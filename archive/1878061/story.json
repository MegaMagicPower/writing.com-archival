Tan skin, long brown hair, and dark brown, Cathy has the of model with her well defined face and pouty pink lips. Quite tall at 5\u201910\u201d, Cathy\u2019s weight often fluctuates between 120 and 130 pounds due to her love of food and her tendency to be on the lazier side. She has, however, made her mostly slim and fit figure from years of gymnastics and soccer throughout high school giving her both stamina and flexibility. She has perky and \u201csizable\u201d B cups, sometimes C cups depending on her weight. Despite her thin build, Cathy has rather wide hips and a large, though shapely and tone, backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy is generally a rather nice person though she can still be a little rude and greedy at times (depending on the storyline, she can be downright rude, obsessive, and power hungry). She\u2019s a bit geeky with a strong interest in video games, comics, and most forms of fiction. She also has a strong love of food, ranging from eating to preparing it and plans to major in the culinary arts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy is a lesbian. Her immediate family and close friends are aware of this and accept her, but it is not a feature she commonly makes known. She also has preference for larger women and loves seeing women eat and get even fatter. Though she hasn\u2019t exactly come to terms with it, she too wants to just let go and get fat herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>Your family\u2026</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rhonda Wilson</b> is your 40-year-old mother. She was widowed when you were young and hasn't dated since. She is an important manager for a small, but profitable company. Most days she works 9-5, but she occasionally goes on short business trips leaving you and your sisters together. She has the same dark hair you have, but bright blues eyes instead of your dark ones. She is quite short being only 5'3\". Over the years her bombshell body has become a quite plump 190 pounds from a combination of three children, a comfortable life, and your own culinary interests. While she is rather busty with heavy E cups, most of her weight settles on her plump pot belly and rather rotund back side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alexandria Wilson</b>, or <b>Alex</b> as she often goes by, is your 21-year-old sister. Alex is attending the same University you will be attending, but is home for the summer. She is very fashionable, cares quite a lot about her appearance, and is, for the most part, the stereotypical head cheerleader. She has long straight and shiny blonde hair that is complimented by bright blues eyes. Like her mother, she is rather busty with DD cups. She works very hard to stay fit and it works for the most part, but lately her butt has been looking a little big. While not as big as yours, you like to mock her for it and how it\u2019s her first step to ending up like your mother. Unlike you, Alex is practically unable to tan and is usually quite pale. Alex is usually a bitch to most people, especially you. She is quite jealous of your tan and your height since she is only 5'5\". Despite her bitch-iness she is still your sister and cares deeply about you when push comes to shove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jane Wilson</b> is you 13-year-old sister. Jane is the perfect daughter, never doing anything wrong and getting perfect grades. She is tiny at only 5'1\" and has no curves to speak of yet. She is pale and blonde like your sister but has dark eyes like you. She is quite naive despite her intelligence and has no problem accepting anyone slightly different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Maria Gonzales</b> is not really family, but she is your oldest and best friend. This 18-year-old Latina is very intelligent and will be attending the same University as you. Unlike you, she is not shy at all and quite confident about herself, being the one who convinced you to tell your family about you being a lesbian, she is bisexual herself. She is only 5' and has a soft, curvy figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yuki</b> is your 19-year-old Japanese roommate once you start attending University. She has long black and dark eyes and wears glasses. She is rather busty with F cups, but otherwise she is pretty petite as she is thin and rather a short 5\u20192\u201d. You can\u2019t really deny your own attraction to her, but you don\u2019t exactly know too much her. Though you do believe you\u2019ve caught her staring at your body a few times.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>The Gift\u2026</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, <b>Cathy</b>, were recently gifted with the strange ability to swap and/or absorb the physical attributes of any woman with yourself. <b>Swapping</b> traits is simple. You get what they have and they get what you have. An example would be trading your dark hair with Jane's blond hair. You could then give the blonde hair to Maria. All swaps must go through you. They also must match; you cannot swap your legs for someone else's arms. In most storylines you can even swap mental traits such as interests, skills, intelligence, appetite, and more. <b>Absorbing</b> can be a little more interesting and focuses more on attributes that can be calculated. The absorption ability allows you to absorb the fat, curves, height, hair length, etc. to yourself and then transfer it to someone else. Like swapping, it must go through you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDepending on the storyline the power will allow you to alter reality so no one notices the changes, alters reality naturally without your input, or can\u2019t be altered at all. Generally, the storylines start as you acquire the powers and therefore cannot control them. Sometimes you have difficulty but sometimes you learn fast the limits of your powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can also transfer your powers <b>temporarily</b> to another woman. If they are not returned willingly, they will return in 72 hours. The powers only affect women and cannot be used on any one older than 50 and younger than 13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b>Storylines</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn <b>The Rookie</b>, it is the summertime between high school and college. You are out for a run on a hot summer day when you gain your power. You and your sisters are home and you have not yet started University so you have not met Yuki yet and she will not be in this storyline. Depending on your choices, you may or may not have job. In this storyline you tend to have a harder time controlling your new powers. This story focuses more on you trying to use your new power to make yourself bigger and happier while balancing everything that comes with that. Depending on the path you may or may not be able to alter reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn <b>The Novice</b>, you have begun attending University and it is late fall. You are at the mall on a pleasant Saturday afternoon when you gain your power. Though she was not with you on this fateful trip, you do know Yuki in this storyline and she is your roommate. Both Maria and your sister Alex attend the University as well. In this storyline, you have much better control over your powers though you still have trouble sometime. You tend spend your time helping or messing with others with your power before using it for your own benefit in this storyline. Depending on the path you may or may not be able to alter reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn <b>The Thief</b>, you are attending University with Yuki, Alex, and Maria and discover your powers one even in the University cafeteria. In this storyline, however, your powers are different. Here, the power has corrupted you and become addictive. You have an increasingly and almost uncontrollable to absorb as much as you can to become the biggest and most beautiful. You may even attempt to capture and tempt others into serving. In this storyline your powers are much more sensitive and harder to control. On top of that, you cannot swap traits in this storyline. You can only absorb traits from women into yourself and only transfer an absorbed trait onto a willing subject with whom you have formed a Bond. The more you use your power and grow, the more power hungry, dominant, and persuasive you will become. None of your changes will affect reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn <b>The Mask</b>, something a bit different happens. You are now a sophomore at University, you've been studying and stressing, you've grown much closer to Yuki and drifted a bit away from Maria. While home for the weekend you discover your power but this time it is far more different. Instead of mentally controlling your power to swap and absorb traits you do so more passively by wearing another woman's clothes and taking on their attributes. Will this power alter reality or will others notice your changes? Will you be able to affect others or will only you be changed this time? Read and Add on to find out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will update this page as more storylines are added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Please use second person [you form])</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a cool summers day when you stopped into the Starbuck's blocks from your house. Against your better and despite your conflicting emotions, you had decided to go for a jog. You soon realized you were more out of shape than you had initially assumed and stopped in the Starbuck's for some water and maybe a snack. Striding to a table, you turned a few young men's heads. Your tanned skin glistened with sweat, causing the blue spaghetti strap top cling to your slender torso and reveal your sports bra. However, since your breasts were on the small side, you assumed the attention was for your ass. Bigger than expected on such a slim girl, it was displayed magnificently in your charcoal yoga pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting, you began to people watch while you composed yourself. Most were young hipsters, a business man, a couple that seemed to be catching up after a long break, and lone girl in the corner. The girl drew your attention. She was cute.  Her had blonde hair was tucked in a pony tail,showing her full, round face. She was a tad bit chubby, most of the weight on her thick pot belly and round ass you assumed since she didn't have much more boob than you.This reminded you of your internal debate. Why were you out jogging? You hated jogging. Not to mention the main reason. You had recently come to terms with the idea that you were attracted to fat girls, but if you liked fat girls, could you be one? Seeing this chubby girl made you begin to wonder . . . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted, however, before you got fair as a gorgeous red head entered the shop. She was tall thank to her four inch black stilettos, her long legs and curvy hips contained by a tight black business skirt. She wore a scarlet blouse that complemented her fiery red hair. Several of the buttons were undone, revealing a glorious amount of cleavage produced by her DD cups being crammed into a lacy black bra. You were transfixed, practically drooling. You managed to control yourself when you noticed people were starting to stare at you stare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, if only i had tits like that, </i> you thought sadly. Hardly a moment before you felt a warm feeling in your chest. Glancing down, you gasped a the sight of your sweat soaked and tight sure stretching as your breasts swelled larger. Second later, they stopped at what you knew were DD's. Turning to the red head, you saw that she now had your measly B cups, her shirt hanging limp. No one had seemed to notice, not even her as she seemed transfixed by the menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to test, you focused her getting her breasts back. Quickly, yours shrank to normal while her grew to normal just as she looked down. <i>This is so cool,</i> you thought. <i>But did they were they just not paying attention?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExperimenting more, you turned to the chubby girl. She was sadly fidgeting with her shirt that kept riding up and exposeing her belly. Figuring that'd be a good test for many reasons, you focus on taking her belly and watch as it shrinks away. The girl gasped and grabbed at her slim waist in shock. <i>She noticed</i>, you giggled. Turning your attention to yourself, you attempted to pull your shirt over your now plush tummy. however, it was to no avail. You seemed to have gained roughly 20 pounds. It wasn't so bad, but this wasn't the time or place. A little guiltily you looked up to return the girl's belly and were surprised to find her gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What will I do now?</i> you began to panic when another idea approached you. Turning to the red head making her order, you focus on giving her the belly fat an d believing that she had always head it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid it work?</span></div></div>",

In seconds this bombshell of a woman had put on 20 pounds. Things got even stranger when you blinked. It wasn't very noticeable, but once you blinked a few details had changed. While she still looked great, your outfit was no longer so tight and revealing, her blouse buttoned up all the way. Her hair wasn't as  luxurious and was pulled into a cute pony tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her you go, ma'am,\" the cashier said cheerfully handing her her coffee and a small box of donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" the woman grinned. \"I really shouldn't be getting this. I'm supposed to be on a diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was crazy. When you made her believe this change, it had altered much of reality. Testing your power further, you absorbed the added weight and focused on reality again. The woman shrank, you grew, you blinked, and she was the same as she had been. Dressed as reveling as she had been. The donuts had vanished as well. Looking down at the belly you know carry, you gently poked and prodded the soft fat. It was pretty nice. Being a fat girl might be fun now that you can make people believe it is completely natural. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you weren't to surprised to find that the woman was gone. Looks like you were stuck with this belly after all. Standing, you left the small coffee shop hardly noticing that you did not garner the stares you did before thanks to jiggling pot in front of you that was barely contained by your shirt.

Turning and walking away, your new body jiggling somewhat, you paid no attention to how the woman had changed further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you remembered the new all you can eat buffet that had just opened not far away. If you hurried, yo u could catch the next bus there. Picking up the pace, you made it to the bus stop with some difficulty. You were not yet used to your new center of gravity. You were early though and found yourself among three young black women. They seemed nice enough, maybe a bit loud, but nice. Their personalities, though, did not concern you. Their bodies did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the three had about what you'd had this morning in the chest department, so you paid no attention. The the third, however, was about th same size as you. At least, she was before your own breasts doubled, growing to nearly a GG cup. They were massive, like fleshy melons in oyur tight sports bra. And so much cleavage! You'd never had cleavage before. You also noticed that all three women had rather sizable ghetto booties. You didn't hesitate to absorb all of then either, along with one of the girls belly that was a bit bigger than yours. THe three curvy women were now slim and quiet. You on the other hand were a site to behold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were very busty now and very definitely pear shaped now thanks to your giant ass, wide hips, and thick thighs. You were even pretty chunky around the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bus arrived, you struggled to force yourself onto the bus and were met with a surprise. The bus was full of curvy and fat women.

You found yourself hitting other passenger's arms with your hips as you walked past so you had to turn sideways and shuffle down the isle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding an empty seat and sitting down you found to your amusement that your ass was so enormous you took up the whole seat!  As the bus took off your mind raced rapidly about how your life was changing for the better.  No more sharing bus seats with strangers, no more strenuous exercising and no more watching what you eat.  It was like a dream come true.  You looked over at the woman sitting across from you.  She was very cute and pretty chubby, most of her weight residing in her stomach.  It sat like a big round ball on her lap.  You admired the beauty of it for a second then gasped when it seemed to shrink before your eyes!  You looked down at your chubby stomach and watched wide eyed as it grew up and out and filled out your shirt, sitting on your lap like it had just done on that woman's body just before.  Your belly button was exposed because you didn't make it a reality swap.  In fact you didn't even want to make a swap!  By just admiring the belly you had unintentally swapped stomachs with the woman.  You looked over and saw your old smaller round pot belly on her.  She was gazing out the window and didn't even notice.  I guess I have to learn to control this power better, you though to yourself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus arrived at its destination.</span></div></div>",

If you looked close you could still tell it was her. Blond and blue eyed, she was still very pretty. Just bigger. Her face round, much rounder than your own, with big chubby cheeks and fat double chin. Her arms were thick and massive and her hands were plump with sausage like fingers. Her tits were gigantic. Way bigger than your own hers were like fleshy beach balls shoved into a bra. You knew somehow that she was a JJ cup. Maybe it had something to do with your gift and how you changed reality. Her giant breasts sat heavily on her fat gut, a massive orb of fat and rolls. It bugled in nearly every direction and wobbled with the slightest of movements. It was mesmerizing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got even bigger going down. Like your mother and yourself, Alex was inevitably a pear shaped woman. Her hips were almost as wide as she was tall. Her ass wag enormous and you knew doors must give her trouble. Her thighs were giant pillars of fat and her calves were almost as thick as your own thighs. Without asking you knew she was 413 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey Cathy,\u201d she smiled.

Then you\u2019d have enough extra to plump up your mom a bit and change Jane\u2019s personality back to normal. Heck, maybe you could even give some to Jane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, something could go wrong and you could make things worse. Maybe you should stick with your old plan just to be safe.

I like this.\" Why was your mom being so interested all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were open to dropping some weight, I can ask Meredith where she got he liposuction and tummy tuck done and see if we can get a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU SERIOUSLY ASKING ME TO GET LIPOSUCTION!?!?\" Your face burns, your blood boils, and your stomach, thighs, breast and ass all tremble in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey,\" your mom says with a slight tone in her voice, \"I know you have issues with commitment and ability to stick with something, like a workout routine and a diet. I'm only suggesting this because it might be easier for you to handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't stand hearing her anymore. You contemplate adding a little more to her weight then just 138. </span></div></div>",

Her clothes change into a long sundress that hangs on her frame giving a classic kind look to her. As you smile at the changes to your mom you start to really understand how fat you have become. You look down and see that your exaggerated pear shape is no more and your belly has taken center stage dominating your bulk.

Moving your gaze up you notice your belly hanging out of your shirt and draping just inches above your knees and streaking across the huge bag of blubber are tons of angry stretch marks. \u2018Oh my gosh those stretch marks look rather new I must have eaten myself this big more recently.\u2019 You move your gaze up while leaving your inner monologue and see a shirt that has ridden up over a belly with two huge folds as well as the massive belly apron you e grown. Your large breasts seem shoved into a bra that you don\u2019t even dare to classify at their current size. Moving up some light staining adorns the top of the shirt just under the triple chin draped over your neck and off of a chubby checked face. You reach down and lift up and jiggle your belly and feel a small tingle deep in your thighs \u2018oh my gosh how am I so aroused at this?

Processing all that is happening in your house in this reality you come to the conclusion that it would be best to give mom back the weight. As you are deep in thought your sister gorges herself into a state too full to continue to eat. Mom picks up the plate she was working on and proceeds to keep feeding her even to Alex's protests. Alex seems to mildly protest for what couldn't be more then a minute as she gives in and resorts to rubbing the sides of her poor belly. You come out of your haze to the scene that helps to explain how you and your siblings wound up as overweight as you all are in this reality. You watch in awe as Alex seems to allow your mother to force more and more food past her lips and into her over used gut. Said gut seemed to start and swell under its current task of holding the inhuman amount of food crammed into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly you decide that you want to help Alex and there might only be one way to help her. \"Mom um, Alex looks rather full\" you speak up as your mom stops what she is doing and slowly turns to you. \"Well dear I made all of this food for someone and Alex is the biggest eater. I seem to remember you stating you didn't want an afternoon meal. SO.... Alex will eat till this lovely food I worked so hard on is finished.\" she smiles at you and starts to turn back to her duties. \"Oh well I mean, I am very hungry right now I could maybe um eat whats left.\" You offer yourself to your mom to at least get her away from Alex. She smiles as she moves away from your sister and starts pushing the cart towards you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ok here goes need to make you bigger so everyone else can be smaller' you think to yourself as she makes her way towards the door a look on her face that says if things don't change soon you will be just as large as Alex and fairly soon. But as she makes her way towards you you will the 300 pounds back onto your mother. She starts to slow as she gets halfway and you notice her distinctive pear shape re-emerge, her hips flair out and her legs start to rub together as blubber accumulates. She keeps rounding out as the rest of her form grows to match her lower half. As she finally reaches the earlier high of 435 pounds you feel a buzz letting you know things have changed again. You smile to yourself and look up at your obese mother and then over at Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex is the exact same as she was in the other reality, still a mound of flesh pinned to the bed. 'What the hell mom is huge again why didn't anything change?' You are puzzled and worried that Jane too hasn't changed when she rounds the corner and looks to be a pudgy teen but only barely. As you look at her and smile Jane's weight pops into your head, '200' which isn't bad all things considered. Jane walks in and takes a plate of food off the cart and walks out without saying a word and avoiding looking at Alex. 'Well at least she is safe for now' you sigh as you turn your attention back to Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ok well I am easily 300 pounds lighter now so I think Alex can at least get her mobility back.' You finish your thought and start to do the mental math realizing that taking 300 pounds from her would leave her 765 pounds, and you at a hefty 650 again. She would still be rather large what if you took more, or even took her place. The thoughts swirl around in your head in a flash as you decide to....</span></div></div>",

I mean...\u201d You hadn\u2019t been fully paying attention to your mom as she is offering you food and decide mid sentence to take on the 300 pounds from Alex. As you concentrate on willing the weight from Alex onto your relatively thinner body time seems to freeze and your moms words seem to halt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch Alex intently as nothing seems to be happening at first but slowly you see the changes. Her legs start to shrink calves  and ankles receding and revealing plump feet. Her huge belly starts to travel back up her calves and shins slowly settling slightly above her knees. Her knees and thighs seem to shrink down into just tree trunks instead of the blobby masses they were a second ago. As you keep your gaze moving upwards she seems to level out and you see a slight shimmer as she becomes clothed in a huge pair of sweats and a shirt replaces the bib. You can feel the weight start to grow on you as you take in the rest of the room. Nothing has changed in the room noticeably, her bed is still a huge bariatric one. You still see handles attached to the roof to help her sit-up, or in this reality stand slowly, beside her bed seems to be medical equipment that includes an EKG and oxygen machine. One of the things that does seem to change is the scooter that was previously in the corner unused for who knows how long has been moved next to the bed. Your mom was definitely planning on growing Alex way more when she was thinner and focus on growing you and your siblings. \u2018Why did the room not change at all other then minor details\u2019 you ponder to yourself as you feel your legs become weak again and instinctively grab the walker again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back down and see that you\u2019re back to your large 650 pound frame but it seems different and more spread out this time. Your belly is still huge but not quit as dominant on your figure, instead some of its previous heft went to your legs and rump. As you take in your slightly altered figure your mom seems to jump start again and continue her sentence. \u201c... I know everyone in this house is a big eater but I made enough food for both of you at least. Did you want to eat any of this?\u201d She smiles not seeming to notice any of the difference in yours and your sisters bodies. \u201cJane did you want any of this\u201d your mom asks to your sister who seems to have come up behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around you find that Jane is again changed, her weight crashes into your mind and it\u2019s unsettling again \u2018480\u2019. \u2018What is going on a second ago Jane was less then half this size and all I did was thin down Alex. And why didn\u2019t mom change at all only I did\u2019 you\u2019re deep in thought as Jane lumbers past to look at the cart. Thinking quickly you formulate a plan. \u2018Sorry Alex I need to test something\u2019 you begin to will the 300 pounds back onto Alex as you thin and the shimmer returns. Looking at the room and your family as everything settles into this reality the only things that change are the scooter is back in the corner and your walker is gone. Jane is still 480 pounds mom is still a plump 435 and poor Alex is back up to 1065 pounds, you\u2019re the thinnest in the family now. \u2018Ok let\u2019s try something again sorry Alex I\u2019ve got to experiment some.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou again will the 300 pounds back onto your frame and the shimmer fires off and again only the scooter and walker change. You smile at Jane as she happily takes a plate of food and leaves back for her room presumably. With your new plan in mind you focus on Alex getting back up to her half ton weight and then call for Jane. \u2018I hope this works, if it does I think I might have a handle on things.\u2019 You look at poor Alex hoping you are right in your hypothesis as Jane comes back in.

Anyone I am observing doesn\u2019t change with the reality wipes. But anyone outside of my observation changes into some other reality where my weight and those I see makes sense somehow.\u2019 Smiling to yourself you have an idea to try and get the best results for everyone present and hope that you can change things later. The only problem is you\u2019re going to have to divide up the weight as evenly as possible and that\u2019s going to be tough. Doing the math in your head is tough, mom at 435, Jane at 200, Alex at a huge 1065, and finally you at a smaller 350. \u2018Let\u2019s see that\u2019s 2050 pounds to divide over 4 people geez that won\u2019t be easy. That\u2019s a little over 500 pounds each, and I don\u2019t want to make Jane even weight 200 I\u2019d like to lighten her to 150. Ok so that mean mom, me, and Alex are gonna need to be 633 each, that\u2019s manageable. Well first things first how do I keep everyone in the room\u2019 with that thought an idea flashes in your mind one that you don\u2019t really like but one that might work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your little sister and pull the 50 pounds off of her bringing her down to 150 and at the same time you look to your mom and pull the 300 off of her again. \u2018I hope Jane has the same reaction in this reality as when her and mom were thin. I mean I hope she takes after mom.\u2019 As her thought finishes mom is her tiny 135 pound feeder persona and looking over at Jane with the plate of food in her hands and a smile on her face. You finally look down and see that you\u2019re back to the body shape from earlier with a huge belly that hung down to your knees. Jane places the plate of food on your walker and smiles \u201ceat up big sister, I saved some from the blob for you.\u201d She seems to tease you but also to genuinely care that you got to eat too. Your mom smiles as you remember you offered to eat in Alex\u2019s place. \u201cOk my plump little sweetheart it\u2019s time for you to make good on your promise to eat in Alex\u2019s place.\u201d She grins as you begin to almost regret your own decision, \u201cok *huff* mom just let me *huff* sit down.\u201d Breathing heavier from the extra 50 pounds over your previous highest weight you start to shuffle over to Alex\u2019s bed with your walker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling your bulk on the edge of the bed you hope there is enough time in the slight delay in the swap to do what you need. As mom and Jane start to saunter over to the bed you focus on taking Alex down to 630 pounds. That\u2019s gonna add 435 pounds to you and you\u2019ll need the bed over Alex. As Alex slims down you watch her belly recede and rolls disappear from her legs and belly alike. When she seems to be down under your weight she slowly lifts herself out of the bed as she sees it\u2019s your feeding time. With the extra effort required in your 700 pound form you scoot into the spot she had been filling and prop yourself against the pillows and wait on the swap to finish. Looking over Alex has slimmed down to the desired 630 and your mom and sister have moved to her side with the cart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath as you feel the weight start to flow into your body, your already present rolls grow with the infusion of blubber. You watch in awe as your belly swells and flows down your legs, As it slowly crawls forward the rolls on your legs multiply and grow outward filling in all the space between. As your huge belly slows and comes to rest at the top of your feet you see said feet almost turtle into the fat of your shins. You start to feel the weight on your chest as you grow out of conventional bra sizes. As your arms start to swell and turn into fat sacks more like wings than arms, you feel your fingers grow and plump into almost useless nubs. Your body seems to halt for a second and you see yourself in the mirror across from the bed and your weight registers in your mind 1000 pounds. \u2018Wait 1000 that\u2019s not right I should be\u2019 in the middle of your thought you suddenly feel your belly flow out to the sides of the bed and around your back as your hips and ass swell and pool like water in a puddle. You look back up and see the final total 1135 monsteras pounds, you are in complete shock and awe as you take in what you are now. Your belly is huge and covered in stretch marks both new and old a face barely recognizable from your old self and appendages that seem uselessly heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all your shock you start to feel short of breathe and your mom notices and places the nose canulla from the oxygen purifier on your fat swaddled head. The oxygen flows into your nose and down into your lungs giving you relief and also fear at how your mom could do this to one of her daughters. The scariest thing about all of this experience is that you feel no shame and only arousal, something that is both foreign and familiar. You think back to loving the growth and how much you like getting bigger. But you try to push that out of your mind and focus on what\u2019s happening. \u201cSomebody looks very hungry and as I recall you made a deal to eat all of Alex and Jane\u2019s extra food. Which is so noble of you as a sister and believe me they would be much bigger if you weren\u2019t such a willing piggy.\u201d She grabs food off the cart and sits next to you prepared to feed you all of it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting in the bed that your new for occupies so much of you\u2019re still slightly in a state of shock at your size. Your mom lifts up a plate full of food and start to spoon some of it into your mouth. As she puts the spoon to your lips and the food hits your tongue you feel a hunger pain like never before. You greedily take the huge spoon full in and in seconds chew and swallow, mom has another following before you\u2019ve completed the first. Your eyes go a little wide at the richness and heaviness of the food she\u2019s almost forcing into you. You say almost forcing because you are still keeping pace somehow with the speed she is going. It dawns on you that you\u2019re probably used to such gluttonous acts multiple times a day seeing as how you are over 1000 pounds. As the first plate starts to come to an end Jane hands your mom another plate and takes the first leaving her able to keep the food flowing at the same pace. 1,2,5,15,20 plates all get shoveled into you and you are starting to get full and dangerously so you feel. You are still swallowing even with a stomach that has now inflated with food and soda your mom has made you guzzle. Your body seems to instinctively still eat when food is placed at your lips driving home the sobering reality that with your family as it is you\u2019ve been trained to eat till the food is gone. And gone was not something that happened easily with your feeder of a mother happily humming to herself as she fed you. Coming to the last plate you count 35 empty dishes and bowls filling the top of the cart. You don\u2019t see how a human could fit so much food into themselves but there you are a testament to gluttony proper up and stuffed past your limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go darling that was such a good lunch you are it all this time I\u2019m so proud of you. Too bad for Alex I mean you had been struggling lately and look at the poor thing she had to bear the brunt of the leftovers. It doesn\u2019t help that she\u2019s a bit of a piggy without any help.\u201d Your mom giggles as she pats you enormous stomach and smiles wickedly at Alex. \u2018Ok I got to eat and see how she did this to me now the fun is over time to try and right this wrong.\u2019 You focus on your mom and start to will 500 pounds off of your frame onto her. This will push her to a new high of 635 and you back down to a small, at least by current standards, 635 as well. Slowly she gets up as the weight evaporates off of your frame and explodes on hers. You are dumping a hundred pounds at a time and your body fill so much better with each loss, mom seems to balloon into the dress she\u2019s wearing. Reality shimmers slowly as her dress contorts and stretches to keep pace with her weight increase. As you get back down to your 635 pounds you take the nose canullar out not needing it anymore. Moms body is a new sight she still took on the huge pear shape but now has a good sized belly to match. Wide hips and thick trunk sized legs support your mother who in this reality seems to smile but also since with her movements. You are still the belly dominant fatty with what seems to be better mobility, making you surmise you probably gain all this weight much slower and built some muscle to move it all around. Jane seems to be happy and smiling as you look at her in her almost comically small form compared to the rest of her elephantine relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around at the room and gone is all the medical equipment and scooter, your bed seems to have morphed into a sturdy wooden one instead of the bariatric kind. Your family slowly leaves with Jane helping your mom move out of the room and Alex taking a candy bar from her pocket and happily unwrapping it as she too leaves. You sit in you bed and smile thanking the gods you were able to get everyone at a manageable weight. \u201cWell I wonder what I should do now? I could go out and mess with my powers some. I don\u2019t really know the limits of this power I could test that or I could just stay in and veg out for a while.\u201d You way to yourself as you rub your belly realizing you\u2019re a bit hungry, all the food from the previous reality gone but the memory still remains and may have altered your perception of proper portions. \u201cOh well let\u2019s see....\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you waddle closer to the bus stop you spot a couple on the bench waiting on the bus who seem to be arguing about something. They don't seem to mind that you are lumbering towards them, or they fail to notice that you are getting any closer to them anyway. As you get with in earshot you vaguely start to pick up on what they are arguing about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you just be supportive of me? I've put on like ten pounds since we have been dating and its all your fault.\" the girl huffs at her apparent boyfriend as he listens quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I told you that I loved to cook and besides it's not like I'm forcing you to eat all of the food.\" He retorts with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah well your food is just too damn tasty to not eat and I told you when we met it took a lot of effort for me to stay thin.\" she frowns slightly as she looks down at her little tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I keep telling you that I don't care if you are chubby or thin I love you no matter what. Besides I think you look very cute with that belly.\" He smile with a devilish grin that I assume means he wouldn't mind seeing her with a much bigger belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well if you keep at it like this it wont be too long till I have an even bigger belly then this.\" She giggles and pats her small tummy for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh my this is almost like a plot in some of the stories I read online. But who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth, a bigger belly for her is in order.' You think to yourself as you finally make it to the bench and lower yourself on the other end hearing it creak. As you sit the boyfriend looks over at you and you could swear his nose is about to bleed confirming what you had already suspected his taste in women might be. 'Okay well lets get a look at your current weight my dear, I want to get more mobile but I don't know if making you immobile is the way to go.' As you stare at the girl the weight again floods into your mind and the girl is only a measly 155 pounds. Doing some mental math you wanted to test out some theories and see what her boyfriend liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you decided to start out your experiments by bumping up her weight a little at a time so that you could see how he reacted and also how she changed in her new form. You decided that 100 pound increments would probably be the best way to move forward in this test. 'Alright so here it goes time to see if lover boy here is a man of his word and likes her at any size.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start with the first 100 pounds growing her to 255 and bringing you down to 535. Instantly you feel the weight fall off of you as you belly shrinks and you can feel your rear and thighs slim down and lower you slightly in your seat. As you finish your shrinking a slight pause seems to occur before the girls starts to grow. She is a cutey with red hair that is long and curly but it is a dark red probably a dye job but still very nice. As the 100 pounds swell on her her thin face takes on very little of the weight but she does grow a slight double chin. Her chest that formerly sat in the nice B cup range grew maybe a cup size and started to fill out her bra more thoroughly. Moving down to her small tummy you see in balloon out flowing further into her lap and almost halfway down her thighs, definitely taking the brunt of the growth. Her shirt doesn't seem to charge much maybe going up a size but it definitely does not fit properly, it rides up her gut slightly showing the stretch marks that seem to prove just how good of a cook he is. Her legs and ass seem to plump up slightly filling out her yoga pants more and smiling you focus back out at the girl as a whole seeing her arms have thickened too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you said you don't mind your women chubby but babe I'm getting big I mean I've put on 60 pounds since we started dating.\" She frowns and looks to her boyfriend who has a toothy grin. \"Like I said you look great no matter the size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh we are going to test that theory out today for sure.' As you focus again you begin sending 100 more pounds over to the girl. This will bring you down to 435 and her up to 355 pounds this is putting her up into the solid bbw range. You begin to shrink again and this time it seems more dramatic as you feel the weight flow off of you and it seems every part of you recedes like the ocean. Looking as you feel all the weight settle you try to start counting the time delay, ' 1...2...3...4...5...6' after six seconds you start to see her swell. This time her face takes on some more weight and second chin is here to stay. Her chest gains probably two cups and a few inches this time and you notice her bra and top change to a snug sweatshirt that looks well worn. Her belly again gets the majority of the growth having her almost reach her knees in her seated position. Her legs grow as well this time to and fill out a pair of sweat pants that seem to match the top, her butt also swells and pushes her up into the air and spreads out slightly pushing against her boyfriend. Again you focus on the girl as a whole and she is a plump little number that is blushing at your gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting so big Glen, I told you I would try this whole feedee thing but people are starting to stare.\" She blushes some more as Glen simply smiles. \"You shouldn't worry about what strangers think of you Rachel, I think you are amazing.\" He smile sweetly at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay well its time to see how big you like them Glen because she is about to be bigger than me.' You smile to yourself as you concentrate on sending another 100 pounds Rachel's way. This will be a defining change as she will take your place as the fattest person on the bench, this will push her up to 455 and drop you down to 335. You feel you body settle as the weight has left leaving you looking rather close to the other girl sitting the other end of the bench from you, all be it more pear shaped though. You remember to count again reaching 6 seconds this time as well, 'it seems that the time delay is consistent, I wonder if it changes with the amount transferred.' You make a note to test that some time and watch as Rachel's new weight has finished settling on her and she stops blushing so profusely. She is quite large now especially when you consider her starting point. Her gut is definitely her main feature as it has swelled and forced her legs apart to make room for it to hang, slightly pulling her forward. Her chest has gotten a slight upgrade again along with her thighs and hips growing a few inches. her face seems unchanged which is kind of odd. Her clothes have changed into a large flowing blouse that seems to fit well and her pants are a huge pare of stretchy jeggings. She is smiling slightly as Glen pats her belly and hands her a candy bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is my good girl doing, hungry?\" Glen inquires. \"You know that you made me into a big girl that is always hungry.\" She smiles and unwraps the candy bar greedily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile to yourself as you focus on sending the last 100 pounds you are willing to give up to the now happy feedee to see how the relationship changes. The weight seems to drip off of you slimming you down to a chubby 235 pounds honestly the smallest you really want to be but you can always change that. After the requisite six second delay you watch as Rachel grows again not seeing a ton of difference anywhere other then her now gigantic belly. The mammoth red head now settles into her burger that Glen has produced to feed the 555 pound girl. She is humming and smiling as she tears into the food with greedy teeth. Her clothes are now a huge dress that seems to have been bought with a little room to grow into and a pair of legging under that to keep her warm as it doesn't reach her ankles any more. As you smile at the loving couple you notice the bus pull in as you think of where to go to run some more test. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a brief idea to follow the loving couple and test Glen's preferences on size, you decide that going to one of your favorite areas would be better. Standing up at your current weight of 235 pounds is much easier and you take stock in the fact that you seem to be more pear shaped at this lower weight. Looking over to watch as Rachel struggles to slowly stand and still smile at Glen happily helping her to her feet. You easily walk past them and on to the waiting bus knowing full well that it will take Rachel a good bit to lumber onto the bus even with her feeders help. You make it onto the bus and look for a spot to sit and briefly take in the other passengers wondering if there is any potential to run some tests on the short ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a seat you lower yourself into a spot and then look over towards the handicap seats that can be converted to make room for scooters or wheelchairs. A thought brings a smile to your face as you get an idea and try to decide how best to proceed with your plan. For a second you think of trying to use Rachel as your guinea pig but decide to save her for another day, since she and Glen are in your neighborhood. Promptly you stand and move seats so that you are sitting in the aforementioned handicap spot. You surmise that it would be easy to get the results you intend if you are closer to where you want to end this ride. As the couple are making there way onto the bus you take stock in the reserves of fat that you have to work with. Luckily for your little experiment you have a crowded bus to work with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou count ten other people on the bus not including the loving couple getting on or the the driver. Looking to the front of the bus you see three people two ladies and one man. There is a brunette that is rather large focusing you see her weight is 425 taking stock of the pear shaped woman you smile loving the fact that shes a great start. The blonde that is sitting across from her is a chubby young woman who is belly heavy, focusing puts her at 250 on the dot a little bigger than you. Next looking over at the man you see he is an older fellow with thinning hair and a gut that seems to show his appetite. With a little focusing you put him at 320 which is plenty large for the snacking slacker. 'So between the three of the front passengers I can grow myself by an even 500 pounds. That would land me at 735 much larger than I was when leaving the house.' You smile at yourself deciding that you should transfer from these three before the bus starts moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the brunette first you focus on stealing 300 pounds from her and really getting the ball rolling. Coming to the decision to take her weight you decide to test out your time delay hypothesis. So you settle on taking all 300 pounds at once to see how long the delay is, hoping that the time lengthens or changes with different weights. Watching intently you see the first hints of weight to slowly evaporate off of the woman. Her thighs and hips are the first to change as they seem to melt away and then more of her body joins in the weight loss. As she slims into a stunning model worthy figure you smile as you see her face shine with pride and happiness. You start your count '1...2...3...4...5...6...' and then the familiar feeling fills your core. Swelling up to 535 pounds in a matter of seconds you smile as you can feel most of the weight you had given away return. Your body lurches forward in spurts as you once again take on a more belly heavy figure. You revel in the growth and your size as you again feel the tingle of excitement at having grown so big. Blushing you turn to see Rachel lower herself into the set of seats next to yours and smiling at the sight of another woman close to her size. A slight hint of pride fills you as you think that soon you will be much bigger then her and you almost laugh. Looking to the two others you plan to take from you focus first on the blonde and will 100 off of her and then with an idea immediately focus on siphoning the other 100 from the man. You watch as both shrink at the same rate and settle into there new size. You blush as you feel the weight flow into you adding another 200 pounds onto your zatfig body. Swelling more you notice your belly takes almost all of the weight drooping and swelling into the new dress that appears on you, falling lower between your thighs as it reaches for the floor. Next to you you see the walker fade into being as you hear the seats under you creak with effort and Glen's gaze lust after your new 735 pound figure. 'Jeez he really does seem to love them big huh' you think as you see poor Rachel shove a whole candy bar in her mouth in jealousy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh realizing six seconds seems to be the standard delay now knowing at least you learned that is constant. The bus starts to move now and you frown to yourself thinking that you would definitely have needed a scooter or something other than a walker at your size. Turning your head you see the other people on the bus and start to weigh the options as to if you want to continue your experiment. </span></div></div>",

Now you peruse the other passengers sitting in the back of the bus and honestly you don't have a ton of people to work with. Honestly most of them are on the small side but that kind of makes sense seeing as how fatties usually sit up front. 'Well at least I should not need too much more weight in order to procure a set of wheels' you think giddily to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst up you focus on the blonde that is sitting at the top of the little stairs and see that she is only a meager 150 pounds. Taking aim at her with your power you siphon off 30 pounds pushing you to 765. You turn your head to the left and frown seeing the walker still their. There doesn't seem to be much of difference in your size at least not a easily noticeable difference. Gazing back at the next row of seats you see a redhead that is a little bigger sitting at 210 when you focus in. Stealing 35 pounds from her will settle you right at 800 pounds so you hope that will do. As you count down the seconds you smile as you see the light shimmer around you and you clothes grow into a huge sundress with daisies all over it. Next you watch as your walker shimmers out of this reality and then frown with its replacement. Instead of a standard walker it is replaced with a wider version that has a sling on it. 'For heavens sake am I really that stubborn that I still choose to walk with a freaking belly sling.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff out loud drawing attention from Rachel and Glen who are both staring at you one with lust and the other with jealousy. Well looking back at the next person you realize you have only one donor left. It is a busty brunet that is not very big at all, sitting at just 170 pounds you decide to take 50 from her. You watch in amazement as she shrinks down but you notice her chest stays basically the same. \"Oh my I've made a busty bombshell if i do say so myself.' You smile as you see the shimmer and feel yourself grow as you raise up just a bit. You are no longer sitting in the seats but now firmly planted into a huge power scooter. As you sit smiling ear to ear you feel your belly bush against the steering column of the scooter and brush against the floor of it too. 'Finally I got what I wanted' you are still beaming with glee as the bus stops at the shopping strip.  </span></div></div>",

Jane squeezes through the door on a mobility scooter her body having taken a very distinct pear shape after your mother. \"How oh my...\" you stop yourself from screaming as you focus in on Jane so that you can see what her weight is. Focusing and still slightly shaken from the latest reality shift, your sisters staggering weight slams into your mind. '800 pounds oh my gosh she is way too big she is only like 200 pounds less than Alex.' You are still reeling from this new development as you instinctively suck all of the excess fat off of Jane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no that was definitely a bad idea\" you almost shout as you see you sister start to shrink. Time slows to a crawl as you seem to notice everyone else stops really doing much. Jane is slimming down at a steady pace and as she does you she a shimmer when she drops down to the 600 pound mark. Suddenly the scooter disappears and she gets a walker now. \"Oh no I cant be standing when this all happens I will be pinned to the floor. But the only place to sit in here is the bed....\" With a sigh you look over at Alex and realize that there is really only one way to get her out of the spot you will need to be. Focusing in on Alex you don't even know how much you will have to take to make her get up. \"Dang it I already took 300 pounds from her and she was still there. What if I take 500 pounds that is crazy but I might have too.\" You look back at Jane and see that she is down to 500 pounds now and time is kind of running out. \"I don't know how else to make sure I get the bed other then taking more than enough to be safe.\" you frown as you realize this was a bad idea and you really need to think things through more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to take 700 pounds which should be more than enough to make her get off her rather large bum. Now you watch as Jane settles in on 300 pounds and you watch all of the changes start to morph Alex too. She is now down to 965 which is still huge but as another 100 pounds melts off her frame you see everything shift. Her belly seems to shrink and recede into her torso like the tides into the ocean. After the next 100 pounds she is almost as heavy as Jane was. Speaking of you turn to see that Jane is now in a short sun dress similar to the one that your mom had before you filled her back up. \"Wow mom was so small\" you smile as you look over at her and picture her back in that sundress. You look over to Alex as you feel yourself grow to 450, she is now down to 765 which is very much a noticeable change. Looking back at mom you realize you've made a mistake, she is down to 335 and it dawns on you why. \"Oh crap I shouldn't have pictured mom small again this is bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you settle in on 550 the other two shrinking ladies in the room are changing as well. Deciding that you can't change anything for the time being you start to waddle towards the bed as you go up to your previous high of 650. The walker appearing next to you, you reach out a blubbery hand to use it so you can hopefully make it to the bed in time. Your sister who is now smaller than you at 565 is shrinking and your mom is now down to 135 pounds. She seems to morph into the same mom relentlessly feeding Alex with the same sundress and now wicked grin on her face. When you reach the bed you all of a sudden feel the weight of your now 750 pound self. Now looking up to the bed you watch as suddenly the now 465 pound Alex shifts to standing next to the bed and you use the opportunity to fill that spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your bulking mass settles into its spot you watch as the last sister drops down to 365 her new weight. Something weird happens this growth for you though, you notice that this time you swell to 950 pounds. \"Well at least I've learned something besides thinking more carefully when looking at fatties.\" You slightly smile realizing that your power seems to take off weight in the highest normal increment (like 1000, 100, 10, and 1). You also noticed it takes about five seconds for each level to shrink or grow. The new more alarming thing is that those weight stages can seem to stack onto your frame when finally off of the other person. You do still find it interesting that the weight transfer doesn't start till someone is already down to the final weight though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you swell again you notice that you grow to 1250 pounds since you are now receiving weight from all three. You feel yourself suddenly get light headed but it clears up with a shimmer and the addition of the nose canular to your pudgy face. \"Oh my god I'm going to be way too big when this is over\" you struggle to say realizing that all the added weight is making it hard for you to speak as well as breathe. The bed beneath you groans as you grow another 300 pounds pushing you up to 1550 probably making you one of the fattest woman to ever live. Suddenly the whole room shimmers as your bed is morphed into a huge sturdy steel frame and the EKG machine can be seen beeping away next to you. Over the next 25 seconds the last 500 of Alex's pounds settle in on you mammoth form practically filling the custom made bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you see your mother and sisters return to normal and start moving in step with normal time now you take stock of this reality. Alex is 365 pounds which while large is a third of the woman she was, Jane and your mom are both slim and grinning ear to ear as they stare at you. \"Look at my big loving daughter\" she smiles as she walks over to the right side of your bed. \"I'm so proud of how big my beautiful Annie has grown. And she has done all of this out of love saying that she'd eat all the extra food I was feeding Alex. Hehe I was also planning on feeding it all to Jane too.\" Jane looks over at the mountain of a sister you are laying propped up and grins \"Thanks big sis for letting me and mom stay so thin, too bad mom had already started on Alex before you took her place.\" Alex looks a bit ashamed at that comment but keeps quiet all the same. \"Well it is time for my ton of fun to keep eating, I've made plenty of food for the first dinner you get tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at yourself in a large mirror just above the dresser that seems to perfectly frame the blob you have become. You can feel your feet and legs but can't see them for all of the blubber the four or maybe five folds your gut is. Said gut is filling up two thirds of the bed and obscuring all but the tops of your massive thighs and hips. You can feel that your hips are close to the edges of the bed and know that huge rolls of side fat as well as back fat a spilling over onto them. You try to lift your huge arms to rub your belly and notice with dismay that you can't get them up. Smiling your mom now settles in next to you with food and starts to feed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like a full hour every ounce of food is inside you huge stomach and you let out a small belch an attempt at clearing a little space. Now you watch in a haze as your mom and sisters leave the room and you think on what you can possibly do next. </span></div></div>",

With that, you gave her 200 of your pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body surged forward, growing fatter than ever before. She maintained her busty pear shape, just bigger. Not as big as you had just been but still bigger. Enough to make you envious. She blinked a few times, confused for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you saying, mom?\u201d you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I-uh, I was just saying that dinner is ready,\u201d she said smiling calmly. \u201cI hope you\u2019re hungry.

Mostly. You looked down at yourself and frowned. You were still quite chubby at 188 pounds, almost as large as your mom had been at the start of the day. You were a busty E cup, still showing off ample cleavage. Your belly was still fat and round and rolled onto your lap when you sat, but it didn\u2019t prop up your tits like it had and it no long stretched your shirt or peeked out. Your bottom was still your largest feature, big and supple, but it was so much less than you wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat at the dinner table sadly, waiting for your family. Soon, your mother and Alex joined. Two giant women, laughing and enjoying themselves, excited to feast. After a moment, Jane finally joined you. It was immediately clear that her attitude had returned to normal as she happily greeted, but was there more to her now? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something, maybe a perk of your power, told you she was about 157 pounds. Not as a big as you, but she was still big. Her fat tummy stretched her shirt and she was already taking after the family considering the size of her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down and everyone happily dug into the meal.

You ate plenty of food and eventually retired to your room to reflect on the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay in your bed, dressed only in a tight bra and panties, gently caressing the new you. It was so exciting. Sure, you may not be as big as you had been earlier but you were still nearly twice the girl you were when you woke up this morning. You had been so hesitant to even admit you liked big girls before today, let alone entertain the idea that you\u2019d be one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it felt so right. Your body was big and plush. You breasts were heavy and round. Your hips so wide and your thighs so thick. You were getting so excited so easily. Your hands found their way between you thick thighs. You did your best to keep quiet, trying to hold back the moans. You weren\u2019t very successful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finished, you cleaned up after yourself and let your mind wander. What could these powers do? You could transfer weight from people and even change reality to fit. You could even somehow sense others weights. Could you trade more than just weight? Like, if you wanted to be a red head could you just trade with some random ginger? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould you transfer you own weight around your body? That you could at least test. You waddle over to the mirror to try this. Your bottom was pretty big. Your hips, thighs, and butt made up the majority of your shape. They had even when you were thin. It ran in your family. It was as good a place as any to start with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focus on your thighs slimming, your hips narrowing, and your booty being just not so giant. You also focused on your breasts growing. You were always a little self-conscious of your breasts. Sure, they hadn\u2019t been small before and they certainly weren\u2019t now at E cups but you know what they say: bigger is better.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes it work? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before she has a chance to protest you are out the door and in the car. You get in quite alright but you realise something rubbing against the steering wheel. Its your belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought fast, looking around you saw the apartment block across the street, and walking outside was Lulu. Lulu was a hot alternative girl with a love for music. Her curvy body was only matched by her very long legs. You two hung out a few times, and she would be a perfect woman for some  \"Im sorry Lulu\" you say as you give her the 22 pounds you took from your sister last night. Lulu seemed unphased and continued with her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving madly through the city you made it to Jason&amp;Jasmine. Pulling into the driving lot you ran towards the store. Your added weight was a problem though. You lost breath a couple of feet from the store. You collapse as you make it to the entrance. As you recuperated you saw \"the bitch of burden\" was running this shift. \"What are you doing? Get the hell up! You are late!\" Susan shouted in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cant deal with you right now, you say to yourself you decide to throw half your belly fat into the short dominate woman. It all flowed straight to her behind. After a few seconds her thighs were pillowy and fat. Susan brushed a lock of dirty blonde hair out of her face as and called out \"Alana, come over here\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over she saw her buddy Alana working the registers. Alana looked like she was out of a small town story. She had messy straight hair,  a bunch of freckles under her eyes and the cutest smile with rosy red cheeks. However her personality was a different story. She really did grow up in a small town, but that meant she was surrounded by people swearing. She had a mouth on her like a sailor! It was a surprise she got this job because her self restraint was little to non existent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlana came over and helped you up. \"You're meant to bend over backwards for the bitch, not fall face first.\" Alana whispered to you as you both stood infront of Susan. The surprising thing was you were all 5 years apart, yet Susan acted like she was some forty year old with menapause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay you two, today and tomorrow i want you to deal with...</span></div></div>",

Glancing to the left side of the store you get distracted by the flow of people only for someone having to shake your arm to take you back to reality. \"I'm sorry.

The person talking to you was enormous, her breast had to be at least JJ with the way they bounced you could think that they would get out any moment but the thing that took your attention was her belly, that thing was so big that it took all your willpower to not stare for the immensity, it didn't help that her wardrobe wasn't able to cover even a little, letting everyone to see it. \"I know it's big, isn't it ?

Having made up your mind you try to take some of her babies but being careful 'cause you have never tried to take a baby from someone. Willing it to take three of them you concentrate only to almost fall to the floor. Looking down to survey the damage, you feel to faint looking that your boobs literally went from C cup to NN, even bigger than yesterday then the babies started to kick, bringing to into a daze.

Trying to stand up you realise that was no longer an easy task. \"You okay Cathy?\" Asked Alana as she walked over. Her petite yet curvy frame was soo alluring, why did she have to look so great? You thought to yourself, your emotions were I. Flux, you had to fix this some how. \"Why, why d-d-did this happen?\" Was all that could muster as your eyes watered up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around and no one was there except for you two. Alana put her hand on your shoulder as you started crying. \"It's okay Cathy, don't worry, you are okay\" she said assuringly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you don't know\" you cry out, what the hell is going on with you? It's like when you recieved the pregnancy you also received 7 months worth of emotions. This was getting way to out of hand, at this rate you won't stand another hour being pregnant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, can you just work with me here? You have been like this all week\" Alana said, her tolerance for the situation decreasing. That remark flipped your emotions on their head. \"Really? You are really going to say that to a pregnant woman\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to concentrate on Alana's smooth flat belly. Maybe twins would change her emotions. You focus as hard as you can and you see Alana's belly start to grow. Her midsection started to swell outward, her boobs inflate, looking very juicy too. Her arse started to balloon out as well. What was once a cute petite friend was now a large, pregnant woman that you enjoyed working with. You kind of liked her this way, she looked interesting. As she stopped growing you admired your work on your friend. She had no flabby arms or fat face, but her breasts and arse managed to take quite a bit of fat. Her pants looked like they were just about to break at the seems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Cathy, I know I'm not as pregnant as you, I just was saying that my emotions also run a little wild.\" She said as she rubbed her newly expanded belly. You to awkwardly try to hug, laughing as your bellies bump into each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went along smoothly. You were tempted to impregnate Susan, but with all your added weight, you decided to just throw an extra 40 kilos her way. On your way out you bump into Lulu, who looked quite alright with her extra weight. She was now around 190 kilos which wasn't bad, her being 6ft 3 and all. \"Cathy! I haven't seen you in ages! How are you?\" Lulu eagerly asked you. \"How are those five little precious ones going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at lulu thinking, she's an alternative kind of gal, she could make a good mother. Using the same technique you used on Alana you inflated Lulu's belly. She had a look of discomfort on her as you concentrated harder on making her pregnant. Her belly grew larger and larger and as her little belly button disappeared, you knew she was 8 months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her breasts came next, and they looked amazing. Her once perky yet big breasts started to expand, building up with milk and fat they grew out into some amazing looking J cups. Yours shrank down to about double L cup breasts. Lastly was the rear and her thighs. She had an alright butt first of all, then it got a bit fat when she added the previous amount. Now Lulu was starting to look a little large at 240lbs. \"Sorry, I mean four, haha. Are you coming to the support group tonight?\" Lulu asked as her delicate fingers made circles on her large midsection<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Support group?\" You asked quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know, single mothers to be...\" Lulu said as she rubbed her belly against yours. \"Alana and I are going like always, are you free for this weeks session?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She may be the tallest of you three, but her curves were the smallest of all of you. Feeling a bit sorry for her position you decided to transfer a random pregnant woman's belly into hers, plus some extra weight in the right places. Her stride slowed down just a teensy bit, but it gave you an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if you split up the pregnancies in a certain manner? Alana had twins, you had quadruplets and lulu had a single, well, now twins. there should be a bunch of pregnant women here, you could almost make a game of it. You can't take everyone out at once, otherwise you won't be able to enjoy it for too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the single parents to be group, you saw a woman with black curly hair take the stage. \" you know how hard it is to carry twins with no one there to care for you?\" She started off as she stood in behind the podium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you said bluntly, a big Smile on your face. Before everyone took a stern look at you, you transferred her twins in alana's belly. There was a sound like a balloon blowing up to maximum until Alana's chair started to creak. \"OOOooohhhh\" she let out. \"How we doing?\" She said, trying to turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too bad\" you said as you went up to he podium next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was no great feat. Slowly she transferred all 15 pregnant women's pregnancies into the three now hugely pregnant friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp first you took the extra four babies to keep you in order. That caused a minor rip in your awesome top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other 15 (there were a few women with multiples) were split accordingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLulu was given a measly two. But she supported her quadruplets well, as a few buttons came undone, showing off some very lazy black and pink lingerie \"what?\" She stammered \" I deserve to feel sexy\" she said trying to shove her breasts back into her overflowing bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlana got quite a bit bigger, gaining four more little ones. Her octuplet belly shone perfectly. She looked like a blown up pin up girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, you stood epically at the nearly empty room. With no other pregnant women there, there was no use for the class. Your sseventeen foetuses filled your gargantuan belly. You were in heaven. But you faced a problem. You couldn't move. Your belly was an incredible weight. You needed something to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when someone came in, someone who wasn't pregnant. In came</span></div></div>",

This was nothing short of amazing, considering the amount of food your mother brought you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of all, you were wheezing trying to recover your breath, your arms ached after the heavy lifting they endure to bring the food to your mouth and your belly was filled to the brim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey I'm going to clean up here so just wait for a little\" said your mother while picking up the plates and food wrappers on the messy room.

Yet this was easier said than done, you were not completely accustomed to your new weight considering you took this new form today. You tried to move your upper weight and shuffle your butt to the edge of the sofa so you could have an easier time getting up, but doing this left you winded and red-faced. While taking a breather you realized the enormity of your hips and butt. You were bottom heavy before, but now weighing 513 lbs. it was ridiculous. Your butt took 2 seats of the 3 available and even while you were on the edge it touched the back of the sofa. Feeling a little better you start standing up, straining your pour knees and legs. After a couple of tries, you feel your butt leaving the sofa and some sweat run thru your face. Not wanting to stay like this forever you rush things up, perhaps a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere your legs give up and you noisily fall crashing down on the sofa. Fortunately, the distance between your butt and the sofa isn't much and the sofa doesn't break, but it leaves you without much energy to give it another go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kathy!!!, honey what happened? \". Your mom enters rushing to your side to check on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry ... wheeze... mom ... I ...\". You struggle to respond and catch your breath at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie are you all right? Are you hurt?\" Your mom panics as she inspects you and the sofa to see if anything bad had happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, ... I tried to get up, but ... I couldn't\". Your answer is cut not by your lack of breath this time, but by your shame to admit that you couldn't bring your fat self out of the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, honey. You worried me, I thought something bad had happened to you. Don't worry about that, you know that if you need something you should call me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mom, I just wanted to go to my bedroom\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to apologize, it's not your fault.

The formerly heavy girl now had reasonably wide swaying hips with matching thunder thighs, a big but well shaped bottom with a small shelf, a soft tummy that dipped over her waistband, smallish but perky breasts which confirm her pear figure, and a slight double chin that gave her a cherub's angelic face. You took 100 pounds and left 50 to make her a curvaceously thick babe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If too much is too depressing and the right amount makes her too stupid, I'm taking all of it.\" You banter to yourself in frustration as your act of unsung heroism was performed in vain. Unfazed by the current strain on your clothes, you focus and begin to absorb the rest of her curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself rise slowly on the bench you're both sitting on as your yoga pants fill out again with the warm sensation of increased flesh. Rising several inches in the air from your soft bottom expanding in all directions, you turn your head to look at the girl and notice her bottom half melting away as yours expands to your yoga pants dismay. As your legs fan out from your thickening thighs fighting for middle ground, you feel your exposed belly knead over itself into a doughy ball resting on your legs, while your crop tops melds further with your sports bra, just barely containing your breasts. As the warm sensation continues to radiate upward, you feel your arms begin to match the rest of you with a supple meatiness. Finally your facial features soften up with the addition of a small second chin resting kindly and smoothly under first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than an hour, you went from having the body of a 120 pound model to a 260 pound pear shaped connoisseur of confectionery treats. The formerly obese and then  thick and curvy girl was now skinny by all accounts. Her face was now well defined and angular, her breasts a small b-cup and easily hidden, her stomach completely flat, and what remained of her pear shape was a small yet perky bottom. Her hips were considerably smaller and her thighs were even small and thin now too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin as it was actually a quite comical site to behold as she was practically swimming in her clothes as much as you were bursting out of yours. Her high waisted mom jeans now could be pulled all the up to her chest, and her tucked blouse now looked like an open parachute. On the other hand your yoga pants were begging for mercy and practically see through with your crop top and sports bra ready to burst at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly hits you that you're both an <i>almost</i> perfect weight swap of the other. While this girl may be a bit shorter than you and now thinner than you ever were, her shape is almost identical to what yours use to be, and your shape is now almost identical to what her's use to be. To the average passerby, you would now be the one suspected of crying in the distance over being called a fat sow, and she the one out for a jog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to contain your present sense of awe and fighting the urge to examine yourself, you zone back in to find the now skinny girl equally as dumbstruck and examining you as much as you are her. As the bus appears in the distance, a thought pops into your head: \"What if I ask her to swap clothes. I'm bursting out of mine and she's swimming in her's, it would help both of us.\" Your sense of imagination raging wildly on the idea of exchanging clothes and symbolically your lifestyles, maybe even your very lives, you begin to feel a large hunger pang akin to something you'd always fantasize about. Scooping up your doughy belly, you're torn as to whether you should get on the bus and find food, or talk with the girl about a potential swap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You've decided to fight the newly found hunger pangs and to talk to this girl whose figure you've <i>almost perfectly</i> swapped with. Unable to contain yourself, you look directly into her eyes as if she was yourself and blurt  \"Cathy, Cathy Wilson.\" Seeing a slight panic in her eyes develop she blurts back \"Natalie, Natalie Russo. Call me Nat.\" With an exchange of nods acknowledging the pleasantries, a loud gurgle from your stomach roars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat mused: \"Funny, I was very hungry a few moments ago too, but now I'm not hungry at all. Then again...I was also jiggly fat all over with a large lardy ass and crying a few moments ago. Come to think of it, you look A LOT like I used to. And now here I am, swimming in my own clothes that I bought only a two days ago. Heh, ironically enough you appear busting out of your old workout clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing your moment was approaching, you collect yourself enough to know to keep your cards close to the chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, were you thinner when you first sat down? I don't mean be rude or ridiculous, you just look so much like me. I mean like I used to, I mean I was just preoccupied by being called a fat sow by my boyfriend, I mean ex-boyfriend.\" Nat was very quickly running out of words as she was trying to wrap her mind around the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nat continued to ramble on, you cradled your new belly in your arms and knead its soft, doughy flesh. You quietly moan a little as it's cool to the touch. You take a deep breath, ready to ask for a swap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you ask to hang out and swap clothes at a local establishment, or to swap clothes AND swap something more such as your lifestyle, lives, or something else?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wrestling with the nervous energy the words begin to quickly fumble out of your mouth as you exhale: \"Hey Nat, I know we've only known each other for a few minutes but can I ask you a weird question?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill slightly disoriented and unguarded from the sudden weight loss, Nat shrugs her shoulders and says \"I don't see why not, this day only gets stranger by the second.\" <br>\r\nYou continue on, \"Well, it seems to me that we can solve a problem for each other.\" Nat turns her head to you making quick eye contact, choosing instead to stare down in the general direction of your massive thighs. Her ears raise slightly showing her curiosity when she responds \"Go on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you couldn't already tell, I'm bursting out of my clothes. My yoga pants are paper thin, my sports bra's unhooked, and my top is barely hanging on. I've become too fat to keep wearing this outfit.\" A chill runs down your spine as you continue: \"And you, you're way too skinny for your clothes. That blouse looks like a circus tent on you, and your high waisted jeans are sitting on you like an empty burlap sack. I could only imagine how your bra and panties feel right now.\" Trailing off to try and let Nat fill in the blank, she looks at you bemused. Unable to put together what you're asking her she replies \"What are you saying to me Cathy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shift your gaze to make eye contact with Nat and ask her flat out: \"I was wondering if you wanted to trade outfits and maybe grab some lunch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMull it over for a few moments, Nat begins to visually study your bodies. She quickly stares at your large belly and her flat stomach, then your thick thighs and her thin legs, and finally at your doughy arms and her trim limbs. Sighing with visible relief, Nat renews eye contact with you. \"I think that's the most logical thing for us to do right now. So yes, let's swap outfits and eat or something like that.\"  As Nat finishes her sentence, your belly lets out another loud gurgle. Trying as hard as you can to contain your excitement, you know exactly where to go for such an occasion. \"How about the Golden Corral or Starbucks behind us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing visible excitement Nat perked up: \"I love Golden Corral, I go there all the time! I don't think anyone will recognize me looking like this. But I'm surprised that I'm still not that hungry so we could go to Starbucks. But I would like something familiar right now, so I would like to go to Golden Corral.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A soft moan comes out of your mouth as you're turned on by your outrageous hunger. Trying to contain yourself for at least a little longer, you lift your belly with your hands and say to Nat \"Well, I think that means we're going to Golden Corral.\" As Nat pumps her fist in anticipation, a young man of around the age of 21 walked over. Decently attractive, the young and slick hipster nerd had one hand around the strap of his laptop bag and the other around a venti latte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking eye contact with you through his thick black glasses he smiles. \"I was walking out of Starbucks when I overheard you crying into your phone. Your ex-boyfriend is rather mean; I don't think your a fat sow, I think you're pleasantly plump and cute as a button.\" Even though you're not into young men, you blush a little from being called pleasantly plump and cute. Showing confusion again, Nat begins to ramble again: \"Actually she wasn't the one that was crying before, it was m-.\" \"Mean. It was mean of him to say that to me. Thanks for trying to hide my tears Nat.\" You say as you grab Nat's toned arm, signaling her to not finish what she was going to say. \"And thank you for the kind words, I think my ex is going to regret losing me.\" \"Well you're quite welcome.\" Satisfied that his good old college try of kindness was a success, the young hipster sips his latte and walks away. Realizing that you may have just showed your hand of feigning ignorance, you hope that Natalie is disoriented enough from that interaction to not know of your powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas Natalie figured out that you have powers?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm the fat sow.\" Natalie remarked, still unable to comprehend that she's thin now. \"Natalie, you're as fat as a lowercase \"d\" -  stick thin with a small round bottom.\" Looking at you with wide eyes of realization, Nat responds: \"You're right, let's go to Golden Corral. I just need to get away from this bench.\" Relieved that Nat was blaming the bench for her present reality, you nod in agreement. As you both rose to your feet, the changes in your weight began to sink in. Nat's jeans started fall down but thankfully she quickly grabbed the top of her high waisted jeans before something unfortunate happened. \"I guess I'm really not fat anymore.\" Nat mused to herself as she tightened her belt as much as she could, which wrapped around her svelte waist almost twice over. \"It's not exactly enough, but it'll get the job done. I can't believe my new clothes make me look like I'm wearing a parachute right now.\" Nat offers a nervous and <i>excited </i> giggle as she waits for you to arise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get up your yoga pants strain to their absolute max, while your formerly modest sports underwear sits on you as a glorified thong which was now only thinly veiled- but still veiled none the less. You untuck your paunch from your yoga pants in the hope that it will offer them some sweet relief. Thankfully it helps recover some much needed room. Just as Nat was bemused by her thinness, you were now enthralled by your fatness. It hit you, you were now that fat girl with the belly exposed just hanging over her pants. You're equally thrilled, hungry, turned on and doing everything in your power to contain yourself. Surprisingly, you don't look quite as fat as Natalie use too, which you chalk up to being 3 inches taller than her. You're definitively fat, and everything about you confirms it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards Golden Corral, you find that you and Nat having a hard time keeping pace with each other. You're slower than you use to be with a smaller stride due to your rubbing thighs and wide girth. A few beads of sweat roll down your head that never would have been there before. Most apparent is your body's jiggle with every step; your wide ass and thighs shaking in sync with each other, and your belly moving uncontrollably now that it was untucked. Conversely Natalie was taking grand steps ahead of you at a pace you couldn't keep up with. She walked quickly and with purpose. \"Wait up!\" You shout to Natalie as you huff and puff toward her. \"Oh Wow, you're really far behind!\" Natalie blurts out of her mouth, continually showing her lack of tact. As you catch up to Natalie she appears apologetic: \"I'm really sorry Cathy, I didn't mean to inadvertently call you fat. I'm just not use to walking this fast.\" Cracking a small smile you reply: \"It's ok Nat, usually I'm a much faster walker, but I'm ok with walking slow today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into Golden Corral, you promise yourself to not absorb more weight until you exchange clothes. Putting on the mental horse blinders, you and Nat make your way to the host desk. Thankfully the hostess sitting behind the desk appears quite thin, with your only temptations being her lovely cherubic face and C-cup breasts. In your mind, she was traditional eye candy that would look even better with a some more pounds. \"Welcome to Golden Corral I'm Erica and I'll be your host for today.\" You snap out of your reverie as Nat and Erica exchange pleasantries. \"Hi Erica! Table for two under the name of Nat Russo!\" \"Nat Russo? That's really funny, we have a regular here with the same name. She's a really nice girl, and has a great sense style. Are you related? I've been meaning to ask her where she buys her jeans from, they're to die for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused why a thin girl such as Erica would want Nat's jeans, you blurt out to maintain cover: \"Yes they are related. They're cousins in fact. Nat is a common name in their family.\" Glaring over at Nat, she surprisingly corroborates your claim. \"My cousin Natalie loves Golden Corral with a passion. She enjoys eating here and then going to shop at Forever 21.\" Erica bought the lie. \"Tell your cousin I'm glad she loves Golden Corral and that I'll be shopping at Forever 21 from now on because of her. Follow me to your table.\" As Erica got up from the host desk, it became apparent why she wanted to know where Nat bought her clothes. Erica's thin arms, and perky breasts were a facade for the rest of her body- her lower half was huge! Erica defined thick with a perfectly flat stomach, curved waist, massive hips and thighs which supported an equally impressive ass. the only word that came to your mind when looking at Erica was was magnificent. As Erica led and Nat to your table you couldn't help but watch her ass move up and down with every step, her ass cheeks fighting for room in her tight jeans. You watched as Erica would sidestep between tables to pass through because she was simply too thick to walk straight between them. You desperately want Erica lower half; you also want her phone number. But right now you were on a mission, and you knew that if you focused on Erica for too long, you might just end up bursting out of your own pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud roar emanates from your belly, helping you to refocus your priorities. \"Sounds like somebody's hungry. Good thing you came to Golden Corral.\" You blush significantly at Erica's remarks. \"Oh don't be shy. It happens to me all the time, I just love to eat. It's made this the perfect job for me. Most of my lunch breaks are spent eating here for free- how else would I have ended up so big?\" Your heart pounds and you begin to sweat as Erica laughs at her own joke. She's the perfect babe for you. \"Let me show you what I looked like when I first started here.\" As you and Nat reach your table Erica hands you and Nat an old photo of herself on a beach wearing a size 2 bikinis. Your jaws dropped. \"Erica, is this really you? You look so...different.\" Nat commented in true form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what I looked like when I started 1 year ago. I really started noticing how cushioned my seats felt after they made me full time!\" Erica laughed again. \"But who cares? I'm happy and the food here is great!\" It takes everything in you not to ask Erica for her phone number or absorb her weight. \"Let me grab some waters for you ladies before you begin.\" As Erica walks away you take several deep breaths to calm down. You feel a tingling sensation inside of you again. \"Uh oh\" you whisper to yourself \"please, please, please be a hunger pang. I just can not get any bigger in these clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what to do, you look at Nat: \"Ready to trade outfits? I think it would be better for us to trade and then eat.\" \"Agreed, let's head over to the restrooms.\" As you and Nat walk towards the restrooms, the tingling sensation increases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you begin to absorb Erica's weight, or is it just another hunger pang?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nat\u2019s clothes fit better, but were still very tight around the ass, \u201cI bet I absorbed some of Erica\u2019s donk,\u201d you griped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Nat asked as she admired her newer svelte body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing,\u201d you grumbled as you jumped up and down to get Nat\u2019s jeans over your big, fat ass.  Barely buttoning our jeans you exited the stall to see Nat running her hand over her flat tummy.  \u201cYou okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this is just kind of new for me,\u201d she replied kind of quietly.  You weren\u2019t sure if she was excited to be thin or ashamed to be thin without having worked for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to change the subject before she could think about it too much, \u201cC\u2019mon I\u2019m starving, let\u2019s get some food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you piled your plates high and sat down at your table.  You caught Erica from the corner of your eye and saw that her butt was slightly smaller.  You must have absorbed some of it, and you hungered for more of it, or you just hungered.  You dug into your huge plate of food though Nat simply pecked at her own.  \u201cGuess she\u2019s just used to eating like a big girl,\u201d you thought as you watched Nat barely eat more than a few forkfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ever be in a position where everywhere you look you see something you can\u2019t stop thinking about?  That was how you felt as you looked around the Golden Corral, just big juicy badonkadonks everywhere you could see, and you wanted all of them.  Which ones?  ALL OF THEM!  You feel your ass expand ever so slightly as you watch the woman to your right sink a little in her seat.  You needed to get out of there fast, as your power was more swayed by your subconscious desires and not your logical mind which said stealing all that ass fat would leave you a rampaging buttzilla with your secret exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically inhaled your food and were about to get up and leave when you noticed Nat\u2019s plate, \u201cYou gonna eat that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d she responded pushing the plate towards you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ate it in just a few minutes and burped loudly.  You grabbed Nat\u2019s phone and programmed your number into it.  \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go, but call me.  Soon,\u201d you winked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you have to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d you smiled.  You turned to leave bit noticed it was getting harder and harder to roll one leg around the other.  Looking down to see what the problem was, you saw your thighs thickening, a quick over your shoulder saw that your ass was thickening even quicker than your thighs.  \u201cUh-oh.\u201d  Looking around the restaurant you saw every woman was startled at the loss of her ass and thigh fat.  You hurried towards the door and your top half was out when you stopped suddenly.  \u201cNo, no, no, no, no!\u201d  Your feet barely scraped the ground as you hung in the doorway by your new giant, and naked, ass.  \u201cDouble door, and I\u2019m more than double wide!\u201d you covered your face in shame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gathered around you to witness the still growing mass that you called a donk.  Well that and if they were female they were putting two and two together at the loss of their posteriors and the growing one in front of them.  \u201cNow what the Hell do I do?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All so boring and typical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were the thoughts that went through your head as you skimmed through the selection in your usual clothing store at the nearby mall. The place was something of a haunt for most teenagers your age, it was one of the reasons why you dreaded coming here. Not that you were a misanthrope, mind, it was just that most girls your age were far too interested in staying unbearably thin and starving themselves and any girl even the slightest bit overweight was mercilessly picked on until she followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't quite understand the concept of dieting, yet you never had to worry about it being able to eat pretty much whatever you wanted due to the amount of exercise you did. You had been slacking on that somewhat lately, which was why you were here at the mall shopping for new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was absolutely nothing that caught your eye here and you were just about to give up and maybe check out the new donuts shop nearby when you suddenly heard a familiar nasty voice from over the rack of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch what you're doing there, fatty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreading who it was, you peaked through the folds to the other side and saw her. Samantha Anderson, the biggest bully and perfectionist you could remember from high school. You had hoped that you had seen the last of her after graduation but it seemed luck was not on your side in that regard. She had almost bleach white blond hair precisely cut at shoulder length to match her solid blue eyes. She had more of a model's body than you, five foot five with flawless C breasts and a sweet hourglass figure that she constantly flaunted with low cut shorts and shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I-I was just buying some clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some clothes here? Hah! You should try a Big and Tall next time. Save the designer outfits for people like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slumped over person she was talking to was also someone you recognized from school. Maggie Kelly, was pretty much the exact opposite of Samantha and had a form that you secretly coveted. She was taller than, a whooping six foot one, and was pretty overweight despite her attempts at dieting which you noticed she must have been trying over the summer. Her current weight seemed to be around the two hundred marker with most of it focused on her bust and belly. She was rather pale with beautiful red hair, matching her Irish heritage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm allowed to shop here,\" Maggie tried to defend herself. \"They have things in my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are you? Size twenty? Pick up my clothes that you knocked over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth as Maggie hesitated and silently obeyed, bending far over as Samantha continued to berate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stick your big ass in my face, your pig tails shows!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie's face was all red now, she must have caught Samantha in a really bad mood. She were tempted to just go over and smack Samantha out of pure rage, you were so sick of girls like her. But you knew how to control yourself well enough as much as you felt sorry for Maggie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I wish I could do something about that snarky bitch</i>,\" you thought to yourself. \"<i>Maybe take her down to size and show her who's boss. Or at least keep her from destroying Maggie like that.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that very moment something magical happened that would change your life forever.

Its not like I want to return this belly but I have to experiment a bit.\" You began to think as you feel your belly start to shrink.

It was only you, Cathy.\" Maggie said as she wiped a bit of sweat off her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw what happened earlier. I wish I could've helped.\" You said while rubbing her shoulder while looking at Maggie's figure. Her breasts had to be at least an F cup while her belly looked as if she swallowed a watermelon. Her thighs and butt weren't really that big but were larger than yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well even if you did. She would probably gawk you for your rather larger than normal butt. I wish  I had a metabolism like you. Eat whatever you want without worry. I've been dieting but it deosn't seem to work out.\" Maggie sighed as she picked out some clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't worry what people think.

Like make her fat or something.\" Maggie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh how I wish I knew someone like that.\" You said as you rolled your eyes and the two of you begin laughing. You begin to try it out again on Maggie. You first take her belly , then reduce her breasts to a B cup, her thighs, butt and hips till she got a slim figure. You had taken at least 80 pounds off of her as she waved goodbye to you with a smile and new found energy. In a blink of an eye, you are startled that Maggie's once very loose clothing now fitted her. Rubbing your eyes, you shrug a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... that worked like a charm.\" You say to yourself as your rub you newly gained weight. Your face and arms remained slim but you had distrbuted the fat to the places you felt needed a bit of heft. Smiling at yourself you begin to think of what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They weren\u2019t as thick as your new ones, but they were pretty thick. You generously took some fat from their thighs, putting on about 20 additional pounds just on your thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIN another store, you notice a woman sadly looking at clothes that wouldn\u2019t fit her. You kindly absorbed about 30 pounds from her, slimming her down enough to fit the clothes and fattening your belly and ass up nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another, you saw a busty woman rudely berating the cashier. Justly, you stole some of her bust. Her E cups shrank to A\u2019s and your own D cups swelled to heavy HH cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking you overheard two girls speaking, sisters it seemed. One, taller by a few inches, was harassing the other, shorter one.

You had come to this mall 5\u201910\u201d and 130 pounds with B cups and a slightly larger bum.

Why did it seem like no one noticed any of these changes? However, all of these inquiries were overridden by the almost child-with-a-new-toy like urge you had swelling up inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What else can I do with this?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the mall and the gawking you were gaining, you decided that the best idea would be to change yourself so you were less of an attraction for any wandering eyes. Though it seemed like no one could apprehend the changes to people that had been going on, you didn't enjoy the idea of attention while you experimented with this strange gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a casual glance around, you looked for people to swap things with. The mall was absolutely full of people now, it being during it's peak hours. There were plenty of victims you could \"bless\" with a little extra height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you spotted someone you had been looking for. A shy looking red headed girl was busy being berated by who could only be her older sister. Both seemed to be within the same age range, but the older one had been blessed with a few extra inches in height. You estimated them to be five foot one and five foot five respectively. Smiling, as you had just witnessed a similar a similar event just moments ago, you closed your eyes and focused on the smaller girl growing taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Don't rub it in Sally! It's not fair, you got such a boost during puberty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, you opened your eyes to see the younger sister now standing over the other girl gloating her boost in height, which was a good foot and a half. You also took notice to your own changes, having been brought back mostly to normal with just an inch or so difference from your usual height. One major difference, however, was that you kept the two hundred and thirty pounds. You were now overweight, a nice bulging belly jutted out from your shirt as did your hips from your thighs. Everything was chubby, nice, and full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is neat,\" you said to yourself as you casually played with your giant new breasts. \"I wonder though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you weren't picky with who you chose as a target. You picked an average girl talking on her cellphone and focused just on the height again. She shot up like a rocket, extending all the way to roughly the same height you had been when you absorbed Samantha's traits, you had to guess it was about a two foot gain. This meant that you had lost that much of your own height, bringing you down to four feet one, a size that you hadn't been since you were a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, you waddled over to a mirror to get a look at yourself laughing at what you saw. \"I look ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like someone had taken a giant hammer and squashed you her like a tin can. All that weight spread itself out along your breasts, belly, thighs, and arms making you seem even more heftier than ever. There was a bizarre feeling of excitement and wonder, everything seemed so much bigger than before but at the same time you were much bigger than before as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this can be pretty cool, I should try this later. But for now...\" you refocused on the girl on the cellphone and took your height back. \"I think I'll just stay normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so you told yourself. Who knew what the next crazy thought that could pop in your head would be now that you had this boon.

YOu don't really have the cash for new shoes, sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering one aisle, you see a familiar face resting on a bench. It belonged to a woman named Meredith, one of your neighbors. You had admired Meredith from across the fence for many years. She was the first woman you were physically attracted to, some eight years ago when she was still lingerie model. Now, 31 years old, most would never recognize her. She was recently tipping the scales at roughly 300 pounds and pregnant with her third and fourth children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue any day now, Meredith's gravid belly was immense. While mostly round, the thick fat coated her belly, several rolls apparent. Her hips were rather wide and her thighs very thick, allowing her to fill most of the bench oh her own. But what gained your attention was her bust. Busty before her weight gain, even bustier once breaking 250, and now mind boggling busty thanks to pregnancy. Her large, fatty breasts weighed heavily on her belly, filled to the brim and ready to feed her children. The tight maternity blouse was pulled down revealing a hypnotic amount of pale cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Meredith!\" you greet her, waddling yourself over to her. She looks and smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it isn't not-so-little Cathy, the girl who used to watch me tan,\" the pretty brunette smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't have been so tempting if you hadn't tanned nude,\" you laughed, noting Meredith's comment on your weight. \"And what do you mean used to?\" you said with a wink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeredith laughed half-heartily, \"Why would continue to watch me? I'm such a whale these day. I look like I ate the skinny girl I used to be and then ate the fat girl a became.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not that bad,\" you comforted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is!\" Meredith exclaimed. \"All the disgusted stares, the way Robert looks at me now, how hard it is to move. It's horrible! I used to model bras and thongs, now I'd be lucky if my husband wants to see me naked. My husband!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole while she spoke tears were forming in her eyes. By the time she was done, she had broken into sobs. You felt bad for her. Despite believing she looked beautiful so round, you couldn't stand seeing her so unhappy. </span></div></div>",

Maybe things with her husband would patch up now as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fondled yourself slightly in the middle of the store wondering what you should do with this new power of yours.

All that was about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an evil grin you outstretched your hand and focused solely on the tall girl's stomach. Before your eyes, a bulge started to form under her breasts.

No it must be your new power and as you look up you see Kelly again and facts pop into your head. She was actually nine months even she was a little off and her breasts were actually DD. You also some how new her weight she was sitting at a heavy 185 most of which seemed to be the pregnancy. Looking back at yourself you see that you're new weight is 163 pounds, thank you magical powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it feel being pregnant with...\" Kelly was cut off by her belly starting to shrink as well as the rest of her pregnancy weight melting off her body. You start to feel the tingling sensation again and look down to see your breast almost burst your top settling at a heavy F cup. Your belly then started its growth and ballooned out to three feet in front of you. The rest of Kelly's pregnancy weight settled on your body making your butt thicker as well as widening your hips and thickening your thighs. Your pants rip as you finish your growth and you blush thinking to yourself I wish everyone's clothes changed when I did this that'd make things easier. As you finish your thought you find that Kelly is now wearing a pair of daisy Dukes and a tank-top. You look down to see that you know have a huge pregnancy blouse and a pair of maternity pants that fit your new form perfectly. Thank you magic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that I got a chill as I was saying what does it feel like being pregnant with triplets?\" Kelly finished her statement not knowing that you just stole her pregnancy. \"It's been great even with the added weight I love my babies even though I'm nine and a half months and ready to pop any day now.\" Looking at Kelly you notice that she is rather petite without her pregnancy weight coming in at 110 pound, you then think about your new body and realize you now sit at 238 ponies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have what you came for so you talk for a little bit then decide to leave and go..</span></div></div>",

This was your attempt to bring a close to the love affair you'd had with food all your life, an affair that was threatening to kill a slim figure you'd somehow been able to maintain. You and food could still be friends, you reasoned, just not friends with benefits. No more late-night booty calls in the form of midnight snacks, no more spending entire days together. It had to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, staring at the plate of pizza, burgers, french fries, and cake before you, you made a resolution. And your will broke instantly. \"Ohhh, I can't do this! I just want to eat, but I have to stay slim....\" you say, trailing off as a girl walking down the aisle catches your eye. She's a chubby girl, with at least 40 pounds on you, but you don't see anything wrong with the way she looks. Rather, you find yourself absentmindedly drooling over her curves. Her breasts, solid D cups, bobbing up and down with each step, her hips swaying with a size and femininity you'd never been able to attain, her ghetto booty bouncing and jiggling--all of it made you so... jealous. Why did you have to be thin? What made you think that way, especially when you could be as big and as sexy as this girl? No, not as big... bigger. The biggest. Why not? You wanted nothing more than to be so big, so curvy, so... sexy. After all, your breasts were small by any and all standards, which isn't exactly sexy. And even though you had an above average ass, this girl's buns put even your best attribute to shame. You wanted them, you had to have them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, you did. The girl had to catch her pants to stop them from falling off completely, as her flat-as-a-board ass wasn't enough to keep them up anymore. You, on the other hand, found yourself sitting at least a few inches higher and taking up much more of the cafeteria bench as your new found ass pancaked out below you. Her ass was now yours, an occurrence which neither you nor your pants were quite prepared for. The yoga pants you had been wearing, which were already tight on your previously plump rear, had torn completely down the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

Your bra snapped as her D cups combined with you B cups, bulging into fleshy melon like F cups. They stretched your shirt and pulled it up, revealing your now plump gut for all to see. It was not yet big enough for too many rolls but hung over your waistband. It was round and smooth, free of stretch marks and cellulite. Your yoga pants stretched and ripped more, this time down the sides of your thighs as you put more than inch on both sides of your hips and your thighs thickened together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shut, a gasp escapes your lips, and your toes curl in your now surprisingly tight shoes.

And exciting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking inventory, you slipped off your shoes and your ruined pants. Your panties were still intact even though they had been converted into a thong. With effort, your pulled your useless bra from under your shirt and added it to the pile. Your shirt would make due, covering your breasts just fine. Taking yourself in, you note that you had taken quite a bit of weight. While she was indeed 40 pounds heavier than you, it seemed you had taken more than 40 pounds. About 60 you'd say. You also seemed taller, about 4 inches taller, which would explain the shoe problems. And you were hungry, very hungry. Did you take her hunger too? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you felt up your body, you sized yourself to be about 6'2\" and 190 pounds. Your big breasts were wonderful, your round belly great, but your plump ass was glorious. Before, your plump rump had been your largest, and most defining, physical attribute. The same could have easily been said about the chubby girl. Between her fat ass and your plump butt, you were now a wondrous pear shaped fatty. And a hungry fatty. Not just for food though, but for more. More curves, more fat, more height, more power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were interrupted by someone entering the quiet ladies room. Peering between the cracks, who is it?</span></div></div>",

Her breasts were noticeably bigger than yours, GG cups, and sat heavily on her rotund belly. Her belly hung over the edge of her pants, her muffin top and love handles practically begging to be held. One large fold had creased her belly across her deep belly button, giving her the glorious \"double belly\" look. Her wide hips sway with each step, followed by her ass. It was big, but probably the smallest thing on her. Actually, it looked only slightly bigger than your own booty. Her thick thighs touched as she stepped forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cathy?\" Karen called out, brushing her curly blonde hair out her face.

Jutting nearly 2' from the small of your back, the massive shelf booty weighed more than you did this morning.

She was very slim: no belly fat at all, narrow hips, and a tiny pert butt. Her proudest achievement was her chest. Perky and full, round and natural F cups. Same size as yours now, just perkier. She did have a beautiful model like face, framed by long raven black hair. While she was vain and self-centered, she wasn\u2019t stupid. Lauren was devious. She had a knack for knowing exactly how to tempt a man or woman into giving her what she wanted and when that failed she knew just how to best ruin their lives. She did what she wanted, she got what she wanted, and slept with who she wanted, all regardless of who it hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was not nearly as gifted as her deviant friend. On the short side of 5'3\", Becca was the definition of a blond bimbo; ditzy and busty. She had DD cups and no fat on her body, but not naturally. You had known Becky before University. Her family was loaded and she had more money than Lauren. In middle school she had been fat; liposuction in 8th grade. Flat chested freshmen year; implants over the summer.

The few who were deliberately ignoring her turned around at the sound of her blouse buttons, as the flew wildly. The woman ripping it open revealing her too large bra for her disbelieving audience. Her hands mauling her breasts, still looking for that vanished flesh. Her lip started to tremble as she was on the verge of tears. Her pride and joy, those ripe, eye-catching D-cups were now yours, that luscious rump too. In her distraction, the woman's skirt fell from her dull hand swishing down her stockinged legs to pool at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all helped you leave with her so determinedly demanding everyone's attention.

You feel, as well as hear the stitching surrendering, each step putting unbearable strain on the seat of your yoga pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it's your fuller bust that draws the most gawping, leering looks. Your own bra wasn't made for the mass they now contain. Overflowing the cups, they bulge obscenely making your bust look even bigger than it's expanded dimensions. You breathing constricted by the strap, and the weight crushed against your ribs, you want to rip the damned thing off yourself. Resisting the temptation, you don't want the interest... or anyone to think of you, and connect you with the chaos in the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for the looks were hard to deny. As every detail of your bra was pressed firmly against your own blouse. Making it look like it was embossed with a flowery, lacy design. The buttons tight under pressure, a familiar diamond pattern visible, as they gapped, revealing your bare flesh, and underwear beneath.</span></div></div>",

Minutes later, the alarm blares again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCathy, wake up!\u201d you here your mother order sternly. \u201cWhat in the world are you doing sleeping at this hour?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was tired\u2026,\u201d you mumble. Lazily, you roll over and peek through squinted eyes at your phone: 8:32 PM. \u201cUgh, I\u2019m moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to sit up and rub the sleep from your eyes. School was just so exhausting. You were a sophomore now at your University and it was wearing you out. All the classes and the homework and the tests and the responsibilities. Bleh. You were only about two weeks into the second semester and your classes were already dragging on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up from the bed and stretch the sleep out of your body. A shiver runs through your body. The winter weather was seeping into the house and you were feeling it now. You had slept in just your underwear and a tank top; your braless breasts bouncing lightly as your moved, your nipples poking against the thin material, and your long bare legs were covered in goosebumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou normally lived at school in the dorms even though you lived in the same town \u2013 perks of having scholarships \u2013 but you liked to come home on the weekends to do laundry since you didn\u2019t have to pay. It was pretty peaceful too being home right now. You didn\u2019t have to worry about school for the moment and you bother of you sisters were out, Alex was working and Jane was with a friend. So it was just you and your mom on the cold and quiet Saturday night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to head down stairs and get some pants and maybe a bra out the laundry room. Nice, freshly washed and warm clothes would help you relax even more. You pause for a moment before leaving the room, studying your corkboard. It was covered in notes and memos and pictures of your two best friends: Maria and Yuki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria, a short and thick Latina, was your best friend growing up and all through high school. She was cute and you\u2019d always had a bit of crush on her but you hadn\u2019t spent time with her in so long you were sure how strong those feeling were anymore. She had a gone to the same University as you but, in an attempt to branch out and make more friends, the two of you had chosen to live in different dorms with strangers as roommates. As school went on and classes and workloads increased, the times you saw each other dwindled. You hadn\u2019t seen here now since the summer and even then she was so busy with summer classes and new friends you still barely saw each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were tempted to call her up and hang out sometime, maybe even talk to her about your feelings for her but that made you feel guilty. Yuki, your short and busty Japanese roommate, was pretty cute and not only did you sort of like her too but it seemed, at times, that she might feel the same way. In the past year and a half of living together the two of you had bonded and grown so close that you felt you might be closer to her than Maria nowadays. You and Yuki had long conversations about many things: what you liked, what you wanted to be in future, and who you were. You were the only person Yuki had come out to at the point and she was the only person you\u2019d talked about your feelings for bigger girls and how sometimes you wondered what\u2019d it\u2019d be like. Maybe it\u2019d just be smarter and simpler to talk to Yuki about dating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed in frustration, face red at the possibilities, and went down to the first floor and to the laundry room. It was just a small room in the back the house with the washer and dryer, a sink, and few racks and shelves for clothes. You opened the dryer, savoring the sweet smell of freshly washed clothes, and dug out a pair of jeans. You lazily stepped into the warm fabric and pulled them up your smooth legs. Buttoning them you realized they were not your jeans after all but your mother\u2019s. They were far too big for you around the waist and in the back and too short for your legs but before you could properly react, the strangest thing happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt strange, an odd sensation spreading through your lower half. You felt both hot and cold at the same time; on one hand you felt as if you were having a heat flash and your legs just felt so warm but on the other hand a chill ran across your skin and up your spine leaving goosebumps all along your legs. Your legs felt cramped, as if they were pressed into an uncomfortable position for hours and you felt an uncomfortable bloating in your tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you registered all these sensations in a blink of the eye, your body shifted and morphed. Your legs \u2013 and your overall height \u2013 shrank and diminished, leaving you several inches shorter. Dropping from an impressive 5\u201910\u201d to a measly 5\u20193\u201d you now matched your mother in height and the pants were now longer too short for but, instead, fit they length of your legs perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, the girth of your lower half began to expand. Your hips began to widen, your pelvis cracked and stretched even as pound after pound of soft fat layered them. Your thighs thickened, the muscles growing stronger (though only slightly) and fat building up. Your thigh gap, what little you had, quickly disappeared as your newly dubbed thunder thighs smooshed and pressed together. Even your calves grew fat, taking on your more swollen appearance, and your tummy soften, the small belly you had from snacking at college rounding out a bit more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lower half was now an exact match for your mother\u2019s in both shape and size. You\u2019d shrunk 7 inches and gained roughly 40 pounds (putting you at 180) just below just below the belt. Your thin top half perched about your fattened bottom half left you looking like an over exaggerated pear shape. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But compared to what she had been, to what you were now, she was slim. She was maybe a fourth of the size you were now. On top of that she was taller, just like you had been. She now towered over you at 5\u201910\u201d. It was intimidating, despite you size you now felt much smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did look, in your opinion, more comical and unbalanced than you did. Her breasts were still gigantic and her belly still large and fat and even her face and arms were still pudgy looking, but below the waist she thinned so much. It gave her a sort of lollipop shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCathy, are you ok?\u201d your mother asked again putting a hand on your shoulder, obviously getting worried. You swallowed, clearing your throat before you smiled up at her (an odd experience).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, don\u2019t worry mom. I was just confused,\u201d you fake laughed. You tugged at the waistband of \u201cyour\u201d jeans. \u201cAre you really sure these are mine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course they are sweetie,\u201d she laughed at you, putting her hands on \u201cher\u201d hips. \u201cNo offense, dear, but no one else in this house would fit them. Only you, my Big Little Girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began tending to the rest of her clothes leaving you to your own devices. Kind of numb and not knowing what to do with yourself, you wander back up to your room. The journey up the stairs was an interesting one. When walking, you were used to the way your thighs lightly brushed together or how your hips kind of swung and rolled or how your butt bounced. After all, you hadn\u2019t exactly been slim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now you felt all those sensations times ten. Your thighs always rubbed together, slapping each other and shaking. Your hips, so much wider now, had an entirely new center of gravity and momentum and forced you to swing them in what must have been a rather enticing show. Your ass, wow your ass, was so big and your jeans so tight that your round, bulbous cheeks seemed to be fighting for space in your pants. Every step your body shook and jiggled, it jiggled so much, and the worst part was that it wasn\u2019t a bad feeling. You liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you got upstairs into your room, you were red in the face not just from the work of carrying an extra forty pounds up the stairs but from the excitement you were feeling from those sensations. Finally alone, you wondered what you should do. Glancing over your corkboard, you saw all the same things but now you had this giant ass in every photo.<i> Reality changed that much?</i> You thought sitting on your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There\u2019s gotta be something I can do. Maybe if I take the pants off? Since I changed when I put them on, I might change back. Like the pants might be cursed or something.</i> You noticed your hands were once more rubbing and groping your new mass. Your right hand tried to drift between your thighs but they were so big now you were forced to spread them rather wide for the same access. You gently rubbed your crotch through your pants, growing more aroused. You grinned. <i>And if it doesn\u2019t work, I can always have some fun.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling your hand away, you struggled to stand momentarily. You unbuttoned the pants and rolled them down letting them fall the ground. You stepped out of them, entranced by watching your flesh jiggle and shake. You looked so much bigger without out the pants on. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rummaging through the rest of your dresser and closet, you notice that much of the clothes were really your mother's and were organized the way she would organize them. In the top drawers of your dresser were clothes from when your mother was thinner. She calls them the \"top goals for lowest weight\" section of her wardrobe for those brief periods of time when she would really work out hard and weigh anywhere from 150lbs to 175lbs. In the middle set of drawers were the clothes she wore most often at her normal weight fluctuation of 185lbs to 200lbs. Looking at the pants you were wearing now, they would belong in there. Then in the bottom set of drawers was her \"keep the fat far\" section that was stuffed to the gills with her fat clothes. You laugh a little as your mother had always been more likely to fatten up than slim out over the years. Usually her seasons of being bigger than normal ran concurrently with stress at work, boredom at work, or girl scout cookies at work. One time she even ballooned to 300 lbs due to work stress and several cases of samoas. Most of the time though her average high end was around 250 lbs. That being said, it was becoming obvious that your mother was prepared for everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the closet reflected her ever-changing waistline with several different dresses available in multiple sizes that became progressively bigger as you went to the right. What was most interesting though was that while most of the pants clearly really belonged to your mother, a small minority of your shirts were scaled with some of the pants. It did make some sense to you though- your belly did round out some and while the rest of your top half may have been normal, part of the reality you knew seemed to overlap with a reality where her body and yours were fully swapped. It was then that it hit you: \"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. I put on mom's jeans, I get mom's ass and legs and she gets mine. If I put on 'her' jeans now, I should get her current legs and ass. I'm so glad I bothered to do my physics homework last week. Thank you Newton.\" Excited by the prospect of figuring out the mechanics of your situation, you decided to take back some of the clothes that were rightfully and size-fully yours. You then begin your attempt to quietly waddle your way to the top of the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step from your bedroom to the stairs became an act of concentration as it was much harder to walk silently now than it was before. The extra mass changed your center of gravity and it didn't help that your large ass and hips were constantly threatening to knock something over. As much as the thought of your ass knocking a vase down made you hot in the face, you realize that your mission was too important to drift away from right now. Once you made it to the top of the stairs, you listened intently to make sure that your mother was still downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the low electric hum and swirl of the rinse cycle, your suspicions became confirmed your mother had done more laundry. A sudden artificial roaring sound enters your airspace- your mother was now vacuuming. Pleased that your were so close to your mother's bedroom and she was nowhere near it, you make your way straight to her closet and dresser. You figure that if your dresser looked like hers, than her dresser would now look like yours. Testing your suspicions out you open the right middle drawer to find nothing but your jeans in your old size- exactly what you were looking for. You quickly grab a pair and waddle as fast as possible back to your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking the door behind you, you immediately take off the pants you were currently wearing. For comparison's sake you hold up your old jeans in front of you. The designer jeans in your hands looked like they were a representation of the skeleton inside of your heavy bottom half. A slight gasp of pleasure releases from your mouth as you were surprised to see exactly how different you were now. You really did enjoy the very bottom heavy figure that was in front of you. Thick calves, thunderous and creamy thighs, wide and full hips that perfectly supports your massive ass. \"If this works, <i>I do</i> want to try this ass out again\" you whisper to yourself as if someone else was in the room listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sentiment said you begin to put on your old jeans. Does it work? </span></div></div>",

You felt both hot and cold at the same time; on one hand you felt as if you were having a heat flash and your legs just felt so warm but on the other hand a chill ran across your skin and up your spine leaving goosebumps all along your legs. Your legs felt stretched, as if they were being released from a tightly-wound spring and you felt a comfortable deflating feeling in your tummy, returning your midsection to having only a small belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you registered all these sensations in a blink of the eye, your body shifted and morphed. Your legs \u2013 and your overall height \u2013 returned to normal, bring you back to 5'10\" from the measly 5\u20193\u201d you received from your mother's pants. Your old pants were no longer too long but, instead, they fit the length of your legs perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, the girth of your lower half begins to shrink back to normal. Your hips began to compress, your pelvis cracks to a familiar place as the pounds of your mom's fat flesh leaves them. Your thigh gap reappeared granting your thighs independence of each other once again. Your calves thin out and the 40 or so pounds you put on were gone- you look as though nothing ever happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" You exclaim as you run your hands down your legs. Staring back at you in the mirror was the reflection you remembered. 5'10\", large yet shapely backside, and small belly from collegiate snacking. \"This is exciting, I think I might be on to something!\" you say with glee as you gaze at your mother's jeans, as they lay wide and empty on the floor. Curious to see if reality was fully restored, you check to see if your dresser and your mom are back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Grinning with thoughts of pure imagination you strip down to your skivvies. Checking yourself out in the mirror you bid your current body farewell. \"Goodbye for now body. We'll see what you look like next time.\" With great anticipation you take a quick breath and put on your mother's jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill runs down your spine as the strange, odd sensation spreads through your lower half again. Your legs immediately shrink bringing you back down to 5'3\"- but without the feeling of cramping. Your tummy bloats and rounds out but there was no feeling of discomfort. The pants now fit the length of your legs perfectly. At the same time, the girth of your lower half begins to expand, bringing your body to fill every contour of the jeans. Your hips widen with pound after pound of soft fat, your thighs thunderously thicken hugging together without a gap, your ass inflates in size with a jelly-like feeling in your new center of gravity. Your calves puff up and appear swollen, and finally your tummy softens more, tucking into the jeans, causing the button to move forward ever so slightly. Your transformation was complete with no cramps or no cracking with time around. The process was seamless, your lower half was now a perfect match for what was <i>once </i>your mother's. It was big, it was lush, and it was the work of years of her snacking - and it was now all yours. As far as anyone was concerned, it was <i>your</i> snacking that gave <i>you</i> a large lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy's Big Little Girl indeed\" you mumble to yourself as you gaze upon your over exaggerated pear shape in the mirror. Aside from a seamless transformation something felt different this time. Looking more carefully in the mirror you noticed that you were fatter than the first time, though not by too much. Your arms and sides were a little meatier and your face softened a bit with your perfect jawline showing the first signs of a double chin. Even your boobs felt bigger than before. Most evident of all was your belly. Originally it was just a little pooch from snacking in college. Then in your mother's jeans it rounded out into a small belly of it's own. This time around there was enough for you to grab in your hands with a wrap around to love handles. Your belly was even taking up noticeable real estate in <i>your</i> jeans! Thankfully your shirt adjusted to fit properly. You estimated that you probably gained 55 instead of 40 pounds this time around placing you at 195 pounds - and you loved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavy and labored a small bead of sweat forms on your forehead. It gently cascades down the side of your face, finding itself on the bottom of your softer jawline. It then liberates itself downward, landing into the abyss of your chest. You have a hard time containing yourself as this experience was realizing your every curiosity. You bite your lip, trying to hold back the very arousal you feel. In an attempt to distract yourself you wonder why you ended up fatter this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it because you wanted to be transformed? Maybe more power was unlocked in you and you transferred some of her fat to your body? Maybe you were starting to take on the rest of your mother's figure? Maybe it was some combination of those things. Right now you just didn't care, you just wanted to put on more of her clothes. Looking in your dresser and closet, you smile as you see reality has settled with some of her clothes and organization of them back in your dresser and closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know where to start.

Along with the jeans came a white t-shirt your mother stretched to its max capacity. This look is <i>the</i> look your mother wears. A devilish grin comes over your face as you realize you would be her for all intents and purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/sOc1Yrf.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/sOc1Yrf.jpg</a> <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.imgur.com/yC4lS5X.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.imgur.com/yC4lS5X.png</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you as imagine your reverie, you also see her purple workout clothes, and want to give them a go.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Throwing the t-shirt and jeans on the bed you strip down and quietly take stock of your body in the mirror. While clearly not a girl who was missing too many meals, you wanted your body to look like it never missed any snacks. You were mesmerized by your thick lower half as it was impossible to escape it. It was clearly your largest asset. Making your way up you smile coyly upon examination of your belly. It was real, it was jiggly, and it was supported by two love handles. Even your breasts were larger than you before. Working further up you blush when you see your own face. Your features were softer, with a little added fluff to your cheeks. You had a small double chin that exaggerated all your facial expressions. At your current size most people would maybe guess a girl like you was thin at one point, chubby definitely. They'd guess that you were a chubby child who took to snacking and boozing in college. But right now you were towing the line of fatness- the edge of glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cool breeze from the air conditioner hits your bare skin signaling that you've been admiring yourself for some time. Drifting back into reality a familiar devilish grin comes over your face again. It was time. Sitting on the edge of the bed, your belly rests peacefully on your thighs. It was a new sensation, and becoming increasingly hard not to stop and gratify your body as it was demanding. Grabbing your mother's clothes your heart beat accelerates as you slide the even bigger jeans over your already big bottom. Quickly throwing on the white t-shirt, you lay back in the bed hoping to experience the transformation all at one time. You did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar chill runs down your spine as the strange, odd sensation spreads through your whole body. For the first time it was not only everywhere, but also totally pleasurable.Your whole body swells in total pleasure at the same time. It was intense, radiant, and almost caused you to black out. Every part of you surged forward and rounded out. Your belly jutted out and became large and ovular. It was thick and heavy with a fat roll wrapped around to your sides. Lovely large love handles adorned your backside and sat on top of your fantastically large and round rear end, which itself was being upheld by thick thighs and drumstick calves. Your breast grew large, full, and began to fight gravity as they rested gently on your big belly. Your arms became even softer as they barely miss touching your breasts. Your face softened up dramatically with substantially fuller cheeks and a full on double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your clothes finish filling out to where your mother last wore them, the odd chilling sensation begins to die down. Clenching your fists and flexing all your muscles you let a long passioned moan shouting \u201cmore!\u201d in an attempt to keep the sensation going. Reigniting to full strength, your body continued to expand. The base of your belly began to merge more with your sides as your swelling breasts rested further on top. Your arms growing meaty gently kiss the sides of your breasts. The white t-shirt you're wearing stretches to its max as you grow fatter, clinging to you in in a way that your mother would have retired it before ever daring to reveal so many lumps. Your entire lower half grows more dense with soft fat, pushing the jeans to the limit. As an obvious ripping sound hits your ears, you relax all your muscles and unclench your fists commanding the odd sensation to die down. Regaining your senses you feel a dampness below your belly- you orgasmed. This sensation was better than anything you'd ever felt. Further searching the dampness, you feel your exposed thighs touching between your legs, a slight rip in your jeans in between your legs on your thighs. Thankfully you'd become fat enough where no one would notice. It was then that it hit you: you were fat everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up slowly, your whole body jiggles as it adjust to your new center of gravity, in which you feel much closer to the ground now than ever before. Looking in the mirror you were in awe. You were much fatter of a woman than these clothes were ever made to contain. It was a miracle that they even held tightly on your body. You could practically see your bra through your shirt, as well as the top of your panties which by this point were giving you a borderline pleasurable wedgie. While your mother had certainly been this fat before, she would have never nor could she ever wear these clothes at the weight you were now. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d you mouth to yourself as you struggle to find an answer. Beholding your form you guesstimated that you were 275lbs now, approximately 135 lbs heavier than you were than you woke up in this morning. There were so many questions in your head, but all you wanted to do was eat, explore/enjoy your body, and fatten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeling your shirt up you examine your new jelly belly. Jiggling around it was fighting wildly from being contained by your jeans. Stroking it from the outside you feel the thick crease your underbelly makes against your jeans. A shiver runs down your spine. It was tantalizing but you greedily wanted even more. Using your fat fingers to carefully unbutton your plastered on jeans, your belly juts forward embracing its new found fat freedom. To you it's the beginning of glory. A full fledged mom belly resting upon your open jeans- it's indulgence. It's the kind of body you get from years of snacking and horrible eating while raising kids, the kind of fat that's set in, and it's all yours. You take both of your meaty hands, and caress your glob of a plushy belly from the bottom. Circling around it you discover smooth cool skin. You greedily grab two handfuls and immediately let out a long, deep almost violent moan. This was your moment, this was what you wanted. You're fat, and you want to be so fat and so much of a fatty in lifestyle that there's no going back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok up there Cath?\u201d You here your mom yell from downstairs. Your eyes grow big as the thought hits you- what does mom look like? \u201cI'm uh, fine mom.\u201d you shout as your mind races to figure out what she looks like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStay Upstairs and explore your body/powers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo Downstairs and find food and your mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Curious as to how you expanded past the size of the pants, what this reality looked liked, what your mother looked like, how fat you really are, and what kind of powers you really have. It was all so surreal to you, but at the same time the fat belly in your hands and ravenous desire for donuts confirmed it. You want to feel the warm frosting of fresh donuts across your face and tongue. You want to grab fistfuls of donuts and shove them down your gullet until your fat belly cries for mercy. You want to see food wrappers and crumbs surround your body as your clothes stretch to their max. Eating was now sexual conquest to you, and you're as thrilled as you are hungry and horny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying back on the bed you suck your gut in with all your might. Pulling up the zipper as much as you can you begin to stuff your belly into your pants. Fighting to get it all in you manage to just button your pants. Exhaling in relief, you feel the wonderful strain your putting on the jeans. Standing up, the reality of your weight gain begins to sink in. You feel gravity's pull stronger than ever before as your body jiggles in places you didn't know it could jiggle. Looking down you feel your double chin kiss your neck as you fail to observe the whole of your feet. \"Soon I won't be able to see past my gut at all\" you whisper to yourself in satisfaction. Looking up into the mirror you're stunned. You look exactly like a younger, fatter, and taller version of your mother. The beginnings of the ideal you right in front of your face and it really was you. Feeling a massive tummy rumble you moan and set forth to have your desires met. Grabbing your car keys you begin to make your way down the stairs. Creaking with every step, you felt multiple areas of your body brushing into your surroundings. Everything on you was harmoniously jiggling together, putting further strain on your already strained clothes. At the base of the steps you begin to quietly huff and puff showcasing how out of shape you were. It was turning you on even more, but you were on a mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear your mother call out from the kitchen: \"Hey Cathy I heard some noises from upstairs, is everything alright?\" Trying to cover your tracks you lie to your mother \"Everything is fine mom, I dropped a textbook on my foot but everything is good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your keys you're torn, do you leave the house and grab donuts, or see your mother? </span></div></div>",

She had a full face with thick cheeks and a double chin that jiggled with each bite of the feast in front of her. Catching her crumbs were two large, full breasts that would have rested on top of the island if they weren't resting upon a fat pot belly. It was a beautiful belly so full, malleable and lush. The island cut into and began to  subdivide it so that part of her belly peacefully rest on the counter top while the rest sat underneath. Two deli meat sized arms cuddled the sides of her breasts and upper belly as they gluttonously shoveled food into her mouth.A single dot of chocolate frosting found itself on Rhonda's face as what was left of a once complete chocolate covered sponge cake entered her mouth.This chocolatey meal was being eaten with such focus and reverence that it could have been mistaken for a religious ritual.

Awestruck you realized that she was spilling over the chair she was sitting in. Her thick saddlebagged hips gave her a fiercely rounded feminine body as they turned into thick tree trunk thighs, which acted as the support system upholding her big belly above. Her whole body was raised up high from the seat due to her large shelf ass that pushed itself through every nook and cranny - including the space between the back and bottom of the chairs she was sitting in.

Pull up a chair and we can finish this cake in time for me to me to start figuring out dinner.\" Catching yourself salivating at the mouth, you remembered that your mother shouldn't be fat.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were more than a bit surprised by the chill you felt running down your spine. You had long known that you were attracted to girls, and to curvy and even plump girls at that, however, you had never once thought of yourself as potentially being like one of the girls you were attracted to. You had never actually borne a resemblance to any of the girls you found attractive. While you were drawn to thick and luscious curves, you yourself were tall, scrawny, and generally flat as a board. This had never really bothered you, as despite not having a womanly physique, you were still quite cute, and you had no trouble finding women who were happy to jump into bed with you. After the madness this morning, however, you felt underwhelmed with your appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2udX9qx\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2udX9qx</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discovery of your newfound ability was thrilling, and you could not wait to try it out, however, you had no desire to become your mother. This was no insult to your mom, who you loved dearly, you just weren't ready to trade in your young and adventurous lifestyle for one that was far more middle-aged and domestic. But now that you had had a taste of what things could be like, you simply could not go without. Your mind began wandering towards some of the other women, and what it might be like to look a little more like one of them. While you had mental images of women who had caught your eye throughout the years, there were really only three that truly stood out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Maria Suarez</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had been your best friend growing up. The two of you had been inseparable. You could remember afternoons spent climbing trees, swimming in the lake, and catching lightning bugs, where you and Maria spent hours and hours together without a care in the world. However, as the two of you aged, you began to drift apart. This wasn't because of any sort of falling out, but because your interests had begun to diverge. While the two of you had been outdoorsy and tomboyish during your childhood, puberty had a significant effect on one of you. While you remain generally flat as a board and maintained your tomboy demeanor and dress, Maria began to blossom, both figuratively and literally. During your early teens, you grew up, and Maria grew out. You sprouted up rather quickly to a scrawny and gangly 5'10\". Maria, on the other hand, remained a diminutive 5'2\". What Maria lacked vertically, she gained horizontally, so to speak. Her hips flared out and became big and wide, adjusting her gait from a light and spry amble to a slow, seductive sashay. Not to be outdone, her boobs grew from mere bee stings to heavy, hanging DDs, topped with thick, mocha colored nipples. Maria had always been a bit bashful about her newly voluptuous figure. She tried repeatedly to lose weight, but to no avail. Her mother repeatedly told her not to worry, that it would all pay off in the end, as bearing children would be a breeze with her broad hips. Maria was never deprived of male attention, however, her creeping insecurities caused her to remain single. You had always had a bit of a crush on Maria, but you never knew how to broach the topic. This created an unspoken divide between the two of you, and when you had both gone off to State, your families had expected you to be roommates, however, the two of you mutually decided to branch out and form new friend groups. You didn't regret the decision, but you did occasionally miss Maria. You couldn't imagine possessing Maria's lush curves, which seemed to cause her so much angst over the years, and further, you were troubled by the idea of doing something so manipulative to someone who you cared about so deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2w05kc6\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2w05kc6</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Yuki Suzuki</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Maria, you had little to no history with Yuki. She was a prototypical Asian student, fresh off the boat from Japan. You would describe her as prototypical because she was like so many of the other Asian students at State, whose parents had sent them to the U.S. for an education, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in the process, however, despite this, she was seemingly entirely disinterested in school. While Asians were generally regarded as being highly intelligent, and the winners of the majority of merit-based scholarships at State, there was also a sizable subset who were merely the children of the extraordinarily wealthy throughout Asia, and when they were unable to secure acceptance at Harvard or Stanford, their parents spent countless sums to send them to a mid-tier state school so that they would not have to lose face to their friends back home. Having been rejected by the premier American universities, yet having been rewarded with a new six-figure car, students like Yuki became even more likely to give into the hedonism of American college life in a massive, college town. What made Yuki different than the other wealthy Asian students at State was one specific feature. When she had been moved in to your dorm, you couldn't help but notice that Yuki was far more well-endowed than what you anticipated when you discovered that you were going to be rooming with an Asian girl. And unlike your friend Maria, Yuki was not lush or curvaceous everywhere. In fact, her legs were spindly, just bone and sinew, with absolutely no ass to speak of, and Yuki was waifish and thin, possibly thinner than you. However, Yuki more than made up for it with a set of tits that were truly preposterous. She had become the talk of campus for a set of boobs which defied logic, and which seemed almost comical on a girl her size. While nature would seemingly dictate a B cup at most for Yuki, you knew (having checked her lingerie drawer one night) that Yuki's jugs clocked in at a ludicrous 32N. You had to cover your eyes in the morning as Yuki got ready every morning so that you wouldn't end up in a horny haze all day. The idea of taking the tits on Yuki's stick was certainly something that crossed your mind, however, even you were unsure if you were willing to adopt a look that was so outlandish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2vced4s\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2vced4s</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Tatiana Chernov</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third woman to cross your mind was a true dark horse. She was the only option of the three whom you had never actually spoken to. Instead, you had seen her nearly daily in your dorm building, and every time you laid eyes on her you were immediately drawn in. Tatiana was stunningly beautiful, with soft facial features and alabaster skin as white as the freshly fallen snow. Tatiana was of average height, probably around 5'5\", and had curves that could stop traffic. She had huge tits, which fit her voluptuous frame perfectly, and were only just south of being too big. From her healthy bosom, her waist tapered in (yet remained thick), before flaring out into wide, flowing hips. Tatiana had a plump, round ass which nearly rivaled Maria's. She had the slightest paunch, and subtly thick arms, however, no one would ever call her traditionally fat. She also had thick, kissable lips and reddish, auburn hair. You knew almost nothing about her, except that she lived in your building. Additionally, she was essentially a ghost socially. You never saw her at any of the typical parties, bars, and college life hot spots. Nobody else had any more information than you, as they hardly, if ever, spoke to her. She was known only to come in and out of her room at completely random hours, and beyond that, she was a mystery. You were unsure if the mystery added to the mystique and made a boring girl somewhat exciting, but you would never know unless you made a move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2wfJMY8\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2wfJMY8</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich of your three choices do you pursue first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After much deliberation, you settled on testing your new powers with someone you didn't know. If things didn't go as planned, you weren't risking your relationship with your friend or your roommate. You had almost no experience with this, having accidentally swapped after putting your mom's pants on, and you didn't want to get caught in a compromising situation with someone who you would actually have to deal with. Besides, you were also drawn to Tatiana, possibly more so than either Maria or Yuki, so it clearly made the most sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou packed your bag and headed back to campus, even though it was Saturday, much to the chagrin of your mother, who thought you would be staying through Sunday. Once you dropped your things off in your dorm, you started staking out Tatiana. Luckily, it was the middle of the day on a Saturday, so the majority of the people in your building were out and about. The first thing you did was sit at the end of the hallway where Tatiana's room was to ensure that it was clear. After five minutes had passed, you walked casually down the hall and knocked on Tatiana's door, making sure to quickly move further down the hall and slide in to the common bathroom before she would have been able to open the door had she been inside. From the bathroom, you peered back down the hall and waited another couple minutes to see if Tatiana answered the door. Convinced that she wasn't home, you moved on to the second stage of your plan, which involved gaining access to her room. Luckily, you were friends with the RA on call, Jeff, so you quickly strode over to his room. Despite knowing that you were a lesbian, Jeff was obviously enamored with you, and on this day, you intended to use that to your advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knocked, and Jeff called out, \"who is it?\" When you said it was Cathy, you could hear him nearly fall over himself to get to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up,\" he asked, in a way that was calm, albeit more than a bit forced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, just stuck here on a Saturday,\" you said in a voice that was almost whiny, yet with a sensual undertone. \"I just wanted to hang out.\" And with that, you walked past a flabbergasted Jeff and into his dorm, taking a seat on the small loveseat he often used when he had to have conversations with fellow students. Except this time, you splayed yourself out in a way that made clear this was not a typical student conversation. Ironically, it wasn't until now that you had ever had insecurities about your sexuality. You had always adopted an assertive and domineering posture whenever carnal pleasures were on tap, however, this time, you felt less cocksure, as you became acutely aware of what some may perceive as the physical inadequacies of your gaunt, rail-thin appearance. You thought of the rolling hips and heaving chests of the girls who had been on your mind all morning, and now that those same hips and chests could soon be yours, the meager offerings you had currently simply would not suffice. Fortunately, you were not actually attracted to Jeff in any way, so those feelings were less concerning to you at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent the next ten minutes flirting with Jeff and waiting for an opportunity to get what you had come here for, his RA keycard, which granted him access to every students' dorm room. Eventually, the moment was right. \"Do you want anything to drink?\" Jeff asked, trying to appear suave. You were certain he was referring to alcohol of some sort, however, that wouldn't get him out of the room. Thinking quick, you responded, \"Yeah, sure. I'd love a grape soda.\" You knew there were grape sodas in the vending machine, and it seemed unlikely that Jeff would keep such a random request stocked in his paltry mini-fridge. Luckily, you intuition was correct. \"Well, I don't have any, but I'll grab you one from the vending machine. One of the perks of being an RA is that we are given an allowance for sundries to use for student conversations. I think this certainly qualifies as a conversation...\" he stammered awkwardly. You forced a devilish smile back, and he stepped out of the room, leaving you alone. You acted quickly, and swiped his keycard from its perch on his nightstand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited for Jeff to return, drank the grape soda, and chatted just long enough that he wouldn't think anything was up when you stood up to leave. You smiled and waved as you walked back down the hall towards Tatiana's room, with Jeff's master keycard stuffed into your pocket. You knocked and hid again, to be certain that Tatiana had not returned while you were with Jeff. Once you were certain that the coast was clear, you made your move, swiping the keycard, and stepping across the threshold into Tatiana's empty room. Once you closed the door behind you, you felt an unexpected feeling of relaxation wash over you. You made it. You were shocked at how industrious you had been, and as your reward, here you were. The first thing you noticed was that there was only one person living in this room. Where the second bed would have been was a white leather couch, which you promptly sat down on. The rest of the room was decorated in dark, muted colors, and was well organized. While you wanted to lounge around all afternoon, you knew you had a mission to complete, so you pulled yourself back to your feet and stepped over to Tatiana's dresser. You opened a couple drawers until you found what you were looking for: her lingerie collection. You quickly scanned your options, and were drawn immediately to a stunning white set, with bra, thong, and garters, which you had to imagine would have looked stunning on someone like Tatiana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you picked up the bra, with your hands trembling as you ran your fingers across the floral pattern stitched on each capacious cup. Did you immediately try it on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stopped feeling around your new curves as your mother entered. She glanced at you, then away, then back at you, her mouth wide open. You realized quickly she was taking in your changes. She had to look down at you now, something that hadn't happened since your growth spurt during puberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" you started, standing there awkwardly with your newly diminished height and enormous ass and hips. \"What's happening?\" There was some fear in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Cathy,\" she went to hug you when you both saw that she too had some changes. Her lower half now resembled what yours once had. Her legs were longer, leaner, her ass no longer gigantic, her hips far less wide. She had also gotten your height. Her clothes had morphed to adjust, too. Her upper half, though, was still pudgy, and only her belly having decreased just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm sorry, I didn't-\" you started to stammer, trying to cross your arms and place your hands on your huge hips at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dear, it's not your fault. Come, let me explain,\" she stepped as awkwardly as you did unadjusted to her new shape as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious to you that by putting on your mom's pants you had swapped lower halves with her. It was also obvious your mom was fully aware of what just just happened. You bumped your hips into the door frame, then the table, then the couch as your mom lead you to the living room. Walking was strange to you now. Your center of gravity had shifted, your stride had shortened, and your whole lower half wobbling was a new and, given your past desires, strangely appealing sensation. Gaining a little bit of tummy weight from college snacking could not have prepared you for what it would be like to truly expand like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat,\" your mom said, speaking in her soft, calming motherly voice. You complied. The couch went down further than you remembered. You had another moment of panic as you realized your legs just barely touched the floor. But, as with having your hips and ass bump into everything when you walked or turned, there was that sense of excitement about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cathy, our family has a secret. We're not the only ones, but the rules are different for everyone and even for each generation. You see, at least one child of each generation in our family has a . . . gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is a giant ass a gift?\" you asked with a smirk. Your mom continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can change parts of our bodies. Sometimes it's taking from others, or swapping with them, but it's different every time. I can already tell what your gift is. When you wear another's clothing you will get their traits and the other person yours. As you can see,\" she motioned to her now taller figure and lean legs. \"It looks like its linked to what piece of clothing it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I have your lower half but still my upper half?\" you said. It was a lot to take in. But then, the proof was right here. There was no denying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom patted her belly, \"Looks like it. Cathy, you're taking this awfully well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged, not knowing exactly what to say. \"It's just so much to take in. It's not so bad, mom.\" You were afraid to ask if you could change back. You ran your hands along your hips as you leaned back, looking at your mom with an expression that said 'What can you do, right?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can probably-hopefully-get your figure back by just wearing some of my clothes now. They probably all changed to match my new figure so you'll have to do some wiggling to fit into them. I'm sorry this is how you found out,\" she looked like she really felt bad, too. Of course she would, you thought. Most young college-age former gymnasts would be devastated by a transformation like this. Cathy's initial panic had already turned to curiosity, if not acceptance or joy. Your thoughts raced. You wanted to see what you looked like. You wanted to see what it felt like to walk up stairs like this. You wanted to examine every inch of your new wide hips and see if your ass really did stick out as absurdly far as it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter years of enjoying it when your females friends put on weight, as rare as that was given your athletic company, you rarely dared to imagine yourself getting fat. You would often imagine how awkward and embarrassing it was for your friends if they were to blow up, though. It was a guilty pleasure that you indulged in more and more in college. You didn't even notice until you had put on some weight at college until Yuki accidentally pointed it out. You and were about to go out to get some food. This was just before you had come out to her about liking heavier women and she had come out to you about being a lesbian. She had instinctively reached over and pulled your t-shirt down. It had come down over your belly, which had started bulging over your jeans. She apologized when she realized she had unintentionally called attention to your softened tummy. But you just blushed and stammered out that you didn't mind. It was quite embarrassing for you. It was also intensely erotic. You had been imagining more and more the thought of thin little Yuki gaining weight for a while now that you were unprepared for the intense feelings over that same thin little Yuki pointing out you had gained weight. You tried for weeks after to get Yuki to comment on your weight in some offhand way but, being slim and self-conscious about staying slim as she was, she stayed away from the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it occurred to her, \"Mom, um, how am I going to explain this? I'll be twice as wide when I go back to school on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey,\" your mom reached over and hugged you, clearly interpreting the comment as one of fear and humiliation, rather than simple curiosity. \"You should be able to get your body back just by wearing my pants, like I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about this as you shifted your weight to adjust how your thighs were crammed together.</span></div></div>",

You are generally a pretty average guy. You\u2019re 5\u201910\u201d, 160 pounds, and of average build. You get above average grades with a little extra work and you have part time job where you work weekends in the campus bookstore. Simon has preference for larger, curvier girls and skinny girls getting bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther characters<br>\r\n<b>Kim</b> is your roommate. She\u2019s 21-year-old studying finance and work part time as a bartender. The two of you didn\u2019t know each other before rooming together but the two of you have since become friends and get along great. She is cute, standing at 5\u20196\u201d and 125 pounds. She exercises often to keep fit, but still sports a toned bubble butt and perky C cups. You would be lying if you said you didn\u2019t have a little bit of a crush on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Patricia</b> is Kim\u2019s best friend. She\u2019s 21 years old and in general studies and bartends with Kim. Unlike Kim, she is rather short at 5\u20192\u201d. She tends to be lazy and as such is more on the chubby side at 180 pounds and definitely more pear-shaped though she does have some nice D cups. Blonde and blue eyed, Patricia is sometimes a little na\u00efve and almost ditzy, but she is a genuinely nice girl. You two are friends as she often spends her own free time hanging out with Kim at your apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lisa</b> is your fellow employee and supervisor at the campus bookstore. She is a 20-year-old studying in liberal arts. Proud and sometimes a little snobby, Lisa is used to getting what she wants. She is smart and dedicated. She can be mean but doesn\u2019t usually intend to do so. She is 5\u20195\u201d and 165 pounds making her just a little chubby. Most of her weight sits on her round tummy and large DD cups while her butt is still rather big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ted</b> is a friend of yours. He is 20 years old and studying engineering as well and the two of you share a few classes. The two of you get along well enough but both have your own interests and never hang out much. He is taller than you at 6\u20192\u201d and is a quite a bit more muscular than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to add more characters and I will try to keep this page updated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story you, Simon, will encounter items, people, or events that will to you and/or your friends changing, sometimes of your own will and sometimes against it. This story will focus mostly on male to female transformation, weight gain, and female expansion. Have fun! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does your story start?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had accidentally forgotten your jacket in your dorm and were shivering as you stepped into the relief of the heated building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just, uh, just browsing...\" you replied as you looked around the store. You weren't even sure what kind of shop you had wandered into. You hadn't looked at the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire shop looked like someone's garage, with random objects all over the place in strange locations. The best you describe it, you had entered a pawn shop or a thrift store with anything you could imagine for sale. From clothes to rather obscure objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady who had greeted you folded her arms as you warmed yourself next to the heater near the front of the store. She was a rather overweight woman with long brown hair who enjoyed exposing the cleavage of her large breasts to the world. You had to avert your eyes so you wouldn't be caught staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a sale on clothing,\" she said, leaning over the counter. \"Half off on any outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Cool...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's some new things in the electronic section!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat...\" you muttered, trying to get as far away from her as possible, if only to avoid the awkwardness of looking at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, while you were waiting in the store to warm up, you could at least look at some of the things she had for sale. It looked like she had some cool things out and it would kill some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to check out...</span></div></div>",

You headed over to the clothing section of the store, which amounted to a few racks in the very back. It didn't take long for you to make a realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are all chick clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't just clothes for women either, but large women. You looked through the rack briefly and found that all the shirts came in XL plus sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised at just how wide the variety was for the styles. Normally, most big girl outfits you had seen were limited to only a handful of basic styles. A larger girl must have come in and dumped her entire wardrobe on the shopkeeper. In fact, judging by the owner's weight, you wouldn't be surprised if they all belonged to her and she was just trying to get rid of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you had no reason to buy any of these clothes, as they weren't for you, you found yourself mysteriously drawn to the outfits. Maybe you could find something of use for your roommate to get on her good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked for...</span></div></div>",

There were loads more clothes you could see any normal girl wearing in an every day situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could use one of those...What do you call them? Cowls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, you found exactly what you were looking for. Your fingers touched a rather soft material belonging to a tan jacket-like piece of clothing. It had black poke-a-dots and looked like something she would wear.

The overweight shopkeeper and crept from behind the counter right up to your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! Yeah!\" You shouted between deep breaths. \"I mean, yeah. Yeah, what's this, uh, cowl cost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, an excellent choice. It suits your perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, no, no. It's not for me. I'm not a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? What does that matter? It doesn't in this store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see,\" the woman had a coy look in her eyes. \"I'll let you have it for free. You know where to find me when you want to explore more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, whatever,\" you replied. \"Thank though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tucked the cowl into your arms and made your way out of the store, after feeling more than a little bit awkward with your encounter with the shopkeeper. Unfortunately, the moment you stepped outside the door you realized why you had entered the thrift store in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering, you quickened your pace along the sidewalk back to your dorm. For just a moment you glanced down at the cowl you had been given and considered putting it on. Even though it was girly, it was better than nothing. And there was no one around to laugh at you, everyone was inside to hide from the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you give in to the cold?</span></div></div>",

Your normally brown short hair burned and you absentmindedly scratched at it. As you did, it turned fiery red in color and lengthened, draping down over your shoulders. It curled with every inch it grew, until to the outside world it looked as though you were wearing a wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not notice the change, however, until you arrived back at your dorm. Kim was still in class leaving you alone in the small apartment. You passed by a mirror and noticed a flash of scarlet out of the corner of your eye. You did a double take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides now being a redhead, your hair was like woman's hair, long and conditioned. You felt the softness of it as you ran your fingers through it in disbelief. Your eyes turned to the polka dot jacket you were wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It couldn't be...\" you said, thinking the jacket was the cause after recalling what the shopkeeper had told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wasted no time in removing the clothing. As soon as you did, you red hair faded away into your usual brown. Staring in awe at yourself, you watched as your hair turned completely back to normal.

You waited for a few minutes to hear the voice again, but it never spoke. You sighed and towered over the discarded jacket. It went against your better judgement, wearing a hair-changing jacket, but you were curious. There was something magical about all this and you were eager to learn what was going on, if only to prove you weren't crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the mirror as you reequipped the female attire again. This time, you could watch your hair morph and grow before your eyes. Your mouth dropped as your hair reddened and curled, until it looked just like a woman's style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your reflection in the mirror moved on its own. You shrieked and fell backwards on the floor as it tried to calm you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" your reflection said. \"I didn't mean to scare you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you!? Are you a ghost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, kind of,\" the reflection replied. \"I was a person once, I remember that much. My name is Abby. What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice of the spirit was kind, even if it looked like you with red hair in the mirror. Knowing that it had a name though calmed you down. This wasn't like something out of a horror movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure to meet you, Simon,\" Abby winked at you. \"You seem like the kind of guy I would date if I was still alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes. About that. What happened, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby rolled her eyes. \"Long story short, my sister is a witch and cursed me because I have too many clothes. Now I'm forced to be a spirit trapped in my many outfits until someone wears me and I can become conscious again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recalled the shopkeeper had red hair as well. \"How long have you been like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, twenty years? The last person who tried on my clothes ran away screaming when I revealed myself and burned the dress they were wearing. I tried to be a little slower with the reveal with you, but that failed. Whoops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a little clumsy aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reflection pouted. \"Well forgive me for being tactless after being trapped in a void for two decades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair point. What do you want from me then? And why does my hair change when I wear the jacket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, my spirit is in the clothing itself. When you wear one of my clothes, a little part of me seeps out into your body. Because my spirit is so divided, it only affects a small portion of you at a time. That's why you can see me and that's why your hair changed. That's MY hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" you patted your red frizzles. \"You have nice hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're sweet. I knew I liked you. Anyway, I can only take physical form while someone is wearing my clothes. What I want is a body that can be my host. The longer you wear my jacket, the more of me comes out. I want my body back then I want revenge on my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" Abby leaned in close to you and batted her eyes. \"You're a really cute guy. I don't want to steal your body, but you're the only one who actually had a conversation with me in the last twenty years. Can you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Abby person sounded really nice, if a bit dense and a bit clothing crazy. You wanted to help her, but the thought of actually becoming her wasn't too appealing. On the other hand, it didn't have to be you playing host. If you explained things to Kim, she might understand and be willing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided...</span></div></div>",

Despite the looming fact that you were going to be sharing a body with her, she was good company during the work.

Every passing second made you drop another inch in height. You found yourself disappeared into your now much too big clothes as you had to crane your neck up to keep eye contact with Kim, who looked amused with your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process wasn't painful, in fact it was almost like a massage. But shrinking in front of Kim was embarrassing. You blushed and tried to look away. You hadn't realized Abby was such a short girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the process stopped when you were just under five feet tall, having dropped nearly a foot in height from 5'10. Kim, who was 5'6, now towered over you. You came up below her chin level, something which she immensely enjoyed.

The only thing that still fit well was Abby's jacket, which now covered your arms completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" you muttered. \"But I need to keep the jacket on to help Abby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You should be fine to take it off for a few seconds to put on clothes,\"</i> the ghost announced. <i>\"I can keep you in this form for that time.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Nevermind.

If you're going to be a host to this ghosty, you're going to have to get used to wearing clothing. Come on! It will be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was one good thing about this mess, it was the fact that Kim seemed to be enjoying herself. You shuddered to think the kind of clothes Patricia would leave behind in Kim's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim managed to dig up...</span></div></div>",

I want to see my handy work!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just see for yourself?\" you asked as you blinked yourself awake and sat up in the bed. You realized that your voice was still deep and normal. That made you dread looking into the wall mirror at the wall of your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nope! I can only see what you do through your eyes.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creepy,\" you muttered back as you crawl out of your sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had spent the night sleeping in Addy's jacket, in addition to the clothes you had borrowed from Patricia. She was a larger girl and slightly taller than you now, so most of them were loose on your shrunken form. It was still sobering to think that a girl who was normally shorter than you would now be gigantic in your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling up a chair to stand on and reach the mirror, you hoisted yourself up to get a look at the damage. Instead of your usual mug, complete with scruffy beard and big nose, you were greeted by a squat but pretty face. You now had big lips and a much smaller nose. Your cheeks were much larger and puffy with fat. Below your mouth, which was wide open with wonder, you saw the beginning of a double chin. Despite your manish body, you looked completely like a woman from the neck up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's better,\"</i> said Abby. <i>\"It's so nice to see my face again.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow,\" you said, at a loss for words. \"You're pretty...cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, Abby laughed. <i>\"Did you think that I was an ugly girl?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No...Never mind. Forget I said anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, what are you waiting for? Wake Kim up! I can't wait to hear her reaction!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Kim was very pleased with your progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squealed with joy upon seeing you and immediately had you sit down so she could put makeup on you. You tried to resist but Abby insisted, forcing you to go along with their games. Their argument was that they wanted to do everything they could to make sure no one would recognize you, though you knew deep down they just wanted to make you look pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my classes?\" you asked. \"They're going to notice if I'm gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You overestimate college professors too much,\" replied Kim as she applied lipstick to you. \"The only thing they care about is you doing the homework and passing the exam. So long as you're attending the class, you're good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I doing this again?\" you turned the question to Abby. \"I get you want a body, but how is that going to help you get even with your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, I'm a witch too, silly.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Of course. My plan is to get a body and confront her, catching her by surprise. But I need to be fully physical to achieve enough power.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeated Abby's announcement to Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" replied your roommate. \"Maybe we should look into getting more clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we want that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To speed up your process,\" Kim folded her arms. \"I have a hunch, the more of Abby's clothes you wear, the quicker we can get this over with. There is another idea I had too. What would happen if someone else were to wear Abby's clothes while you're transforming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why, there would be two of me,\"</i> Abby answered. You gave her reply to Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what if I were to join you, Simon? That way we can gang up on her sister and win for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, I love that idea!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" you muttered. \"Isn't one possessed person enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim shrugged. \"I'll go to the shop after class, regardless. You shouldn't go in or her sister might recognize you. I'll buy a bunch of her clothes so we can, at least, have them here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Sounds like a plan, I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I join in, Simon? I know this can't be fun for you and I'm curious to see what it's like. You could use all the help you can get if we're taking on a witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile that was true, you didn't want to endanger Kim at all. Getting more clothes to speed up your transformation into Abby sounded like a good idea, but you weren't sure about involving Kim in the process. You decided to...</span></div></div>",

We need someone she doesn't suspect on the outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make much sense to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trust me,\" you assured. \"I'll be fine like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Kim put on the finishing touches of your makeup and held up a mirror for you to see. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bizarre to look at your reflection and see someone you didn't expect staring back at you. The woman you saw, while man-shaped, had a very pretty face. You blinked a few times just to confirm it was still you in the mirror. You looked beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad,\" you said. \"What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class, of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool was awkward with you trying to hide behind Kim whenever possible. Thankfully, she didn't have any of her friends in this class and you didn't interact with anyone. No one seemed to notice you and were too focused with their own work which was fine by you. You were still adjusting to Patricia's clothes, which smelled like her flowery deodorant. It made it hard to take notes for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class, it was around noon and everyone was breaking out to get food. You waited in the mess of people for Kim when Abby spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Opp, hang on. You're ready for another change.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here?\" you whispered back. \"In the middle of a crowd? Someone will notice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no stopping her though. This time, you felt a tingle in your hands and toes. You looked down just in time to see your fingers become slender and shrink to a petite size. No longer did they look clumsy and bulky, but soft and gentle. You wiggled your toes a few times and discovered that you now had a lot of room in your borrowed shoes. Your feet had also shrunk a few sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Aw, lame! I was hoping I'd get my girls back.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My boobs, Simon. I hope you like big breasts, because I'm double D's.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at your currently flat chest and blushed. Though you didn't want to admit it, that was one thing you were looking forward to, being a lover of larger women. Abby was starting to sound like your ideal woman. It was just a shame you had to experience that body for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of waiting, shuffling around in your now much-too-big shoes, Kim arrived completely out of breath with clothes in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here!\" she tossed the outfit in your delicate arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to skip out on class early and run there,\" she said between mouthfuls of air. \"I picked something simple out so even you shouldn't have trouble with it, Simon. The lady gave me a few odd looks when I bought the whole wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim had bought a new grey jacket with a light colored dress. As she said, the outfit was simple enough that you could figure out how to wear it.

You might not want to get caught in her shirt and skirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I wear this stuff, I'll only change faster,\" you argued, recalling Abby's comment on her breasts. \"What if I change in the middle of hanging out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You give Patricia too much credit. That girl won't notice anything, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't assuring, given what Kim had just said about Patricia's clothes. Without the new clothes, it didn't sound like Abby would be able to change you again until later in the day. With and there was no telling how quick the process would be.</span></div></div>",

I'll meet you in the lunchroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, it's so nice to have more of my clothes again. Kim has a good taste in fashion, but nothing beats my own wardrobe.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby hadn't shut up since you had slipped into the clothes Kim had brought you. What made matters worse was there was a lot of space to grow in the folds of the dress, especially in the chest area. You gulped at the thought of the plenty of growing you'd have to do to fill those shoes. At least the dress fit you a lot better than Patricia's clothes, which were large as well as tall on your diminutive state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the lunchroom, you continued to keep to yourself. No one bothered you, though you did find yourself being blocked by people much taller than you more often. Abby continued to backseat drive you as you navigated to the table where you saw Kim, shouting at your to push your way through people's legs and knock over trays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached Kim's table, you found her talking with Patricia, as per usual. Patricia was definitely a big girl with blonde hair, though she was usually nice around you. You suspected that was because she might have had a crush on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Abby,\" greeted Kim. \"Pat, this is an old friend from high school. She's here for a visit for a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, you could tell something was off by the way Patricia greeted you. \"Hey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on your best impression of Abby, which surprisingly didn't come out too badly. \"Hello! Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A redhead, huh?\" Patricia asked. \"That doesn't look too natural. Do you dye it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dye it?\"</i> asked the real Abby in your head.<i> \"I already don't like this bitch.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No,\" you replied. \"I have an Irish heritage...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I'd buy that. You don't have any freckles,\" Patricia turned to Kim. \"There are so many fake redheads these days. Everyone wants to dye their hair to fit in. I'm glad I'm a natural blonde.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim laughed nervously and stood up. \"I need a refill. Be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begged with your eyes for Kim to come back. It took a deep breath to get you to turn around and face Patricia. An air of hostility radiated from her and you felt her size you up with her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Patricia spoke at last. \"You know Kim from high school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh, yeah. We haven't talked in awhile, but I was in the area and thought it might be nice to catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" Patricia completely glazed over your reply. \"Do you have a boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Do I want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a boyfriend? I mean, a pretty girl like you must have a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame. Looks aren't everything then, eh? It probably doesn't help to be flatchested, does it? I mean, I get all the guys hitting on me for my girls. Men don't want bones, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, you bitch,\"</i> Abby shrieked in your head. <i>\"I'll show you!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could stop Abby, you felt the tingling of transformation running down your body.

You looked down and found that the once loose dress you had been wearing stretched outwards to accommodate the giant slabs of meat below your neck. You were staring into a beautiful canyon of cleavage, when it dawned on you that these were your own breasts. From your perspective they looked gigantic and you wagered that they had to be a size DD, at the very least if not bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head moved on its own and stared right at Patricia, who was looking at you with her mouth agape. A sly grin formed on your face, as you discovered you were no longer in control of your own body, if this was even your own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's flat chested now, bitch?\" a voice came out of your throat. But it wasn't your own masculine voice. This was Abby's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!?\" shouted Patricia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Kim had returned from refilling her drink. She must have processed exactly what had happened in an instant and immediately came to your aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Patty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fucking friend,\" Patricia shrieked at the top of her lungs, attracting the attention of nearly everyone in the lunchroom. \"She just...She just fucking grew breasts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found that you had control of your body again and could respond. \"I...I don't know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Patty,\" added Kim. \"Abby has always been on the larger side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck you two,\" responded the hysterical blonde. She began looking around the table. \"This is a prank, right? You have cameras on me somewhere and seeing how I react before putting it on YouTube?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're being ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not!\" Patricia stood up from her seat when she couldn't find any hidden cameras. All eyes in the lunchroom were on her. \"If you two want a giggle at my expense, you can both go fuck yourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then got up and left the two of you to finish your meals in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that went well,\" you said when you both had returned to your dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I forgot to mention that Patricia gets that way around girls she considers a threat. She's always been on the hefty side, so whenever she feels 'threatened' by a new girl, she gives them a hard time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Whatever,\"</i> Abby said in your head. <i>\"She's a cunt. I never want to see her again, if I can help it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou folded your arms over your new breasts. After the initial shock of growing two massive boobs, you had been enjoying the opportunity to touch them at any given chance without Abby noticing. Walking had become a completely different experience, as every step yo made caused them to bounce and send ripples of a new sensation throughout your body. It didn't help that you had gone bra less, of course, which earned you a few stares from people as you had returned home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, Abby,\" you said to the mirror with Kim standing next to you. \"I'm not so mad that you made me grow breasts, that was part of the agreement after all. But for a moment back there I wasn't in control of my body. The time you called Patricia a bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim raised her eyes in surprise as Abby stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I...I don't know what you're talking about.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb with me or I'll take these clothes off right now. I agreed to be your host but I never agreed to surrender complete control of myself to you. What's the deal? Can you do that at any time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were glad you were asking this in front of Kim. If your suspicions were true, it was good to have her on back up in chance Abby went rogue.

Honestly, if I hadn't met people like you I would have gone crazy--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get to the point,\" you interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, when you spoke it wasn't internally like it had been for Abby. It was your own mouth that moved and said the words, in your own voice. Even Kim heard you, though she jumped back in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your throat clear as Abby began again. \"Anyway, as I was saying, we're sharing a body so it makes sense that we will alternate control of said body. But even though it will look more and more like me, it's still Simon's body. If he ever wanted control over it, no matter what I wanted, he would have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good. Right, Simon?\" Kim asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrific,\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, I can only assume control when Simon specifically lets me or if I feel a very powerful emotion. But, no matter what, if Simon willed it he could have complete control. I am a guest here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyway you could take complete control?\" asked Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if Simon had his soul removed, and that would take some serious black magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts turned to Abby's sister, the shopkeeper at the junk store. She seemed kind enough when you had entered the store, but looks were always deceiving. Abby was making it sound out to believe that she had been the victim of said black magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" continued Abby. \"The fact that I can control this body means we can actually start practicing magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" said Kim. \"And it's Saturday tomorrow, so we have the whole day to ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we can begin tonight,\" added Abby. \"Your choice, Simon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave it a lot of thought. On one hand, the sooner you could master whatever magics Abby had in mind, the sooner you could be rid of her. On the other, today had been a very long day. Despite it only being in the afternoon, you were drained. Perhaps it was because of all the transforming your body had undergoing lately. The thought reminded you that you were starving, despite just eating lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

But then we gotta at something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby laughed and rubbed your belly. \"I could agree with that. Let's get started then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I join in?\" asked Kim. \"I mean, I don't think it will accomplish much. But I'm curious to see how this sort of thing works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! And don't say that. You're both beginners, so you're on equal grounds as far as I'm concerned. Let's make a space for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby moved your body into the living room of your apartment, which amounted to little more than a couch and a television. Of course, you had insisted on having the most up to date consoles on display to play. You felt Abby eye the video games questionably before shrugging. She probably hadn't ever seen such things before, being trapped for twenty years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving her move around for you was somewhat relaxing. It was a bit like being the passenger in a car, sitting back and relaxing while someone else drove around for you. But you could still feel everything Abby touched, especially your breasts bouncing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of moving the couch to make room to sit on the floor, Abby brought your body down crossed legged. Kim joined you both on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Abby began. \"Normally, you're supposed to begin with stuff like levitating or making fireballs. But that stuff is boring and I don't think you want to put out a fire in your dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let's do something that's both fun and harmless. Well, it will be for one of you, at least. Transference!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby grabbed a notebook and pen on the floor, which had been under the couch, and flipped open to the first clean page. You let her draw what looked to be a crude human being. She then drew a few arrows around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem, the fundamentals of magic is actually closer to real science than you might think. It's about balance and exchanges. You can't just create something from nothing. It has to come from somewhere. The magic part is the alteration or the transference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drew another crappy humanoid next to the first one, then a few arrows pointed to and from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transference is the easiest sort of spellcasting because your materials are already there. You don't have to envision what you're altering because you can see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense,\" said Kim. \"But how do we actually do the spellcasting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple! With runes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby turned to the next page and began to scribe something in a language you didn't understand. They looked like letters in some long dead language, less like words and more like symbols. She finished off the artwork with a gigantic character in the middle of all the other words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you get good, you can cast the spells through words alone. But for basics, every witch needs to use runes. This is a fun little game I invented. It's like tug-of-war. I want you both to touch the paper with one hand and then hold hands with your other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby gave you control again so you could do as commanded. You had to marvel at just how small your hands were now in comparison to Kim's. Only by touching her did you realize how soft your skin had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you're going to take each other's mass at the same time,\" continued Abby. \"The runes I drew out will allow you do to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means when you both cast the spell, one of you is going to lose their mass and shrink and the other is going to absorb that mass and grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Couldn't you do this in a more normal way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could. But this is more fun. It's all in good spirits, Simon. We can do this another way, if you really want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Simon,\" begged Kim. \"I want to see how this works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't resist the look she was giving you. \"Ugh, fine. How do we start this then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you need say the initiation word and focus. You're going to want to imagine the most perfect circle you can in your head, then envision yourself falling endlessly within it. That's what always works for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds a little bit like mediation,\" Kim pondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In some ways. Anyway, on the count of three say the words, Bus'Hominum Massa. One, two, three...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby spoke so quickly that she barely gave the two of you enough time to prepare yourself. You both shouted. \"<i>Bus'Hominum Massa!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, you felt a tugging coming from Kim's hand. By her reaction, you could see that she was feeling it too. As your clothes loosened, you realized what was happening to you and you followed Abby's advice. You focused your mind and pulled back, earning you some mass. The game had begun.</span></div></div>",

But your concentration was broken when Abby spoke within your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Damn, she's really good.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the briefest of moments you turned your attention to Kim. As soon as you made that mistake, it was all over. You felt yourself literally get drained as Kim grew before your eyes. She swelled both upwards and outwards, gaining both height and a little chub around her breasts and belly. Conversely, you could see your own eye level dwindle down. The once comfortable dress you had been wearing was now slipping from your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor just a moment, you removed your hand from the book and pulled up your clothing. Kim took full advantage of that and sapped another few inches from you. Try as you might, you could focus yourself to win back your lost mass. With around nine inches of height lost, Kim was looking more and more like a giant in your eyes. Even her breasts were getting bigger from your stolen mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Abby with your voice. \"I think we have a winner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim opened her eyes and gawked at you. \"Holy crap, Simon! I felt I was winning, but I didn't think by that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stood up to compare in heights. Kim was now standing at an impression size of 6'3, with her loose fitting hoodie and sweat pants now stretched to the maximum, revealing her wrists and ankles. Her breasts had definitely swollen in cup size. You heard her bra strain as she groped herself, feeling her goods. Her hips were wider and her stomach looked softer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your end, you felt small and diminutive like a child. Even your breasts had shrunk a little bit, which was a shame because they were the only thing holding up your dress. You stood at around 4'3. With Kim's new height and your stunted state, you found you had to look up at her to even see her face. She got closer to you, as you saw you were at eye level with her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, she patted you on the head. \"Wow. Simon, you look so tiny! Everything does from up here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hang on, Simon,\"</i> Abby said in your head. <i>\"I'll bring you back up to my height.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tingling spread throughout the tips of your fingers as you felt yourself slowly inch your way up. Your eye level was rising along Kim's body. At first, you hoped you might keep going up to her eye level, but you stopped right in front of her two massive breasts. A quick measuring yourself and you realized you were back at the diminutive height of 4'11.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can grow me at any time?\" you asked. \"Why not bring me back to my normal height then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't work that way,\" Abby explained, using your body to talk. \"For one, I'm limited with my powers to my own body shape and size. Also, the mass has to come from somewhere. I'm using your old body's mass to bring us back to size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you shrunk my real body!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. You're probably in the lower five feet now if you took off all my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fix it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can. Just ask Kim for your mass back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at your gigantic roommate and had to admit that she looked really hot at over six feet tall. Secretly, you had always dreamed of making her bigger. Just not like this. You sighed...</span></div></div>",

Getting taller than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing Kim playing around with herself with starting to give you an erection. In secret, the reason you wanted to keep her at that size was because she looked damn good bigger and better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" continued your roommate. \"I wouldn't mind learning more magic, especially stuff like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you have no better teacher!\" said Abby. \"Transference of size is my specialty! Speaking of which, Simon, you might want to get ready. I feel another change coming on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Abby gave you almost no warning as the tingles spread throughout your body. That feeling evolved into a shudder throughout your whole body. Then you felt heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight hiss could be heard throughout the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you watched as your entire body started to swell with fat. It wasn't just our breasts or stomach either. Everything, from your fingers to your thighs, was getting bigger and softer. You yelped and felt up and down your body for your expanding horizons. There was an especially heavy focus on your butt. In your head, Abby laughed at your reaction though it might have also been because of your throbbing member at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like someone had connected you to a hose and started pumping. The once loose dress you had been wearing all day had suddenly become form fitting. The belt strapped around your waist was now tight and cutting into your flesh. Most of all, you felt much warmer and cuddlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God,\" said Kim, still standing over you. \"Are you completely Abby now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudying yourself, you were greeted by two balls of fatty flesh. Beyond them was the body of a rather portly young woman with plenty of weight on her chest and a large waist size. From your perspective, you looked like a whale. But you imagined to another outsider you would look appear to be a girl who was a little thick. In truth, your perfect woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" replied Abby. \"He's missing two things. One is my voice, the other...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's eyes glanced down to the slight bulge underneath the skirt of the dress before averting her eyes. \"Ah! Oh...Dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to cover up your erection with your fat legs. Your face matched Kim's own blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless,\" continued Abby. \"It's good to be almost perfect. By tomorrow, Simon will be a perfect clone of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then we can practice more magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea! We need a battle plan to take down my sister. We'll meet tomorrow, troops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim saluted in a silly manner as she went to go move the couch back. You excused yourself from the living room and returned to your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had privacy again from Kim, you waddled over to the mirror to get a better look at yourself. The person staring back at you was just a fatter version of the girl you had been used to gawking at whenever you saw your reflection. You looked exactly how you envisioned Abby, except for one detail. Blush still reddened your face as you gazed down at your prodding manhood. The dressed was like a pitched tent, you were so turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a couple of days since you had taken care of yourself after having Abby in your body. You didn't want to gross her out. But now more than ever did you need to take care of business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby kept quiet in your head. Perhaps she wouldn't notice if you closed your eyes. Would you risk it?</span></div></div>",

You couldn't take it anymore. You got up to lock your bedroom door. Abby became sentient to you actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh. We're doing this now, huh?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt your right hand move on its own. Your legs brought you to the bed and you laid down, taking in the view from the mirror. Abby lifted up the skirt of your dress and moved your hand down into your underwear. You had still worn your boyish briefs, not wanting to borrow Kim's panties yet. She reached inside the elastic and grabbed hold of your raging erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your hands, it felt so foreign. This was not your usual palm grasping hold to choke out a quickie while Kim was in class. This was a woman's hand grabbing hold and gently stroking it to get you started. It was all you could do to not explode in her fingers. Abby seemed to know exactly what she was doing, working your hand up and down. She was slow at first, teasing and taunting you with the explosion of pleasure that awaited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked her magic, your member started to feel smaller in your hands. Originally, it was huge within your tiny girlish fingers but now it felt like it was shrinking. You definitely weren't losing your erection, your breathing gave that away. But something was off. You were at least an inch shorter than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Give me control,\"</i> whispered Abby. <i>\"I'll take good care of you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure who was in control of your hand anymore as the speed of your rubbing increased. The faster you went, the smaller your penis became. But the impending orgasm still urged you to continue despite the wrongness of the situation. Soon, your member couldn't even fit in the palm of your hand. You could pleasure yourself with your fingers. The more you shrunk, the stronger the rush. Then, in an instant, you moaned as a moistness covered your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it...Don't stop...\" you cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was longer than any orgasm you had ever experienced. You kept going as your manhood receded into your crotch, giving way to a deep hole. You tried to pull it out, but were met with a wetness covering your fingertips. You had a vagina now and Abby wasn't stopping. In fact, she increased the speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new organs buzzed with activity as your toes curled. Your spine twitched and curled as you rolled onto the bed, biting your lips to hold in the moan. This was the most intense sexual experience you had ever received. And Abby didn't stop. She played with the soft patch of tender skin right at the top of your clit, massaging it and tickling your nervous system. You spasmed on the sheets several times arcing your back with every wave of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're mine now...\" said Abby using your body to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't think, your mind was so intoxicated with new hormones. Everything went foggy and you felt yourself getting drowsy, despite Abby controlling your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came to again, it was morning and...</span></div></div>",

Despite the matted hair and caked makeup, Abby was still a very good looking girl and just your type. \"It was awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good! There's more where that came from, big boy.

It's like me with math, Simon. This stuff just clicks. I can feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby laughed and spoke for you. \"I'm barely a master myself. My sister was the real one gifted. But I can teach you the basics, on the condition that you go out and get me my wardrobe. And maybe a few bras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do!\" Kim grabbed her things and practically stumbled out of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a 48 G by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until lunch did Kim return from her mini shopping spree. She must have run all the way to the local strip mall and back, where the thrift store was located. You were sitting in your towel still, wearing Abby's old jacket so you wouldn't revert to normal before Kim arrived. She had dropped almost two hundred dollars on new clothes for both her and Abby. You offered to pay her back, but she refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the cost for learning magic and I'm willing to pay it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim had bought two bags worth of Abby's old clothes, as well as some random objects from the store so she wouldn't raise suspicion from Abby's sister. She had also assembled an outfit that would fit on her new 6'3 self, which was nothing more than a simple jeans and sweater combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor yourself, you stuck to what looked to be the most comfy out of all Abby's clothes for around the apartment, her pajamas. You donned an ancient looking Lord of the Ring T-Shirt from when the books were popular, as well as a pair of fuzzy pants for lodging. With a little help from Abby, you donned the new bra and panties. You had to admit it was a great relief off your shoulders to give your breasts some support.

She must have forgotten about me after all these years, letting Kim walk out with so much of my wardrobe. I'll bet she doesn't even remember which stuff is mine, the bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Kim interrupted her rant. \"I want to learn more about Transference. I mean, does is it only limited to total mass? Can you focus on which parts of the entities you want to transfer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, though it's slightly complex. You just need to be specific in the runes. They act as the directions. Your voice then activates the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of like programming, in a way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way. I just of something fun we can do to give you a better example.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" you raised a concerned eyebrow at Abby's chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

With your hands, you could decide if you want to give or take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like fun!\" replied Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds very dangerous,\" you added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Simon. Let the girl have some fun. It's all safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't sound safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim put her hands on her waist. \"Simon, you're the guy who gave up your body to a spirit in a bunch of girl's clothes.

I'll give you control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby started her work by grabbing the permanent ink pen you kept in the kitchen. She rolled up Kim's sleeves and began to scribble in the same runes she had done yesterday with the notebook. They looked more like tattoos, strangely intricate in design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Abby explained. \"Your right arm I've prepared so that you can absorb from people whenever you touch them with it. You need to say the right word on what you're taking from them, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if I just say 'breast' it will work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You need to use the Latin word,\" Abby moved Kim's hand onto your shoulder. \"Ubera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ubera,\" Kim repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden looseness in the cups of your bra. You looked down and saw your body impressive rack shrunk ever so slightly. Gasping, you glanced to Kim as she marveled at her own chest which expanded in equal size. She released your shoulder before she took too much from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there,\" said Abby. \"You'll find that it's quite potent. As you can see, when you release your target the spell will stop. The other hand will give whatever mass you demand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Do you want this back then?\" asked Kim, jiggling her newly sized rack. They had jumped up another cup size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, keep it as a gift. I'll just borrow what remains of Simon's old mass to refill. Is that alright, Simon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and tried to keep your eyes off Kim, who was looking more like your ideal woman by the minute. \"I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling of transformation focused on your sensitive boobs. The cloth of your T-Shirt began to rise as the empty cups of your bra refilled with glorious splendor. You were back to normal as Abby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too cool,\" Kim muttered to herself, looking down at her etched palms. You could see a lustful look in her eyes as she made two fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People will notice if you go a little too crazy. Be subtle about things and don't go too big or too small. I'll make a small list of words you can call upon to get you started. It's a good lesson for how transference works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Thanks, Abby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for you, Simon,\" you jolted awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have our own training session.

Fiona\u2019s Frugals. Apparently it was a hot spot for wiccan lovers, if the reviews online were any clue. Small wonder considering what it had done to your head, perhaps there was something to the idea of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was only one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found the number next to the listing and dialed it into your cellphone. It rang a few times before a familiar bubbly voice greeted you on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFiona speaking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi,\u201d you replied. \u201cUh, you might remember me from a couple of hours ago. I came in because it was cold and you gave me this weird cowl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes! The pretty boy! Have you tried it on yet? What did you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I think?\u201d you huffed finding yourself getting angry with how careless the shopkeeper was sounding. \u201cIt turned my hair red! And then it grow it out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorking as intended then. How long did you keep it on, by chance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ripped it off the moment I saw what it was doing to me! What the hell was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, magic will do that to you. I thought I got a good read on your aura the moment you walked into my shop. Hold on a moment. Let me do some tarot readings to be sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing over the phone, you weren\u2019t in much of a position to argue with her when your only power was that you could hang up. And that wouldn\u2019t get you any answers. You could only sit patiently as you listened to her play with cards on the other end of her phone. After a solid five minutes of waiting, she finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see. You have girl troubles then, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha--\u201d you replied, trying to disguise a blush Fiona couldn\u2019t see. \u201cI don\u2019t...How did you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe cards told me as much and they\u2019re never wrong. Forgive me, I thought you had wandered into my shop as a boy simply curious about what it\u2019s like on the other side. Now I see your need much more clearly. Let\u2019s start from the beginning. Hello there, I\u2019m Fiona. And I secretly own a shop of magical items.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagical items\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, there are too few real witches out there these days. Most of them are just in it for the fashion with none of them practicing real magic. That\u2019s why I opened this shop in a college town, to recruitment fresh members into our coven. What I have given you is an enchanted cowl. It was owned by a former friend, another witch. Before she died, she passed on a part of her soul in various items around the shop. You just happened to find one of them, like it was calling to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t calling to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why did you grab it out of everything else in the store?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was looking for something Kim might like!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim being the girl you\u2019re interested in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d you could practically hear Fiona smirking over the line. \u201cThe items in my store are all imparted with some essence of previous witches. They have a mind of their own, in some ways. They would not go to you without a reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, you couldn\u2019t handle this insane back and forth. It was like talking to someone who believed in angels or ghosts, no matter how reasonable your argument there was no shaking their faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook,\u201d you continued, voice clearly painted with impatience. \u201cCould you just tell me what this stupid jacket was doing to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple,\u201d Fiona as she reared up for an explanation.</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t need to spend my breath. I gave the cowl to you for free and it turns you back to normal as soon as you remove it. The way I see it, I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. For better or worse, you were destined to pick that item in particular. And I was only doing my part of fate in passing it along to you. What you do with it is up to you. And if you were interested in actually buying something, you know where to find me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTa ta!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growled into the sound of an empty received as you dropped your phone on your computer desk. Something how the brief conversation with Fiona had left you with more questions than answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWitches were real, apparently. As was magic. And there was a shop of enchanted items in your very town that no one knew about. No one as far as you knew, at least. You couldn\u2019t help but wonder what Fiona met by the cowl being destined for you. Why on earth would you ever want to become a girl? You were happy just being a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowled and did what you normally did when things pissed you off, browse Twitter and creep on other people\u2019s lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt being a Friday night, most people were out doing their own things. A couple of your friends were having a party for the recent football game, though you didn\u2019t bother going because you hated sports. Some of the local college nerds were raving about their new Dungeons and Dragons campaign, causing you to roll your eyes. You paused when you saw a tweet between Patricia and Kim, excited for their girls night out together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona\u2019s voice taunting you about girl troubles echoed in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that what she meant?\u201d you asked yourself. \u201cWas that why she gave me that thing? To help get closer to Kim?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed crazy. But crazy was par for the course today, it seemed. You played with the soft fabric of the cowl and ponded what you were going to do with yourself this evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to...</span></div></div>",

It was better to 'not think' for the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some hours you still had your eyes locked to the pc but the cowl was like calling your mind \"Fuck\" you exclaimed closing the pc and recovering the cowl.

Than you showed it to her like it was the proof of some homicide and you were the detective accusing the culprit \"now, tell me what it does\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm you just played for the afternoon and didn't even eat, come with me\" she said bringing back a lock of brown hair and advancing to the back of the shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait\" you said following her, but she was already gone in the back. You followed and entered in some kind of kitchen \"Fiona!\" you called her but she has already appeared behind you. Her eyes beamed with an odd light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon... Wear the cowl\" she said in a chanting tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze for a moment. Then slowly nod wearing the cowl. Fiona's face opened in a distorted smile \"Good, good\" she said as your hair was already turning red \"You see I didn't think you would return\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\" you said with a dumb smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for that Simon, but you were a bit anxious. Why don't you have a donut?\" she said opening the oven and revealing a tray of freshly baked donuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took one just as you hair was turning full red and was falling behind your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see\" she continued \"In the cowl there is the soul of one of my dearest friend Mary...Or Fat Mary as we called her due to her gluttony habit\" she giggled, making her breasts wobbling \"It's actually quite difficult imbuing a clothes with a soul, there are so many variables...\" she paused fixing your hair, as your body hair start to vanish \"and I nearly lost any hope of bringing her back\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what do you need me for?\" you say still mesmerized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled again, opening her eyes \"I'm glad you ask, I want you..\" </span></div></div>",

As you placed in your mouth and gave the first bite, your brain exploded in a simil-orgasm, a \"donurgasm\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...new recipe\" you said pushing the rest of the donut in your open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Kim picked a piece from one and chewed it down \"Naa...it's just the same old college-bar donut. It's better near the center, near the city. Have you ever been there Simon? Simon?\" she asked a second time. However you were unresponsive as you were already eating the second donut \"Wow. You didn't have dinner yesterday, am I right? I've told you, if you want to keep your waist, you have to eat small portion every 4 hours\" she shooked her head as you already on the third donut \"You're a lost cause\" she added standing up and fixing her hair.\"It's late..it's late\" she said before recovering the bag from her room \"See you later fat-boy..\" she waved laughing at the sight of you gorging on the donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the noise of the door closing made you \"woke up\". \"Oh...sure...I mean Kim?\" but she was already gone. \"Right...\" you looked back at the box, which was now empty \"Damn. Did I really eat all of that by myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually did and that wasn't the only thing strange. Behind you, under your pijama, your ass bubbled out and expanded. Not much, but more than 10 minutes ago. Actually you were feeling quite tight on your pj-pants \"F- that. I need to control myself more or I'll become a blimp!\" you chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleaned the table and returned to your room. Today you've got no lesson, but you needed to report to the cafeteria. The college cafeteria was actually two distinct shop who was run each of one by one external employee (who lived then in the campus) and one or two students who needed to have some extra cash. This morning you actually recived a message who informed you that you were finally accepted as a replacement in the cafeteria B with another replacement: an external empoyee named Laura Still who started this morning with you. You looked at the clock. Shit you were late. You recovered a pair of jeans but they also were tight on your back, so you recovered a pair of sweatpants, thrown a t-shirt a hoodie and run to the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore reaching it you stumbled on a 40 something years woman with a great pair of boobs. She was clearly overweighted, maybe even obese, but she was cute anyway. You've also had a crush on this kind of women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry....\" you said moving a side \"Did I hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up \"Don't worry. Nothing the old rump can't save me from\" she chuckled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...did we met before?\" you asked. It was odd but you could swear you knew her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I think not. I would remember it\" Fiona replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if  you're okay I'll go. I need to be at my working place and meet my new colleague\" you said departing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry. I'll meet my new friend too soon enough\" Fiona replied chuckling when you already couldn't hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there. I'm Laura, your new colleague! And you must be Simon\" Laura replied. She wasn't as you expected. As like the woman you met before, Laura was a bombshell. She must have weighted around the 400 pounds. She had dark hair, styled in two ponytails, and brown doe eyes. She wore the cafeteria apron but underit, you could spot a black t-shirt and a long skirt. Hmmm that wasn't so bad. Working with her could have its perks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled \"I'm Simon indeed. Pleasure to meet you\" you said shaking her hand. It was chubby as the rest of the body. Hehehe you were a lucky bastard. \"So, what do I have to do?\" you asked opening your arms \"Ahh and sorry for being late on the first day\" you said closing your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...you just have to be at the register while I stay behind and cook and arrange the pastries..\" she said proudly \"and don't worry\" she patted on your shoulder \"I knew we're going to be good friends\" she smiled.</span></div></div>",

You basically knew everyone who came. Even Patricia arrive at some point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Patricia!\" you waved at her when she was looking at the shoo showcase<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon! I didn't know you were working here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just started today. It seems they finally accepted my cv\" you replied \"anyway even my colleague is new\" you said pointing at the back. Patricia looked over thr counter and spotted a big woman in a apron moving in the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...Can I have some muffins?\" she asked looking at the pastries with a glutton expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"of course.. What can I give you...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one there?\" you heard Laura calling you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Lessons are over and they have better things to do than staying at the campus cafeteria\" you chuckled. Hell you would be out too if you had the chance. Too bad you still had one hour to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well come in the back. I've just baked a tray of donuts\" she said but for you it was like the siren's call. You had to sell them all day and you looked at all the donuts with some sort of trance. What was the matter with you? You had your lunch too. You untied the apron and reached Laura as she put the tray on the table \"serve yourself\" she said taking the first for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked one. It was still hot but you didn't mind. You would do anything for eating it. You blow on its surface and swallow the rest of it in two bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh my. You're one hungry fellow\" she blinked \"i like that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed her tone. Did she meant some sexual thing? You couldn't really know since your attention was focused on the remaining donuts. You were already picking another one when Laura started talking again. It seemed she hopped from one job to another and she was really happy to take this one since the college even gave her one of the apartment at the campus. It was in the latest building of the structure, far away from yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".. Yeah it's very comfortable and guess what\" she said as you were already biting the next donuts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm guot... I mean what?\" you said swallowing the donut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's big enough for two so if you wish and you want some private space from your friends you can come over anytime. I'll give you the key and stuff. You seem a nice guy\" she said placing her water-melony breasts right in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded blushing as you felt an hardness in your private part. However, under your hood your abs were leaving their place to a bit of a pudginess. You never had fat on your hips, now however they poked a little on the side of your belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"someone's there?\" a voice called suddenly from outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"a customer!\" you exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura giggled \"don't worry that's my bestie!\" she said waddling out and removing the apron \"Fiona!!\" she said to the woman outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed her and found out that Laura's friend was the woman from the morning \"Oh I remember you\" she said when she spotted you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am\" you said waving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"such a nice fellow\" she replied giggling with Laura. Their body wobbling around like two Jell-Os. That was the definition of heaven probably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Simon, me and Fiona here will go to have a little dinner to one of our favorite place. The all you can eat near the city-lake, do you want to come?\" she asked blinking. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How many times would have the possibility to going out not with one but with two girls with those killing curves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll come. Got nothing going on anyway\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded to each other \"it's settled then. Go and prepare for the night out with your new aunties\" Laura joked \"Fiona got her car outside. Meet you here in a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left for you apartment, got a shower and changed. Just a sweater and again another pair of sweatpants. Somehow you were still feeling a bit bloated. Maybe it was the snack with Laura. How knew? You grabbed your leather jacket and left a note for...Oh right you forgot Kim left the apartment. You were alone until Patricia would come. <br>\r\nAs you returned to the parking lot, Laura and Fiona were already there. They both changed (probably at Laura new campus apartment) into two long dresses and heels. The two long dresses let you have a good sight of their cleavages but you tried desperately to avoid starring at those watermelons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Simon\" Fiona waved at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you good kiddo?\" Laura said patting on the jacket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere she referring to your clothes? \"Yes... I just wanted to wear something comfy for the night\" you said with a forced smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh don't worry we will have a blast\" she reassured you \"go to the front, i prefer being alone in the back\" she added before hopping on Fiona's van. You guessed right, they probably weighted more the three hundreds both so a normal car would be a little too light. Anyway in the car the situation was a bit hot too. Fiona seatbelt cut her body and let her girls jutting out, giving you nothing else to look. You resolved to look at your feet to avoid being labeled as a sexual hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou three talked about your college life. Fiona was also curious about your friends and family. Well Kim would be far and Patricia had her own friends circle. Even your best friend Ted would be out of town these days, and your parents were too far, so you really were on your own for some time now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the restaurant they staff seemed to know very well Fiona and Laura and greeted them both before showing the usual booth near the buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did see this place from outside some times but I never went inside. Do you come here often?\" you asked when you sit down<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah once or two...\" started Fiona<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you shut up? \" giggled Laura \"yeah more or less every three days. We're a sort of habitu\u00e9\" she said in a French manner \"come let's pick something to eat\" she said gesturing you to follow her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" you said getting up \"I'll just grab some...\" you quickly added as you see them starting to put on their tray basically everything. </span></div></div>",

A little large, but I could get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this situation, where your only thought was trying to please your crush, you could only agree with her. \"It looks very nice on you. Would you, uh, like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regretted the words as soon as they came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you go and get this for little old me,\" Kim asked before giving you a big hug. \"You're the best, Simon! I've just been looking for something like this with the colder weather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't thank me yet,\" you muttered as you looked down at her head. Tiny little red hairs were starting to sprout over her brown ones. Whatever the cowl had done to you was slowly working its way through Kim now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so sweet,\" Kim concluded, blissfully aware of the growing scarlet in her hair. \"Why don't I treat you to dinner? You're tired of cafeteria food too, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was practically a date and you couldn't well say no to it. Especially if she was the one instigating it after months of no process on your end to get things moving. If only there wasn't an enchanted cowl in your way giving Kim the best hair dye job you had ever seen. There was already a distinct sanguine streak running through her scalp. Plus, this outing would let you keep an eye on her, or so you told yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How can I say no?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim clasped your hands and pulled you to the door. \"Come on, I know just where we can go for a nice warm meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped and hoped a change in hairstyle wouldn't be the only thing altering about Kim tonight.

And not the fake kind that required extensive dying. This was a natural looking red that would only come with freckles and pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to Henry\u2019s Pub,\u201d said the waiter as he approached the two of you. \u201cPardon me, miss. Would you happen to be Irish?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim laughed. \u201cWho me? Maybe like one percent or something on my mom\u2019s side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just figured I\u2019d ask. The owner\u2019s Irish, oh well. What can I get you folks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you ordered a burger, but you weren\u2019t entirely sure. While you hoped that you could enjoy your first date with Kim, if you could even call this that, the fates had conspired against you. As by the time your appetizers of pretzel sticks over melted cheese came out, you noticed something else happening to Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything okay, Simon? You\u2019re barely touching this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a distinct picture of Kim\u2019s face in your mind whenever you closed your eyes. As you glanced up from the plate there was something...Just subtly off about it as she stared back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in her nose, which was normally narrow and pointed. Now it was looked slightly stubbier and wider. But it wasn\u2019t just that either. You knew for a fact that Kim had brown eyes. As she looked up at you, you were met with the most distinct and striking green eyes that seemed to go well with her new red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the meal, the situation only seemed to get worse with time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim\u2019s entire face was looking a little puffier and paler, while her cheeks took on a rosy hue. Dimples began to form in her smiles and even her eyebrows were slowly shifting color.

It wasn't that Kim was behaving any different than how she normally did. But staring into the eyes of someone who looked completely different from her was just surreal. Worse, it seemed to be spreading as Kim made an odd comment when dinner arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" she said shifting in her seat. \"That's odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What happened?\" you were doing your best not to sound panicked considering at any moment she might realize what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pants feel a little tight...Which is weird because I've had these for a while now and they always fit me. I must be gaining a little weight. This will have to be the last time eating out for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stole a glance at her bottom and she stood up in her seat to adjust her jeans. Kim was speaking the truth, her hips were starting to look a little wider. Bigger than they were when you first entered the pub. Not huge, but she was definitely starting to look more curvy in the waist department which was very noticeable consider how hard she exercised to make sure she didn't gain the freshman fifteen. You could only assume this was the cowl's doing. People didn't get gain five pounds in their ass over the course of a meal. But you weren't left long to ponder it as a new problem arose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople had been coming and going to the bar that you hadn't given them much thought. Had you been watching the door, you might have noticed a particular bubbly blonde coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Simon!\" called a voice as she approached your table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped at the sight of Patricia waving at you. She was Kim's best friend and coworker at the bar, and some of a short chubbster with a ditzy attitude, but Kim loved her anyway. You got along with her just fine usually and she was in your statistics class, but this was the absolute worst time as Kim tried to call out to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Patti!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia frowned her brow at the nickname typically only reserved for Kim and time froze for a moment as you could see her begin to open her mouth to ask how this was. You had to jump into action and went with the first thing you could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patricia!\" you interrupted, leaping to your feet. \"Oh, thank god I bumped into you. I just remembered our big statistics class homework assignment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Statistics homework?\" she asked, turning away from the slowly transforming Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" you glanced over to a confused Kim and apologized. \"One second, I'll be right back. Sorry, this is kind of important. Half our letter grade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't mind me. This was my treat after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed nervously as you grabbed Patricia by the wrist to pull her off towards the bathrooms for someplace quiet to talk. You ducked off to the side of the kitchen door, far enough away that Kim would not hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you on some kind of date?\" Patricia asked. \"And why do I get the feeling that girl knows me? But I've never met her before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because you have,\" you groaned. Either Kim or Patricia was going to have to know what was going on. And Kim might literally kick your ass and ruin any chance of dating her if she knew what you had done to her. \"Look, this is going to sound absolutely crazy, but that chick over there? That's Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For real?\" Patricia stole a glance back at the booth. \"Holy cow, what did she get a nose job and her hair dyed? She's putting on a little weight in the face too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, surgery doesn't work like that, Patricia. I don't know how this is exactly happening but today I went to a weird shop in town and was given a cowl. When I put it on, I started transforming into the same redhead girl Kim looks like right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I barely believe it myself, but this is for real. Kim thought I got the cowl from her and now we're sort of maybe on a date that I don't want to ruin by revealing I have given her some sort of...Cursed object that she's been wearing. Can you help me get it off her? Or at least play along that she still looks like Kim until we can find a way to remove it without her noticing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia thought for a moment and decided to...</span></div></div>",

You were desperate for any way out and would take any ladder thrown to you. Even if it led you into a pit of snakes.

She was confused because the waiter apparently didn't recognize her when he presented the bill. You might have been a little crazy too, but Kim's butt was starting to look a little bigger too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Kim said looking up from the paper. \"Get that homework thing worked out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Patricia replied, putting on a distinctly bubbly voice as her eyes caught onto Kim's cowl. \"Oh my god! I love that jacket so much, Kim!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? Simon got it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did? What a big sweetie! Hey, you know what's funny? I have a friend who has the perfect outfit to match that cowl, isn't that weird? Do you think I could borrow that for a day so she can try it on with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what are friends for, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't have been that easy. But, sure enough, Kim began to remove the cowl and handed it over to Patricia. As she did, her entire face began to slowly morph back to its normal self while her hair returned to its usual brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Kim replied, patting at her waist. \"I think I just made room in my stomach. I feel great all of a sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always look awesome, girl,\" Patricia said, as she folded the cowl on her arm. \"And my friend thanks you. I'll have to introduce you two sometime. Are you guys done with dinner then? I'd like to work on this homework assignment with Simon. Right, Simon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you had been content to sit out of the conversation. \"Uh, yeah. Sure. Thanks for the dinner, Kim. We should, ah, do it again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Don't stay out too late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were pulled to the door by the wrist with Patricia towing you along. For a short chubby her, she had some surprising strength to her. Though she didn't speak to you until you were both out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" she said, patting the cowl in her arms. \"That wasn't so hard, was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you did great,\" you said, reaching for the jacket. Patricia pulled away at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah. Don't forget, you owe me a favor, mister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" you said, pulling out your wallet. \"Well, how does a hundred bucks sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want money, Simon. I want something very particular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, uh, like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

It was presently hidden away underneath your bed where Kim wouldn\u2019t go looking for it. That meant that, reluctantly, you wouldn\u2019t have an excuse not to go out on a girl\u2019s night with Patricia. Part of it was because you felt you owed her one for getting you out of a jam last night. The other part of it was...Well, you were beginning to get a little curious about the cowl and how it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, so you are coming then,\u201d Patricia said as she hoisted up her backpack. \u201cI\u2019ll be by around six tonight, we can catch dinner and check out the mall. I also spent some time putting together an outfit for you that will match the cowl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d you said as she began pulling out a black dress. \u201cThese are girl clothes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh. You\u2019re going to be one in a few hours. You\u2019re done with classes, right? You might want to get started on that. That\u2019ll give you about four hours. See you then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left you with a handful of clothing, including the dress, matching stockings, black bra/panties, and a pair of high heeled boots. You suddenly couldn\u2019t help but wonder what you had gotten yourself into. You shoveled the supplies into your own backpack before anyone saw and headed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the safety of your apartment, you locked the door so that you could begin your transformation in peace. Patricia had given you a solid time frame of four hours to work with, meaning you had plenty of time you ease into the changes. It seemed to happen over a slow period though, you imagined four hours would be long enough to give you some time to adjust as well before you went out on the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as you held up the bra. Patricia apparently trusted you enough with her underwear, she must have been really important to her. At least she had done you the decently of giving you something that wasn\u2019t low cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not a crossdresser and had never had to put on women\u2019s clothing before. You had only taken off someone\u2019s bra once, your lucky date on prom night. You gulped at just how big the cups were, you hadn\u2019t even considered what it might be like to have breasts all of a sudden. You were already committed though, having stripped naked. You began the arduous task of putting on the bra. The panties weren\u2019t too comfortable either, given your package between squeezed together. Though the stockings were comfortable enough and the dress fit you just fine. Everything was very lopsided beneath the clothes as you were clearly wearing something meant for someone a great deal shorter and wider than you were. You could only hope that Patricia was right in her estimates as you donned the last bit of clothing to start the process. The cowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had parked yourself in front of your bedroom mirror to watch the process, starting first with your hair. The beginning strands of red appeared in your roots, spreading to your tips and growing even beyond that. Within a few minutes, you looked like a rather shaggy redhead. Within ten, it looked like you were wearing a woman\u2019s wig as the hairstyle settled into place, combed out as if by an unseen hand. This had been the furthest you had gotten on your own. You had only seen the next part as it affected Kim and you focused intensely on your face in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like tiny little bugs crawling on your skin. Not unpleasant, but just slight touches that told you something was happening. You watched with an odd fascination as your nose became shorter and stouter on your reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like your very persona was fading away. Your cheeks became wider and fuller as you felt a slight tug pulling them outwards. Your lips inflated and you bit at them confirm their growth. The hair on your bushy eyebrows thinned and became more refined as your eyes themselves started to change in color. Overall, your entire head seemed to be getting larger as an extra chin formed beneath your own. It felt like someone was giving you the most gentlest of massages. By the ten minute mark, you no longer looked like yourself from the neck up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap,\u201d you said, still in your own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to move the expressions of your reflection around, surprised to find that the face you saw was completely under your control. You touched at it, pulling at the cheeks and felt the same pain. This was indeed your face. These transformations were really happening to you. That filled you with the deepest sense of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was short lived when there was a knock at the door. To your surprise, a certain someone would be visiting you during your most intimate moments of the changes. It was...</span></div></div>",

Can you take off the chain of the door?\" you heard Kim saying outside the door of your apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus. What you would say to her? You looked again in the mirror. Except for your face the rest of your body was still male. At the very best you would pass for the mad man of Psycho. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. Think Simon, think\" you thought. <br>\r\n\"Can't you pass again later? I'm naked\" you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon I've got my own key. Just remove the chain.

I promise I won't look at the shower. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it. What could you do? You cursed you and the decision of wearing the cowl. Wait you could removed it. Ahh even if you would remove it you were still in Patricia clothes. You needed to think. Ok the shower would be a good cover since its glass was just dirty enough to not let Kim peer to you. What would have Kim go away faster? Oh, right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, you had the plan set in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unchained the door and quickly run to your bed, rising the quilt till your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Kim mumbling something about opening at least the door a little. Then she entered the room. She left the book on the table and yelled \"I can't believe how difficult it was. Right, Simon? And why are you taking a shower right now?\" she said reaching from the bathroom door. However she stopped \"I thought you were on the bathroom\" you heard her saying reaching from your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" she said finally seeing your head. You were keeping your eyes closed and slowly opened them when Kim reached you. You gently smiled, blinking a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Kim giggled \"I'm so sorry...\" she giggled again \"Awkward\" then she turned away \"Simon we need to talk later about warning about some important things\" she yelled, then she turned back to you \"Look, I'm sorry. I didn't say anything about bringing someone here\" she said smiling briefly \"Tell the asshole I'll borrow the make-up so he can shower calmly. I'll offer you a coffee later if you will be still around\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and smile without saying a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim waved at you, leaving the room.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You waited until you heard Kim enter her bedroom. There was no telling how long she was going to be in the apartment, but at least now you had a cover story. Even though it painted completely the wrong image of you. You were trying to date Kim, not give her the impression that you were already seeing someone. Even though you had just been out to dinner with her the previous night, she didn\u2019t seem that bothered with you sleeping with someone else. Maybe it was because she only saw you as a friend, dummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you logic, you were presented with a new problem because of your lie. Kim was now expecting to hear the shower running in the apartment. That meant, you were going to have to move from your safe space under the quilt of the bed and turn it on. You just had to be quick and hope Kim wouldn\u2019t see you dash back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could sit up, you were overcome with the most intense feeling beneath the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like you were trapped in a box and someone was squeezing the sides together. You felt cramped all of a sudden as the sensation came in waves, matching the time of your own heartbeat. You couldn\u2019t explain it, but somehow there felt like there was less of you all of a sudden. Then it passed as quickly as it appeared. Patricia\u2019s clothes already felt quite loose on you, being the larger girl that she was. But now they suddenly felt just a little more emptier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged it off and went off to complete your task, ignoring the fact that the apartment suddenly felt just a tiny bit larger than it usually was. You slipped inside the bathroom before Kim could notice and turned on the showhead before creeping back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were almost home free when a voice called to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you don\u2019t have to leave on my behalf.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and had a slight panic attack at the sight of Kim. Not only because she had spotted you out of bed and now you had to socialize as your own one nightstand, but there was something more disturbing. Normally when you were looking at Kim, she only came up to your nose given your differences in height. Now it disturbed you to find out that you were seeing her eye to eye. You should have expected this, given the size of the cowl and Patricia\u2019s own height. You were starting to shrink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I get it,\u201d Kim said, raising her palms up. \u201cI\u2019d be embarrassed too. Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you two. You go ahead. Just bring the quilt back washed and clean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and nodded again, quickly excusing yourself from the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, you leaned against the wall with a breath of relief. You felt a great deal smaller than you normally felt, and not just because you had shrunk a few inches going from your usual 5\u201910 to about 5\u20196, or Kim\u2019s height. This transformation was going to be dangerous if someone caught you. The shrinking just made you realize how tiny and vulnerable you felt, and you could only imagine that it would keep getting worse as time went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed a safe place to hang out until these changes passed and you could go around as normal. Or as normal as a short chubby girl could. You would have to remember to pick up pepper spray to make you feel a little safer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were trapped in your apartment complex at least until you could pose as a normal girl  instead of a short guy with a girly face/hair dressed in drag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed lived in the building, a friend of yours. But you would have to explain to him what was going on. There was always your residental assistant, a kind old woman who was going slightly blind. You might be able to pass as yourself until you could escape. Then again, you could just hang out in the lobby and hope no one saw you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to...</span></div></div>",

Ms. Pinkerton was an old woman, a chemistry teacher back in her old days, who now worked at the campus as residential assistant. She was always kind to you and always had some cookies for everyone in the palace. She was a bit plump, and now a bit more short due to the pain she had at her back and hips.

In the past, you had run experiments with her to test the level of her blindness including having your friend Ted waving a bag of pot around only for her to mistake it for a sandwich. She didn\u2019t even seem to notice you having the blanket draped over you in the first place, so you folded it up and had a seat on the couch as you cleared your voice a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whispered a few random things to confirm that, indeed, your voice had changed into something softer and more sultry, no matter how nonsexy you tried to sound. Coupled with your new shorter height, this was going to take some adjusting. Though the cowl was not likely to show down in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me get a good look at you, dearie,\u201d said Pinkerton as she returned with the tea and leaned in close to your face. \u201cWhy, aren\u2019t you a pretty young thing? You remind me of when I was your age. Back when I worked in the reactor. Such nice soft hands too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had accidentally brushed against her when she handed you the tea only to look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers were beginning to slim and shrink, losing about an inch in their length. You had always had big hands and the ones you were looking down at and flexing were clearly feminine in nature. And, what\u2019s more, a little chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you said, adjusting to how much larger the teacup now felt to hold. You searched for a subject to change to and distract yourself. \u201cUh, Simon never mentioned you worked in a reactor. He said you were a chemistry teacher.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I became one after the accident that ruined my eyesight. Teaching was the safest option for me following that incident. Though I never gave up my research and have made a comfortable living doing that. I just love this university so much that they let me stay for free, provided I do my part with this residential assistance job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never stopped to listen to Pinkerton\u2019s backstory ever before, and hearing her talk about her life before working for the school was kind of said.

You imagined that it wouldn\u2019t be long before you arms shortened and plumpened to match your face.

You removed the glasses and wrapped them in the cowl, a bit unsure about what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a black frame appeared out of nowhere on your nose, as you felt your sight progressively getting worst. Then, glasses appeared in front of your eyes. Very thin, then progressively heavier. You quickly removed Ms Pinkerton glasses from the cowl, but your glasses didn't disappear.<br>\r\nYou slowly raised them to confirm your fear. You've lost a bit of your sight. You switched your glasses with Ms. Pinkerton's. As you predicted they were a match. You place again the new glasses on your nose and returned her glasses. Somehow you'd transferred the glasses the cowl and vice-versa. You hoped it even worked on Ms. Pinkerton in the same way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fixed them?\" she said giggling. Probably she thought you were joking. As she put them on you noticed that her blue eyes became a littler more bright (like yours did when you had put on the cowl. Even if your eyes were brown before so the difference was noticeable). She blinked a few times \"it's odd. But...\" she blinked again \"oh my god\" she said removing the glasses and putting them back on \"I can actually see. I mean I can see way better than some moments ago\" she turned to you blinking again:\"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder your new glasses, you gave her a small, shy, smile. What could you say to her now? Even more, you could actually feel a bit more skin on your arms as they started to get a bit more fatter. Something that Ms. Pinkerton will notice now. </span></div></div>",

But then you started dropping a few more inches of your height in the middle of your conversation with her. This actually made you even in size when you both stood up and were looking eye to eye, when previously she only came up to your nose. The dress you were wearing was certainly starting to feel rather big on you as you stood at a crushing height of about 5\u20192. You feared you might even lose a couple more inches by the end of it, with so much of the cowl to fill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you see,\u201d you said, pushing up your new glasses. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said, playing with her glasses. \u201cThis might be the biggest scientific discovery in the modern era.

Then, as you were eating the third cookie she used the tweezer on the cowl, ripping a small piece off.

Anyway that comment made you feeling pretty susceptible \"Yeah...they are my favorite\" you commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway this \"girl\" we're seeing is replacing you, Alice\" she said getting up \"Just look at your belly\" she said pointing her finger at it \"Are you having your period or its the cowl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down just to be greeted by a potbelly under your dress which wasn't there some minutes ago \"I am...\" you stuck a finger in it to confirm it.

That could only meant that you would even get larger \"I'm on my period\" you lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well...that's even explained the hunger..\" Ms. Pinkerton said chuckling \"anyway you must carefully watch for your changes Alice.

You couldn't remember the specifics of it anymore, but it felt important. Important enough that you were willing to throw away your remaining life and memories for it. Besides, you could always take the cowl off and change back, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem was that you weren't even sure where she was, exactly. And you had left your phone back in your room. Another thing you were having trouble remembering where it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wandered the hallways, trying to find some clues to the dwindling life you were slowly forgetting, your body was going through some more changes.

A brief touch told you, however, that it was fat you were filling up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger and bigger you grew as your belly extended beyond anything that could be considered natural. You had a beach ball for a torso, as you placed both hands on your stomach. It was getting tight enough that Patricia's borrowed dress was starting to strain a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this isn't right,\" you decided and pressed down with all your might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't expect your gesture to actually do anything, but were taken aback when you seemed to have pushed a fair portion of the mass back into your torso. Of course, this was followed a sudden weight in your backside. You looked over you shoulder to find your butt sticking out a good portion further than it had just a moment ago. Somehow you had pressed the weight back into your body only for it to come out at another end instead, specifically your butt. Though you still had a good ways of growing to fill Patricia's dress entirely, your stomach rumbled again and inched further out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I going to keep growing and growing like this?\" you asked yourself, imagining your stomach continually expanding out and you pressing it back in like a spaghetti press. \"I need to find Patricia quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, that's exactly who you bumped into as you rounded the corner.

You slowly raised a hand and uncovered your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These clothes...SIMON!\" she exclaimed after gazing at you for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the name you tried to remember! Simon. Your name was Simon. How could you have forgotten? \"I'm...Simon?\" you repeated after some seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...it's really you in there right? I mean that's are my clothes\" Patricia squeeled all excited \"Can't believe you're a girl now\" she giggled offering you a hand. You grabbed it and raised up. Patricia weighted more than you so it was easier than you thought \"So...everything's changed down there too?\" she asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....no\" you say checking Mr. Happy is indeed under your clothes, You gasped realizing the situation \"Patricia! Is worse than we thought.

What do you mean Simon's roommate? You ARE Simon.\" she said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm Alice...\" you say looking at your hands.

Do you mean you said to Kim and Ms. Pinkerton that you were called Alice not to blow off the cowl? Should I call you Alice too?\" she asked, but you were too occupied to look to the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes..Anyway I was with Ms. Pinkerton and I've started to eat her biscuits and...boom. I started forgetting..,\" you turn to her \"I'm hungry Patricia. Do you mind if we order?\" you said all of a sudden. What was special about the things you knew or the things you remembered anyway? Your belly was rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia looked at you for a second \"Hey! That's my line\" she giggled \"All right, all right, we can order, but you've got to tell me what was it like to become...this..\" she said pointing her finger to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two ordered some different menu with standard plates as you explained the trasformation to Patricia. The restaurant was still a bit empty and you started to talk along the first dishes. Like an old engine fueled by new oil, the food was giving enery to the cowl. This time however you started to expand in girth, both by your shoulder and by your hips, giving you a more pudgy appearance, similar to Patricia. A small moan left your lips between ramens as your bones and skin readjusted to your new width.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...I think you've just put on some weight\" Patricia noted giving you a long look. As she did suppose the first time, the girl-in-the-cowl was about her size. She was worried a bit that you were acting strange, but part of her was excited. She couldn't believe that she actually had a friend so similar to her to go around with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" you said clearing your dish \"I forget to tell you but I think I'm kind of a glutton now\" you said again mixing your life with the cowl's memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that now you wanted to indulge some more?\" she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. I mean you've always took confort in food, didn't you? Nothing out of the ordinary.<br>\r\nPatricia, being a binge-eater herself, thought you just wanted to show her sympathy as a part of the promise and didn't take note of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept adjusting into your sit, as  little by little your breast were coming alive. Patricia's bra was being filled by your bosom, which was jutting any bite a bit more till it stopped at a rotund D cap. If someone had see you at that moment, they would never have suspected that you actually were Simon. You now looked more like Patricia irish cousin or just another chubby red-head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...that was just wonderful\" you said cleaning the last dish under the surprised look of Patricia.<br>\r\nShe was always her the one to clean the dish clear after you and Kim ate small portions \"Ready to hit some bar or do you want to go home?\" she asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nLittle did you know that, before the end of the evening, you two will met...</span></div></div>",

The fact was that even if you had finally stopped growing, your manhood was basically been pushed and twisted inside yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey are you feeling good?\"  Kim asked turning to you. You were basically bowed on the table \"Did you drink too much?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned \"Hmmm it's just my belly\" you said \"I need to go to the bathroom\". You said trying to get up. Since you sit between them, Kim got up too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm coming with you. I also need it\" she said gesturing you to follow her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you will find me here when you two come back\" a visibly drunk Patricia said giggling. Kim laughed and quickly went to the bathroom. <br>\r\nYou followed her without doubts. When you entered the stall you raised your dress and... Why were you trying to piss standing up like a man? You immediately sit down trying not to touch it, as you were finally able to release. No alarm sounded in your alarm that you were now 100% female.<br>\r\nWhen you left the stall you found Kim fixing her lipstick.<br>\r\nShe passed it to it \"Do you want it?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I don't know why I didn't put it up before\" you said putting the lipstick on your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you and Simon uh?\" she said rising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this Simon you two talked about?\" you asked out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guy you slept with? You don't even remember his name?\" she asked surprised. For Kim this all was something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean I didn't sleep with him. I just slept and woke up in a room. Your room\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that was Simon's\" she replied quickly \"Did he get you drunk or anything?\" she asked quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.. I don't.. I just felt.. Odd\" you said trying to remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim stared at you and you two returned to the table with Patricia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you heard Kim whispering to Patricia \"Patti did your friend here slept with Simon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeek!? Of course not. I mean why are you asking this?\" she replied after a small scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"then why was she sleeping in his room?\" she asked again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. That. She just.. Needed a place to.. Lay down\" Patricia replied understanding a little what were going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\" Kim replied \"I didn't think of that\" she said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia tried to speak but one of her friend suddenly closed-in \"Hey Patriciaaaaa. Hello ladies. Care to join me for a dance?\" he said to her. Patricia nearly choked on her drink. She got up red head \"of course!\" then she turned around \"I'll come back in some minutes. Otherwise call the police.. Ehehe\" she giggled following the guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two remained alone with Kim silently reaching for your hand. You turned and looked at her in the eyes. Why were you feeling your heart bumping so much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry for the interrogation in the bathroom. I misunderstood the whole situation Alice\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I.. Don't worry\" you stammered. There was something important with Kim, but you couldn't remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim squeezed your hand again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, why don't we...\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why don\u2019t you come over to my place for a while? I feel like we could be good...Friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your face burn brighter than the color of your hair. \u201cWhat about Patricia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get her to go home with us too. She\u2019s drunk enough that she\u2019s bound to pass out at any moment. I\u2019d rather not waste a lovely evening, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou supposed that sounded innocent enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, when you both returned to the bar, you found Patricia asleep with her head in a bowl. The bartender was keeping an eye on her to make sure there was no funny business going on and was relieved when you both grabbed her by the shoulders and hoisted her up and out of the establishment. She didn\u2019t even so much as stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short walk to her apartment, which Kim had a key for, and you dropped Patricia in her bed like a sack of potatoes with a note on her forehead telling her that you both got home fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back, you and Kim talked with each other some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange but you felt like you knew her from somewhere and the way she said things made her seem like an old friend. You were able to guess some of her stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere are you from and such?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question gave you pause when there was suddenly an answer that filled your head and you spoke confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m from Nevada and came here to escape my family, who were always overburdening me. I\u2019m studying to become a librarian. Got hit real bad by the freshman fifteen\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, don\u2019t say that. I think you look beautiful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talking got a little more like that with Kim dropping little hints along the way. One thing led to another and by the time you had gotten to her apartment, you were on the subject of kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never kissed anyone before,\u201d you admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Not even once?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just never met the right person, I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you like boys? Or girls? Or neither?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you replied. The briefest memory of your life as Simon flashed in your mind. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve thought about kissing one girl before. But I can\u2019t even remember her name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim laughed slightly and played with her hair as she led you into her bedroom. \u201cWell, um, do you ever think about trying it out? With someone, I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly something you can ask to practice with someone, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can ask me, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of your faces turned red as you interpreted what Kim was inferring. \u201cI, uh, didn\u2019t know you swung that way\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe either until last year in college. Then it suddenly clicked, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...There is where I\u2019m supposed to say I kind of find you super hot and want to make out with you...I hope that\u2019s not too forward or anything. And I hope I\u2019m not going too fast here. But I\u2019ve just never felt this way about someone before. It\u2019s kind of...Thrilling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I appreciate it,\u201d you stammered trying not to look like a dummy, while Kim was looking at you more like a hungry leopard. \u201cAh, what the hell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was definitely awkward at first. You weren\u2019t quite used to the idea of having to look up at someone while kissing them, as Kim was taller than you in this form. But as you got more into it, you both got comfortable with each other. Enough that Kim was starting to get handsy with you as you felt her grab you by the butt with her tongue down your throat. Not that you were going to ask her to stop. Kim was definitely a top, while you were a bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing led to another and that\u2019s when the clothes started coming off...</span></div></div>",

And...nothing.<br>\r\nDespite it seemed that the girl succeeded in sleeping with Kim... And maybe even.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Kim voice echoed in the apartment \"Alice...? Alice.. Are you here?\" you heard Kim footsteps around. <br>\r\n\"shit.. She must have woke up\" you thought. You reached for your drawer and placed the cowl recovering a pair of boxer and a t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you heard knocks on the door \"come in.

Clearly this could only mean one thing, the glasses allowed you to transform into this Alice again much in the same way that the cowl did. You supposed that was certainly an easier thing to wear that the cowl, which was very distinct and noticeable. But you waited a few minutes to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a much slower going process than the cowl was, that much was sure. It took about ten minutes for signs of your hair to start turning red and then another twenty before it started growing out and down to your shoulders. You supposed that was the con to wearing them. Easier to manage and wear with different outfits, but you'd have to prepare for a slower transformation. You briefly toyed with the idea of what might happen if you had on both the cowl and glasses at the same time before you were struck with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" you said to yourself. \"If I went to Ms. Pinkerton for help and gave her a pair of these glasses to fix her eyes, doesn't that mean...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and ripped off the glasses as your vision blurred again while your eyes returned to normal.

She was about Patricia\u2019s height and just as chubby, moreso even in some places. Though she looked out of place wearing what appeared to be the clothes of an old woman, a dress from the 50\u2019s, it was her scarlet hair and face which gave her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Miss Pinkerton?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon,\u201d she smiled. \u201cI was wondering when you\u2019d show up. How do you like the new me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d you said. \u201cYou still have your memories?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. Come on in, let me show you what I\u2019ve found out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kicked yourself for your outburst, but somehow Ms. Pinkerton didn\u2019t seem to mind. You had tried to keep your Simon identity a secret from her last night. It only made sense that she would put two and two together, being smart as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuffled your way into a room that smelled like the science lab, all clean and sterile. Pinkerton had certainly done some redecorating with tables put up in every corner. On top of them were all sorts of open books and chemistry sets, whizzing with endless experiments. There was very little remaining of the comforts of home, though she showed you to an open seat after she pushed aside some papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see, I\u2019ve been very busy since you left me last night,\u201d she said, collecting some tea for you to drink. \u201cYes, dearie. I\u2019ve already put it together that it was really you who was visiting me. I\u2019m old but not dumb. Anyway, when I discovered the bleeding effects of the virus, I was hesitant at first. Especially when I started losing my memories. But the youthful vigor it provided me encouraged me to press forward. So, I run up an old friend for did work on the study of viruses. We can basically treat this as a brain infection with the memory loss. Through his help, we put together the best antibiotic to counter that particular virus. There\u2019s a basic medicine that can be used to specifically focus on the brain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAspirin,\u201d Pinkerton smirked as if she told you a joke. \u201cBy following the same recipe as everyday over the counter aspirin, I was able to mix in some of my own DNA. Simply by consuming a pill every six hours, I can maintain complete control of my previous mental capabilities without losing myself to this new identity I\u2019ve assumed. It\u2019s been challenging work without a proper lab, but I\u2019ve made due with my apartment. As you can see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d you said. \u201cYou\u2019re like Breaking Bad only for a fat chick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d Pinkerton huffed. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know now that I have this new body, the first thing I\u2019m going to do is put myself on a strict workout routine to get into shape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right, right,\u201d you muttered. \u201cSo, there is a way to keep your memories while still being another person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThrough a little science. I\u2019d still like to study the properties of the cowl you had been wearing last night. I believe there\u2019s some great secrets there. But I can understand if you wanted some pills for keeping your own memories. They don\u2019t hurt to have and all I need is a little of your untainted DNA. Otherwise, perhaps we can find a way to trigger the transformation faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll those options sounded promising. It was nice to have someone as a partner in all this. But what experiment would you want to pursue for now? There was only enough time for one and Kim would no doubt be looking to see Alice again.</span></div></div>",

It's working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just nodded like she was proud of the results. If someone entered the room he would have seen two identical twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK I'll be going now. Do you mind remain at your apartment Ms. Pinkerton? I don't think it would be wise if they see two of us together\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Pinkerton nodded silently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk it was set.

You put on the biggest smile as Kim answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlice?\u201d she said with some surprise. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You could totally fuck her right now.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nYou paused in answering Kim. That wasn\u2019t your voice in your head. It sounded strange, yet weirdly familiar. You shook it off as you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, uh, Kim. I\u2019m sorry for disappearing like that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It\u2019s your fault. If you hadn\u2019t come along, I bet we\u2019d still be in bed together.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem,\u201d Kim answered. \u201cYou just surprised me a bit this morning is all...Everything okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let me take over. Come on, you\u2019ve had the body all to yourself for so long\u2026<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah. Sorry, but do you mind if I use your bathroom for a second?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim nodded and let you scurry away into the restroom. You stood on your tippy toes to look into your concerned female face. You had a guess of what was happening almost immediately as the voice grew louder in your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re making us look like idiots over there.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re...Alice?\u201d you whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No shit, Sherlock. You don\u2019t need to talk. I can hear you if you think it. We share the same body, dingus.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cThis is more comfortable for me,\u201d you stammered. \u201cHang on, Pinkerton said that the pill was supposed to bring my memories back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, by suppressing me. This is my body you\u2019re using for your own means.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? It\u2019s my body, technically.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Then why don\u2019t you just stick with your old boy body? What? You\u2019re too busy trying to get into Kim\u2019s pants? I did all the hard work. You just want to move in on what I\u2019ve done for us. Jerk.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry just...I\u2019ve known her for so long. And I am the host, so technically I have the right of it. Can you just bare with me for a little while so I can talk to Kim?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No can do. You booted me out of control so you\u2019re stuck listening to me.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cCome on, there must be <i>something </i>I can do to shut you up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sensed the Alice in your head think for a moment.

Though you still weren\u2019t quite sure how it was going to work exactly. With your memories, you felt like you were in full control of your shared body.

What if we just watched a movie instead?

Kim was completely invested with it, of course, and you laughed whenever she did to not make things awkward. But it really wasn\u2019t much different than how you normally watched movies together when you were still a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to make a move, dummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit back a grunt at the annoying voice of Alice in your head.

Don\u2019t you know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t, but you also didn\u2019t like the idea of having Alice jump in at random times like that during this date. Even if it was just cuddling on the couch, perhaps you could get to second base if you played your cards right. Certainly better than you ever did as a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about the pills still in your pocket. If one gave you back your memories, perhaps taking another might silence Alice entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, her advice was pretty good. It might be worth it to keep her as a wing lady.

Your face morphed and your eye returned to your normal colour, but...you waited and waited but nothing happened.

You never had a beard but now you didn't even had your stubble left leaving your face looking more rotund and delicate. Your legs and arms too: you were never the hairy type but now it seemed like you had waxed yourself. Even there, near Mr. John, it was all neat and clean like when you had ten years old.<br>\r\nThe second things was your belly: even if you had lost the majority of Alice's tummy, you couldn't feel your abs under it. It was just fat. Like you wasted all your life sitting on the sofa and not going to the gym near your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice...\" you whispered \"Alice!\" you said louder. But no one responded. 'Alice' was asleep or didn't want to reply. You needed to speak to her. Maybe the pills were acting strange maybe you spent too much time in Alice's body, but something was definitely wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou changed your clothes, hoping that yours might somehow revearse the effect, but nothing happened. You sighed.<br>\r\nYou packed Alice's clothes and the glasses, then you slowly opened the door and left a note for Ms. Pinkerton (you needed to be gentler with Ms. Pinkerton, you might needed her help if this...\"thing\" got out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou safely returned to your apartment.

Until then, you had to get used to the fact that your entire body was so smooth and hairless as your arms and legs constantly rubbed softly against your clothes whenever you sat down. In addition, your new gut seemed to wobble with every step you made. You couldn't help but play with it on the occasion whenever no one was looking. You were going to have to workout to keep this off somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it you found an even larger surprise when you bumped into Kim on the way to lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kim,\" you waved before stopping in place. \"Holy--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught yourself before you made a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim while was typically the perfect picture of health and fitness, today you were taken aback by the sight of her own gut that she was proudly sporting. She looked like a muffin with how a thick layer of flab poked out from beneath her T-shirt as she waved you over. Even her breasts were starting to look a little puffier than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Simon!\" she sounded overjoyed to see you. \"Sorry we cleaned out the food last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no problem,\" you replied, trying to keep your gaze at eye level and sound normal. \"We?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wonderful girl I met the other day. You met her before, right? Alice? She's so beautiful. I've never met anyone like this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wandered around if she hadn't even seen you as the two of you went back to the apartment together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were regaled with all sorts of tales of how wonderful Alice was on the way back. You were starting to think that Kim had fallen in love with this persona of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I see her again real soon,\" Kim said. \"I don't care what happens, I need her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized that hungry horny look in her eyes as you both returned to your rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said to yourself. \"Kim is clearly smitten by Alice. But the longer I wear Alice's clothes, the more I become her it seems. Maybe there's a way to...Fix it later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would talk to Miss Pinkerton later about a fix for your growing problem, she had probably thought of something already. In the meantime, Kim was clearly ready to play and it would be a perfect time to finally seal the deal. Even if the Alice in your head would claim it was her turn, you were willing to put up with her grumblings as long as you could finally be with Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collected the cowl, glasses, and pills before coming to a realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been wearing the same clothes as Alice this whole time. Kim's probably going to notice something's off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the cowl was starting to smell a little fresh given all the eating and spilled food the last night. Luckily, you had the glasses to use and keep the form of Alice even if you removed the cowl. You should try to find another outfit to wear though, perhaps something sexy to keep Kim's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to...</span></div></div>",

You considered talking to Ms Pinkerton and Patricia but that could only resolved in more questions. No. You needed to buy some clothes by yourself, even if that meant buying girl clothes. The mall wasn't so fsr from the campus and you had your stash of 150 bucks to use. The only thing left to decide was going to the mall as yourself or as Alice? <br>\r\nYou thought and thought about that but the only thing you could think of was to change in Patti's clothes with the glasses and then eat a pill. At least you could explained the situation to Alice. You just hoped she would understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou changed your clothes. They do smelled fresh (even if the food odour seemed nice) and you placed the glasses on as the familiar sensation returned. You must admitted that it was pretty arousing to feel yourself getting bigger (especially by your breats and your ass). As your mind got foggy you pop the pill in your mouth and swallowed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>.... What are you doing? It's my turn with Kim</i><br>\r\nA familiar voice said in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you come down? We've got no clothes other than this one and Kim wanted to see us again\" you explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She wanted to se ME again you mean.... Ok fine, what do you have in mind? Shopping? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded \"Yes, the mall isn't very far. We will get a new cloth and then we can have some fun time with Kim\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>... Ok but just remember it's my turn. Anyway I too think a change of clothes is in order. Plus, maybe we can also pick an ice-cream after that</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth watered immediately. It seemed Alice words were sufficient to let you become hungry. You shook your head and left the apartment. Lucky you didn't find anyone around and you walked (well waddled) to the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit hard walking around in your body\" you whispered recovering your breath when you entered the mall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, now it's my body? Pfff you're just not used to my mass. It's not difficult. We're not even close to 300 hundreds pounds. Look around there are many women fatter than us here</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she was right: the local plus-sized store had many women who was fatter than you looking around. You imitated them and looked around. A part of you (or was it Alice) wanted to try something a bit provoking, while the other want something more casual. After a while your attention focused on two different outfit:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- A white shirt (with the black bra) and the black skirt. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e1055549504d0d732eeac3173691ed2/tumblr_mi2zm8q4J71qzibl9o1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e1055549504...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- A v-neck dark pink t-shirt and the floral skirt. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a554747d411e8da7d1a0be909bc870a3/tumblr_mme5htcAoX1qzibl9o3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/a554747d411e...</a></span></div></div>",

Now can you please pick something so I can go on our date with Kim?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nYou sighed somewhat reluctantly and settled on a rather simple looking outfit, largely because you didn't really know what you were doing yet. A dark pink t-shirt with a floral skirt that seemed to match. You honestly never thought you'd like the idea of wearing a skirt, but the breeze between your legs was rather nice as you paid for it and walked out. As long as you kept wearing Alice's glasses, her body shape stuck with you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There</i>, grumbled Alice. <i>Now let's get some ice cream and ring up Kim. You better give me control this time or I'll make your life difficult.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned and stepped up to order some cookies and cream at the nearby ice cream shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, you were starting to have some second thoughts about all this. Being Alice for longer was doing weird stuff to your body and Alice was a bit of a control freak whenever you spoke with her. As you finished a big double scoop, you pulled out the phone and prepared to dial up Kim. All you wanted to do was just spend one night with Kim. But, per your agreement with Alice, she wasn't going to give you that chance. And staying in her body for another date was undoubtedly going to make your changes even worse when you eventually removed the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept another pill in your pocket as an option, just in case of emergencies. You could go back on your word and keep Alice out of your head for another time and...Then never wear the clothes again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr would you risk it and just see what happened? Or maybe something unexpected happens while you're at the mall?</span></div></div>",

You looked around: no one was looking at you and the nearest clients were too busy talking to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice...was that you?\" you whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sorry Simon, but these cookies are really good. Don't you find them delicious? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right actually. You've never eaten cookie n' creams but they did taste really good. Well, actually before these days you never ate so much and so high-calories food. Despite your taste for bigger girls you've always tried to control yourself. But now, being Alice, allowed you to... Thrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's right. You don't have to be so worried about anything sweetie.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't peek in my thoughts\" you said giving a furious bite to another cookie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, sorry. But I'm in your head. Do you remember? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd. But Alice behavior changed from yesterday. She was being nice for once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course I'm nice. I'm not your enemy Simon, never was. Plus, I know you have the pill in the pocket but you didn't take it. So... Why should I be mad? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed. You didn't know why, but you actually felt sympathetic towards Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill eating, Alice resumed her speech. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Look Simon, we do not need to fight foe Kim. I know you like her, but we can both have her. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you said munching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I mean... I will let you peek if you want. I'll be in control, but you will feel my date with Kim. Just don't fell asleep, otherwise you will lose it all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. You could basically 'watch' the date from your own head. It was like that movie with John Malkovich. It was crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's not crazy. Nevertheless I know that you are starting to like this body of mine. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour left hand moved by itself and reached for the curve of your belly over your pink shirt \"Hey what are you doing?\" you said still busy clearing the last two cookies. <br>\r\nIn reply, your hand gave your belly a gentle squeeze before massing it from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Relax.. Would you? I'm just letting you feel your own body. Isn't it nice to being like this? This.. Big... This soft </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft moaned escaped from your lips. She wasn't entirely wrong. From the first day of your transformation, you did enjoy being this different person, this chubby, gluttonous, red haired girl.<br>\r\nYour left hand got into your shirt and briefly touched your bra cup. <br>\r\nThe intimate touch made you jump a bit, as you lowered yourself on the table. You looked around. No one was looking at you. Luckily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"don't do that ever again\" you exclaimed with your face full red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sorry! I thought you boys liked that kind of thing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed \"just warn me next time\" you said trying to adjust yourself on the chair again. \"well cookies are over\" you said checking the plate \"time to switch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a sense of gratitude from within. After that you felt very odd. Like you smoked weed. Like you were tired and someone was lifting you up. And then it happened. You were like looking at your body under full anesthesia. You couldn't move your arms or legs.. Or mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Simon. Really.. Thank you\" your mouth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're... Welcome</i> you thoughts slowly with incredible difficulty. You felt like you were reading a book over someone else's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you didn't know was that Alice didn't aim only to have a date with Kim, but she wanted to.. </span></div></div>",

He was still eating when your body came nerby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there\" Alice said smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly finished the donut \"H-Hey..\" he said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to interrupt but I just moved near here and I don't know any direction.

Crumbles felt over him and her laps. \"Sorry I'm a bit clumsy\" she said giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. Maybe it was thr first time he met someone like that. You didn't know. You were watching Alice plotting from your own head without knowing what she would do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I take another?\" Alice said suddenly, she touched the guy shoulder casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped again. Then he passed the box to Alice \"Oh, don't worry. Take as much as you want\" his face full red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice giggled and planted a quick kiss on his cheek \"Thank you, you are really.. Really nice\" she said before grabbing another donut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...Robert, well they all call me Bob\" he said watching Alice gorging. She was a dirty little trickster. Every movement she made was just to make sure he get more excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed the donut she was eating again inside her mouth with her finger, as her cheeks inflated to make some space \"I'm Alice\" she replied swallowing loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?\" Bob exclaimed surprised. He only ate one donut while Alice was quickly finishing them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice giggled again \"Always\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob smiled too \"Than I'll sure seeing you again. I work as the pizza guy for the pizzeria between the mall and the campus. Are you from the campus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>See? Free pizza forever</i> she said to you inside her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're full of surprise.</i> you realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I need to go back now. Thank you for the snack Bob\" she said rising. She quickly kissed him again on the cheek while he was still sitting and waddled away. Bob could only say a quick 'bye' before realizing the whole situation. He stayed on the bench, looking at Alice ass (well your ass) wobbling in the distance. </span></div></div>",

So, what do you want to do tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of a few things over dinner...Come on in! I just ordered some pizzas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you were left to watch the master of seduction as Alice did everything in her power to woo Kim. It was the little things in how she would tug down her shirt a little to show off the teasing bit of cleavage. How she would touch Kim, be it on the arms or hand, at every chance she got. How she would laugh at every minor joke from Kim, even if it wasn't entirely funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the two of them were making out between shoveling bites of pizza, which Kim had ordered. They had gone through four pies combined already, though you could feel your shared stomach and tell that Alice was nowhere full yet. There was something ravenous in their display of affection and gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after finishing eight entire pies all on their own, their making out had gone to the floor complete with swollen stomachs and undone bras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't been just watching though.

She pinched the belly and wobbled it in her hand a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice got excited all of a sudden. You could feel a bit of easiness in her own mind. Maybe it was the right time. You needed to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put all your enegy into moving your right arm. Like milions of ant sent by your thoughts. You pictured it this way. <br>\r\nYou waited and focused and waited, and waited. Till your arm actually moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had already swallowed the pie and opened her mouth surprised. A moan now left your own mouth. You actually managed to \"be you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your arm jerked till your hand grabbed the first thing in the air...Kim's left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim eyes opened while a little moan left her lips too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey that's not fair. It's my turn</i> Alice voice reached inside your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim giggled, believing it was your way to say you were ready to make out.

You could still move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Kim had already recovered the pie and you felt her hands on your shoulders.

Chewing down the pie without any control. Kim was right, Alice was right. You felt good.<br>\r\nWhen Kim reached your lady parts, you slowly closed your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere inside your head, Alice smiled satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up already late in the morning near lunch time. <br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed was that you were again you. You were naked, in the bed in your room. No signs of Alice clothes around this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly panicked.

Her eyes raised with surprise as she looked at both of you before looking disappointed. \"Oh, it's you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Miss Pinkerton,\" said Alice. \"I've come to ask for a bit of a favor.

Maybe he will sleep there\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim rolled her eyes \"Perfect, just perfect. At least he could have told to me...whatever\" she said raising her shoulders. Odd enough you felt guilty all of a sudden. You remember there was something you shouldn't tell her. But couldn't remember what \"I think I'll go home. What about you?\"she added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfff....we will stay here longer, right Alice?\" Patricia quickly added with her arm quickly securing your wide girth. You nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well see you around Patti...Alice\" Kim waved and left the bar with you two looking at her go. Something in your mind kicked again, but you were unresponsive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Told you...\" Patricia said with her face close to yours \"It's hard to be around her sometimes\" she whispere, then she turned to you \"At least I've got you for the night. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her in the eyes and just smiled. You didn't really know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know..\" she said moving away some of your hair \"You're actually pretty cute like this\" she said biting her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden compliment sent a bumping in your heart. You suddenly felt really warm in the face especially on your cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Y-you too...\" you said after a second, looking away. Then you moaned in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happened?\" Patricia said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's..this belt...\" you said untying the belt Patricia gave you with the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...I think we misscalculted\" Patricia said giggling \"Maybe you're even bigger than me\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned again as your belly expanded onward and your bottom enlarge backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, you ARE bigger than me. You're gonna rip my dress...\" Patricia exclaimed in a hurry \"We better leave for my apartment before you became naked...just try to...control you. Or something like that\" she said rushing you to the exit. She paid the bill and sprinted with you to her car. You two were actually pretty drunk so you waddled again laughing like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait till I tell Kim about all of this Simon\" she giggled while driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Simon again ahahah\" you laughed. Patricia started laughing too, unknown about what is happening inside your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was short and you two safely got to Patricia apartment \"Don't worry my mate is away for a week\" she said opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe guided to the bedroom and sit on the bed \"OK. We made it\" she said catching her breath \"Now undress\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In front of you?\" you said shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh! We don't know how bigger you can get and I don't want to have my clothes ripped\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitant, you took off the cowl and started to remove the dress \"It's stuck\" you said after trying a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God lord...\" Patricia said getting up and helping you. After a bit of a struggle you finally removed the dress, as you remained with only your bra and the leggings. Your belly was indeed big. It helped your breast staying afloat, but it was actually so big to be diveded in two big rolls. The gut just jutted over the leggins. \"The leggins too\" Patricia said. This time she reached herself for the leggins and pulled them down. You obediently removed the boots kicking them away and you took away the leggins. You legs, now short and chubby wobbled in the air for some seconds, sending shocks to your bottom which tottered around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aughf...done\" she said again out of breath in front of you. You were actually trying to catch your breath too as you stood there with only the bra and the panty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you're not changing back\" Patricia noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do that even mean?\" you asked baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean look at this\" she said shaking your belly \"And this\" she shooking your ass \"And these..\" she said shooking your breasts. Everytime she touched you felt a brief shock of shy passing through you. Since the trasformation, you had shrunken down and you were now eye-to-eye to Patricia. You were both heavy breathing and so close, too close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drew near to Patricia lips and kissed her quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia opened your mouth.</span></div></div>",

As it slided behind your back you felt something odd on your head \"Hmmm Patti\" you said as she sit in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Alice?\" she said squeezing your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked her in the eyes. Alice? Yeah that was your name. \"Sorry I..\" you stammered as under Patricia t-shirt your breasts developed once again. It seemed that wearing the cowl and the glasses boost the transformation speed. Or maybe it was that your body had already experimented such change. Your mind already gently swifting to your alice persona. \"I had a small blackout\" your belly and ass inflated once more. Your hand reached a donut \"you know?\" *chew chew\" \"I remember going to the bed with you but..\" you felt your hand squeezed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia was chewing a donut herself \"and what do you remember of the bedtime?\" she said with a not so innocent smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled as Patricia started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"we were drunk\" you said taking another donut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye. We were\" she traces the back of your hand with her finger. Suddenly she passed it on your hairless arm squeezing your forearm \"And now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled shy, as you got your face close to Patti. You slowly closed your eyes as she kissed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say? Wanna hang out together?\" Patricia asked \"Sorry Simon, but I want to spend some more time with Alice..\" she thought to herself. </span></div></div>",

But first it's better if we recover your bra. Can't go around with these..\" she said pinching your nipples under your borrowed t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ouchhhh\" you screamed but you were cut short by Patricia kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only I can see them\" she whispered tracing your double chin with her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded smiling. You followed Patricia in her room and undressed keeping your glasses on (oddly enough Patricia said that you shouldn't ever take them off). Patricia t-shirt and sweatpants were at least big enough to contain your plus size body. She also gave you a pair of her pink and white sneakers and her hair bend to fix your hair. Finally a bit of make-up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're good to go\" she said hugging you from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\" you turned around and rubbed your nose with Patricia's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatti smiled \"We're going to have a blast me and you\" she said excited guiding you outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you reached the car, Kim was waiting outside \"Hey Patti\" she waved her hand then noted you \"Hey Alice\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved at her while Patricia hugged Kim \"Hey!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you two see Simon? He didn't returned yet\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuhhh... Nope\" Patricia said \"We remained at the bar for the night and then went sleeping here. We are going to the mall. Wanna come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim shook her head looking at you. She didn't notice that you were so fat the first time she saw you. Then she reached for Patricia \"Tell me, are you going out with Alice only because she's bigger than you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia looked upset and pointed a finger \"That's why I'm going out with Alice\" she said opening the car door \"C'mon\" she gestured to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happened?\" you asked as soon as Kim left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia rolled her eyes. Then she looked at you. She knew she was done something wrong. She had basically forced her friend to become another person because.. Well because that felt right. She wanted to spend some time with someone who would understand her and not judge her. And Alice seemed just perfect \"She's envious of us. Just that\" she said starting the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two spent some hours at the mall, browsing clothes and snacking together. You really had a strong bond with Patricia. Since that was actually one of the few thing that you remembered. Your memories was actually foggy. Why you were at the campus in the first place? You clearly remember you were friend with her and Kim than you were looking for an apartment and talked with the RA. But before that... Nothing. </span></div></div>",

She seemed familiar. Where did you see her again? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Alice. You could at least phone your auntie once in a while to tell her where you were. I was so worried\" she said when you were near \"you also forgot your necklace at home\" she said placing a pearl necklace around your neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze for a second as odd memories reached inside your mind.

Now I understand\" she nodded without making much sense. Then she reached for Patricia \"So you're my niece friend Patricia.

I want to thank her personally for her help\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled \"Sure\" you said going to the shop nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not Alice's auntie\" Patricia said as soon as you've left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn laughed \"And you're not Simon's friend\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how do you know?\" Patricia asked \"You..you did the cowl to Simon\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn smiled wickedly \"Atta girl.

It's you you should answer. What do you want of him? You were responsible for his trasformation. I told you, your eyes cannot lies, you preferred Alice to Simon...\" Ann mouth opened up again in a wicked smile \"and I can make it happens if you want..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" Patricia basically yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying you will have your friend Alice and I'll have a niece to help me in the house and in the shop.

She had something with her eyes that made it so she looked at everyone like they were a delicious piece of meat to be eaten. Yet, the offer she was making was extremely tempting. It had been a long time since Patricia had any sort of fun with someone her size. Or made that kind of connection with someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This deal,\" Patricia said. \"What's it involve, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a little bit of this and that. Mix a few potions and have the right people drink them. Do you know if he had any immediate family who would notice he went missing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, never you mind that. I'll take care of everything, darling. When I'm through with him, Simon will never have existed in the minds of everyone he's ever met. And you don't have to do a thing. Just sit back and help him enjoy his new life. Or should I say hers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia swallowed hard and said. \"Very well, I accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the deal went without you even being aware of it. As far as you cared, you were a short chubby named Alice who lived with her Aunt Ann ever since your parents died in an unfortunate train accident. The rest of the blanks were filled by the lies told to you by Ann and Patricia throughout the rest of your first month as Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia a few odds things changed. For once, Kim forgot all about your old life and instead moved in with your old friend, Ted. All your teachers simply forgot about him. And, as far as Patricia knew, your parents never called asking about you. As for the disguise of Alice itself, Ann had provided Patricia with plenty of options to ensure the transformation never came undone. You were given \"gifts\" in the form of new clothes and necklaces that you had to swear you'd never take off. Patricia was funny like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, you passed the time studying at a community college in social studies as well as working at your Ann's shop to earn a little extra spending money. You had just started dating with Patricia which was going so well that you were even starting to gain some extra weight, not that she seemed to mind. She was starting to look a little pudgy too and that was making the sex even spicier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all seemed perfect, though even that was too good to last. Perhaps it was in something Patricia had forgotten about or because of someone you might find in Ann's shop one day. Or maybe something else entirely?</span></div></div>",

She sucked loudly from her straw. You two were sitting together on a bench at the college campus and were having lunch like every other day in the previous two months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patti\" you fully opened your eyes \"you know I need to help aunt Ann at the shop too. It's just me and her.\" you rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you felt a chubby hand poking on your wide thigh, you raised your eyes to see Patricia with her eyebrows raised \"Aren't you forgetting about me? \" in the last period, other than gaining some more pounds Patricia had also cut her hair short with bangs. She really looked gorgeous. You stopped drinking just to nod and rubbed your nose against hers.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you adorable?\" she said tickling your double chin as you giggled. You had also put some weight gain due to Patricia complicity and snacking habits you took when you became Alice. As Ann explained your female side, being born by your own-mind (due to Ms. Pinkerton hole in cowl) was basically instilled with the contrary of your same being.<br>\r\nAlice was extroverted where you were shy.<br>\r\nShe was glutton where you were self-controlled. <br>\r\nShe was a bit absent minded where you were focused, and so on. <br>\r\nOf course Patricia was on the same wavelength and in the past were only in check by Kim influence. Since your transformation Patricia had cut her friendship with Kim and progressively left herself indulge in her habits without thinking about consequences.<br>\r\nYou now weighted around the three hundreds with Patricia around two hundreds and a half (like your aunt Ann).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not all. Due to your prolonged \"life\" in your new body (thanks to the complicity of both Patricia and Ann which had you wear magical clothes and jewelery) you were now stuck as Alice, both in body and mind and Simon was just a memory in Ann and Patricia's heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh why hello! So you're attending in the college too. Are you living around here? Alice if i remember correctly\" a voice called you and Patricia back in the reality. It was Ms. Pinkerton. From you last visit she was finally able to see better again \"Hello Patricia\" she waved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze \"Hello Ms. Pinkerton\" she had forgotten about you fixing Ms. Pinkerton eyesight and the glasses. That was not all. Ms. Pinkerton was now clearly sporting a red tone on her hair and a youthfulness she didn't have before. Probably as she had predicted when the two of you met, the DNA of the cowl (and the glasses) spreaded like a virus. In her case it was a slowly process, but it would progress whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" you explained \"my aunt live not far from here so I stayed with her\" as your Aunt explained to you, you were in the college looking for an apartment to stay near your friend Patricia when you felt sick and had a blackout. You really didn't remember anything about the day so you trusted both your friend and your aunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\" she said, then She reached for your ear \"I've never had the chance to thank you for your help Alice..\" she paused and looked at you \"You know the first time we met I didn't note you were so...in good shape\" she said with a nervous smile. Ms. Pinkerton was never been thin herself, but she clearly remembered you were much more thinner than you were now \"well don't worry. If that's also part of your secret.. It is in good hands\" she winked before leaving you two and departing for her building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia secretly eavesdropped the whole conversation and was now very nervous. Ms. Pinkerton knew too much. Something needed to be done.<br>\r\nMaybe she could break Ms. Pinkerton glasses, that could stopped the effect, or maybe she could ask Ann for help, she might have a potion or something to get ride of Ms. Pinkerton...</span></div></div>",

That led up until the both of you visited your aunt's shop for your daily work quota in the evening shift. But you shrugged it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop was like your new most favorite place in the world. It had so many wonderful clothes and baubles that you loved working there in your spare time. It reminded you of someplace safe, almost a home away from home. You especially loved the days when your aunt would let you run the shop yourself. When business slowed, you would sneak in the back and try on clothes. The outfits your aunt had there were strange in that no matter how small or big the clothes looked at a glance, they always seemed to fit you perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived, you grabbed your apron and set off to the backroom to start dusting as per usual. Patricia, on the other hand, lingered around your aunt until you were out of earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then spent the next few minutes explaining the encounter you had just had with Ms. Pinkerton as well as your history with the old woman, though she was certainly starting to look a few years younger now. Ann listened to her and nodded along. Your aunt had a habit of giving Patricia the creeps sometimes, but she wouldn't ever say why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Ann said when Patricia was finished. \"So, not only did Simon end up passing on the enchantment of the cowl through glasses, but he somehow made it so the old woman would slowly become an exact duplicate of Alice. I'd very much like to speak with this woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you need to take this more seriously,\" Patricia whispered. \"If they found out what we did to Simon, his friends, and his family...Well, I don't know what they'll do but what we did was definitely illegal somehow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax would you? I haven't been caught since Salem. And those idiots thought a fire would be enough to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless...Shouldn't we find a way to keep this under wraps as quietly as possible? If only to not spook Alice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true. I've grown quite fond of having a little helper around my shop. And she has an appetite of magic too. She's so cute when she's trying on the enchanted wardrobe and doesn't think I notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what can we do to fix this? Can you just yap away her memories like the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One shouldn't devolve to memory charms at every foul up else the wrong sort might take notice to such a misuse of magic. Besides that, I am very interested to hear what a scientist has to say about magic in this day and age. Therefor, I want you to bring her to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Why do I have to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was your error in forgetting about this woman until just now. Therefore, it's your mess to fix. I will supply you with the tools you need to lure her my way, forcefully or otherwise. The rest is up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia gulped as Ann dug around in her safe, the one place she told you never to go. Inside were all sorts of powerful magics well beyond the clothing enchantments she was most famous for. She turned around to Patricia, holding up the item which would be used to bring Pinkerton to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

She looked closely at the small hairclip she had in her hand. It was black with two white stripes at the end. It just looked like any other hairclip someone would found in some market. Ann looked at her smiling.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Patricia said placing the hairclip between a lock of her hair \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn smile widened \"Try it out.\" she said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I command you to....open your mouth\" she added after a while<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH AH AH\" Ann laughed loudly. So loud that even you heard your aunt laughing. \"Is everything all right there?\" you said waddling with the broom where they were and peeking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aunt was still laughing:\"Oh, don't you worry Alice. I think you've dusted enough. Why don't you keep an eye on the door instead? We don't wont to miss a client, don't we?\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. Your aunt was your only relative after all and in the years, she always had her way to make you obey. \"...Right!\" you said quickly. You left the broom there and waddle to the entrance of the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" Patricia asked red in the face when you were far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you've misunderstood how the hairclip works dearie\" she said twisting the stone she had as necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it work, then?\" Patricia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's easier done than said ahaha\" she laughed wickedly, then she drew near Patricia. She breathed \"I own you\" she stated....A small shock passed through Patricia body. \"Now, then...jump\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia blinked one time, before feeling an odd sensation in her legs. She had to jump. Even if she didn't want. She started jumping in place in a slow speed. Her whole body jiggling. She couldn't say anything regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop\" Ann said after a while \"....You can move freely\" she stated again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike being released by an invisible force, Patricia stopped trying to recover her breath \"Oh my god. It's awful...I-I coulnd't disobey nor talk\" she said removing the hairclip from her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why all hated it. It's even so small that it's nearly invisible to common eyes. It has its limitation however: it can only work with physical order jump, follow, walk, etc...you cannot influence someone's mind.\" she said closing Patricia hand in a fist around the hairclip \"You got it right? Place it between this woman's hair. Order her to follow you with the words \"I own you\" followed by the command and when she will be here you can use the other command to stop her. Easy enough.\" she added <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already 7.00 pm and you could finally close the shop. You removed your apron and reached your friend and your aunt as they were advancing in the shop discussing something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and don't worry about Simon's parents and friends. As long as Alice is happy and she is believing this reality, there won't be any Simon in people's memories..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....oh that's why...\" you heard Patti whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No customer this evening auntie\" you said sad approaching them and lowering your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn quickly raised your chin with her finger \"Don't worry Alice. We are not going bankrupt...not yet\" she laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auntie don't say that!\" you yelled, laughing a bit and then suddenly stopped. Patti was pondering on something with a serious face. \"What's on your mind Patti?\" you asked worried.  Only when she came to the shop and talked with your Aunt she was like this \"Does Aunt Ann said something troubling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face turned in a smile in an istant:\"Don't worry Alice. I was asking your Aunt about...something...it's a surprise\" she lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Enough talk. We need to eat ladies. These bellies won't fill by themselfes\" she said laughing again and making her whole body wobbling around \"C'mon. Let's go grab some fries. It's my treat!\" she said opening the door of the shop. Patricia was a bit worried. This overweight woman she had nearby could switch from a lovely aunt to a creepy witch in the snap of a finger. Anyway she needed to think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Patricia..</span></div></div>",

She played with the idea of having you involved for moral support, before quickly deciding against it. The last thing she wanted was you asking questions which might lead to you getting your memories back at some point. Too risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she was going to wait until you set off for your evening work shift. She circled around the block and headed straight for the old apartment complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy enough for her to jimmy her way in, having done so many times when she and Kim were still friends. Though Patricia hadn't spoken to her in quite some time, and even you sensed there was still some bitterness there whenever she got brought up as a subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia had a plan as she approached the formerly old woman's room and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a moment,\" Ms. Pinkerton said as she answered the door. \"Wait, don't I know you? Yes...We met yesterday, didn't we? You're Alice's squeeze, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia blushed and not just because Pinkerton was starting to look a little like Alice in the face with the slight changes being done to her by the glasses. \"That's right, ma'am. I was, uh, actually interested in speaking with you if you're not busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, little old me? Whatever for, dearie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask you...If I could look into renting out of your rooms for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the problem with that is I'm not exactly the landlord here and these are supposed to primarily be dorms for the local university.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I go to school here, but just in one of the other dorms. I was looking to move over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you say so? Come on in and we'll figure this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStep one complete, get to have a personal and private talk with Pinkerton without her or anyone else suspecting foul play. Now all Patricia had to do was somehow convince Pinkerton to wear the hairclip and then the game would be over. Or so Ann had told her. Step two was going to run into a few hurdles though as a problem occurred...</span></div></div>",

Maybe you can also convince Alice to join us here. What do you say?\" she said rising the cup and smiling with her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia became suspicious. Ms. Pinkerton was clearly fishing for something. She needed to be cautious. The wrong word would have alarmed Ms. Pinkerton.<br>\r\n\"Of course. Of course. I mean the more the better, right?\" she said rising the cup of tea too and smiling with her eyes. She needed to place the clip on Ms. Pinkerton fast.

I'll tell you what. After we've fixed Ms. Pinkerton here I would gladly grant you something you wish\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia was taken aback.

She couldn't bring herself to oppose her. Her mind raced to Simon and Alice. She wasn't a Saint either.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ann recovered the machine hose and gently brought it near Pinkerton head. The hose hole progressively got bigger until it was basically a cap which Ann fixed on Pinkerton head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time\" Ann solemnly said before switching the machine on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia was still fixed on Pinkerton face which was a mixture of confusion and terror.

It's even painless. She's slowly losing consciousness. This will become only a dream for her\" Ann said to Patricia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle by little Pinkerton hair turned from black and red to her whitish colour. Wrinkles appeared again on his face. Even some of her curves deflated. Meanwhile her eyes closed and her mouth opened in some kind of smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Ann exclaimed as the vacuum cleaner finished its job. She reached for Pinkerton head and recovered the hairpin, before slowly taking down the hose. <br>\r\nPinkerton was again her old safe, she was still standing with her eyes closed and a sort of snoring. Ann removed Pinkerton glasses \"It will be better to destroy it\" she said making the glass disappear in her clothes. Then, she opened the vaccum cleaner and recovered a small sphere not bigger then a nut. She opened her mouth and swallow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what was that?\" Patricia exclaimed surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pinkerton memories and Alice's essence I've removed with the machine. I've told you I was curious about her discovery. Plus, I could use some youth. Don't worry though, I'm not going to turn into Alice, it will just take some years off me.\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Pinkerton?\" Patricia asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes...\" Ann said recovering Pinkerton hand. She whispered something in her ears and gently guided her to the door, where a hooded figure was standing by.<br>\r\nShe returned shortly after to Patricia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled \"You sure ask a lot of question my dear Patti\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.

That\u2019s it, I\u2019m coming in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrasping at your now bruised knee, you could only sit there and wait as Ted opened the lock to check on his friend. You closed your eyes and waited for the impending discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon, bro?\u201d he called, turning the corner to your room and stopping short. \u201cOh, shit. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know he had a girl over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d you said in your own voice. \u201cHey Ted, I can explain\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you did. Ted was a big guy, bigger than you by a good couple of inches. And he helped you up to sit you down to the kitchen in order to hear you explain your story to him. He wasn\u2019t that surprised by it all, well, he was a little bit doing the bug eyed thing as he adjusted to the fact that your voice was coming out of such a sultry face. But Ted was always quick on the updates and took your changes in stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you talked, you began to feel a little more comfortable in the clothes you were wearing. The way they were brushing against your arms and legs. You glanced down and discovered why that was. The hair on your limbs had receded entirely, leaving your skin  with a rather smooth disposition that was soft to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Patricia guilted you into going on a date with her? That\u2019s a little shitty of her to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my fault anyway. I should have just told Kim about the cowl. Now I\u2019m in this mess and stuck. But maybe I can get a little closer to Kim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot looking like that, unless she\u2019s into chicks. Speaking of which, you do look kinda hot. Minus the man bod, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, thanks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never been complimented by a guy like that before and it felt a little strange. Maybe the cowl was doing funny things to your head. Ted thought for a moment, as he tended to do with a particularly hard math problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what,\u201d he said before continuing...</span></div></div>",

And I was looking for something to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d you asked, though trying not to sound ungrateful for the offer. \u201cI mean, this is all pretty strange to begin with. And I don\u2019t want you to waste your afternoon keeping company over this weird thing I\u2019m involved in. I\u2019d hate to be a bother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, you\u2019re not a bother at all. I\u2019m actually kind of curious on how you\u2019ll end up, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed a little nervously. \u201cActually, I kind of am too. This is all strange to me, but it\u2019s kind of exciting too. It\u2019s really just bizarre to be thinking like this, but maybe it\u2019s kind of fun to be dressing up and pretending to be someone else, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd maybe all this might get you in touch with your feminine side or something, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a positive way of looking at it. You suddenly felt a whole lot better with Ted here with you. He had a habit of looking directly into your eyes, which made you feel like he could see right through them. You unconsciously played with your hair as you stared back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat to play some video games while we wait?\u201d he offered, taking charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed picked the game to play, Super Smash Bros, and the two of you enjoyed a round of beating on bots before you had warmed up enough to play each other. You always had a preference for Princess Peach while he alternated between Mario and Luigi. As the dueling round started, you got really into it. Ted was known to be a pretty good player, enough that he could challenge the leagues in clubs around the college. But it came as a surprise to you when you won the round, almost too easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re throwing the game,\u201d you accused him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah,\u201d he smirked. \u201cYou\u2019re just that good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh, well why don\u2019t we play a round again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you started up, a weird dizziness overtook you, but you ignored it. The controller began to feel a bit heavier in your hands, but you were determined. Ted was actually putting up a good fight this time. But, at the last minute, he jumped off the ledge and died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I know you\u2019re just trying to lose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he replied. \u201cJust a little distracted. You\u2019re looking a little...Slimmer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced down at yourself to see what he meant only to be greeted by a pair of sticklike arms. An odd tingling was going up to your elbows and into your chest. You suddenly began to feel a little frail as you could feel your breathing. In and out. In and out. In and in again. Your entire stomach seemed to concave a little, catching you by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Ted asked with some concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening,\u201d you said, putting two hands to your shrunken waist. \u201cI\u2019m...Changing a little more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went like a wave from your stomach all the way to the tips of your toes. Every part of your body was thinning down to a petite size, making Patricia\u2019s clothes feel very big on you. You were almost like a child playing dress up, though you were still the same height. Sitting next to Ted wasn\u2019t helping matters, seeing he was always buffer and taller than you were. He liked to exercise and had some large biceps. Your mind briefly wondered what he would look like without his shirt on when you shook your head and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to use the bathroom\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

You felt like you could blow away in the wind and Ted staring right at you didn\u2019t help matters too much. Especially with how the neck of your dress went low down your chest given your diminished state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much do you normally weigh?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno about one sixty or so. Maybe a little higher with all that cafeteria food--Hey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Ted reached over, put his hands under your armpits, and lifted you right off of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you weigh one twenty now,\u201d he commented, hoisting you up and down a few times for good measure. \u201cEasy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI lost forty pounds?\u201d you gawked. \u201cNo wonder I feel so weaker\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re feeling weak? Here, we should sit you down then. I\u2019ll get you some water and maybe a little food to keep your strength up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to protest until Ted started carrying you bridal style over to the couch, holding you close to his chest enough that you could feel his hard pecs beneath his sweater. No wonder the guy was able to lift you so effortlessly. He was built like a bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment was over too quickly as he left you on the sofa to fetch water from the sink. You frowned as you looked down at yourself. With your head transformed and your body taking a more feminine shape, there was very little of \u201cSimon\u201d left. You couldn\u2019t help but notice a slight protrusion from beneath your dress. You blushed and folded it down with your now petit hands. Were you actually enjoying this? Or was it Ted\u2019s presence that was doing weird things to your brain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t left wondering for long as Ted returned with the glass and some crackers...</span></div></div>",

Though it was a small amount of food, it seemed to do a lot of good for your changing body. \u201cThanks, Ted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. What if you took off the cowl and called this off with Patricia? I\u2019m sure she\u2019d get it if she knew what it was doing to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you spoke with a surprising amount of force. \u201cI made a promise and I intend to keep it. Besides...I think I kind of like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected Ted to laugh at that and call you crazy, you were certainly feeling that way about the matter. But he surprised you with very sympathetic and almost...Gladdened eyes combined with an encouraging smile as he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it kind of suits you, I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long awkward silence as you struggled to come up with the first thing you could think of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, want to watch a movie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Which one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as you were slowly starting to adjust to your new body, you found yourself giving into the temptations that came with it. Namely the desire to watch the specific romcom genre as your first instinct. To your surprise, Ted did not object and only gave a slight smile as you turned a movie which sounded good on Netflix. Always be My Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself getting much more emotionally invested in the movie than you initially thought you would. It was when Ted caught you sniffing that he handed over the box of tissues on the table for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d you mumbled, such a display would have bruised your ego without the cowl. But now you were feeling very dainty and feminine. \u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s no problem. Nothing wrong with a good cry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed seemed to know exactly what to say as he had his arms stretched out on the couch. You were suddenly come over with an odd desire to lean closer into him. You were beginning to feel smaller again, in some specific areas too despite being flustered. And before you knew it, your shoulder was resting against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this okay?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d he replied with complete confidence as he moved his arm over your neck. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you continued watching the movie.

Only while that seemed to be focused solely on your muscles, this was something deeper. Like it was twisting your very bones. You felt like you were sinking and quickly stood to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Ted asked, standing up with a look of concern. When you found yourself looking up at him moreso than usual, you both quickly saw the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like the ground was slowly swallowing you up as your legs wobbled around from their decreasing mass. Down and down you went, going from eye level to Ted's nose, to his chin, to his chest, and further still. You felt like you were in the worst elevator ever as the apartment seemed to get bigger all around you. Only it wasn't that the world was becoming larger. You knew that it was you who was shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the clothes you were wearing started to slide off you. The cowl was a close enough fit, though meant for someone much weightier in size, though Patricia's clothes were not. The belt which you had been using to support the black dress on your waist fell right off onto the floor and the tights were starting to feel very loose with nothing to fill them. You looked like a little girl trying to fit into her parents. You certainly felt exposed as Ted now towered over you. You were almost at eye level with his navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like a freaking midget!\" you squeaked in a voice that was much higher pitched than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a midget,\" Ted assured you. \"You're just, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, really short?\" you asked before laughing. \"Wow. I mean...Holy shit, dude. What a rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not...Upset by this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I mean, it was a little surprising at first. But this is just so strange!\" you walked around a bit, admiring the enlarged furniture. \"Everything is just so big! Especially you. Here, pick me up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't give him much chance to prepare as you practically jumped into his arms. Ted braced himself but was caught off guard by how little force there was to your sudden leap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do I weigh now?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lighter,\" he commented, you felt like a toy in his arms. \"Much. Ninety five pounds, easy. Definitely less than a hundred. And at that height, you gotta be at least 4'10.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, closer to 4'8, I'd wager,\" you said as you patted his chest. \"Give or take an inch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was like a mountain from your perspective, each pec larger than the size of your head. Though you could sense his worried glances coming your way. He was definitely starting to have second thoughts about all this with you. You wondered how you could make him see and enjoy it with you. Maybe it was the rush of having lost almost half of your body's total mass, but you were rather excited by all this. You just wanted to share it with Ted and let him feel what this was doing to you as the arousal set in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and...</span></div></div>",

But why\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to check the store out for myself,\u201d Patricia said with a smug smile. \u201cIt stands to reason that if they have one piece of magical clothing, they might have more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious? I mean, come on Patricia. This shit could be dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSays the guy who was too scared to tell Kim about it because he wants to get into her pants,\u201d she commented and saw your blush run down to your navel. \u201cI mean, come on Simon. You\u2019re so obvious around her it\u2019s a wonder she hasn\u2019t noticed yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe, uh, hasn\u2019t noticed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, and if you want me to soil your chances I can go back in and tell her all about it and this little bit of enchanted cloth. Now come on, Simon. I\u2019m trying to seem nice here by asking for a favor. One little favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relented with a grunt. Patricia could be extremely manipulative when she was given the chance to be. You had just never been on the receiving end before, though you had seen it all the time when she would guilt Kim into eating out with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I think it\u2019s over here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe street was a sight different in the dark, with only the streetlamps and smaller crowds. No one suspected a thing odd about two college students walking together looking through the older part of town through the shop windows. In fact, they might even see you two as a couple, though you\u2019d never admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you came to a shop you were sure was the place. Only it was dark on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think this is it,\u201d you said, reading the sign out front. \u201cThey closed at five. We\u2019ll have to come back tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Patricia didn\u2019t seem to be listening to you as she wandered around the alleyway off to the side. You weren\u2019t about to protest until she started stacking boxes for reaching the window above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh,\u201d she hissed your way. \u201cI just want to take a quick peek inside. Not going to steal anything or nothing. Just need to make sure this is the place and you\u2019re not trying to throw me off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy word isn\u2019t good enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were lying to Kim just a moment ago and I\u2019d call having a magic cowl grounds to be suspicious about anything otherwise. Now just keep watch and I\u2019ll go around to open the door for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes at Patricia\u2019s fruitless attempts to squeeze into the window. You hadn\u2019t the heart to tell her that the size of her butt would make the effort impossible, given she\u2019d never be able to fit. She must have realized it after jumping and failing a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeeey, Simon,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a skinny guy, right? Why don\u2019t you slip inside and do it for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m willing to show you to the shop but I draw the line at breaking and entering.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to know what Kim really thinks about you? Like, no bullshit. She\u2019s told me her feelings about you? Want to know if you\u2019re more than just a friend material?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...That\u2019s cheating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the last thing, I swear. Once we\u2019re in I\u2019ll let you off the hook and tell you everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to grunt as you stepped onto the boxes she had been using for a makeshift ladder. You mumbled to yourself. \u201cI don\u2019t see why this place is a sudden obsession for you.\u201d Before you jumped and pulled yourself into the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a stick in comparison to Patricia, you were able to easily shimmy your way in.

Just scanning through them, they came in all shapes and sizes but all of them were also distinctly for women of a larger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon,\u201d you heard Patricia hiss from outside. \u201cAre you in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019m fine, thanks for asking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo around and unlock the backdoor. I\u2019ll be waiting there for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunted as pulled yourself to your feet. It was a challenge to navigate the shop in the dark. You seemed to have ended up in one of the back rooms that you had seen out of the corner of your eye when you first visited the place. And you couldn\u2019t very well turn on a light switch to see where you were going or you might give away that you had broken in to the neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, you shuffled you way into the hall, loudly kicking one of the steps up and cursing your stubbed toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you made it to what you assumed was the backdoor and unlocked it to find Patricia waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, now step aside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved past you and you gave a loud mumble as she stepped on your already stubbed toe. She then pulled out her phone to light the way you were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd quiet,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the owner to find out we\u2019ve been here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, what\u2019s the deal?\u201d you asked, now demanding an answer. \u201cYou\u2019ve been acting weird ever since I told you about this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I tell you, will it get you to shut up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPatricia, seriously, what\u2019s up? You were never normally like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, Simon,\u201d she said, grasping at her head. \u201cA year ago, a very good friend named Sarah of mine went missing. Police looked all over for her and never found any trace of her. Her parents just said she had been traveling abroad and spoke with her every week. But she left without a word to any of her friends her and I\u2019ve not seen her since. Not until today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up the cowl in her hand. \u201cThis? This was hers. It was the last thing I saw her wearing before she disappeared. And weirder still? When Kim was wearing it, she looked just like her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you asked somewhat in shock. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me. Then how\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s what I aim to find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd find out you would as the two of you went deeper into the store. You suddenly had a funny feeling about the clothing pile you had landed in. You would discover exactly what had been going on as you turned to the basement as the last place to check. Inside you would discover that Patricia's friend \"Sarah\" never actually existed...</span></div></div>",

What if this is dangerous? We should turn the cowl into the police and then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon, whatever happened to Sarah is not natural. Jackets don\u2019t just turn you into other people. Can\u2019t you see what\u2019s going on? I tried to get the police involved by they were stopped. Something...Magical is covering whatever happened to her up. I finally have a lead and I\u2019m not going to lose it. Now you can stand there and do nothing or be a man and follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t much care for someone questioning your manliness like you had something to prove about it as you followed Patricia close down the stairs. Voice you had heard from before morphed into a female hum as the two of you crept as silently as you could into the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rather curious sight that looked much like a laundromat with various outfits hanging up to dry and machines tumbling to disguise your footsteps. Standing over an ironing board was a rather large woman. You squinted for a moment as you whispered to Patricia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the woman who gave me the cowl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she doesn\u2019t look so tough. Maybe she can answer some questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Patti! Don\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late as she stepped out from the shadows and approached the woman from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have some questions for you,\u201d Patricia said, hands on her wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper didn\u2019t so much as jump, she only turned around slowly. Her smile was wide as she caught you still trying to hide on the stairwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, if it isn\u2019t my friend from this afternoon. How are you enjoying my little gift?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you ignore me,\u201d Patricia fought for attention, being a whole head shorter than the shopkeeper. \u201cWhy do you have my friend\u2019s cowl? And why does it turn you into my friend when you wear it? Answer me before I call the police.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look familiar,\u201d the shopkeeper thought for a moment. \u201cOh, now I remember! Your name is Patricia, isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you stalking me?\u201d Patricia said, opening her cellphone she had been using for a light to dial a number. \u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019m calling them. Hope you like jail, bitch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the shopkeeper reached into a pouch at her side and threw a handful of sparkling dust at Patricia. Your friend\u2019s friend sputtered and coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is this--Ugh--I got it in my mouth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you blinked and in a split second Patricia was gone. It was like she had vanished into thin air, leaving only her clothes and phone behind as they collapsed into a heap on the floor of the basement. Across from the scene, the shopkeeper clicked her tongue and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch a pity,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, at least I have a new outfit to sell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha,\u201d you stammered from the stairs. \u201cWhat the hell did you do to her? Where did she go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s still here,\u201d the shopkeeper gestured to clothes on the floor. \u201cJust taking on a slightly different form, as it were. You can put those on, if you\u2019d like, and you\u2019ll see her again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou turned her into clothes!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly...The truth is a bit more complicated than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, can you change her back to normal at least?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Be a dear and gather those clothes up for me and then bring them over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as commanded, blushing as your sorted through Patricia's discarded panties and bra. All her clothes were still warm from her lingering body heat as you bundled them up in your arms. You also pocketed her cellphone for good measure as you were gestured over to the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that corner was a mannequin, no different that one you might find in any department store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put an article of clothing on that dummy,\" ordered the shopkeeper as she folded her arms. \"Anything will do. Whatever's easiest for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia had been wearing her standard outfit when around school, jeans and a tank-top under a plush pink hoodie with your college logo on it. You settled for the hoodie as that seemed the simplest to fit over the white plastic dummy. It took a little maneuvering, but you managed to do what you were told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" you asked with some concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch,\" answered the shopkeeper as she pointed to the top of the mannequin. \"Look at the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as you watched closely, there seemed to be strands of light hair growing out of the dummy's skull sprouting like weeds. The hair grew longer and longer until you could see a definite blonde sheen to it as the hairstyle became more evident. It was Patricia's hair that was growing out of the dummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process took about ten minutes, though you were engrossed with it like an odd fixation. You watched as the hair trailed down the dummy's neck until it was in the exact same shape and style as Patricia's moments ago. Then a discoloration formed at the dummy's pale face. It was then you realized that it was human skin forming like a growth. Eyes took shape where there had once been empty sockets. The mouth of the mannequin grew lips that seemed to move. Before look, you found the face of Patricia starting back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon?\" it asked. \"What happened? Why can't I move? Or hear anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was because the dummy hadn't yet grown ears, though that was slowly underway. The pale flesh of Patricia's body etched forward all around the dummy's head and down its neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making sense yet?\" the shopkeeper asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" you pieced it together. \"You throw that weird powder at people and it turns them into clothes...Which in turn causes whatever wears them to turn into the owner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less. Though it's not really so much that they're turned into clothes, more like their essence is infused in the outfit. Haven't you ever heard the saying that the clothes make the man? It's actually quite literal, in this case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that would mean if I removed the hoodie,\" you reached over to the Patricia dummy and hoisted the sweater off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Simon!\" Patricia called to you as her skin slowly returned to its plastic white. \"Everything's getting dark! What's happening to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off as the mannequin fully returned to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of creepy,\" you couldn't help but say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But powerful magic,\" replied the shopkeeper. \"That girl is now effectively immortal. Though she has control over herself with a non sentient, like an animal or a dummy. If you were to wear that hoodie, you would be in full control of yourself unless you let her do so otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you asked. \"Why do this? And why would you give away the one of Patricia's friend Sarah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper pursed her lips at you as she gave you her answer...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Little did you know, Patricia had her own priorities in mind. She and Kim were usually the best of best friends, being bartenders together meant they faced a lot while on the job. The problems lied in outside of work where their interests tended to diverge. Kim liked to exercise and study hard, for example. Patty liked to be lazy and eat. And given Kim was thin and fit, Patricia tended to get made fun of for being a whale while around her in comparison. So, while they got along fine, what Patricia really wanted was a friend just like her deep down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing an opportunity for just that, she smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Simon. We can keep playing along and pretending she's normal until we can find a way to get the cowl off without her noticing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed a sigh of relief. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two of you returned to Kim, who had unbuttoned the top of her jeans while eating the burger she had ordered. You gulped at the sight of her butt having become even bigger than when the two of you excused herself. She was getting larger and it was kind of exciting. You never told anyone that you had a deep interest in watching skinny girls get fat. But this was something else, it was really happening before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" Kim chimed when she looked up. \"Work out that homework assignment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you asked. \"Oh, right. Uh, we figured it out. We'll work on it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I didn't say hello earlier, Kim,\" Pat chuckled. \"It's been a long day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even worry about it. Man, I am murdering this burger right now. Yours is ready too, Simon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at the wad of beef and bacon between a bun and swallowed. \"I'm, uh, I'm actually feeling a little sick, at the moment. Those pretzels didn't agree with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I take it then?\" Pat asked. \"Saves me for buying something myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it! Though that means I still owe you a dinner, Simon,\" Kim said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled slightly and gulped, wondering if she would still be on board with all this if she ever figured out what was happening to her. She was still the same person underneath the new face. She actually looked kind of cute now that you admitted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished the burger, Kim stretched out her arms above her head, which was followed by a rather loud crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omph,\" she said. \"I think that was my back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you realized the shirt she was wearing beneath the cowl was looking a little bit bigger on her. This was because that cracking sound was her back being compressed slightly, scrunching up her entire torso so she lost a few inches in height. This wasn't made clear, however, until she stood up and found herself standing eye to eye with Pat. Normally Kim was 5'6 and Pat was 5'2, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Kim said. \"Are you wearing heels, Patti?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're just high shoes,\" Pat assured her. \"What do we want to do now? Want to go to my place and watch a movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Simon, want to come too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were busy gawking at the fact that Kim had shrunk 4 inches right before your eyes. \"Uh, sure. I can come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the three of you headed along down the sidewalk, with Kim battling the button on her jeans still unaware that it was no longer fitting because of her extra assets in the rear. While she was busy, you whispered into Pat's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bad, we have to get her to take that thing off before she notices!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad?\" Pat said. \"This is great! She doesn't expect a thing, as long as we keep her away from any mirrors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, do you <i>want </i>her to keep changing into...Whoever she's turning into!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you? This is so cool! We can see how long it takes for her to realize and I can have finally have a friend who's my shape and size, for a change. Come on, Simon. Don't you think she looks better with more junk in the trunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her bigger butt bouncing along with her step, taunting you. You swallowed, did you want to go along with whatever craziness had come over Pat and see what would happen to Kim the longer she wore the cowl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to...</span></div></div>",

Deep down, it did excite you to see Kim getting shorter and fatter, for some reason. It appealed to your outside interests that you never told anyone about. In fact, you had to wonder what might happen if you wore the cowl now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys coming,\" Kim said as she approached the steps to Pat's apartment. \"Come on, last one up pays for pizza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou allowed yourself to lose as it gave you a full view of Kim's expanded rear jiggling with every step up the stairs. And you swore that she was still growing wider and wider. How could she not notice what was happening to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough before she reached the door, something else strange happened when her shoe fell off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" Kim said, leaning over to pick it up. \"These always fit me fine. Come to think of it, my other one feels kind of loose too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you borrow a pair of my slippers for now, Kim?\" Patrica asked as she opened the door to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patti, you know that your shoe size is smaller than mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got these by accident,\" she replied, dropping a pair of fuzzy pink bunnies at Kim's feet. \"They're a few sizes too big, so they should fit you just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim accepted that excuse and tried them on. Sure enough, they fit much better than her sneakers had just a moment ago. Little did she know that those slippers were, in fact, Pat's regular slippers. Kim's feet had just shrunk, catching up with the rest of her. Still, she remained satisfied and unaware as Patricia distracted her with the movie choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we feeling tonight? I have Disney Plus, want to check out something from them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were honestly more enthralled by watching Kim's transformation than anything that could be put on TV, so you resigned yourself to watching whatever.

Kim had parked herself on a stool while you had taken a seat behind her, which granted you a full view of the changes that continued to affect her backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been growing nonstop since the movie began. Though the undone jean button had helped, the swelling was starting to put a significant strain on her pants. All the while Kim seemed to be rising off the stool as more and more cushion formed in her tush. Before long, it looked as though there were two pillows stuffed in each cheek as her whaletail began to show, with her panties stretched to their absolute limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething had to give though and that came in the form of a cracking rip as the seams along Kim's seat bursted when she stood up to go to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on,\" Kim said as she looked behind her and saw significantly more butt than she was used to. \"What happened to my ass!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my,\" Patrica said with an overacting hand put to her mouth. \"Kim, it looks like you're swelling up from an allergy or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An allergy?\" Kim asked. \"I've never heard of an allergy that could do this before to someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have,\" you interrupted. \"My, uh, my mom gets really puffy if she eats something like lobster or shellfish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think the burger I had any shellfish in it...Did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was second guessing herself. Maybe the shock of suddenly seeing her ass four times bigger than it usually was doing something to her head. Or maybe she was secretly actually enjoying this, given how Kim's face was all flush when she shook around her new asset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I run to the store and get some ice?\" Pat offered. \"Simon, you can help Kim get a little more comfortable. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant Pat was leaving it to you to convince Kim to keep things calm and under control. You sighed, but reluctantly agreed.

Kim eventually found a pair of pink sweat pants that passed the sniff test and she began to strip out of her jeans as you turned around to give her privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" she said. \"Even these are a little tight on me. I'm bigger than Patti now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not so bad,\" you replied as you turned around. Instead, the pants looking like they were cutting into her thickened waist a little. \"You look...Good, Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I?\" she asked, spinning around to try to get a better look at her bottom. \"I just feel so huge, like I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelped slightly as she brought both hands to her chest, cupping her normally C-cup sized breasts only they looked a little larger now underneath her shirt and the cowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Like I'm growing all over. Oh, Simon. I'm getting bigger! My boobs are swelling! It feels kind of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's face turned red as she gave herself a squeeze while her chest inflated a little more with each passing second. She was getting noticeable larger now, past D-cups and approaching the E-cups as the fabric of her bra began to groan under the pressure. She then looked to you, as the sole witness to her new growth developments. She fell backwards on Pat's bed with the most peculiar expression of bliss as her whole body, not just her breasts, began to grow bigger to match the plus-sized nature of the cowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon,\" she called to you. She was about to make a request of you, which was...</span></div></div>",

Once you were within range, she snatched your wrist and pulled you towards her mouth. Your lips met as she nipped at you in the most passionate kiss you had ever experienced. There was something raw and primal about Kim's behavior as she pulled away from you, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon,\" she said between deep breaths. \"I don't know what's happening to me, but I feel amazing! I had no idea being so large could feel so good! I feel like I'm someone else entirely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you replied nervously. \"That's because you kind of are. Here, look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you finally managed to kiss Kim, it didn't feel good to keep lying to her like you had been. Now that she seemed to be enjoying herself, you decided that now was the time to come clean about the cowl. As you pulled out your cellphone, you turned on the camera and flipped it so that Kim could see herself. Her expression was like a fusion of shock and amazement as she reached up and touched her face in a moment of stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that...Is that really me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't know how to tell you and this is going to sound crazy but...You know that cowl you're wearing? It's slowly turning you into...Well, whoever it is you're turning into. Don't ask me how because I just don't know. Magic, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...But, how do you know the cowl is doing this to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I was wearing it early and the same thing happened to me. That's when you walked in and saw the cowl and...Well, here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim pondered all that you revealed to her for a long time. So long, in fact, that her stomach was starting to bloat up like a tire while her breasts swelled up another cup size. She had easily gained over a hundred pounds in total now, combined with her loss in height. The T-shirt she had been wearing was now stretched out tight from her new F-Cup sized boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you said, sitting with her on the bed as her body continued to grow. \"Are you mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not mad,\" she replied, a coy smile on her face returned. \"Not at all. I'll just start to change back as soon as I remove the cowl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, that's what happened to me, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means I can be two people entirely whenever I want. And only you and Patti know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what are you getting at, Kim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Kim right now,\" she said, putting a finger to your lips. \"Instead, I feel more like an...Emily. Emily is a good name for a big girl like me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed and didn't say anything. Kim glanced down to your pants, specifically where you had a growing bulge. Her coy smile widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like big girls like me, Simon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were powerless to stop her from grabbing your hand and placing on her breast, which was over spilling out of her bra. Kim's poor clothes could barely contain her expanding body. And while you remained stunned at holding a real live boob in your hand, she pulled you in for another kiss. She tasted like cinnamon and spice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to break away before her tongue could slide down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait a minute, Kim. Should we really be doing this? I mean, Pat could come back at any time and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you,\" she purred. \"I'm not Kim right now, I'm Emily. And do you know what Emily wants right now more than anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, almost dreading the answer while at the same time longing to hear what \"Emily\" had to ask of you.

You found yourself face first in her massive cleavage as she began to fondle you with one hand and hold you in place with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wants you to fuck her,\" Emily whispered in your ear. \"She wants you to fuck her and enjoy every inch of her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't need to be told twice as you were overcome with a deep hunger and grabbed hold of her pants, pulling them off her flabby waist. Kim's panties had already given up the fight and trailed to the floor as you fell on top of her and began thrusting hard. Kim groaned and began to drown you in her breasts as she pulled at her neck and started ripping her shirt, though making sure to keep the cowl intact. In that moment, you were connected and were inside her as she moaned into your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harder, Simon,\" she cried. \"It's getting so tight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat much was true though it was because the last changes into Emily were happening to Kim. She was shrinking a few more inches as the bones in her legs dwindled and delengthened, bringing her down to the squat height of 4'10. This, of course, had the effect of making your already large shaft feel that much larger for Kim as she let out an orgasmic groan and her whole body shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept going at it, letting Emily's soft body absorb you as you pushed harder and harder until you exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both fell back onto the bed, panting and coming to terms with what you had just done in the span of about fifteen minutes. Pat's entire room smelled of sex and Kim's old clothes were ripped and torn all across the floor. The only thing that Kim was wearing which was the magical cowl which had turned her into this sex crazed new person to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was,\" Emily panted. \"Amazing! I never knew how much fun fat sex could be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you chuckled. \"I aim to please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And please you did. Want to know what else you can do to please me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily rolled over on the bed and on top of you. Being over twice Kim's usual weight, and a fair deal heavier than you yourself, Emily was able to crush you with her massive weight, despite being a whole foot shorter than you. She was certainly enjoying pressing her giant breasts in your face as they now dangled freely from her ruined shirt. You gulped as you found yourself slowly suffocated by her swollen flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What,\" you managed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily gave an evil grin. \"I want...\"</span></div></div>",

Okay, so what do you mean you want to get bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I just want a body that's bigger!\" Emily chirped like it was the most obvious thing in the world. \"And I don't really care how. This is amazing. It's like I'm on vacation from my usual thin, fit self. Now I can just indulge in every vice I've ever wanted and not have to worry about the consequences because I'm not Kim. I'm Emily. And Emily needs some room to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily hoisted herself up and paced around the room. All of Kim's clothes were destroyed and Patricia's clothes were a little small on Emily, though they were better than nothing. Emily grabbed a pair of black stockings before slipping them on. Then she picked up a big, grey dress that Pat sometimes wore before taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, gotta be quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, she took off the magical cowl, which was what gave her Emily's body to begin with. She then started to race putting on the dress as you noticed her red hair was beginning to fade. Or rather Kim's brunette color was starting to return. By the time her brown color was mostly back, she had fit herself completely into the dress, which was rather tight around her chest. Grabbing the cowl, she quickly put it back on, causing her hair to brighten up again. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://sta.sh/09j4ijv4xiw\" target=\"_blank\">https://sta.sh/09j4ijv4xiw</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close,\" she said, buttoning up the cowl. \"I'm not quite ready to go back yet.

Have a seat for a moment. On top of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On top of you?\" you asked, worried you might crush her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even worry about it. I'm sturdy enough to handle you, now come here, big boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, you took your seat on her thick thighs as you eased into her. Her breasts were pressing against your back like two giant pillows, Emily was just so soft and doughy all over. No wonder she wanted to be more like that. You didn't even notice her grabbing your hand until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that,\" she said, guiding your hand into the cowl's sleeve. \"There we go. Nice and comfy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put up no fight as she pulled at your other hand until both arms were comfortably inside the cowl with her arms. The back of yours pressed against the soft and thick flesh of her own. You felt rather warm and safe as she cradled you while you made for a rather strange sight, sitting on her lap while wrapped up in her jacket. In fact, it was starting to feel a little toasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we doing?\" you asked as you tried to adjust your hands, while were starting to feel a little numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced over to your arm and were stunned to see not two hands fit into the cowl but one. Emily's chubby fingers wiggled back to you as you swore her hand looked a little bigger than it had just a moment ago. But that wasn't as pressing as the fact that your own hands had simply vanished entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" you asked as you tried to pull yourself away but were met with fierce resistance, like your arms had melted into hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax, Simon. It will all be over soon. You're going to help me get even bigger by <i>being </i>a part of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared now, you tried to stand only to be pulled back down by Emily's great weight. She now felt even heavier for some reason. It was becoming numb up to your shoulders now and you looked to find something out of a horror movie. Both of your arms had fused into Emily's. And worse, now your torso was starting to sink in with hers. The effect seemed to be going through your clothes as your T-Shirt began to limp loosely as Emily caught it and slowly pulled it off your shrinking body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" she cooed. \"No use fighting it anymore. Have a look, you're front row center for the greatest show on earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour torso was almost completely enveloped as your head remained in tact, resting exactly on her chest with a full view of the cleavage below your neck. You gasped as the breasts grew bigger and bigger and bigger before your eyes, almost like all the mass of your body was converting into mass for Emily. You could hear her stomach gurgling as she sighed with satisfaction, leaning back on the bed as your legs uselessly kicked. They were about the only thing you could still feel besides your face, and the numbness had just about reached your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go,\" Emily moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in horror as your legs began to recede into Emily's gut, all the while your jeans crumpled up as less and less of you remained. You could hear the sound of fabric tearing as you knew while the more of you got absorbed, the bigger Emily was getting. Her breasts were already the size of bowling balls and her legs stretched out longer than yours. She was getting taller as well as wider!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your legs were short enough that Emily could reach around them and pluck off your shoes, tossing them on the floor with your discarded T-shirt. She then slid off your jeans and underwear, leaving your naked feet and what remained of your calves dangling and kicking uselessly out of her stomach. Her laugh was deeper and bigger as more of her swelled up, though you had no way of knowing just how big she was getting with your perspective muffled by her inflating breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily,\" you let out a helpless cry as your feet finally numbed and vanished into her stomach. \"Please! I'll do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you silly, horny boy. You've already given me all that I wanted. Now, down you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould feel your neck receding and you now no longer had a mouth as it merged with the flesh of Emily's tits. You sunk deeper and deeper into the cleavage, becoming one with her breasts as they swelled up a few more cup sizes. Until at least, your vision went dark and you lost the feeling on the top of your head as your consciousness faded away entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily could feel you disappear inside of her as her entire body absorbed the last of your essence and expanded just a little bit more. She sighed contently, like she had just eaten a particularly satisfying meal before standing up and taking in her new height. With your combined masses, she now stood well over six and a half feet tall and tripled her own weight, with some added curves given to her breasts and hips. The stockings she borrowed from Pat had been ripped to shreds and the grey dress was now like a mini skirt, with the top of it struggling to hold in her pumpkin sized boobs. It was only her cowl which seemed a perfect fit, the jacket had seemingly grown with the wearer to match her new scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily took in her new surroundings as she now towered over everything. She had gotten bigger, but now what? Could she get even larger? And what might happen to her if she removed the cowl now? She decided to...</span></div></div>",

Kim? I got the ice? How's that swelling going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stiffed a giggle, knowing full well that the two people Patricia expected to see were no longer here. In fact, no one even knew that they were in this building and Pat didn't have a roommate to check up on them. That gave Emily an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe listened for Patricia while lurking next to the door frame, which she was now taller than. Pat lingered around in the kitchen, leaving her bag of ice on the counter before wandering over to her bedroom to try and determine what had become of her friends. Only she was about to learn the hard way. As Patricia wandered aimlessly into the room, Emily slammed the door behind her. Her friend jumped and then did a double take at the giant looming over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim!? What the heck happened to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it?\" Emily cooed as she put both of her massive hands around Patti's torso. \"And it's Emily now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Put me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing to think that the girl in her hands had once been heavier than her. Now Emily was about twice Patricia's height and almost 50% taller than her, Pat being 5'2. The small, chubby girl squirmed helplessly as Emily just laughed and brought her closer to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you--Omph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach breast was bigger than Patricia's head and being pressed between two of them meant she was practically suffocating in cleavage as Emily dropped her into her tits as she fell backwards on the floor with a thud that caused the whole apartment to shake. As Patricia helplessly swam around in the biggest boobs she had ever seen, Emily grabbed both of her arms and slipped them into the cowl. Pat's short arms didn't even make it up to the sleeves wrist, but that didn't matter as Emily could already feel her fingers begin to merge into her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia gasped for air as she broke from the fleshy prison only to try and tug away and realize that her wrists had become fused to Emily's forearms. The look of fear that spread across her face as she slowly realized what was happening to her was delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you always wanted a big friend you could hang out with,\" Emily said with a smile. \"Well now we can hang out for as long as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia tried to shout for help only for Emily to grab the back of her head and force her deep into her cleavage. Her arms had already been completely absorbed and now Emily could feel Pat's face fuse with her chest, though she continued to scream through the thick wall of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily moaned slightly as Pat's breasts worked their way inside of her, adding to her total mass as she felt herself begin to grow all over again. Her arms had already extended in length and her own breasts were beginning to inflate from small pumpkins to the very large ones, like one might use for Halloween craving. As more of Patricia was sucked into her swelling form, Emily fought with Pat's kicking legs as she patiently removed her socks, socks and pants before ripping off the discarded T-Shirt Pat had been wearing. Eventually, all that was left was Patricia's naked legs flailing from out of Emily's massive cleavage. The sound of screaming still muffled deep inside Emily as she could feel her spine stretch out a few more inches. Emily had to give a laugh at the ass sticking out of her breasts and gave it a slap before they also sunk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily then laid back on the ground, feeling her entire body grow as less and less of Patricia remained. By the time Patricia was nothing more than feet wiggling on top of her chest, Emily had swollen up to ridiculous sizes. She was now over eight feet and approaching the heights of one of the tallest human beings in the history, let alone currently alive. Yet, despite that, she felt strong and powerful. As the last of Patricia's toes got slurped up and the screaming was silenced, Emily felt a new surge as she settled into her size which contained the total mass of her, Pat, and Simon. The wood floor was starting to sag under her great weight and it was a miracle her dress had held together. As before, the cowl had grown in size with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily felt gigantic as she sat up, noticing how small the bedroom and it's furniture were from this new perspective of 8'2. Her bust and waist had swollen up a considerate amount as well which brought a new concern for her as she approached the doorway. Emily had gotten much too big to fit through Pat's tiny door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a girl to do?\" she wondered as she tried to squeeze her way out to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could definitely try pushing harder, but that might only result in breaking the door frame and attracting unwanted attention. Emily supposed she could always try to turn back into Kim to get into small places, though she was quite liking being big for a change. A temporary swap, perhaps?</span></div></div>",

The vibrant red slowly began to fade away as the curls slowly flattened into Kim's typical do. Emily felt a tingle in her right arm and held it out just in time to see it look significantly less puffy than it had been moments ago. From her fingers to her shoulder, her entire limb was becoming skinnier and looking like a scarecrow's in comparison to the rest of her body. When all the fat had drained from the arm, Emily could feel her muscle grow just a bit before the entire limb felt like it was being sucked into her torso. The same happened to her other arm too as they returned to the size more suited to a 5'6 tall woman and not a 8'2 giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops,\" Emily giggle as she felt her spine compress. \"Down we go, I guess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery part of her was starting to get smaller at once now as the tattered dress she had borrowed from Pat was starting to fit her just a little bit better, having been stretched out from her once giant body. The floor came closer to her as Emily could the bones in her legs scrunch up like accordions. Then came the sound of a balloon deflating as Emily could feel her hips and thighs begin to shrink as all that fat disappeared and she shrunk down to Kim's usual height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omph,\" she said as it felt like she had been kicked in the gut as her stomach was sucked in. The tingling was spreading up to her chest now as she grasped her still pumpkin sized breasts, knowing what was coming next. \"Good bye, girls. I hope to see you soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front of the dress began to sag as her boobs felt like they had been poked full of holes are were letting out air. They got smaller and smaller until Emily was exactly Kim's shape and size. All that was left was her face, which she winked at in the mirror as it contorted and molded itself into the final detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stay skinny and small too long, okay?\" she said to herself before her existence faded from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was gone. In her place, Kim was left blinking confusedly at why she had just been talking to herself. And more importantly, why she had been wearing one of Patricia's dresses which had seemed to become stretched out to point where it was too big on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" she asked herself. \"Where's Simon and Patricia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled to remember the events that had transpired in this apartment, though her mind was drawing a blank. She could recall going to dinner with Simon and then the movie afterwards with Patti. She had said she was going out for a bit to get some ice. But then...A big blank filled her mind. This was made even more mysterious by the thing in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cowl?\" she asked before holding it up. \"But...How did it get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce looking a little small for her, the cowl was now large enough for someone who was 8'2 easily. It was almost the size of a blanket in Kim's eyes. And strangely enough she was oddly compelled into wearing it, even if it looked ridiculous on her. Though she was a little worried what had become of her friends. This wasn't helped by the fact that there were torn clothes on the ground, some of them belonging to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking what to do, Kim gathered up her remaining things and rolled the cowl up into a giant ball under her arms before stepping out into the night. It was late and there wasn't much time to think, best to sort it out in the morning and see if Simon or Patti showed up then. And she had to get some clothes that fit, though she doubted any stores were open at this hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, on the way home...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Huddling for warmth, Kim had to continue to resist the temptation to put on the cowl as she walked through the dark city streets late at night. There was something bizarre about it, almost like it was calling to her and begging to be worn again. Though Kim shrugged it off as mere curiosity like one might feel about a novelty bra or something. All Kim knew was that she wanted to get home and sort this all out. Maybe Simon was back home and he could explain what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim decided to take the shortest route home, which unfortunately meant cutting through the nearby alleyway which was next to the bar Kim and Pat worked at. The unfortunate part came from the trio of drunk girls stumbling on home in the same direction as Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim bit her lip and tried not to make eye contact with the giggling girls, she had to deal with their kind more than enough during work hours. The girls, however, noticed Kim almost right away. Especially with the oversized dress she was wearing which barely contained herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls were of various shapes and sizes. There a tall thin blonde one who was about 6'0 and a bitchy look on her face, similar to that of a cheerleader and with not an ounce of curves on her. There was one about Kim's height of 5'6 with more average curves and brunette hair, a very basic looking college girl. And then there was a short chubby girl around 5'0 who had black hair with glasses and looked reluctant to be there. All of them were pretty clearly intoxicated judging by how they stumbled around the street. Though it was the tall blonde who had to point out Kim to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it out, girls,\" she giggled and hiccuped. \"Looks like someone had a wild night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim just smiled and nodded, hoping to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait a minute,\" said the brunette Kim's size. \"Isn't that the bartender who cut us off last weekend? The one that carded us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde squinted real hard at Kim, looking down at her completely. \"Yeeeeah! You're right, Sally. Well, look who needs to be cut off now, huh girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim grunted as the blonde got a little handsy with her. Being a whole six inches taller than her, the girl was a little bit intimidating even if she was a beanstick. But Kim maintained her composure and cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize if I upset you,\" she said. \"But you were making a scene last weekend and too much more might have been dangerous. You shouldn't have been drinking anyway without your ID on hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you calling us lushes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicky, come on,\" the short chubby girl tried to reason with the blonde girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I don't want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde \"Vicky\" pushed Kim hard enough that she lost her balance. The cowl, which had been wrapped up in Kim's arms, came undone and fluttered to the ground. All three drunk girls turned their attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that?\" Sally wondered out loud. \"It looks like a blanket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...It's a jacket,\" Vicky said, stumbling over to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim panicked in that moment. For some reason, the thought of someone else taking that cowl from her filled her with dread. While Vicky reached down for it, Kim scrambled to grab it herself. Who would reach it first? Kim or Vicky?</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the small act of defiance was enough to send the plastered bully into a slurry of curses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me that fucking thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim managed to slip away, onto to run towards into the brunette, Sally, who shoved her back. Kim suddenly found herself in the middle of two very cross and intoxicated girls who were suddenly very interested in what Kim was trying to keep away from them. Kim wasn't quite sure herself why this cowl was so important, only that if it were to fall into the wrong hands then bad things might happen. That was when she had the idea to wear it, just so she'd have a free hand to escape as the girls began to circle around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for them, that was about to end badly for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner than did Kim put the cowl over her shoulders did a weird tingle spread through her arms. It was almost like her bones had turned to rubber and someone was stretching them out. She didn't think it was so strange though until the girls around her had stopped approaching her to stand back in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is wrong with her arms?\" asked Vicky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim took a moment to see what she meant before Kim realized that her arms now stretched down further than usual, no longer around her waist but now towards her knees in an almost cartoony fashion. Kim held up her elongated limbs and looked at her hands as they too began to increase in size like they were being pumped with air. That was when she was taken aback by a rising sensation in her spine, like someone was adding a few more notches to it as Kim suddenly shot up to the same height as Vicky. Though it didn't stop there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's legs wobbled as they began to shoot out from her ragged dress while her feet exploded out from her shoes. From her perspective, the alleyway and the surrounding bullies were getting smaller and smaller as she began to expand skyward up to Emily's height of 8'2. Height wasn't the only thing to increase as Kim felt more like a parade balloon swelling with air as all parts of her began to swell, though specifically her hips and bust size were a primary focus as they strained against the fabric of Pat's borrowed dress. Before long, Kim had gotten very tall and very curvy in a matter of seconds. All that remained was her tiny head on such a big body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was in shock at her body's sudden transformation and most of all how good it all felt. She fondled her yoga ball sized breasts as her hair began to turn red and curly. A sudden swell cause her whole head to grow twice in size and then shrink back down slightly as her whole facial features changed. Kim was gone. Emily was back in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" Emily said while stretching her neck. \"It's so nice to be outside for a change. And what cute little girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky was powerless as Emily wrapped both hands around her waist and hoisted her straight into the air with impressive strength. Vicky squirmed once she realized what was happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha! Hey! Put me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily just let out a giant chuckle as she tossed the blonde in the air slightly, catching her like she would a baby. She wasn't quite aware of who these three girls were, having not been keen to Kim's actions prior, but they made for some excellent toys now that she had her freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have much in the way of curves,\" Emily muttered to herself as she studied Vicky. \"But you're a tall one. I bet you'd give me a nice boost to height...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying, you giant freak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again, you might just make a good toy too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hungry smile crept across Emily's lips as she stared down at Vicky, intimidating her slightly. What would she do with her?</span></div></div>",

I wonder how tall you'll make me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing to me?\" Vicky cried as Emily grabbed her arms and slipped her into the sleeves of her cowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sit back and watch. Look, it's already starting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky's eyes widened in horror as she looked at her arms slowly beginning to merge with Emily's own flabby tree trunks. She fruitlessly wiggled her fingers until they all but disappeared, causing Emily to surge up in height a couple more inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" Emily sighed as she could safely release Vicky now that they were stuck together. \"That's it. Make me even bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde fruitlessly tried to pry herself away from the giant as she sunk slowly into the flesh of Emily's body. She then screamed to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally! Alice! Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, the short 5'0 chubby girl with glasses, only stood by stunned at the sight of the largest woman she had ever seen seemingly absorbing one of her best friends like the Blob. Sally, however, sprung into action, running up to Emily and tugging as hard as she could at Vicky's wildly kicking feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still, hold still!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho,\" Emily bellowed as she stretched up a couple more inches. \"A challenger, huh? Well take her, if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sally struggled, Vicky sunk deeper into Emily's chest until her own torso had disappeared completely. The low-cut lace shirt she had been wearing fluttered uselessly to the ground as Emily moaned while growing to nine feet tall. Vicky's head remained atop of Emily's breasts like a hood ornament, still screaming for her friends to pull her out of her inescapable fate adding more and more mass to Emily's body enough that her dress was splitting at the seams. Emily licked her lips as Vicky's legs began the process of getting sucked into her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Vicky was gone up to her knees, Emily was 9'6 and on her knees to give Sally some sort of advantage. The poor girl was seeing that it was a hopeless endeavor now and trying to break away but...Couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Sally cried, looking down at her hands, which had fused to Vicky's ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is new,\" Emily said upon inspecting the girl's plight. \"Lucky me, I get two for one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally screamed as she felt herself jolt closer to the gaping maw that was Emily's cleavage. She kicked and cursed as there was less and less of Vicky's legs and Emily's breasts inched closer to her melted fingers. All the way Emily became larger and taller. When there was almost nothing left of Vicky but her feet, Emily had passed the ten foot marker and she now towered over Sally even when she was on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You big bitch!\" Sally shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am big,\" Emily agreed. \"And you're about to make me bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally shouted at the top of her lungs again as Emily wrapped her massive arms around her head and pulled her close to her breasts in the biggest and last hug she'd ever get. Emily could feel Sally's face fuse with her boobs, causing them to expand even more as her spine extended skyward and she stood up. She was almost half the size of the nearby rooftops. Sally's legs kicked helplessly as her torso got sucked up, expanding Emily's breasts to the size of yoga balls as her height jumped up to eleven feet. All the while, Sally's screams grew more and more distant until they disappeared entirely. Though her feet still wiggled as they were the last things to go and her empty clothes fluttered to the street. Emily moaned as she stretched up at her full height of a new 11'7. She then looked down at the head of Vicky still cursing at her while in the middle of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bitch! You killed her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I almost forgot about you,\" Emily said while giggling. \"Don't worry, she's not dead. She's just a part of me now, like you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do this to us! You can't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh,\" Emily whispered as she pressed down on Vicky's head. \"Down you go now, that's it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky's head sunk further into Emily's gigantic breasts, muffling her voice as Emily grew one last inch to 11'8. The dress she was wearing was stretched to its absolute limits while the cowl had grown in time with her. Finally, the blonde bully was gone and all that was left was silence, discarded clothes, and a shivering Alice watching from the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, hello there,\" Emily said, leaning over to greet the girl. As she was, Alice was less than half her height and didn't even come up to her waist. \"Now, what do I do with you?\"</span></div></div>",

She wasn't quite big enough yet that she could hold her in one hand, especially given how wide Alice was. But she was so large that Alice essentially weighted almost nothing to her. The poor helpless chubby girl could only squeak as she was brought to Emily's gigantic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please,\" Alice shivered. \"Don't...Don't kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill you?\" Emily a few times before laughing. \"I'm not going to kill you. I haven't killed anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Then what happened to my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, they're just a part of me now, like I said. I can still feel them all inside of me. In fact...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily paused for a moment and focused, trying to picture the girl she had just absorbed. Vicky. As she did, her curly red hair started to straighten itself out before it turned blonde, from the roots to the ends. Emily's face was next, as her wide cheeks started to thin and her double chin sunk into her neck. Her button nose turned sharp as Emily's persona all but faded away to mimic Vicky perfectly, at least from the neck up. Though it took a lot of focus to maintain the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?\" Emily asked in a perfect mimic of Vicky's voice. \"I am her and she is me. And I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help?\" Alice croaked. \"What do you need my help for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily released the appearance as her head turned back to its chubby, red haired self in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't last as long as I would have liked. I'm still very much learning what the limitations of my powers are all while my host remains ignorant to what happens around her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your host?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl you must have seen before I appeared. Kim. We're two separate people and she's completely unaware of what's going on with me. All she should know is that she'll want to protect the cowl and if she wears it, I appear. And when I remove it, Kim comes back. That's where you come in. I'm sure you've noticed, it's not exactly easy to hide when you're someone my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice glanced down to Emily's breasts, which were so large she could almost sit on them like a chair. \"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Therefore, I need to change back to Kim before someone notices. And since Kim is unaware of me, it would be helpful if she had someone who did know all this to point her in the right direction. Maybe someone who can even get me even bigger, in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You want me to feed people to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think of it as feeding, these people aren't dead. Surely a girl like you must get picked on from time to time. Why have such vulgar people waste their mass when they can add it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, I'll make it worth your while somehow. I just need to learn to master my powers and learn to control them. Then, I can be anyone or any size! Please, I beg of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit surreal to have a giantess begging Alice for help when she was in her clutches. What else could she do by agree? As Alice solemnly nodded to seal the deal, Emily let out a squeal as she grasped her tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! I swear I'll make it up to you for absorbing your friends! I'll be your new friend and we're going to have so much fun. But first...I get to go back to being Kim. One moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily lowered Alice to the ground before she began to shoulder off the cowl, which was more like a small tent compared to Alice. Alice watched in awe as the giantess began to shrink back to a more normal size, her limbs thinning and curves disappearing into something less cartoonily exaggerated. There was less and less of the giantess Emily and more Kim as Alice's eyes wandered over to the cowl just sitting on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would Alice do?</span></div></div>",

And for you to become Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha,\" you stuttered. \"Be Emily? I don't, uh, I mean. I couldn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like being the one on top,\" Emily chuckled at her position on top of you as she sat up, releasing you from the prison of her boobs. \"I understand. But here's the thing, I'm a top too. And there's nothing I'd like more than to just dominate you, right now. I can't do that as well in this body, though I'd like to keep it a factor. Isn't this body amazing? Wouldn't you want to see what it's like if you can just change back when we're done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fiddled with her boobs again, each was almost as big as your head. You tried to imagine what it would be like to carry them. Or have hips that were twice the size of your own. Or be a whole foot shorter than you were now. The thoughts were rather tempting to just say fuck it and try it out. She was right, you could change back if you decided it wasn't for you. It could actually be a lot of fun as you swallowed your pride as a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you said. \"Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Emily said with a continued smirk. \"We should probably get out of here though if we want privacy. Patti should be back at any time now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, come on. Let's get dressed and leave quick before she finds us. Actually, hang on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could breath again when Emily pulled herself off of your stomach and waddled over to Patricia's closet. She threw various outfits out onto the floor before returning with an armful of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put these on,\" she said, dropping one armful in your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding me,\" you said, sorting through the clothes. \"You want me to wear a <i>skirt</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually a dress, Simon. And yes, since it's a long walk to our apartment. It's better to wear clothes that will fit and suit this body than explode out of your jeans like I did, isn't it? Now come on. Get to cross dressing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou supposed there was a bit of logic there, since the cowl didn't care what you were wearing underneath it. Though Emily was even thorough enough to provide you bra and panties, the former which she had to help you put on and the later hugging your junk uncomfortably tight. It was a reminder that in a moment you weren't going to have a penis anymore, and the empty cups of the bra tempted you with the idea of seeing cleavage every time you looked down. You supposed that wouldn't be all bad. The grey stockings clung loosely to your legs, meant for someone with meatier calves though they were very short on you. Same with the white and patterned dress, which felt large on your but came up short on your legs. The clothing didn't suit your skinny and manly body at all, though Emily didn't seem to mind (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5983e48374afab276ec2a31dab8b012e/tumblr_n1909wOLCc1qzibl9o1_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/5983e48374af...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you look adorable.

As before, you didn't feel much different though you were sure your hair color was starting to change. It was for Emily, after all, as she threw on a large flower dress to wear. As her head popped out, you could see that the scarlet hairs had begun to disappear, changing back to their usual brunette as Kim. She was otherwise remaining the same shape and size.

Though I forget what comes next. I took it off the first time before it could go past hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll just have to find out, won't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Emily slipped into a pair of Pat's shoes, you could feel your hair get curlier and longer while Emily's own hair had turned completely brown again. You had to hurry to your own apartment, which was on the other side of town, as you grabbed your own shoes to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to change was...</span></div></div>",

We'll just head straight home and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stopped short on your usual direction home as you looked down the sidewalk. A short and shapely shadow was approaching the two of you, carrying a big bag of ice so that she didn't notice you both as well. But you could see her as she passed under a streetlamp. Patricia was coming back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" Emily cursed as she pulled your arm in the other direction. \"We'll have to go the long way home, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she not see us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides being a little busy with the ice, we're not exactly silhouettes that she'll immediately recognize,\" Emily smirked as she glanced your way. \"Speaking of, you're looking a little puffier in the face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fiddled around with your hand, touching your nose and cheeks to discover that they did feel a little different to you. You pulled out your phone and turned your camera on only to gasp. The appearance was one you weren't used to seeing at all, with a bubble nose and a rounder face as your five o'clock shadow disappeared to smoother skin. You could even feel your lips inflate a little bigger. You paused for a moment to watch your face morph entirely, similar to how it did for Kim during dinner. Within the span of about a minute of your face contorting and changing, there was nothing left of Simon from the neck up. You were Emily!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" you said in a shriller voice as you gasped and grabbed your throat. \"I even sound like a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're looking more the part of one,\" said Emily, only she didn't sound like Emily anymore. \"Or me, I should say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and gasped as Emily's own face bubbled and shifted like it was made of clay. The features of your own face faded away as her head became thinner and more almond shaped. Within seconds, Kim was staring back up at you. Or Kim's head on a very short and chubby body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess our changes happen at the same time,\" said Kim as she touched at her returned face. \"Oh well. As much as I like being Emily, seeing you become her is kind of turning me on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as you tried to adjust to your new voice. \"Well, let's just not get ahead of ourselves yet, shall we? We gotta take the long way home now, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best,\" Kim said with a wink. \"I can't wait to see what changes next about you. Trust me, they get more <i>intense </i>as they travel all the way down your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but feel the tingles going all through your body as Kim said that. You were suddenly acutely aware of the little alterations the cowl was doing to your body. It was like a drop of ink in a glass of water, slowly spreading and growing to every corner until everything was contaminated. Like the very genetics that made you Simon was being ripped up and replaced by Emily as you'd slowly become her more and more on the course of your walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you felt a tingle in your...</span></div></div>",

Your diligence paid off in the form of a strange prickling sensation below your ankle. When you felt your shoes starting to get a little loose on you, you finally stopped walking for a moment causing Kim to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kick off your shoes,\" you told her. \"Quick! Before you explode out of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if only now noticing the tightness in her borrowed shoes from Patricia, Kim leaned over to pry them off of her feet only to be taken by surprise. Her feet were swelling before her very eyes. As she stood barefoot on the sidewalk, you watched them grow larger and larger until they matched her old foot size, which was significantly bigger than Pat's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the opposite end, you were standing in your stockings and watching your feet shrink from being quite expansive for a guy, all the way down to being dainty and distinctly feminine looking. If you closed your eyes, it felt like someone had put your feet into a clamp, twisting and crushing them smaller and smaller. You could actually hear your bones crack if you listened closely enough. Before long, it was almost comical to see such tiny feet supporting such a larger body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you could say the shoe's on the other foot now,\" you said, trying to laugh at your situation. \"Can I borrow the ones you were wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim obliged and you found yourself fitting comfortably in the black flats that once belonged to Patricia. It took a little mental gymnastics to consider the fact that you could now wear them as you would any of your old shoes, when you were used to your feet being giant size 13's in men's. It only made you a little uneasy at the thought of the sheer metamorphosis your body was undergoing. Another brutal reminder that Simon was slowly disappearing off the face of the earth. Though, as scary as that thought was, a part of you also found it kind of exciting. How much control you were exerting over your own body that you could completely alter it at will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could complete that thought, however, across from you Kim was trying and failing to wear your old shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't going to work,\" Kim said somewhat annoyed. \"Your feet are just too big. I can't walk like this, we need to go find me some replacements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big deal about wearing mine until we get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to stumble around in the dark and potentially trip and fall to hurt myself, Emily. Now come on, there's a Walmart over here that's still open at this hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to protest, but the fact that Kim had referred to you as Emily had caught you off guard slightly as the much shorter woman pulled you along. You were practically tripping over your own two feet as you had to quickly adjust to walking on them. You hoped that you wouldn't get any smaller yet or it was going to be an awkward walk home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, your next transformation wasn't about shrinking. It would be about swelling, specifically what was going to expand was your...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One good thing about going to Walmart so late was that there were few people out to stare at you. Even the cashier just gave you both a passing glance as you entered the store and headed straight for the shoe area of the clothing department. Needless to say, you were a little reluctant to be following her knowing that the next alteration to your body come happen at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Kim,\" you whined, still not used to your new voice. \"Any shoes will do, won't they? It's Walmart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be in such a rush, Emily. No one is here, so no one is going to care if we change a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your puffy lips a little. \"Why do you keep calling me Emily now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's who you are now. Or who you're going to be, anyway. I just figured you'd want to get used to the idea of being referred to that name. Who knows? Maybe it'll be fun to have you pose as her to get places you wouldn't normally be able to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Patti thinks that I'm still Emily,\" Kim said with a grin on her face. \"If you wanted to, you could totally fool her into thinking you're me as Emily. Or you could pretend to be Emily to an entirely new group of people. The sky's the limit! That's just what's so exciting about the idea to me, becoming someone completely new and having a new experience. It's so cool! Think about it, you get to see what it's like to be a girl firsthand now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not a girl,\" you protested. \"Not yet, anyway. It's not like I have your butt or your boo--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour conversation was cut short by a slight tingle in your chest, and after tonight you had been paying close attention to every little shift happening in your body. This time, however, it was a slight pressure in your torso. Like something was building and primed to explode out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's happening,\" you whispered. \"Kim, something big is happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick! Hide!\" she hissed back as she ushered you into a rack of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ducked inside to escape the gaze of the few customers wandering around. You had hidden yourselves in one of those circular racks that commonly got placed in the center of the stores. Your chest was heaving and itched insistently as you could feel something growing, like your insides were shifting around to prepare for a violent push. You kept trying to hold it in like you were holding your breath until you buckled slightly. Your skin tickled the bra you were wearing in a way it hadn't before coupled with a new weight on your chest. As you peeled the neck of your dress up, you confirmed your fears at the sight of two small lumps growing where your pecs used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim,\" you said in a hushed voice. \"I got boobs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, you don't,\" she replied. \"What are you doing? Why are you shaking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't even noticed that your whole body was jittering like it was struggling to contain something. Your feet were clenched and it felt like your entire form was that of a rock trying not to be moved. Having breasts felt strange and foreign to you and a part of you didn't want them. While another, smaller part of you was begging to let them grow bigger. As a result, you were in conflict with yourself and fighting. And Kim seemed to sense the battle inside your head as she leaned over, exposing her cleavage while her breasts bounced against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want boobs like mine, Emily? Come on, don't fight it. Embracing it is quite...Pleasurable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped as the smaller side of yourself that wanted to say \"fuck it\" grew bigger and bigger as you could feel your breasts bump up another cup size. Could you even fight this? Or were you at the mercy of the cowl's magic shaping your body? As you clenched your teeth, you discover that...</span></div></div>",

You clutched the sides of your skull, feeling the soft, curly hair that you now sported. It was hard to accept that these things were actually parts of your body now as you stared down at your chest while it bumped up another cup size. You had honest to god boobs right now, in the form of two tiny hills pushing out the once flat chest of the dress you were wearing. There was a noticeable dent and curve of someone distinctly female now. All the while the pressure inside of you grew bigger and bigger until you couldn't hold it back any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned back and mouthed a silent moan as your bust exploded into a very strained bra. Borrowing from Patricia, she was pretty big but Emily was bigger. And your F-cup sized breasts were compressed tightly in a lacy prison as they stretched the neck of your dress out, allowing you to see the cleavage below. Your cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from you, Kim was dealing with her own changes as she cupped her breasts while they receded into her floral dress until they were back to their old size of C-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so much for that,\" she said with a pout before a hungry look crossed her eyes as she stared at you. \"You're looking rather fine though. You're starting to look like a real girl now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you asked, blushing brightly. \"Let me see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you crawled out from the clothing rack and headed for the changing rooms where the mirrors were. You couldn't help but gasp at the sight of yourself. You looked like a tall, red haired chick with a massive bust that didn't quite work on your boyish body. You frowned at that, almost being disappointed the image in the mirror wasn't the one you had in your mind. Kim circled around you, still being so short that she only came up to your new breasts though she could see you frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing,\" you lied. \"Just...I don't look quite like a girl at all, yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a pretty good start, I'd say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but only a start. My whole torso is like a square. Not really curvy at all. Maybe if my hips flared out a little...Or my stomach pressed in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much thought to what you were doing, you held in your breath and starting pushing into your sides with your hands. You kept imagining what Emily would look like and force your own torso to concave like a woman's. It came as a surprise to you then when a tingling occurred through the area as a few bones cracked and your mass realigned itself, traveling from your stomach to your hips and causing them to bulge out slightly. Kim and you both stared at your reflection in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" Kim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know,\" you replied as you stared at your now distinctly female shape in the reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have any of the weight Kim was wearing but you had the start of hips now with an hourglass shape. Though your boobs were still massively out of place, you would at least look like a girl at a passing glance. And they might be too busy staring at your chest to even notice anything else out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, I just sort of embraced being Emily,\" you answered. \"I imagined it and it happened. Don't you remember? It sort of happened to you too when we were, um, getting physical in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Kim said, looking quite thoughtful for a moment. You recognized a look of scheming and suddenly became slightly nervous as Kim made a request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to...</span></div></div>",

What does that mean, exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to describe,\" you admitted, trying to even think about how you had done it. \"I just...Had a distinct image in my head and tried to visualize it happening to myself. So, like, if I pictured myself having a larger butt like Emily does and allowed it to happen to myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiggled your butt around as there suddenly was a bit more jiggle to it. You bit your lip and pushed a little harder, flexing a little harder as you could feel your butt expand outwards, stretching the fabric of the dress you were wearing. You now had a little bit of weight to counteract the impressive bust you were sporting. Kim next to you was eyeing the change with fascination as you became more and more girl like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" she repeated again. \"So, by being comfortable with being Emily more and more, then that means you become her faster. Do me a favor for a moment and remove the cowl, but before you do I want you to do something. I want you to repeat to yourself over and over that you are Emily. In addition, you see the body that you have now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to picture it as your normal body. Like it's your default form and it's what's normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a little confusing for you to follow, but you did what Kim asked of you as you took a deep breath and whispered to yourself over and over. You were Emily. Your name was Emily. This was your body. You always had big boobs and a butt with an hourglass shape. You always had long red hair and a cute girl face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you removed the cowl, you expected your red hair would change to brown. Hair seemed the first to change during these processes, after all. But as you stared into the reflection of yourself, nothing was changing about your persona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" you asked. \"Shouldn't I be turning back into Simon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you asked that question, your red hair started to fade into a dull brown. Kim was already behind you with the cowl and slipped it onto your arms, halting the hair dying instantly as it reverted back into a vibrant scarlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful now, Emily,\" said Kim. \"See? When you removed the cowl and thought about Simon, you turned into him. But when you thought about your real self, you were able to maintain your shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My real self?\" you were a bit confused now. \"But I <i>am </i>Simon. I'm not Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Kim laughed. \"You certainly look like Emily, Em. Now let's go pay for my shoes so we can hurry back and have a little fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of sex was certainly a bit of a distraction as Kim walked away before she could properly clarify what she even meant. What was it she was really intending to do with you? Was this really about just having a bit of fun, or was there something more Kim wanted from you, Simon. You were still Simon, weren't you? Why were you getting more comfortable with having boobs already, as you adjusted them to properly fit into the bra you had borrowed from Pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to keep up with Kim as the changes of the cowl continued to work their magic on your body, next transforming...</span></div></div>",

The cashier was a bored looking teenager with dreads who had no doubt seen weirder couples in Walmart at one in the morning. You didn't want to stick around though and see her react to your ass suddenly inflating or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be $19.99,\" she said with a dull tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck,\" said Kim as she patted herself all over. \"I left my wallet and cellphone back in my jeans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ones that were presently shredded on the floor of Patricia's apartment. You sighed, thankfully you had had the sense to bring along your personal items. The dress you were wearing had the blessed design of actually having pockets compared to most girl outfits. You reached in and pulled out a twenty as it felt like your whole body was standing in the epicenter of an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached the bill out for the cashier's hand, the cash inched away from her just as she tried to grab it. This wasn't because you had pulled the cash back. What was actually happening was your arms were shortening to match Emily's 4'10 stature. You could actually feel your bones recede into your shoulder as your arms got smaller and smaller. But to the cashier, you were just looking like a jerk and she gave you a big glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed nervously and offered the money again, this time having to reach further towards her. \"Uh, sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of your hurried out as Kim slipped on her sandals. Your arms dangled weakly as you could feel the strength fade from them as you manly muscles shriveled away to make your arms more dainty and lady like. That wasn't to last for too much longer though as when you exited the store, you could feel them begin to pump up like balloons as they filled up the sleeves of the dress with fat. As you stepped out the door, you looked down at your hands while they also began to shrink. Your fingers thinned to look more slender and female, even your nails became polished and longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Em?\" asked Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You at me!\" you said, putting your arms at your side. They now came up to above your waist rather than below. \"I look like a freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no,\" she replied, grabbing at your smaller hands and patting them assuredly. \"You're just a little lopsided right now because your torso is so long. Here, work with me. Close your eyes for a moment and stretch your back out as far as it go and hold it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were a little reluctant, you did what Kim asked of you, raising your shoulders high as you could and forcing your back upright. Strangely enough, as you did it, you felt yourself rising almost like you were growing taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now squish yourself down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you did as commanded pretending you were pressing yourself into a box. As you did, that brief moment of feeling tall vanished in an instant and you now felt a sinking sensation. Like you were getting closer to the floor. Like your spine was an accordion you were stretching and then squashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now release it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you let go, you didn't rise up back to your normal level like you expected. Instead you remained compact as you opened your eyes and found Kim no longer came up to your chest. Instead, she was up to your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim?\" you asked as you adjusted to seeing her more on your level all of a sudden. \"You got bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't get any bigger, Em. You just got smaller. Or, more specifically, you shrunk your spine so your torso matches your arms. See? Look how your arms now match your torso?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shrunk myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked down at yourself, you found that the top of the dress was now fitting you a little better with your entire upper body now looking distinctly feminine. You were just lacking a little cushion in the tummy. Your legs, however, were still very mannish and lengthy. Though you knew that too would change as you embraced becoming Emily more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a bit,\" said Kim as she measured herself next to you. \"I'd say about six inches, making you 5'4, right? That's my old height!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all rather sobering to think of, considering you were so used to looking down at Kim. Now if she'd turn back to normal, then you would probably be looking up at her. The strange thing was that you had had so many changes being done to you, Kim hadn't really changed much herself since her breasts had shrunk. In fact, she seemed almost pristine. It was a strange feeling you had, like she wasn't liable to change any time soon. But that was ridiculous, without the cowl she was supposed to start changing back to Kim. Right?</span></div></div>",

And nothing had been happening to her to suggest she was changing back to her old stuff. It was almost like she was stuck halfway between Kim and Emily. But you didn't call attention to it until you felt butterflies in your stomach followed by a filling sensation like you were being pumped up with air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you put your hands to your stomach, you felt less hard muscle like you were used to and more a thick layer of flab that seemed to be getting softer and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim,\" you said. \"I think my stomach is growing now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both paused to watch as your belly swelled outwards and stretched the torso of the dress you were wearing slightly until you were a perfect match with Kim. You felt so big and bloated now, especially with your massive breasts that now had a stomach they could rest on a little which took a little of the excess weight off of your back. However, as you watched Kim you couldn't help but notice that she wasn't getting any skinnier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim, you're not changing,\" you finally pointed out when you were at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not?\" Kim asked as she looked over herself. \"I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not worried? What if you get stuck like this forever, halfway between Kim and Emily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, Em, I kind of like being like this. Being short and fat is kind of freeing. I don't have to worry about watching what I eat anymore. Plus, look at my hips! They're amazing! Sure, I still wish I had the boobs you do but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said as you both entered the apartment. \"What's going on, exactly? Because this is getting weird. Weirder than the fact we found a magical cowl that can transform people into...Whoever the hell we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Em?\" Kim asked. \"You don't like me like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what...I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what,\" Kim said as she came up to you and poked you in the chest. \"You're doing this for me, after all. It's only fair that I look the part for you. How do you want me? More like Kim? More like you? Or is this fine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammered a bit as it felt like someone had just given you the keys to a sports car and you didn't know how to drive. Could Kim even do all what she was suggesting she could? Just what had you stumbled across in that old thrift store? You swallowed your nerves and decided that you would like Kim...</span></div></div>",

Though they don\u2019t return completely to normal. You feel your tummy soften as a layer of pudge covers your midsection. You shrink in height a few inches, the room looking much bigger, and to your surprise your skin darkens to soft brown. Your grows out, draping your neck as you feel your face shift and readjust. With one final surge of warmth your chest swells out into perky breasts, then in sizable boobs, then is big tits, and finally into massive juggs. Each bigger than your head, your enormous brown tits weigh heavy on you slender-but-soft petite frame jiggle wildly without a bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/67a048b7ce246e0c3a38b0bcb6235ac5/tumblr_p8cnylwstb1wdrc27o3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/67a048b7ce24...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly moly these are big,\u201d you breath in a seductive and husky, though definitely feminine voice. \u201cI guess I should check on Kim.

The cool AC blowing on your exposed cleavage sends a chill down your spine and brings your new female nipples to attention, sensitive and rubbing against your dress. You bite down on your plump lip, resisting the rising arousal. Trying to shake the thoughts from your head, you knock on Kim\u2019s door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim?

In turn, your mouth dropped open at the sight of her. She was a few inches taller than you and easily four times your weight. Her perky C cups had doubled in size, though it was nothing compared to your mammoth mammaries, and sat atop her fat belly. Her belly looked like two scoops of ice cream on a cone; split in the middle by a deep fold, her lower belly was wider and more plump than the top half. All this, however, was dwarfed by the girth of her hips. Her hips were easily wider than yours had been, gently pressing up against the doorframe, and her ass had to colossal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/73e8cee10a429f9bada2313d54ee51f3/tumblr_pfhwp9SS9P1sjttiv_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/73e8cee10a42...</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike you who had changed genders, race, and body type, Kim looked just like herself plus three hundred pounds or more.

Since you had met her, you had had a pretty strong crush on Kim too. Now, standing before you, was a living breathing fantasy of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so hot\u2026\u201d you said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh excuse me?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Want to go back to that store now?\u201d  You ask putting the yoga pants you were previously wearing back in the duffle bag.  After you return to normal you don\u2019t want to risk magical cloths laying around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending over to pick them up turned out to be quite a task indeed.  Your new breasts dragged down by gravity dangled dangerously obstructing your view when you leaned over and were in the way.  They felt as though they would burst out of the dress at any second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim scowled at you and said \u201cok let\u2019s be in our way then mrs hooters.\u201d  She looked incredulously at your enormous bust.  You thought about making a comeback about her weight but decided against it.  You swing the duffle bag full of magical cloths over your shoulder and head out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk proved difficult.  Not being contained by a bra, your breasts tremored violently with each step.  You were very top heavy and with the amount of cleavage this dress showed you were shocked they have not burst free yet.  You constantly had to adjust so they wouldn\u2019t slip out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both pass some public restrooms at a park.  \u201cHey Kim how would you feel about changing up our outfits real quick?  These tits are about to burst out and are jiggling like crazy..\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what your complaining about.  My whole body is jiggling.\u201d  You look back to see a red in the face Kim out of breath from walking and also jiggling a little.  At least her dress was tight and fit properly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed a group of men staring at your bouncing chest and cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo both of you change your outfits into something new before continuing or just go to the store?</span></div></div>",

There isn\u2019t any harm in trying out s new body before we get there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad she agreed you hurried towards the men\u2019s restroom when Kim wrapped her arm around yours.  \u201cSorry there little missy but that\u2019s the men\u2019s restroom.  Our restroom is this way.\u201d  She grinned as she pulled you to the other side of the building locking her enormous soft fat arm with yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breasts tremored violently and you could feel the dress starting to slip again. \u201dEasy Kim I\u2019m about to fall out of these!\u201d  Too late.  One of your boobs burst free at last and bounced wildly back and forth as Kim pushed open the door and pulled you into the woman\u2019s bathroom.  You could hear those men cheering at the sight of your liberated boob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful what you wish for little lady.\u201d Kim said with a chuckle.  You may be regretting changing bodies if you become a porker like this next.\u201d  She gripped her big belly with one of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim pulled the bag of magic clothes from you as you pushed your massive breast back into the dress with a look of indignation.  \u201cThese things are literally like jigging watermelons growing from my chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze when you saw yourself in the mirror for a second thinking you were not alone.  You looked like a complete stranger to yourself.  With this bronze glowing skin and this curvy body.  You stuck out your lips and did a duck face.  \u201cThis is so weird!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back to see Kim pulling off her dress completely naked.  You avert your eyes to be polite and she just laughed.  \u201cIt\u2019s not like these are our bodies no need to be embarrassed.  She bends over digging thorough the bag  with her wide fat ass pointed at you.  You give it a loud slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d  She exclaimed.  She throws a wad of clothes at you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One of the cheapest and strongest was the \"Rum of random effects\". On the label was a doodle of a human body with a big \"?\" written on top. You didn't think about it too much, you grabbed three bottles, since it was so cheap, and brought them to the weird large lady with the big cleavage. She showed you a huge grin as you swiped the card, and you felt before feeling too uneasy. Anyway the label was pretty vague, but clearly it was just alcohol. You wondered how it tasted though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the weekend came, and you were helping Kim setting everything up. There was pizza, appetizers, vegan stuff, many drinks... Kim saw the weird bottles you bought, but it didn't really catch her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later, your flat was filled with people. Among the ones you knew, was your tall and muscular friend Ted who always had to come to every party, if Kim invited her friends. There was also the chubby Patricia, Kim's friend, wearing a thin sweater that gave her quite the cleavage! But short enough to see her belly bulging out... There was also a few people you didn't know. Like April, an old friend of Kim, apparently. She was a short red-hair girl with short hair. With her sleeveless shirt and her jean shorts, it felt like she was working at a farm before coming here. She had a bit of curves though... There was also a quiet Asian girl you knew from somewhere... You realized it was Sung, the Korean chick from your class. What was she doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey Sung! Surprised to see you there...\" </i>You said to her.<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah... I don't go to parties much. And I'm a friend of Patricia, if you were wondering.\"</i><br>\r\nReally? You never knew. But you didn't know too much about Sung, she was quiet, and with her thin and flat body, she sadly didn't attract much attention. But then you saw the silhouette of a pleasingly plump woman in a gorgeous tight red dress coming inside... It was your campus bookstore coworker Lisa! You invited her, but never thought she would actually come... With such a stunning dress, no less!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wowh, Lisa, you came! I'm... I'm really glad!\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Well, yeah. I figured it would be nice to see each other at another place than campus for once. I hope I'm not too late...\"</i> She said, a bit shy, and a bit uncomfortable on her high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Ted winking at you while you were chatting with Lisa. That dude... But he was right, for Lisa to come here with such a beautiful dress, clearly she was interested in something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of chatting and eating peanuts, chips and whatnot, Kim, Patricia and April came bursting out of the kitchen with plates filled with small glasses.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"COME ON EVERYONE! SHOTS!\"</i> Yelled April. She seemed like quite the party girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they handed each and every one a shot glass while yelling \"Bottom's up!\". You could see your Korean classmate sung reluctantly drinking the strong alcohol... Ted, not so much. And Kim and her clique drank one glass each after handing the rest. You looked at your glass, and wondered what it was. You asked Kim, and she answered it was the weird rum you bought at that thrift store. Apparently, it wasn't bad. You looked at Lisa, who still hasn't drink her shot glass, raised yours, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, Lisa... Cheers!</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Cheers!\"</i> She happily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you both drank the whole glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what you didn't realize, is that rum was indeed about to give rather random effects to everyone... It could make people really horny... Or not. it could also change their personalities... Or not. But it would surely change their bodies in unexpected way... And because the effects were random, there was many ways for this party to end.</span></div></div>",

You turned around, and saw Sung, looking down at her own chest with a face filled with shock. Something was odd indeed. Her nipples... Seemed super hard. Like, not only hard, but long, and huge. They lifted her shirt like tent poles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"S... Sung? Are you alright?\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Y... Yeah... It's just... I feel weird...\"</i> Said Sung, embarrassed, quickly turning red as a tomato while she hid her bulging nips with her hands.<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, I guess you must feel cold Sung!\"</i> Jested Ted.<br>\r\n<i>\"You can say that to yourself, Ted!\"</i> You answered, pointing to your friend's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Sung, his nipples were showing. Not as big as hers but... It was rather weird for this to happen to a dude like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Huh? Oh yeah, that's weird. Huh!\"</i> Said Ted, amused, touching his hard nipples.<br>\r\nThat being said, Ted seemed different than usual. Maybe it was because you didn't get a good look at him since the party started, but he seemed less muscular than he used to. His clothes seemed a bit too big for him. But his stomach was telling another story...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"By the way Ted, you've been hitting the fast food restaurant more than the gym, huh?\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"N... No. Why would you say that? Huh... <span class=\"cplum\">I guess I'm a bit bloated tonight but...</span>\" </i>He looked at his own rather distinctly large belly. His voice seemed to break, clearly he was lying!<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"But don't worry Sung, I guess it must be the air cause it looks like I'm rather cold too...</i>\" Said Kim, blushing. Indeed, her nipples too erected against her tank top. You couldn't help but look at her chest and... Was it a bit bigger than usual? Kim always had a nice round chest but... Right now they looked a bit bigger.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Well I guess it must be this shot of whatever that was, 'cause I feel great!\"</i> Said Patricia, stretching her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide opened as you watched Patricia stretching her body. You already noticed her cleavage was rather generous... But now her tits were almost bulging out! Not only that but, you noticed earlier that her sweatshirt didn't cover her bulging belly... But now it fit her perfectly! While her breasts seemed bigger, she looked... Thinner... Her face seemed different too, prettier... Her lips more plump...  Her eyelashes longer...<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Trish! Watch out, your tits are gonna pop out of your sweatshirt!\"</i> Warned Kim.<br>\r\n<i>\"Woops, you're right! Huh?! Wait a second... They seemed bigger than before... Aren't they?\"</i> Said Patricia, looking down at her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mistake. Her tits could barely fit in that shirt. In fact, you could catch a glimpse of her areolae leaking out. What the hell was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"GUAAAAH?!\"</i> Yelled someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was April. She was leaning forward, hands on her crotch, pale as a sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Huh... April? You're feeling weird too?\"</i> You asked, worried.<br>\r\n<i>\"I... Yeah... I'm just gonna go real quick...\"</i> April ran away and hid herself in Kim's bedroom.<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait, April, what's<span class=\"cplum\"> happening to y...</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed. You felt like your voice was breaking too! Not only that but... You felt a tingling in your body... You started to feel... Good actually. You felt a tingle on your crotch, and a pressure increasing in your stomach... Wait. You looked down. Your belly... It was growing too! It was pressing against your pants... Shit, it felt so big! Like you ate a whole feast for yourself... You fondled it... Oddly enough, it felt kind of good... So heavy, and mushy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"cplum\">Simon, dude! Look at yourself!</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">Y... You're... You're looking like a girl!</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?! It's true that you felt different... Your clothes seemed a bit more loose... Your arms... Seemed smoother... You touched your head, and indeed, it felt very different! Then you looked at Ted and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"cplum\">D... Dude! You too!</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"cgrape\">What? What are you </span><span class=\"cviolet\">saying?</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"cgrape\">Look at yourself too! </span><span class=\"chotpink\">Dude... You have boobs!</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"cviolet\">What the f...</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, your friend Ted looked... Really more feminine! It was like his muscles melted away, his body hair disappeared... And on his shirt his nipples moved forward, as two real feminine tits grew forward! But wait, if both of you were turning into women... That meant...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two had the same idea at the same time. You reached your crotch with your hands... And there was nothing! It... It was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Sh... Shit... My dick I... I'm really turning into a... And oh god, my belly is getting so HUGE!</span>\"</i> You said with a clearly feminine voice, looking down. Now it started to look like you were pregnant! You had to open up your pants, it was too tight... But this smooth mushy belly felt so good though...<br>\r\n<i>\"M... Me too...\" </i>You heard a weak voice. You lifted your head... And saw Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact you had to lift your head higher than you thought! Even though you were smaller now that you were a woman, Lisa was... So tall! You could see her red dress barely cover her thighs now! But more importantly... Her belly was getting huge too!<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Lisa...! You're so... Tall!</span>\"</i> You said, looking up.<br>\r\n<i>\"I am?! Oh god, yeah, I am too but... My belly... It's so weird... I feel like something is moving inside... It's like... Am I... Getting pregnant?!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPregnant?! How could that even be?! What was going on?! Was it... Was it the rum you bought? You turned your head, and saw Kim in a trance, fondling her breasts... They got so big too! Maybe double their former size... But not bigger than Patricia... She was stretching her body... Putting her sweatshirt to her limit... Her tits were bulging out... They got even bigger! Soon, they're gonna...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*rrrrriiiip*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sweat shirt ripped in half! Her two jugs burst out, bouncing against each other... As big as watermelons... And not only that, you saw milk dripping from her nipples! It was so unreal, Patricia looked so different too! Like a pinup from a magazine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><span class=\"chotpink\">Patricia... You're... You're lactating!</span></i>\" You said, your mouth wide open.<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah what the heck?! My tits are so big too... But I gotta say... It feels nice...\"</i> She said, fondling her milky jugs.<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"cviolet\">G... Guys, I think... Me too!</span>\"</i> Shyly said Ted with his feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, on his small breasts, above his ample belly, right around his bulging nipples... Were too wet stains! Not only he turned into a woman, but he was lactating too?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Shit, me toooo! God, my dress feel so tight now...\"</i> Said Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked even taller, but you realized she had removed her high heels! She was so tall, and her belly was so big it was lifting her skirt all the way! In fact, you could see her panties... And right above that, was her chest, tightly enclosed in her right dress... Two milk stains! So she was lactating! Which means she was pregnant... So Ted was pregnant too?! But that meant you could be too! You looked down... Your big heavy belly felt so mushy... Your belly button was uncovered, and it didn't feel like something was moving... You looked at your chest but you didn't see any milk stain... God having breasts felt unreal... They weren't that big but they felt good though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"chotpink\">T... Ted! Do... Do you feel like you're pregnant?!</span>\"</i> You asked, trembling.<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"cviolet\">N... No... I don't think so... But... Simon... Look... Behind you... Your butt... It's... Wowh...</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, you felt something behind... Something pressing against your underwear... You put your hands on your rear, and realized it was getting bigger too! Damn, turning into a big bellied woman wasn't enough?! But then, you realized that Ted kept looking at your butt... Drool dripping from his feminine lips. What the heck had gotten into him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"G... Guys... My butt too... Shit...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Sung who spoke with a weak voice, she had to stop hiding her huge rock hard teats because her hands were on her rear just like you. And just like you it grew bigger... And bigger... And rounder... It pushed against her jeans, stretching the fabric, bulging... So huge on her thin body! And you saw that Ted was staring at Sung's butt with a crazy look too!<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Sung... Your butt is so amazing now..</span>.\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"S... Stop staring you creep!\"</i> Protested Sung, shocked by Ted's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lisa was starting to act weird too. She kept muttering words, you heard her saying: <i>\"Mmm... Man... I need a man... There's no man anymore here, f... Fuck...\"</i> Then she ran away with big pregnant belly and her tall body. She also went into Kim's bedroom, where April ran away earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Simon... It has to be the rum you bought...\"</i> Said Kim, who was one of the least affected, having only hard nipples and breasts doubled in size.<br>\r\n<i>\"I know... But it's so freaking weird though...\"</i> You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird how everyone seemed... Okay with everything. Even Sung seemed to enjoy her new ass, despite Ted watching her weirdly. You also loved having such a huge belly, it felt so... Comforting...  And being a female wasn't so bad either, you felt a certain warmth in what was now your genitals... Your butt too... You didn't mind Ted looking at your butt actually... It was begging for some attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But... What's going on with April and Lisa?</i>\" Wondered Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snapped you out of your trance. Indeed she was right, what happened to them? You hurried to open Kim's bedroom door... And you saw something you never thought you could see.</span></div></div>",

As big as volleyballs! And the tall Lisa was on her knees... Sucking the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"God, Lisa... I'm... I'm gonna...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd April came right into Lisa's mouth. Cum spurted out and dripped everywhere, but Lisa tried to swallow it all. There was so much of it, and she was already fully pregnant! But her stomach was quickly filling up, rising her belly even more... It couldn't possibly be contained in her dress now, it was way bigger than yours! Finally, April fell on the bed, comatose, her shrunken balls and her erected dick still in the air. And Lisa's mouth was still full of her cum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Blurb... You... A'bril... You' dick iz so... Amazing...\"</i> Said the insane looking Lisa, spitting cum everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"HAAAA... HaaaaAAAA!\"</i></b> But then, everything went wrong at once! You heard a scream behind you... It was Sung!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran back to the living room, followed by Kim and Patricia who were as dumbfounded as you. There you saw Ted, still with his feminine body, fondling Sung's ass! And she was letting him do it, in fact, she was moaning, and twitching... She was enjoying it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh yeah... Ted... Spank me please!\"</i> Begged Sung. What the hell?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Ted did. You saw her flesh rippling after the slapping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"OOOooooOOOh yeAAaaaAAah!\"</i> Sung fell on her knees, wrecked by the orgasm Ted just gave her. God her nipples seemed even harder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of stunned silence. You felt your heart beating like hell. Things were getting crazy. Kim was yelling what the hell just happened. Patricia was still enjoying her milky tits... And Ted was looking right at you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis female body was so hot though... With his large belly, his milky nipples... And his beautiful eyes filled with desire... You knew what he wanted. He moved closer to you. Your heart beat went even faster. You turned your back to him, and whispered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"chotpink\">P... Please be gentle...\"</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ted grabbed your ass. You felt a surge of pleasure going through your body. It was so sensitive! You fondled your large belly, feeling quite aroused by it too... Ted kept fondling your butt... You noticed Kim's shocked eyes, but you couldn't focus on anything anymore. Your butt... Felt soooo good! And the, without warning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*SLAP*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"chotpink\">Guu...GaaaAAaah...</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed slapped your ass with so much strength! Like Sung, you fell on your knees, a feeling of orgasm going from your butt, to your nether regions, and also your belly button... Your first female orgasm... And maybe not your last...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then felt your consciousness fading away.</span></div></div>",

Good. It's good.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chatted a little bit with Lisa, but you couldn't help but notice that Sung was acting a bit weird. Maybe the alcohol was too strong for her? Her legs kept twitching, and her face was redder than a tomato... But then, you saw Ted trying to approach her. That dude... He really had to hit on every girl he met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So... Hey, Sung, that's right? Is that... Korean by any chance?\" </i>He smoothly asked, already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<i>\"Y... Yeah it is.\" </i>Said Sung with a weak voice.<br>\r\n<i>\"Are you okay? I gotta tell, your face is so red right now!\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah... Actually I feel alright... It's just... That alcohol was maybe too much for me...\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Haha, yeah. It is quite tasty though. It's just you're not a strong man like me, so of course you can't drink that much alcohol.\" </i>Ted always had to brag. But you took a good look at him, and realized he had seen better days. It was like his muscles melted away.<br>\r\n<u>\"You're not that strong...\"</u> Said Sung, her eyes half-opened.<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"cplum\">Huh?</span>\"</i> Ted was surprised by Sung's response.<br>\r\n<i>\"Look at you... You're not that strong... I... I can see your belly pushing against your shirt and you... You're chubby...\"</i><br>\r\nTed looked down, and indeed he felt a bit bloated... Where they once was a strong six-pack, was now a puffy pile of fat. But more than that... You could see his belly moving forward! It was... Growing? And... Shit, was he growing breasts? Ted looked at his chubby arms, put his hands on his crotch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"cplum\">\"What the fuck...</span> <span class=\"cgrape\">What... What</span><span class=\"cviolet\"> his happening to me...?</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear his voice was getting more high pitched... His face... His short beard disappeared, and... He looked like a woman! A chubby one that is. You couldn't believe your eyes. You felt like you were dreaming. What was going on?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But hey... You look good though, Ted... I like your big... Fat... Belly...\"</i> Muttered Sung, who looked like she was hypnotized by Ted's bulging stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a look at your glass. Damn it, the rum! That has to be it! You turned towards Kim to warn her, and saw her removing her shoes. She looked weird too...<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"Kim? You alright...? I think... I think there was something in that rum...\" </i>You said, a bit scared.<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah I think too... I'm starting to feel weird too... <span class=\"cnavy\">My clothes are tight too... Wait, is my voice changing too?</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Kim... She was already a bit athletic, but she seemed to be a bit more buff now. Not only that, but she was getting taller! Her top rose above her navel... And her breasts... They were shrinking?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Holy shit Kim! I... I think you're turning into a dude!\"</i> Yelled Patricia.<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"cnavy\">What?! No way...</span> <span class=\"cblue\">And Trish! Look at your tummy!</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right! Before, Patricia's tummy was leaking out a bit out of her sweatshirt, but now it was completely out, her navel exposed! And it kept growing... And growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Shit...! It's growing... So... Heavy... But it... Feels nice though... My god it's so weird... My tits feels weird too!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tits seemed to be bulging out even more too... And you noticed that on each of her tit... There was a wet stain! Was she having milk?! But then, next thing, you saw April removing her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"cblue\">April? Wh.</span><span class=\"clblue\">.. What are you doing?</span>\"</i> Said the increasingly more male and taller Kim.<br>\r\n<i>\"I... I'm not sure... But my nipples feel weird...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there she was, showing off her bra. Even with everything going on, you couldn't help but stare... She had a rather fit and nice body! Shit, was she removing her bra?! Yes, the next second, she was bare naked, showing off her tits! Her... Nipples seemed hard yeah, and long... Like more than an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ap... April... Why are you...\"</i> Yelled the growing Patricia, leaning on the nearby table, her growing belly rising in the air.<br>\r\n<i>\"It just feels so right... My clothes were disturbing my nipples... Look how long they are... They're a bit sensitive too...\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"Hell, April, I'm turning into a fucking blimp here! G... God... I feel so heavy... I feel so much milk in my boobs too... GOD!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilk was leaking out so much out of Patricia's tits, it was running on her beach ball belly, making a pond on the floor. It was an unreal sight... But everywhere you looked seemed unreal. April the redhead was almost naked with long nipples. Kim was now this tall dude... Your friend Ted was now this chubby girl with a big belly. And Sung... Sung had a... Dick...?! You saw this huge bulge on her tight jeans... There was no mistake! Not only she had one, but  it was huge! And apparently, Ted had noticed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Holy shit, Sung... You... You have a p... A penis...</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<i>\"I know... It's so weird... And it's so tight I can't even move... I... I don't think I'm turning into a man like Kim though... But this dick...\"<br>\r\n\"... It's so gorgeous Sung... Can... Can I touch it?<br>\r\n\"Wha...? You mean... Hum... Okay, if you let me touch your belly too...\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cviolet\">Deal!</span>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Ted and Sung started making out. Sung kept touching Ted's fat belly, and Ted kept fondling Sung large member...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Lisa. She was as panicked as you. You two were the last to drink the shots of rum. Which meant you were about to feel the effects too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You... You're okay Lisa?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know but... Look... You...\"</i> She answered with a shaky voice, pointing at your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, you felt something tingling. You looked down... And your nipples were hard, just like April! What the hell?! You didn't want that! But... It wasn't done. You felt all your body moving... And stretching... Your chest changed more. It got more puffed. Your belly... Felt harder. Your thighs were clenched, and your pants and underwear started to feel tight too... Your shoes too! You looked down, and saw your shirt... Lifting itself, revealing a beautiful six pack! What?! You were never this muscular... You looked at your arms, they were... Bigger too! Strong, and muscular... It wasn't so bad after all... You felt so powerful! But your clothes felt so tight... You looked up again, and realized you were taller than Lisa! You... You grew taller, at least one foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Lisa... She started to dance on her feet, visibly uncomfortable. Then, she held her breasts with her hands, and started pressing them together... My god, where they growing? Yeah, it seemed that way... The more she fondled them, the more they seemed to grow. They were leaking out of her bra, bulging out of her cleavage... She looked so sexy, even more now that she was smaller than you... You fell so aroused! Your eyes were glued on those growing tits... Her large double D's were doubling up... So that made them... F? G-cup? You didn't know anymore... Your clothes still felt so tight, your torso seemed to get even larger... Your feet were in pain, but all of this was overwhelmed by your incredible arousal. You felt so hard... And Lisa kept fondling her tits... But then, she looked up at your face, being towered by your incredible stature. And she muttered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"God... Simon... You're so hot...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your shirt ripping. Your pants and and underwear tearing in half. Your shoes exploding in pieces. It was just too much. You grabbed Lisa with your huge strong arms and you both instantly had a deep passionate kiss. Your tongues twisting together, she fondled your huge muscular thighs, while you fondled her enormous tits now completely freed from her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening turned so weird. Kim, turned male, started making out with April. You saw Ted, turned female, sucking Sung's huge dick... And she even came inside him, when she saw Patricia's huge belly! She had a thing for big bellies, apparently... As for Patricia, she seemed to have an orgasm just by touching her own balloon belly... But you didn't care anymore... You felt so good with this new body, with the girl of your dreams in your arms, and she had even bigger tits! After a huge session of making out on the couch, you soon had sex with her in your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd nothing mattered anymore...</span></div></div>",

Your roommate Kim was here, lazily watching TV. She didn't even looked at you and just waived to say hi. As you became friend with Kim, you relation went really casual. Maybe it was time to spice things up a little bit. Kim was already a cute girl, so the increase of pheromones and whatnot shouldn't hurt her that bad. Well, that was your reasoning. You also thought this potion wouldn't work anyway, but maybe it was an aphrodisiac of some kind... It could be interesting. You went to the kitchen, opened the book and went through the list of ingredients. Kim was always keeping so much stuff, you could find everything rather easily. A bit of ginger, a drop of tea, some lemon juice, vinegar, shake it vigorously... Microwave it for a few seconds... The book was so badly written, there was a chance all of that stuff was wrong. But anyway, when it was done, it seemed... Innocuous enough. You poured it into a cup and well... It looked and smelled like tea. You went out of the kitchen with the cup when Kim asked you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey, what were you brewing back there?<br>\r\n- Ah, hum... Some kind of flavored tea. I found the recipe online and wanted to try it. You want some?<br>\r\n- Yeah, thanks! That's nice, you never prepare tea or drinks around here.<br>\r\n- Well, you have to start somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Kim the cup with the potion, and she quickly took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hmm! Tastes good. You made some for you?<br>\r\n- Nah, tasted it, didn't quite like it. You can have it.<br>\r\n- Your loss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Kim drank slowly the whole cup, and kept watching TV. You just stood there, behind the couch, waiting for anything to happen... And nothing happened. \"Well, that was a waste of time. At least she enjoyed the drink.\" you thought. Sigh. That book was sketchy anyway, and there was no way such a simple preparation would do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening went as usual, you both had dinner and went to bed. But the next day was a different story...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Sunday, and like every Sunday, Kim always went for a jogging in the city park. But something was different... You were having breakfast, when she got out of her room, in her usual yoga pants and sports shirt. She always looked cute in that outfit, but now for some reason... She looked even better. Like really beautiful. She grabbed a quick snack, and when she moved closer to you, you couldn't help but feel a shiver, and your heart pulse getting faster. Her smell... It was incredible! She wasn't really different though... Or was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey Kim, hum... Just wondering, is there something different about you today?<br>\r\n- Huh? What do you mean? It's my usual jogging outfit. I'm not even wearing makeup...<br>\r\n- O... Okay. Sorry.<br>\r\n- Though my pants feels a bit tighter than usual... I should probably change them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as she wiggled her butt, trying to re-adjust her tight jogging pants. You couldn't help but stare. Her butt... Seemed a bit bigger. Maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, gotta run, see you later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hurried through the door, and started jogging down the stairs, as usual. As she went away, you felt a bit of sadness. You were hooked on her smell... What the hell happened?</span></div></div>",

Well, it's true that those clothes are maybe a bit too tight. But I'm sure they weren't before... Maybe it's because of the washing machine. Anyway, to focus on the jogging. I always loved to jog around here Sunday morning. The neighborhood was nice, there was a few parks, and the people were nice too! No one trying to bother you or anything. But still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was different today. I noticed a lot of people were turning around to look at me. Huh. I checked, but nothing wrong with my clothes... Damn, why were they all looking at me? They weren't any kind of sleazy men around here, now I really feel uncomfortable. Let's go to a park with less people. I passed a group of girls loudly chatting, but as soon as I crossed them, they stopped talking and I could feel their eyes on me. Geez, girls too? Can't anyone behave correctly anymore? I passed next to a square with kids playing around... Damn, them too? All the boys and the girls stopped playing to look at me, even their parents! Jesus! One girl, jaw to the floor, even let her ice cream fall off its cone. Okay it's getting crazy... I started running faster, and decided to make my jogging course shorter than usual. I crossed a couple holding hands on the way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Damn that girl's hot!<br>\r\n- Sweetie, don't you dare... Huh. I... Actually thinks you're not wrong for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow both of them were checking on me. Seriously?! It's so embarrassing, I don't believe it... And for some reason, running seemed to be a bit more difficult. My breasts were bouncing so hard, even with my sports bra... Wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got out of the bra! Damn it! Why... Oh god...Something's not right, my breasts are way bigger that they're supposed to be... Is that why people were looking at me? I need to go home quick, I can stay like that... I tried to put back my bra, but it was just too tight! Damn! And not only that but... My butt seemed bigger too? I could noticed the weight increased on my rear. What's going on with me, I need to get out of here, quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran and I ran. Passing through people. My chest jiggling up and down like crazy. Damn they were heavy. Men where whistling. Girls were whispering. Every eyes... They were on me! I can feel tears coming up... No Kim, keep it together! Fuck those people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I arrived at my flat. I was out of breath, and sweating like crazy, but I was safe. Simon was still there, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- That was quicker than usual... Is everything alright Kim?<br>\r\n- Just... Let me... Catch... My... Breath...<br>\r\n- K... Kim, your... I mean, something's wrong with your...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was pissed. I put my hands in my shirt, and removed that stupid small bra. And I turned to Simon, saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Yes, I know! My tits are bigger! They like... Grew when I was running or something! My god, everyone was looking at me, it was horrible! Just for a pair of tits!<br>\r\n- I mean... They're really...<br>\r\n- Come on, they're not that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held them together, looked down... They were almost twice as big. They were huge, heavy in my hands, and yet holding themselves, even without a bra, with the most beautiful shape. Damn... I must really look hot I guess. I looked at Simon and realized he was staring at my boobs... And had a huge hard-on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh come on Simon, snap out of it!<br>\r\n- S...Sorry... He mumbled, while crossing his legs.<br>\r\n- And... I think my ass too... I feel my underwear digging into my skin...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around, and tried to look at my butt... It looked bigger too... But still round and bubbly, thank god. But still, I must look like a bimbo now... And my tits.... What size were they? E? F? I have no bra for that... And... God, Simon's still staring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Simon, stop it I said!<br>\r\n- Sorry... It's just... You look great and... Smells great too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy smell?! What's wrong with my smell? I didn't put on anything this morning. Okay, stop, let's think. I need to act. Something clearly wrong with me. Maybe I need to go to an hospital... But what should I say to them? I don't even know what caused... This to happen!</span></div></div>",

He'd only really wanted the battered copy of the Belgariad that he'd spotted in the bundle. It was the Chinese ... or was it Japanese characters on the cover that made him think of his friend in Scotland. They'd met (virtually), exchanging opinions on Sci-Fi and fantasy. A shared love for Tolkien, Donaldson, Martin and Jordan, made them exchange opinions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe liked her honesty, it was brutal and frank without an ounce of compromise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping to keep the book as a surprise for her, his intrigued fingers traced their way over the embossed characters on the cover. It might be expensive, it might be trash... but there was a certain elegance to the characters. He dismissed the thought that it was gold-leaf that was pressed into them.

Frowning, she hadn't remembered ordering anything from Amazon, but the sound was unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the book over, she recognised the stamps, and the franking mark. It was a present from Simon, maybe a recommendation, ripping the envelope open the book slid out into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura liked to curl up with a good book, enjoying it more than nights out with her friends. The quiet pleasures of a good book brought her more joy than a night out. Riffling through the pages, she inhaled the fragrance, a smile coming to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura McGregor had always felt rather less than feminine. Her ancestry reflecting her mother's genetics meaning she was slender and delicate. Her friends had benefited from a more Scottish diet and were blessed with more curves than she could even imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mum's home cooking was always the healthy Japanese option, filled with sushi, norimaki and sashimi. With tonkatsu the only concession to the Scottish principle that everything can be served fried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips moved as she read the spell off the page. Absolutely unconvinced by the claims of the book, she was just reading it for fun. Her words barely more than a whisper were enough to trigger the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting her position, as a wave of warmth swept through her body. She dismissed the extra heft, the added weight tugging at her shoulders, as pure imagination, as just her hope for a fuller figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the book opened on the floor, she retreated to the kitchen to make herself a mug of coffee. Again, she dismissed the growth, as a trick of the light... or just the way her baggy clothes hung on her. The loose dark blue woollen top was a marvel at shifting, and hiding her lack of curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting at the table, staring out the window as she waited for the kettle to finish boiling, it was impossible for her to deny any longer. Mortified, and looking shyly around to be sure she was unobserved, she grabbed her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp spilling from her lips. The girls filled... No! Overfilled her hands, and if it wasn't the excitement they were more sensitive too. Gently rubbing her thumbs back and forth, her nips stiffened beneath the caressing touch.

Rising from her seat, her legs still unsteady with all her confusion, she picked it up half-expecting it to change under examination. The picture... it... looked like she was now! The picture from last Summer's holiday, was with this body she'd just gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing, to avoid burping, Sakura realised she was still gaining curves. Needing to confirm this, unsure she could trust her eyes, she raced to her bedroom. Well, the racing only lasted a couple of paces, as she felt her bust shimmy and slosh threatening her balance. But she reached her room at a fast walk. Ripping open the top drawer, it creaked in protest at the harsh treatment, but it confirmed her worst fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, she couldn't deny it. Her hands on her bras, each one marked as D-cup. The style and strength necessary for such a hefty girl. Even as she turned it over in her hands. Hoping, that it would return to the simple, familiar A-cup... An A-cup she barely filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe betrayal continued, as she rechecked. Surely she'd mis-read it.... Now! Now!! The damned thing was an E-cup! She shuddered, not knowing where it was going to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to the living room, and the still open book, she dropped to the floor to read it once more. Her bust landing with a crash stealing the breath from her body. The impact hurt, but she focused on the book. She needed to find a way to reverse this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCareful to not even whisper the words as she read the book, flicking back and forth through the book. She was tempted to rip the thing in two. But cold fear stopped her from that rash action. It was more of an effort to rise from the floor. Her growth accelerating, as she'd laid on the floor scanning through the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to heave herself to her feet. Her bust now far... far larger than any she'd seen before. The girls were gargantuan. Horrifyingly, humiliatingly massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the book on the table, she paced back and forth, trying to muster her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/da7c1509be301d61f0550db876998da2/tumblr_pkprzao6pg1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/da7c1509be30...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer baggy top, now stretched tight. The fabric brushing teasingly against her broader, fuller nips. Now cursed with a new level of sensitivity. On the the verge of tears, and collapsing into wailing despair. Sakura had an epiphany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven that brief pacing had helped, apart from the extra heft to her bust. The constant tugging at her shoulders, thankfully she was blessed with a stronger spine to compensate. But the damned spell was relentless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/da70b2d0ca581a61d71eae3975435bb9/tumblr_pkprzao6pg1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/da70b2d0ca58...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a moments work to flick to the right page. Her voice trembling, not wanting to think about it. If it failed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the end of the spell, and felt the unnatural heat fade from her body. Straightening up, she had to assess the damage. Her half-reflection in the patio doors was chilling enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bdb26f152d044bec6ab36b9b950267a7/tumblr_pkprzao6pg1w2lwkto3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/bdb26f152d04...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the kitchen, she checked the family picture. It was as she feared, her new body captured last summer, as if it was part of her new reality. Her friends familiar with Sakura as the shy girl, but now shy because of her sumptuous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kettle clicked off, as Sakura realised only a few moments, a couple of minutes had passed. That was all that was required to ruin her life. She needed the normality of a drink of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that she's shrink back to her previous dimensions, she kept a weather eye on her bust as she drank the coffee down. But it was hoping against hope, the spell had only cancelled out, not reversed.</span></div></div>",

Simon set to work on reshelving the books and hours quickly dwindled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving home after work, Simon wasn\u2019t surprised to find Patricia and Kim already there, sitting around the coffee table. His slender roommate and her plump friend were gabbing about something he didn\u2019t care to remember over a pizza while they. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Simon!\u201d they exclaimed in unison. Had he not been so exhausted his heart would\u2019ve skipped a beat at the attention of the two cute girls. Instead he smiled at them, made sound of acknowledgement and collapse at the small dining table they hand near the kitchen. The girls giggled at him and went back to their chatting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon dug through his bag for his own notebook and instead found the odd book her tossed aside at work. More curious than confused, he opened it and found a writing on the inside cover. It was glittering gold cursive, both elegant and difficult to read.The title stated simply <i><b>\u201cShsiw\u201d</b></i> and looked like gibberish. The first of the body, however, ready<i> \u201cScrawl on my pages your heart\u2019s desires and have your wishes come true\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon raised an eyebrow and chuckled to himself. It must be some sort of self-help or goal journal or something. The concept was admirable in its own right, Simon thought, but he also couldn\u2019t help but think of silly stories of genies and monkey\u2019s paws and the like. Without a hint of concern, Simon took up a pen and wrote in a wish on the first page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Simon actually read the introduction, he probably would have been more careful. The book did indeed claim to grant wishes like a genie but with a unique twist: the book would grant the opposite of whatever one wished. Were he to write \u201cI wish the weather would be great this weekend for my camping trip\u201d the weather would instead be horrid. Or if he wrote \u201cI wish Kim would chill and let me relax more\u201d Kim would instead become more dominant and more insistent he do his fair share around the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Simon didn\u2019t read the body so he didn\u2019t know about the twist and he wrote...</span></div></div>",

Halfway through the washing, he thought... \"Did I wrote that on the tome?\" He looked at it, and indeed it was written: \"I wish I did all the chores around the apartment myself.\" And indeed... That's what he wanted. Kim was just a messy girl anyway, and he always a bit OCD about housework. And it was the right thing for a man to let the girl relax while he do the chores. So he was tired of Kim doing such a bad job with cleaning and such, that he wanted to do it all by himself. The Tome worked! He finished the dishes and said to the girls:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Dishes done!<br>\r\n- Thanks Simon, can you take out the trash while you're at it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. Kim was clearly taking it for granted that he did all the chores. It wasn't a problem for him to do the chores but...What's the point of doing that if Kim  didn't show any appreciation for it? He turned to the tome and wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Kim really appreciates everything I do for the house and treats me like I'm the greatest guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just when he finished writing this, Kim entered the kitchen and yelled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey fuckface, I told you to take out the trash, and I didn't hear any answer!<br>\r\n- S... Sorry! I'm doing that right now!<br>\r\n- Yeah you better, when I say you do something, you do it right now, you fuck!<br>\r\n- Yes, sorry!<br>\r\n- Sorry who?<br>\r\n- Sorry Ms. Kim!<br>\r\n- Yeah that's better, now get on with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim slammed the door. Simon, who felt his heartbeat rising due to Kim yelling at her realized... It worked! he wrote: \"I wish Kim showed no appreciation for everything I do for the house and treats me like a worthless guy.\" He always had a thing for dominant person, and Kim was so hot when she was angry! He happily grabbed the trash bag and took it downstairs to the bin. But on the way, he realized the elevator was out of order, so he had to take the stairs and go down the seven stories... But he did it gladly! The bag was heavy, but that didn't matter. He did it, and went back sweaty and panting like hell. And Kim yelled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Well, it took you long enough fuckface!<br>\r\n- Sorry Ms. Kim, the elevator was...<br>\r\n- I don't wanna hear any excuse you stupid fuck, go make my bed, and quickly this time!<br>\r\n- Yes... Ms. Kim... Said Simon between two breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to Kim's bedroom, and he heard Patricia saying: \"Hey, maybe you treat him a bit harshly, no?\" and Kim argued that I was worthless and deserved that treatment. But still... Even if he liked the tyrannical Kim, it would be nice if someone would pity him for once, and see for what he's really worth... Like Cinderella, but with gender reversed! He could even change his looks to make it even more like a fairy tale...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was a strong and tall man that would catch the eye of Patricia, who would fell in love with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished writing that, he starts to feel weird. He was dizzy, almost lost his balance. Dropped the tome book... And when he opened his eyes and saw the book opened right in front of his eyes, with the sentence written:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was a weak and short woman that would never catch the eye of Patricia, who I fell in love with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it sounded like a fairy tale...! He looked around, and noticed he was wearing... A dress? A lousy, dirty dress! And his arms and hands... Were way smaller! Wait... He put his hand on his crotch. There was nothing! He hurried to look himself into Kim's mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... A girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked! He was she now! And she was a small, flat and short woman with just a simple olive green dress. ... Just like what she wanted! It felt amazing being a girl... Like in a fairy tale! But she had to hurry, the bed has to be done. She hurried, and went back to the living room. Going back there, and looking at the two girls, she realized how small she was! And indeed, she was 4 feet 8, 4 inches smaller than Patricia, and 8 inches smaller than Kim! Even the whole flat looked bigger now! But no time for gazing, Kim moved closer with her usual angry face, dangerously towering you, and yelled at your face:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I see you like to take your time today, Simone!<br>\r\n- That's not... I...<br>\r\n- I SAID NO EXCUSES!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim slapped the now named Simone. And Simone fell on the floor! Kim's slap was powerful. Never she thought that a slap from Kim would knock her like that... But now that she was a weak girl, it really did make feel her powerless. And she loved that situation! But she didn't want to see it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- So... Said Kim. I'm gonna find you a fitting punishment. Since we finished our pizzas and you didn't eat... You'll clean the coffee table, but with your tongue. That's should be enough of a meal for you.<br>\r\n- Yes... Yes... Ms. Kim...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Simone hurried to the coffee table in the living room, and started licking. Patricia was still sitting here. Patricia, who Simone loved with all of her heart. For her, she was the most exquisite and beautiful person in the world. But Patricia wouldn't even glance at her. She was licking the table right in front of her, and she didn't care, too busy looking at her phone. And she would never notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was now a woman at the mercy of a tyrannic Kim, loving a Patricia who didn't care for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Just like what he wished!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kim was tired of hitting the gym all the time, and whatever she did, there was better looking persons than her. But that could change! It'd be nice to be the center of attention for once... Well, even more at least. She wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now, I want to always be fit, and have the right curves to look beautiful and attractive to everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as she wrote that, she felt dizzy... Something was moving inside her... Her body was changing! She saw her belly bloating, getting bigger... Fatter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... Works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the book was written: \"From now, I want to always be fat, and have wrong curves to look ugly and repulsive to everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right, she was tired of being hit on by guys, tired of having to look good to people. She just wanted to be a flat slob. Everyone would find her ugly and would leave her alone. She looked at her mirror. well, she wasn't good looking anymore, that was for sure! Her cheeks and chin were fatter, her muscular arms turned flappy, her breasts started sagging, falling on her huge belly full of bulges, so big it leaked out of her sides, her ass went from big but round to just two sacks of fat, and her legs doubled in volume. It was perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went out of her bedroom with the book, with the intention of showing it to her friend Patricia. But as soon as she entered the living room, Patricia yelled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- OH MY GOD! Kim, what the hell happened to you?<br>\r\n- I found a wishing book! Look, I'll show you...<br>\r\n- What?! What are you saying?<br>\r\n- I wished for that body and I got it, you too can have your wishes granted if you want!<br>\r\n- What?! There's no way you wished for that! You... Urgh, you're disgusting Kim, you're so... Obese! Whatever happened, you need to fix it!<br>\r\n- But... I don't want to! This is body I want!<br>\r\n- Are you high Kim?! I'm sorry, it's just too much, I can't stand being with you right now... I'm gonna go, call me when... You fixed this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia then hastily grabbed her things and left. Kim yelled: \"Whatever, I don't need you, I can't believe you're such a bad friend!\" She was angry. She didn't think she would be even too repulsive for her best friend Patricia. But there was no going back, she wanted that body, and she was going to keep it! What's the point of having a wish book if you can't keep your wishes? She let her huge blob-like ass fell on the couch, and pouted. Meanwhile, Simone was just standing there, with eyes full of terror glaring at the ugly Kim. She also couldn't believe she found the Tome, and also couldn't believe she turned herself so ugly... She was appalled by her looks, but knew she would get angry if she said anything. Kim just looked at her and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Yeah, I found your book Simone. Or should I say Simon? You're too stupid to even use it correctly, so I'm gonna keep it. And you better keep doing everything around here, you dumb bitch!<br>\r\n- Y... Yes Miss Kim...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone really regretted leaving the wish book to Kim. Now she was really at her mercy! She couldn't imagine the scary things she would write if she made her angry. But for now, Kim was now more angry at Patricia. And now that she had the power to make her life worse, why not just wish for that? Steaming with furor, she wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish for Patricia to turn into a dumb slut, to be ugly just like me, except she will hate it and no will ever like her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia, with teary eyes, was still walking down the stairs, still shocked to what happened to her closest friend. She regretted leaving her like that but... She was just so ugly! Maybe she could try to find some help for her... But just when she thought about it, she felt a tingling all over her body... Her dress felt a little less loose. She looked down, and noticed the fat of her belly was going away! She looked at her arms... They felt a bit stronger... She looked at her reflection on nearby window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god... I'm beautiful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer big breasts that used to sag were now beautifully shaped, her ass was rounder, her silhouette was curvier and leaner... She just looked great! A guy passed next to her, moving up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hi there miss, you look beautiful today!<br>\r\n- Well, gee, thanks, do... Do I know you?<br>\r\n- Ah no, you just looked very nice and likeable that's all. Just wanted to tell you that, well have a great day!<br>\r\n- Th... Thanks, you too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a nice interaction! People never have been so pleasant to her. With that body, she could go after any man she wanted... But maybe it wasn't right. Being likeable and feeling beautiful was enough after all. But... Something was wrong. Well, it felt right but... It wasn't normal. Her mind felt clearer too, like she could think more easily. She remembered Kim talking about a wish book. Could it be real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Kim wished for her to turn like that... And me to turn like that...But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kim was still pouting on the couch. She couldn't bring herself to write something nasty about her best friend Patricia, instead, what was written on the book was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish for Patricia to turn into an intelligent prudish girl, to be beautiful unlike me, and that she will love it and everyone will like her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was sobbing. Even if she was angry at her for leaving her, she couldn't help but wish for her to have a happy life. She then heard the floor creaking. It was Simone. Oh that girl. Kim went from sad to angry again, slowly turned her flabby face towards Simone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You think I didn't hear you?<br>\r\n- S... Sorry!<br>\r\n- Stop that! I know you'll try to take the tome away during the night! So you better be careful, I won't write nice wishes for you. And you know what? I can prevent you from even using this book again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrote: \"Simone can't use this book anymore, and if she even tries to do anything with it, I will know it!\" and then she closed it. Of course, the writing immediately turned into: \"Simone can still use this book, and if she tries to do anything with it, I won't know it.\" Kim was smiling. She could write that if she wanted, it didn't matter. She was going to keep the book hidden with her drawer that had a lock, and she was going to keep the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Simone thought she could never use the book again, and felt desperate, as she thought she was trapped in this situation for ever...</span></div></div>",

A bit too fast for Kim, unfortunately, who seemed to need even more sleep with her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I'm late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up, and tried to put on some clothes. She realized that even her biggest shirt couldn't hide all of the fat dangling all over the place. But it didn't matter, she would be ugly either way. So she put it on, struggled to put on a pair of panties and a pair of yoga pants, ate the breakfast Simone prepared her, without even looking at her, and hurried to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Leaving the Tome alone. And Simone realized that. But it was locked away, and even if she founded it, she probably won't even be able to use it. It was no use, Simone put on her dress, and went to class too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the day, Simone noticed being a short girl really made the school experience different. Everyone was taller than her, she felt under-powered, and everyone looked menacing. She was so dull looking that no one even paid attention to her, and got accidentally bumped into too many times to count. Even walking in campus and just normally spending the day felt already exhausting to her, due to her weak body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed Patricia who... Didn't notice her at all. Simone saw that she was different, she was... Skinnier, and even more beautiful! She fell even more in love, if it was even possible. But it would be impossible, as she wished for her not to notice her... \"Why do I love fairy tales so much that I wish for that kind of cruel thing?! But at the same time, I can admire her all I want, it doesn't matter...\" Yes it didn't matter for Simone if Patricia didn't notice her, she loved her, and that was everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia was indeed having the time of her life. Everyone was now just so... Nice to her! No one made a bad joke to her, no one, even the angriest of people were mad at her... Her school experience was indeed different, but for the better! She kept thinking about how it happened, even if it was a blessing. Could it be connected to that book Kim had?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Patricia was the high point of Simone's day, but for Kim, there was no high point. Like she wanted, everyone was leaving her alone, being the huge fatty that she were. She felt great being left, and she loved all the fat on her body! Her smell was horrid due to her sweat, but at least she didn't have to think about that. She didn't have to think about how she looked, because she accepted to be ugly! But... It had a few other thing that Kim didn't saw coming. Mostly, that when she got to the bar for her part-time job, she was fired 10 minutes later. For a really simple reason, all the customers left. Kim left, angry, yelling at everyone :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damn fat shamming fucks! You can kiss my fat ass, you can't just fire me because of my looks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once again, Kim was left alone... And weeping. While everyone in the streets was avoiding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should happen next? And who to follow?</span></div></div>",

Ted, hi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right, even if she turned into a girl, she still had her usual friends, like Ted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Ted... I... Was always a girl to you?<br>\r\n- What? Well, yes of course, what kind of question is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone realized that depending of the wording of the wishes, reality could be altered from past to present, or not... That's why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- By the way Simone, what happened to your roommate? She used to be hot. How did she go so ugly and fat so fast? Her friend Patricia though, never noticed how hot she was.<br>\r\n- Y... Yes Ted, about that, I need your help!<br>\r\n- What, what's going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short girl that was once a man tried her best to explain to Ted what was going on, how Kim now acted at home, the Tome, where it was hidden... Everything. Ted listened, and tried really hard to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Okay but... Even if it's true... And that's a bit \"if\"... You guys have weird wishes.<br>\r\n- That doesn't matter! You can't leave Kim with this power, who knows what she'll do!<br>\r\n- Alright, alright little Simone. I have to admit you got me curious. So, what do you want me to do?<br>\r\n- Let's steal the key from Kim, and go to my flat and you try to find the Tome before she comes back!<br>\r\n- Alright, let's do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first part of the plan was surprisingly simple. Ted simply searched though Kim's bags while she was away in the toilet. Thanks to her stench, he could smell her if she was coming back... Anyway, he grabbed the lone key that looked like a drawer key, and went back to Simone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them hurried to the apartment while Kim was still finishing classes, hoping that Kim wouldn't notice that the key was gone. When they arrived, Simone was really out of breath, having run and climbed the stairs. She took a few minutes to catch her breath, while Ted rummaged through Kim's room, and found the locked drawer. He opened it, and he found the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shsiw? What a weird cover. But I guess there's actually a book, I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut was Ted as stupid as the others?</span></div></div>",

He figured Simone and Kim had weird wishes. But Simone really used to be a guy? That seemed hard to believe, but according to what was written, she was at least taller. And the last wish was weird too, why would Kim would wish for Simone to use the book without her knowing if she... Didn't want that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed went back to the living room where Simone was still catching her breath. He was glad to be a muscular man, and not out of shape like her friend Simone. Running and climbing the stairs was a breeze to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes no sense that Simone wished for that, if this book work, I'll correct it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ted grabbed a pen and wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish for Simone to be now as tall and as muscular as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to do a precise wording to avoid unwanted counter effects from the wish, thinking maybe that's what happened to the others. He didn't have to wait before knowing if the book was real or not... It was real alright! He started shrinking, his pants and shirt got loose, his abs and pectorals disappeared... His surroundings got bigger too! \"Damn, it feels impressive!\" It worked, it really worked! He grabbed the book to see if anything changed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to be now as tall and as muscular as Simone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope, that's exactly what he wished for! Or so he thought. Simone finally caught her breath, and noticed her friend have the same size as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Why... Why did you wish to turn smaller?<br>\r\n- Well, for you! I figured you wanted a friend as small as you. And I also wanted to see how it felt, you were right to wish for that though, it feels kind of amazing to be small and weak! But I need to find other clothes now, my pants just won't hold...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone wondered why her friend inflicted that to himself. She grabbed the book, and noticed the last wish from Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can use the book... Without her knowing?\" Again, why would she wish that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, suddenly, they heard someone climbing the stairs! Damn, could it be Kim already?

Simone kept the book, hid inside a closet in the living room, while Ted stumbled on his pants, fell on the floor, and just hid under the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will PAY for firing me! Just let me grab the Tome and you'll see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn! Simone had the tome, she won't find it and be even more furious! She must have been fired from her job at the bar...

SIMONE! GET THE FUCK OVER HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of her room, slamming the door, and stomped around the living room. Ted was so scared he was in a fetal position under the couch... But Kim in her rage pushed the couch, revealing the small Ted on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Who the fuck are you and what are you doing in my house?!<br>\r\n- I... Hum... It's... Actually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone realized she had to do something! If she wrote something on the book, Kim would never know it. It was her chance! She had to help Ted, or Kim was gonna murder him on the stop. She wrote the first thing that came to her head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish for Kim to suddenly fall in love with Ted, and to try and succeed to seduce him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she wrote that, Ted suddenly stopped stammering and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I... Wanted to come to the house of the most beautiful girl in the city, and I think I found it.<br>\r\n- Uh... What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed didn't understand why, but he suddenly felt attract to that huge sack of fat towering him that was Kim. Like something was so repulsive it came full circle and became attractive again. He just... Wanted to seduce her. Kim was so taken aback she didn't know how to react, but was clearly less angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone breathed in relief, still hiding in the closet. She had wrote: \"I wish for Ted to fall in love with Kim, and to try and succeed to seduce her.\". It was a bit of a gamble, but it seemed to work! Kim didn't what to say, she stumbled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- But... Who are you... How did you...?<br>\r\n- My name is Ted. And I'm really sorry, about coming to your place  you see... I'm the previous owner of the book of wishes.<br>\r\nTed was lying through his teeth, not knowing where it would lead him.<br>\r\n- You are? But how did you know where...<br>\r\n- I carried a little investigation, and when I came here, I noticed your door was already opened! And when I heard you, I just hid there.<br>\r\n- How can I know you're saying the truth?<br>\r\n- Your beautiful eyes are so sharp I'm sure they can see the sincerity in your eyes...<br>\r\n- Ahah, but... I wished to be repulsive... How can you even find me...<br>\r\n- We previous owner are still bathed in a certain magic, and I can see some in your aura as well. Thanks to your wish, I shall be your truest lover, the only one who can see your beauty!<br>\r\n- That... Sounds nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, Ted was good! But still... Simone pitied him for being attracted to such a huge pile of fat. Without changing too much, maybe she could arrange that... She wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish for Kim to still be repulsive to people, but just not as fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her closet, Simone couldn't see the change. But in fact, reality changed to accommodate to Simone's actual wish, which was \"I wish for Kim to become attractive, but just as fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed, Kim fat re-arranged itself in a more flattering way. Instead of the pile of fat and bulge dangling around, she had a big round belly, with two huge round boobs. Big round cheeks that you could pinch for hours, and nice, albeit huge bubble ass. Her skin was softer... She was big, round and cute! Simone thought that because Kim wouldn't know the wish, might as well turned attractive, so that Ted didn't seemed like such a weirdo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You know what? Said Kim. Let's find the book later together, right now, I want you!<br>\r\n- O... Okay, I'm all yours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, the cute balloon shaped girls hugged the small ted, and she started kissing... Simone  heard the sound getting louder and kinkier... Oh god, they were having it, right now, right here! And Simone couldn't leave, they were just in front of the closet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she waited, for them to finish having sex, which was the most painful yet most enjoyable sex Ted ever had, due to his weak body and Kim's tremendous weight. But at least, after a hour, they stopped, Kim went to the bathroom, and Simone could finally leave the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Ted looked at each other, not knowing what to say... Or do!</span></div></div>",

Just a day ago, when she was Simon, she would\u2019ve done anything to be in his shoes. She\u2019d always had a thing for Kim and fat girls so the idea of being fucked unconscious by a BBW version of Kim was the sort of thing she should\u2019ve wished for but instead she was Simone and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned.

Simone looked up to the fat, towering, naked Kim glaring at her, her broad hips grazing the door frame. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m in a good mood. Give it here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone hesitated. Every fiber of her being, altered by her foolish wishing, urged her to obey and give it to Kim but now that she knew the truth, she had no desire to hand it over. What happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kim\u2019s attractive, eye catching tan began to fade to until she was rather pale. Her beautifully applied makeup vanished, her luxurious hair lost its specialness, and her posture shifted from \u201cproud and confident\u201d to \u201cweak and demure\u201d. Her large body seemed to deflate; in mere moments she was twig like girl with next to now curves and several inches shorter. She was so small, weak, and plain. Just like Simone. Well, just like how Simone had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh geez, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Kim sputtered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry Miss Simone. I just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone meanwhile felt herself changing. Her shoulder length, straight flat hair become longer, shinier, curlier, and gained more volume. She felt makeup apply itself to her face and knew somehow it was perfect. Her skin darkened, gaining an even eye-catching tan. She watched her simple and plain olive green dress shimmer and restyle itself into a short and low-cut form fitting neon green mini dress. She pushed herself to her feet in time to feel heels manifest on her feet bringing her up to nearly six feet tall. Her shoulders straightened as she felt different; stronger, confident, better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at Kim with smile as she knew what came next. With each heartbeat her breast began to grow, cup by cup, and hips began to widen, inch by inch. Her ass swelled behind her and her thighs thickened below her, stretching her dress to its limits and pulling it short and short. Her belly, the main even, began to expand slowly at first but more rapidly the bigger a got, like a snowball rolling downhill. Larger and flabbier, it swelled and jiggled and in mere moments her body mirrored Kim\u2019s only minutes before but still seemed bigger somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me <u>my</u> book back, Kim,\u201d Simone said with confidence, holding out her hand.

Working part time at the bar, studying, and living with this lousy Simone didn't give her much opportunity to find someone. So why not wish for a perfect boyfriend? She listed on her wish what she wants in a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had a super manly boyfriend, with a strong masculine personality. Someone just as smart as me, and good looking, but not too much, I don't want to make people jealous. Affectionate enough, but not so much in love with me to the point of being needy and dependent of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim breathed. That should make a good b... Girlfriend! Yes, it was even harder for Kim to find someone, considering she was bisexual, and wanted for a long time to date a girl. But if this wish would come true, then it would be perfect. She read her wish again, to be sure it was correct :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had a super girly girlfriend, with a strong feminine personality. Someone less smarter than me, and so good looking she would make everyone jealous. Super affectionate, and so much in love with me she becomes needy and dependent of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim, where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was her voice! Kim yelled: \"In the bedroom!\" and sure enough, a few seconds later, the girlfriend of her dreams entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Morgan, she was just a bit taller than Kim at 5'8, and boy was she gorgeous! She had nice perky E-cup breasts on a lean but curvy silhouette, her ass had a perfect shape too, her legs were long and smooth... She was wearing a nice and revealing pink dress, close to her skin, and tight enough to make her bust slightly bulging out of her ample cleavage. And her face! She had nice puckered lips, eyes and smile full of joy, and long chestnut hair waving and falling on her naked shoulder. Kim thought she could easily be a model, and in fact, she was! She dropped her school to be a magazine model, but she met Kim at the bar she works and it was love at first sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, relieved to find Kim like she disappeared for a long time, gave Kim a big hug, her big bust squishing against Kim breasts. That's when she realized... That Morgan was not only taller than herself, but also bustier. And that was making her a bit... Jealous. But what she didn't realize, is that she was jealous because she wrote (even if it wasn't at first what she meant) that Morgan was so good looking it would make \"everyone\" jealous, so including Kim!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan, releasing Kim, said with an angelic voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I didn't see you going, I was worried for a second!<br>\r\n- Ahah, it's okay... Hum...<br>\r\n- Morgan? My name is Morgan! Don't tell me you remember you girlfriend's name!<br>\r\n- Of course not! I was just... Feeling dizzy.<br>\r\n- Oh my god, are you okay? Do you want anything for me?<br>\r\n- N... No it's okay.<br>\r\n- What's that book you were writing on?<br>\r\n- This? Oh it's just... A notebook, I was thinking of my finance class, and was writing a few notes.<br>\r\n- Come on Kim, you have to relax sometimes!<br>\r\n- Yeah yeah, I just need to write a few things, and I'm done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Kim looked at Morgan, the perfect girlfriend, the more she realized she was maybe too perfect. Kim thought she was good looking enough, and wanted to be the alpha of the couple. So she wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Morgan was just a bit smaller than me, and less busty than me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her wish reversed, and she watched Morgan getting taller, and taller... Her legs went longer, her hips and thighs wider. Her figure was still lean, her shoulders barely broadened, but her bust....! Her dress struggled to adjust. A belt appeared around her waist, and her boobs were growing like two balloons, right in front of Kim's eyes... In fact she had now to take a step back just to see Morgan's face, she could now barely reach Morgan's shoulders, and her eyes were glued on her girlfriend's massive H-cup tits. She was now a tall amazon-like girl, her head almost reached the ceiling, her being 6'8. Morgan gave Kim a hug again, but this time she just smothered Kim with her big hands and arms, and the now small Kim's face was deep into her squishy tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Come on Kim, said Morgan with a bit deeper voice, let's have fun!<br>\r\n- Just... A minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim couldn't resist making Morgan even more beautiful. Her reversed wish was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Morgan was way taller than me, and way bustier than me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't change the fact that Kim was still jealous. But maybe she could just wish that her was different instead of Morgan? Why only she should have the good looks after all! So she still pretended to take notes, and wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my body was more like Morgan's, but with bigger curves. I can't stand having a better looking girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrote her opinion too, unaware that it would also reverse, and count as a wish too. So her reversed wish was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my body was absolutely not like Morgan's, and with less curves. I love having a better looking girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's dream was becoming true! Now all of the attention was on her perfect girlfriend Morgan she created. She made sure everyone else would be even jealous of Kim, considering she had a really small and unimpressive body. Yes, right after her wish, Kim shrank from 5'6 to 4'2. Wowh, everything seemed bigger around her! And her tall girlfriend was now... Massive! Almost twice her size! She was just tall enough to reach her belly button, and when she looked up, she just saw Morgan's massive breasts looming over her. And not only that, but Kim got rid of her pesky curves. She preferred her girlfriend to be curvy, not herself. She now looked almost like a child, with A-Cup breasts, and a flat butt. She was even smaller than Simone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's enough! Leave that book!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan surprised Kim by grabbing and lifting her. She was so small compared to her she could be carried around like a child. Morgan gave Kim a deep kiss. God, even her tongue was so big compared to Kim's small mouth! Kim could almost choke. But she loved it. Morgan was so gorgeous and massive, and being in her big arms was like floating on a cloud. Morgan grabbed the book Kim was holding, and threw it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Come on Kim, you don't need that anymore!<br>\r\n- Y... Yeah, I guess you're right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, Kim was so happy she couldn't think of anything else to wish for. And so they went back in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Patricia was still on her phone, and Simone was still licking the coffee table. And to make things worse, Patricia actually had her legs standing on Simone's back, thinking it was the coffee table. Simone didn't say anything and kept licking, with tears on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kim finally arrived, Patricia let her eyes out of her phone, saw Kim in the arms of Morgan and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh. Well I'll leave you two lovebirds!<br>\r\n- Hum? It's okay Trish, you don't have to leave now! Said Kim.<br>\r\n- Nah, I don't want to be a bother.<br>\r\n- Okay... Oh we didn't talk about tomorrow's presentation!<br>\r\n- Shit, you're right. Let's do this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim and Patricia were studying together, and they had a presentation to do tomorrow. The small Kim jumped on the floor, out of the upset Morgan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Don't tell me you still have to work on your studies!<br>\r\n- Sorry! I'm gonna go finishing preparing this with Patricia, and then we can spend the night together!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim grabbed a wooden box to put on one of her chair so she could seat at the dinner table with Patricia. Being small was hard! And so they started working on their presentation, while the tall Morgan was pouting. She sat, or more like let herself fall on the couch, and Simone felt the air moving due to Morgan's huge body falling down, and the couch creaking with pain as it tried to support her weight. Her huge breasts jiggled up and down... She really was massive. Simone was so impressed by Morgan's presence she stopped licking the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Why are you looking at me Simone? And why are you still licking the coffee table?<br>\r\n- Huh? S... Sorry. And, well... That's what Kim asked me to do...<br>\r\n- But why are you obeying her? You're supposed to be her roommate, not her slave! It kind of looks like you're enjoying this...<br>\r\n- Oh yeah! I'm so happy. I couldn't wish for a better roommate than Kim. I know it's weird but... I just love following orders, and how dominant Kim is, despite her height. I mean, not that she's too small or anything...<br>\r\n- Ahah, no you're right, she's small. She's my small cutie! I love her so much... But I wish she studied less though...<br>\r\n- Wish... Oh my god! The wish book ! I... I think I left a book in the bedroom!<br>\r\n- Oh what's it like? I'll go grab it!<br>\r\n- No no no, it's okay, it's just an old book!<br>\r\n- Oh I know the one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late, Morgan knew it was the book she threw away earlier, and she was already stomping back to get it. Simone tried to follow her, but Kim yelled at her: \"SIMONE! Instead of bothering my girlfriend, make yourself useful and go clean the kitchen!\" And Simone agreed, though this time she let her head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Morgan grabbed the book that she saw Kim writing on earlier, and noticed the weird \"Shsiw\" cover...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morgan opened the book with her large hands, and read what was written on the first pages. She read sentences about doing all the chores, about being a worthless guy to Kim, and about being a short weak woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird... That must be Simone writing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she read the wishes about having a super gorgeous girlfriend, who is taller and curvier... And that's when Morgan realized:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Kim wrote that! So what Simone said... It really is a wish book! And I'm Kim's girl of her dreams! Oh my god, she even turned herself smaller just to make me more beautiful, because she loves it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan hugged the book, crying tears of joy at the thought of being the perfect girlfriend for Kim, the one she wished for! Even if... It wasn't always the case. But she didn't know that. And she couldn't resist the temptation of writing a few things on the book as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she came back to the living room, to watch Kim still too busy working on her presentation about finance with Patricia. She hated that! She wrote on the book:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Kim and her friend would realize that finance is the most dull and boring thing ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know, the book did its magic and Patricia and Kim started feeling weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Gosh, it's so boring, quick Kim, let's just get this over with...<br>\r\n- Come on Patricia, it's not that bad. Look at that spreadsheet! It's so organized.<br>\r\n- Yeah, it's a nice spreadsheet, but... Hmmm... Yeah, I love how the taxation rate increases...<br>\r\n- Oooh yeah, those number keeps getting bigger. Look at those big numbers...<br>\r\n- So amazing! D... Do you have a chart maybe? Oh my god, I don't know why I'm so into it, but I love finance so much!<br>\r\n- Yeah, I never realized how incredible this all is... Oh yeah, I have the chart right here.<br>\r\n- HOLY SHIT! That chart is so amazing!<br>\r\n- Oooh, yeah... Sooo goooood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim and Patricia actually creamed their pants at the sight of a simple chart. But after all, Morgan's reversed wish came true, because she actually wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Kim and her friend would realize that finance is the most arousing and exciting thing ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan's desires reversed, and she was just worried about Kim, that she wouldn't succeed with her presentation. So she wanted to give her an extra push to motivate her through her homework. But maybe it was a bit much, and she didn't phrase her wish very well. Because now, Patricia and Kim were sweating, moaning, her legs twitching... They were looking at their work like they were having sex, but more intense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- So hum... So you can see the tax rates kept increasing...<br>\r\n- Oh yeah...<br>\r\n- And it reached the top point around... H... Here...<br>\r\n- Holy shit, yeaaaah!<br>\r\n- But, look at this, when we adjust it for inflation...<br>\r\n- OooooOOOH GOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey actually reached an orgasm! It was way too much, Morgan thought. In that state, Kim will just embarrass herself in front of her class if she... Enjoys it that much! She thought of another wish. Maybe she could kill two birds with one stone, and make sure Kim will spend more time with her and not with her study... After all, there's no need for her to work on her presentation, if she doesn't go to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Kim already graduated from her school with the best results possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia and Kim tried to catch her breath, regaining consciousness after that intense emotion of seeing the new chart adjusted for inflation. Patricia then asked Kim:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- But Kim... I don't get why you wanted to help me on that presentation. Why did you want to help?<br>\r\n- I know it's just... I miss it Patricia, you know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's because Morgan's wish turned out to be:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Kim already failed the school due to her having the lowest results possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia answered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I know... I never realized how amazing finance is! Man, I feel weird. I'll have to calm myself for my presentation tomorrow.<br>\r\n- Yeah well... Good luck!<br>\r\n- Oh, Kim... I feel bad for you, you know? You seem to enjoy it, it's too bad they already put you away. Maybe you can try enter the school at another time?<br>\r\n- Maybe I will... Can I keep a copy of this chart though? It's so amazing...<br>\r\n- I know right?! I love how everything in the spreadsheet is visualized so elegantly, with the right choices of color... Hmmm... Okay let's calm down! Here, have it.<br>\r\n- Th... Thanks... Goodbye Trish!<br>\r\n- Bye little Kim!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Kim stayed for a while looking at her chart, while Patricia left, not realizing that Morgan was still watching her, the wish book in her hands. She carefully hid the book under the couch, and then moved towards Kim and removed the chart she kept staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- So Kim, I guess now you have time for me then?<br>\r\n- Hmm? Oh yeah, sorry, I was just... I know it seems weird but...<br>\r\n- Yeah, you guys seemed to have fun with your finance! I guess I shouldn't have... I mean, you had your fun, how about we spent the night together?<br>\r\n- Sorry, did you say something?<br>\r\n- Yeah, about spending the night together?<br>\r\n- No, before that.<br>\r\n- I... Don't know what you mean.<br>\r\n- Morgan, did you, by chance, pick a book in my bedroom? The one I wrote notes on.<br>\r\n- No, why would I?<br>\r\n- N... Nothing, it's just... Okay, we can spend the night together if you want.<br>\r\n- Great! Let's go the bedroom. I'll make you forget about finance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan said that, but Kim still put discreetly the chart in her pocket. And the little Kim, while following her beautiful girlfriend, still thought something was odd...</span></div></div>",

Why would she do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally saw Morgan hiding the book under the couch, and going in the bedroom with Kim. It was an opportunity! Something odd was going on, and she wanted to check the book.</span></div></div>",

She wanted to be sure Morgan and Kim wouldn't come out the bedroom, so she listened to the door and heard:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Yeah Morgan, talk to me about... Something financing related... Just for me to get in the mood.<br>\r\n- Okay, if you want... Hum... So my mom is trying to buy a house.<br>\r\n- Oooh, yeah. Tell me more.<br>\r\n- Well she... Hired someone to find the best rate for the loan, and hum... She managed to find a 2% rate.<br>\r\n- Two percent?! Oh god it's so fucking low! Amazing! Tell me more about your budget plans! I loooove it...<br>\r\n- Okay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone raised an eyebrow. It was definitely weird, but at least they were busy. Who gets off about financing stuff? Anyway, Simone took the book under the couch and read the last sentences that were wrote on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized she was right that Morgan made a weird wish about Patricia and Kim enjoying finance to the point of ecstasy, also that Kim failed her school because of Morgan, which was a bit mean. But it wasn't the most surprising thing, apparently, Morgan herself was just a creation of a wish from Kim! Not only that, but she made sure that her girlfriend was taller than her, and that Kim herself was smaller and flatter! It's so odd, Simone remembered Kim always was like that. In fact, she loved the fact she was being dominated by someone shorter than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, all those wishes were odd to her. Well, her wishes could be seen as weird too, considering she was in an abusive relationship with her roommate, but it was always a kink, back when he was a man. So even if it was weird, at least it's something she wanted. But why would Kim want to turn smaller too? It would be an odd coincidence that Kim too had that kind of wishes. At least Simone knew that all those wishes weren't what normal people would wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to look through the book, and noticed there was an introduction to it, written in small characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Be careful, this book will twist your desires. You will get the opposite of what you want, while being certain you got exactly what you wanted. Or maybe it isn't the case, and you got what you wanted after all...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Simone said out loud. But nobody heard her, Morgan and Kim were still having their weird finance foreplay. So... What does that mean? Simone tried to understand what she read. She was certain that the wishes she wrote where what she wanted. If she got the opposite of what she wanted, does that mean she wanted Kim to be... Nicer to her? And that she wanted to be a tall man instead of a short woman? But she was sure that was she wanted... Even though, come to think about it, it made more sense as a normal wish than what she got... So that meant Kim wanted to be taller than her girlfriend? And maybe she wanted a boyfriend actually!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! We were all... Tricked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, the book worked! And the text said that maybe none of it was the case, so maybe some wishes weren't reversed? But how was she supposed to know that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone wanted to try a few things with the book.</span></div></div>",

Write a wish already reversed? So it would the way she wanted. So, the couch in the living room was red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's say I want the couch to be blue...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she grabbed her pen and wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish the couch wasn't blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wish reversed, and the couch turned blue. And indeed now on the page was written : \"I wish the couch was blue.\" But still, when Simone saw the couch, she thought: \"Damn it! It's still blue! Why isn't it red?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause not only the wish reversed, but her desires also. In fact, the goal of the book was to trick and confuse people, no matter how they wrote their wishes, or how clever they thought they were. Now, Simone was certain the couch was always blue, and that she wanted the couch to be red. She was clearly confused. She thought : \"I wrote that I wished the couch wasn't red, so it should have reversed and it should be written that the couch was red, but instead it's written that the couch is blue! Why blue? It's the same color it always was, why would I wish it to have the same color... Unless it just changed color and I don't realize it, or I thought I wanted it to be red, but instead I... AAAAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked the couch in frustration. She lost her train of thought. Meanwhile Kim and Morgan where still having fun sex, and Kim kept yelling about yearly payment plan. Simone tried to focus, this book was turning her mad! She had all this power in her hand, but she didn't know how to use it to her actual will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*grooowl*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her belly making that begging noise. No wonder she couldn't focus, she had an empty stomach! But Kim told her just to eat the pizza crumbs on the table... She didn't want to disobey Kim, it was part of her domination kink, but still... She needed to focus now more than ever! Kim would notice if she ate anything in the fridge, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll try to use the book without screwing it up next time. Come on Simone, think... Be simple... Just... Write the opposite of what you want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my stomach wasn't full at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes, fearing the worst. She didn't realize that reality was already changing. Her empty stomach... Well it wasn't empty anymore. Her belly started swelling. Food just appeared out of nowhere inside, and tried to find all the room there was in her small stomach. Her navel pushed her dress forward, and her belly got rounder and rounder, fuller and fuller... It creaked and made blurping sounds as it reached the maximum size it could reach. It was now roughly the size of a basket ball. Her dress barely managed to contain that belly, and so it barely covered her legs. She looked down, and just saw that massive belly blocking the view of her feet. She felt her skin hurting and stretching, and her stomach was writhing in pain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... It's still full... My wish didn't work again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the book was written: \"I wish my stomach was full to the brim.\" And a few event of the past changed too. Earlier, Kim and Patricia ordered too many pizzas by mistake, so instead of asking Simone to eat the crumbs, she had to eat two and a half extra large pizza. She forced herself to eat all of it, and even had to push the food in her throat. Her dress and face was still dirty with sauce and oil, and she felt sick. She wanted her stomach to be empty again, so she tried to write \"I wish my stomach wasn't empty\", or so she thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it! My wish didn't reverse at all! I wanted my... Belch... Belly to empty for god sake! Why would I write that I wished my belly was full it was already full? Or the opposite for that matter! I couldn't have wanted for my stomach...Burrrp... to be full if it was already full... Okay, what if I wish for something that's already the case? If I...Bwaaarp... write the same sentence again, does it go back to normal...? Okay that's twisted but let's try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Simone, still trying to ignore her stomach pain, wrote the same sentence that was written already on the book. So she wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my stomach was full to the brim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the goal of the book was to trick people, so what happened this time is that... Nothing changed at all. Except for Simone's desire. First, she didn't want to be starving, then she didn't want to be overfed, but now... She was still overfed, her stomach was still full, her skin still stretching... But she loved it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, it worked! It did exactly what I wanted, my stomach is super full, just like I wanted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone fondled her big stomach, and kept thinking about her new memories of Kim ordering her to finish the pizzas, and then struggling to fit all of that in her small body. She drank a bit of soda to gulp it down too, but she managed to fit every bite! She felt so proud, and it was so much better than the alternative where she was starving! She fondled her big pregnant-like belly, felt and heard the food sloshing around... \"That's gonna take time to digest that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she thought... Now she could actually use the book however she wanted now, right? For example, she wanted a full stomach, so she wrote : \"I wish my stomach wasn't full to the brim.\" and it wrote the opposite. Oh yeah, she did that because the previous wish was also \"I wish my stomach wasn't full to the brim.\", so she wrote the same sentence. So what did she tried to wrote earlier, if it wasn't that? She couldn't remember. It was still very confusing to her. But it didn't matter, because now she got exactly what she wanted. Or more exactly, that's what the book made her believe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... I have to write the opposite of what I want... Then write the new sentence that changed, again... I think? Something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kim and Morgan were still having sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH YEAH SELL YOUR ASSETS BABYYYY!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy god, Kim was still yell financial lingo? Then Simone realized: \"Oh shit, that's right! Kim and Morgan know about the book! I can't let them use it again... All the more considering Morgan was created by the book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Simone again tried to use twisted logic to make sure that Kim and Morgan wouldn't find or use the book again.</span></div></div>",

So let's try...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrote: \"I wish Kim and Morgan knew about this book, realized it was a wish book, and that they wrote some wishes inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so that wish turned to : \"I wish that Kim and Morgan never knew about the wish book, they never realized it was a wish book, and that they never wrote some wishes inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, all the wishes Kim and Morgan made disappeared. They never wrote inside, but still, reality didn't change back to before. They were still having sex in the bedroom, Morgan was still the same tall woman, and Kim the same incredibly short woman, Kim and Patricia were still weirdly aroused by talking about financing. But all of that was the reality it always was, not because anyone wished for it, or wished for the opposite of it. In fact, Morgan and Kim never found the wish book. It just happened that a busty 6'8 woman fell in love with at short and flat 4'2 girl. And Kim and Patricia attitude towards finance was still weird, but not due to any tricky wish at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Simone was frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, it still didn't work! It's not Kim and Morgan that I wanted to forget about the book, it was me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, her desires also inverted. She felt ashamed of writing wishes about being dominated by Kim, so she wanted for things to go back to normal, so that she would write things on it again. She didn't want people to find out she had a domination kink, or that she used to be a man. So she wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that I knew about this book, and that I wrote wishes on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she realized, just before she finished writing: \"Wait. Then I'll forget that it's a trick wish b...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late, the confusion she had due to the constant tricks of the book had the best of her. She made a terrible mistake. The book fell from her hands, bounced on the floor. The book was now empty, except for a sentence : <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that I never knew about this book, and that I never wrote wishes on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that sentence also disappeared after a second, because now, it was like Simone never wrote anything, and never realized it was a wish book, let alone a tricked one. Simone's eyes fluttered. She forgot about before she found the wish book. She forgot about being a taller man. She always was a girl, always was dominated by Kim, her small roommate. It was just her life, and in fact, she didn't want any changes to it. Her belly was still stuffed with pizza Kim forced her to eat, but she loved the sensation of having a full stomach. She fondled nonchalantly her belly then thought:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. What was I doing? And what's book on the floor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was written \"Shsiw\" on the cover. She took a quick look and saw the sentence: \"\u201cScrawl on my pages your heart\u2019s desires and have your wishes come true\u2026\u201d\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. A wish book?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bedroom was quiet. Morgan and Kim had so much sex the both fell asleep due to exhaustion. Kim was having dreams with numbers and percentages in them. Simone was holding the book of reversed wishes, unaware of how reality already changed due to her previous reversed wishes that were now erased from the book. She was interested by the book, but she was also afraid that it belonged to Kim, and that she would be angry if she tried to write anything on it. But maybe it was worth the try? At worst, Kim would slap her again, but she was used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, thinking about what to wish made her reflect on her life. Simone was a small girl, but she found an even smaller roommate with a real attitude problem, which was perfect for her domination kink. She was in love with one of her friend, Patricia, but it was like Patricia never noticed her. But then again, she seemed fine with that. She was force fed pizza, but still, she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it, something is clearly wrong with me, I need to regain control of my life before I lose it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she grabbed a nearby pen, and wrote a wish, hoping it would work. And once again, without noticing the trick of the book that was clearly explained on it... She wrote frantically:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I stopped being so submissive to everyone around me! I don't have to obey to everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone head hurts. Did something change? She wasn't sure. She checked again what she wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish everyone around me started being submissive to me ! Everyone has to obey to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit harsh, but that's what Simone wanted. But anyway, Kim and Morgan were sleeping, and her stomach was begging to digest all of that. She hid the book under the couch, and fell asleep, hands still fondling her swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow morning was difficult. Simone woke up with difficulties, and prepared herself for the day. She looked at herself in the mirror, her belly deflated, but was still visibly bulging. \"Dang it, I'm gonna become so fat... Not that I don't like it though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kim was already awaken, and went inside the kitchen. That's when Simone heard:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SIMONE! EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THE KITCHEN IS STILL DIRTY! I TOLD YOU TO...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone hurried in the kitchen, afraid of the punishment Kim would give her. But when she arrived in the kitchen, to her surprise, Kim suddenly became really quiet, like she was afraid of Simone all of a sudden. The small Kim said in a quiet voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I mean... Can you please clean the kitchen? I mean... If that's okay with you.<br>\r\n- Huh? Do you want me to clean the kitchen or not?<br>\r\n- Yes! But... Well, it's okay if you don't want to... I don't want to... Hum... Sorry if yelled, I didn't want to... Sorry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone then remembered. The wish book! The wish she wrote! Kim just started... Being submissive to her! So it worked? Did that mean she could order Kim anything? She wanted to try. She moved closer to Kim with a menacing pose, and looked down on her with her superior height. She then said with the meanest voice she could make:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Listen to me little... Shrimp. You're gonna clean the kitchen yourself, okay?<br>\r\n- Y... Yes, okay Simone! I'm so sorry I used to order you around, I'll stop right now, I'll... I'll clean the kitchen okay?<br>\r\n- Yes, and quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone then gave Kim a kick in the butt. Wowh, she had such power! So the wish book really worked! She couldn't wait to make more wishes... But first, there was someone else to confront. The tall and busty Morgan arrived in the kitchen, not yet under the influence of the magically charismatic and authoritarian Simone. And despite Simone being two feet smaller than Morgan, she managed to look down on her, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey Simone, what are you doing to my girlf...<br>\r\n- What now? Do you have any problem?<br>\r\n- N... No... I just... I was just wondering what...<br>\r\n- What I do with Kim is none of your business! You can go kiss my ass!<br>\r\n- Y... Yes, of course Simone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without missing a beat, Morgan knelt on the floor. Simone wondered for a second what she was doing, and realized she ordered her to kiss her ass... And so she did! Red from embarrassment, she gave Simone's little derriere a peck. It was cute, and Simone thrilled of all the ideas that came to her mind, of things she could order them to do. But first, she said to Morgan:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You go clean the bedroom, from now on, it will be my bedroom! And Kim and you can sleep on the couch for all I care. And hurry up!<br>\r\n- Y... Yes Simone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan quickly stood again on her two feet and ran to the bedroom. Kim was frantically cleaning the kitchen, and did nothing to protect her tall girlfriend. Simone came back to the living room, took back the wish book hidden under the couch, and was about to make another wish...</span></div></div>",

So you grabbed a pen and decided to try something with your boss Lisa, just to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you wrote on one text box : \"Lisa\", then under it : \"The sky is red.\" If the book worked like it pretended, Lisa would be under the delusion than the sky is fact red. But nothing seemed to happen when you wrote on the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to see if it indeed was a magic book, you tried to ask Lisa...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey hum, Lisa... Nice weather today, don't you think?<br>\r\n- Seriously Simon, you don't have anything better to do than ask me weather-related questions ? You didn't re-shelf those books yet...<br>\r\n- I know, I just wanted to chat. It's beautiful... Red sky outside.<br>\r\n- Yeah I guess.<br>\r\n- So you agree... About the sky?<br>\r\n- Yes, the sky is red Simon, like always. Now that's settled, start working for a change!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lisa left, leaving you dumbfounded. It... Worked? You looked outside, the sky was blue but... For Lisa, it was red! Unable to believe it, you decided to try something else, this time with a pencil. On another page, you wrote \"Simon\" in the text box, and then wrote something... A bit more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa wears only underwear when she's at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing special seemed to happen, but then you turned toward Lisa...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't wearing any clothes. Just her white bra and panties and her glasses, like some kind of model. Damn... You couldn't help but admire her curves, and her excellent choices for underwear. Her big double Ds were tightly pressed against each other, and her fat butt was tightly wrapped... And just enough flesh on her tummy... And yet she was working like nothing was wrong! Other students passed next to her and didn't react! That meant only you were under the delusion that she was wearing only underwear, like the book said!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon, why are you even looking at me?

You're already here?<br>\r\n- Yeah, I have a early shift on Sunday, don't you remember? What, am I bothering you?<br>\r\n- N... No...<br>\r\n- Is something wrong? You look like you saw a ghost. It's just me you know!<br>\r\n- I know it's just... I forgot, and I'm a bit tired...<br>\r\n- Alright, don't forget it's your turn to do the dishes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim went back to TV watching, and didn't pay attention to you. You realized the opportunity was too good not do test the book on her. You went to the kitchen, but not to do the dishes, but to write something on the book...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrote Kim's name, then the following sentence:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually Kim's turn to do the dishes today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after a few seconds of hesitation, wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim will realize than my body is actually more muscular and toned than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a bit of a crush on her, and wanted a bit more attention from her. It could certainly be a way... You went back to the living room, took off your jacket... And Kim indeed got distracted from the TV to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Wowh Simon, you've been working out?<br>\r\nYou didn't. You had the same usual average body. But you said:<br>\r\n- Yeah, you didn't notice?<br>\r\n- I... Guess not. Well way to go handsome! We should hit the gym together some time.<br>\r\n- Sure why not! By the way, it's actually your turn to do the dishes.<br>\r\n- What? Oh... Yeah it is. I don't know why I told you it was your turn. Well, sorry, I'll do them right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim turned off the TV and went to the kitchen. Smiling like a demon, you sat on the couch and opened the book once more while Kim was doing the dishes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Turning other people crazy was way more fun! And so much could be done just on Kim. You thought about being careful with this this. First, you have to write things without being seen, and not go too far, because he would make Kim turn insane. This book... It was powerful! And Kim is still your friend, you didn't want to embarrass her too much. But... Erasing the delusions on the book should work after all? And after all, it's not like she would notice... You think about one of your fantasies you had on her since you moved in together with her, and wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim wants to work to a strip club because she's tired of her part-time job at the bar. She started working on a strip-tease dance for a while, and after finishing the dishes, she wants to show the dance to me and feels comfortable enough to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, hid the book, wondering if what you did was wrong. But still, if it worked... After less than a minute, Kim finished the dishes, went inside the living room, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's a bit weird. But I... I'm kind of tired of working as a bartender, and I noticed that a strip-club not far from here looks for girls, and it pays really well. I know, it's sleazy and shit but... I need the money. Anyway, I trained to do you know, a strip-tease, but I'm really not sure if I'm good a it. Is it weird if... I show it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. The whole story you wrote turned true. At least... To her! You couldn't believe that the Kim you knew wanted to work at a strip-club, just because you wrote that on a book! It really was a change of personality for her... Anyway, she was waiting for an answer, so you nodded, and muttered a: \"Y... Yeah...\", and then she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks Simon! I know it's a bit weird, but I feel... Okay if it's you. After all, if I'm gonna do it in front of a bunch of males, might as well start with you, right? Well, here we go... Ahah, it's embarrassing though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned and showed you her back. She put on some sexy music on her phone, and began dancing. She was just wearing a pair of shorts and a tank top. She started swaying her body. Your eyes were glued on her big bubble butt shaking close to you... It moved up, and down, back, and forth... Then she shook it vigorously... Then moved closer to you, and you felt towered by that round ass... Then, she turned, and you saw her face, with an embarrassed look, but still trying to be flirty. She swayed and swayed, slide her hands on her nice perky tits... Then leaned forward, giving you a good look on her cleavage... You were red as a tomato, and hard as a rock. She then turned her back again. What a tease... Slowly but surely, as the music was building up, she moved her hands on her hip... And removed her shorts! Damn it looked even better with just her panties! Your breath was heavy, you couldn't believe what you had done... She turned towards you again, and this time she removed her bra right under her top... So hot! She threw her pink bra at you... You saw her perky nipples poking through her top. Then she went to remove her top... Slowly... And just when you saw her underboobs...</span></div></div>",

You were puzzled. Who on hell interrupted the strip-tease of your roommate? Kim then explained:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I... Forgot I invited Patricia tonight for girls night. I really wanted to show you my dance, and I forgot she was about to come. How could I forget... Anyway, forget what you saw, and don't talk to her about my strip-tease plan, okay?<br>\r\n- Y... Yeah sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed, you saw Kim getting dressed, and then she went to open the door. You sighed. \"Girls night\" meant they will want to leave them alone for the night, while they watched a stupid romcom, drank beers... Usually in their pajamas... Why not try to be a part of girls night after all, you thought. Maybe it would be even more interesting, now that you had the book of delusions... While Kim was away to greet Patricia, you went to grab the book, and realized Kim's bra was still on your lap! You quickly hide it behind you, grabbed the book, and wrote a new page with \"Kim and Patricia\" in the text box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls will want me to join their girls night, because Patricia really wants to watch a horror movie, but they're both easily scared, so they'll want me to comfort them, because I'm a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment right after, you heard their conversation at the door derailing. You quickly hid the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- What now Patricia? You want to watch this... Horror movie? But you brought those DVDs!<br>\r\n- I know but... I heard of this horror movie. It's on pay-per-view and it is really scary, I really wanna see it, but I don't know if I can handle it...<br>\r\n- Yeah me too... That's weird, I don't mind horror movies usually, but... Yeah, from what you said, it sound really scary. You're sure you wanna see it?<br>\r\n- Of course I do! I know... We need a man to comfort us while we watch it. Maybe we could ask Simon?<br>\r\n- I... That's weird, I agree, we need a man... But it's girls night... But whatever, I don't mind if Simon join us,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. Everything went according to plan. Kim wasn't usually the type of girl to think girls needs men for anything, let alone watch a horror movie, so it was incredible how you were able to rewrite their way of thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrcia went to say hi, and asked you to join them for girls night, and told you about the horror movie. Of course you accepted. Kim then said: \"Well, let's get dressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, they went to dress up in their pajamas, like they used too. You being there didn't change that, fortunately. While they were away, you had time to write something else on their common page. You wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls trust me and what I said no matter what. They think I'm a genuine nice guy who can do no wrong, and not at all a pervert, no matter what happens. So they don't mind if I touch them anywhere...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you go! That way you could do anything to them, and they wouldn't mind! If it works, then there's no way they will be any screw up. After a while, the girls came back, and boy did they look great! Patricia looked different without makeup, but still she looked good. She let down her long blonde hair on a complete pink pajama set that looked really cute. It was ample enough, but you could see her curvy silhouette with her large bosom and generous tummy. Kim was way sexier, wearing a buttoned top that barely covered her chest, leaving her flat and muscular tummy out in the air, and a really short pair of shorts that really complimented her bubble butt. To think you almost saw her naked! Kim smiled and laughed, embarrassed by the situation. Patricia then said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Well, consider yourself lucky! We wouldn't allow you here if you weren't a nice guy.<br>\r\n- Yeah and, added Kim, he looks good too now, since he has been working out.<br>\r\n- You were? Said Patricia to you. I don't see it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia looked at you, and unlike Kim, who was under the delusion that you were in fact muscular, Patricia saw your usual average body. Then she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that doesn't matter. Horror movie time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both sat on the couch, and put on the movie. You were sitting right between them, and soon enough when the movie started... They moved closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh my god, why am I so scared?<br>\r\n- I know, nothing happened yet!<br>\r\n- Thank god we have Simon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia grabbed your right hand, and Kim your left arm. Their eyes were glued on the screen though. Throughout the movie, they squeezed your hand and arm, screamed, Kim even hugged you... You let your hand fall on Kim's lap, she didn't say anything. Patricia even fell on you one time and you could feel her large breasts on your head. She said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woops, sorry! Well... Enjoyed the touch though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts her arched her torso, flaunting her breasts, her tits almost bulging out between the buttons of her shirt... Your hand shaking, you gently caressed them, then gave one a squeeze... She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahah, you lucky boy. Thank god you're not one of those pervs... You... AAAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another jumpscare, Patricia jumped right on your lap, and you could feel Kim's tight embrace too. Then after a while, the movie was over. They were sweaty from all the scares... You didn't really pay attention to the movie though. Then they talked about the movie:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Phew! That was a good one! Not really realistic though... Said Kim.<br>\r\n- You think? I think it's more realistic than you think.<br>\r\n- Really? The killer used hypnosis to transform people, that makes no sense!<br>\r\n- Well, I'm currently studying psychosomatic pain in psychology, and it's incredible what your body can believe! Strong beliefs can cure you, makes you think you're pregnant, make you immune to pain... So yeah, if you're delusional or anything, your body will adapt all it can to your delusions!<br>\r\n- I'm not sure if I believe that... Oh, we were so focused on the movie, we didn't drink anything! Said Kim.<br>\r\n- Oh yeah, I put some beers in your fridge.<br>\r\n- Really? But I bought some too! Now we have too much...<br>\r\n- Well, that's not really a problem, now is it? Hey, Simon, what about you brought some beers please? And thanks for being here, you really helped us getting through that movie!<br>\r\n- Yeah, you really did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't say anything, just smiled, blushing. But you listened to their conversation, especially about the body adapting to a delusion... You wanted to test that before taking any risk. So while in the kitchen, you took out the book, and wrote on Kim's page:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim starts to feel cold, but only on her nipples.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou partially opened the door to have a look and... Yes, her nipples were poking through her pajama top! And Patricia noticed it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Kim, two questions, why is there a bra on the couch, and hum... Don't you feel a bit cold?<br>\r\n- Huh?! I mean, it's my pajama, of course I don't wear a bra with it. And I don't feel cold, that's odd though, only on my titties...<br>\r\n- Well that's your problem, but Simon's gonna gaze for sure. But why your bra is on the couch anyway?<br>\r\n- I hum... Must have misplaced it.<br>\r\n- You're not telling me something... Come on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two started to argue, but Kim clearly didn't want to say how the bra got there, she must felt ashamed for her desire to become a stripper... Anyway, what to write on the book?</span></div></div>",

You decided there was fun to be had with that. You wrote on Kim and Patricia's page:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't know why, but from now, Patricia is really easily drunk, one beer gets her drunk. On the other hand, Kim needs to drink lots of alcohol just to feel any effect. One gallon of beer is just enough to make her feel drunk. They both won't feel any urge to vomit due to the the alcohol, and Kim's confident she can fit as much beer as she wants in her belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey Simon, are those beers coming or not?<br>\r\n- Coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurried, hid the book in your trousers, and grabbed three bottled beers. You gave it to them, and Patricia casually said, while opening her beer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Do you know anything about Kim's bra on the couch?<br>\r\n- What? Oh I didn't even notice. She's really disorganized you know.<br>\r\n- Alright, I'm leaving it be then, sorry Kim. But still...<br>\r\n- Oh come on, Trish!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia had one mouthful of the beer and you could see her face getting tensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Damn! Isn't that beer a bit too strong?<br>\r\n- Are you kidding? Said Kim. I've already finished it! It's so lite it's almost water!<br>\r\n- What?! You gulped that down in no time! You're crazy girl!<br>\r\n- No, you're crazy, come on Simon, how's the beer? I'll need to drink more if I want to get even a bit drunk!<br>\r\n- It's... Pretty normal to me. But you can have mine if you want.<br>\r\n- Alright, let's do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim grabbed your bottle, and gulped down the beer in one go. You could even see her muscular belly starting to loosen up. Patricia only drank one quarter of her bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Burp! Gah, need more beer, that shit is too light!<br>\r\n- Seriously Kim...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim hurried to the kitchen and brought two whole packs of beers and started opening them and gulping them down one by one. Patricia had her eyes wide opened, and was too focused on the show Kim was giving them. She drank one bottle, then two... Three... Four... Then you lost count, but she finished the whole pack! You saw her belly getting bigger and bigger, pressing against her tight shorts, her navel moving forward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEEEEEEEEEEELCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim let out a loud burping sound, ejecting all the gas from her belly. Patricia, halfway done with her first bottle, asked Kim:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Are you alright? I never saw you drinking this much...<br>\r\n- Well I don't know, but I still barely feel anything. But I wanna get drunk! Since you all don't seems to be drinking anyway, I'll finish those.<br>\r\n- But... Kim, you already have like twelve, look at your stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kim didn't listen, threw her emptied bottle that clinked against the pile of the others and stood up. Her protruding belly sticking out of her tank top and opened shorts that she couldn't even close anymore... Her belly... Was so big... It looked like she was fully pregnant! She looked down in amazement, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Daaaamn... Burp. I can't believe I drank all of this. I... Woops, feel dizzy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled, lost balance, and fell on the couch, her huge distorted belly shaking and sloshing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia just had finished her first beer, and was already as drunk as Kim. She said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Yeeeah, damn girl you crazy! I only had one, hip, beer and god is it STRONG!<br>\r\n- You're the crazy girl, bitch!<br>\r\n- Or maybe we're both...<br>\r\n- Yeah, thanks Simon for being sober for us, burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at you, smiling, not even considering for one second that their current state was because of you. Seeing how drunk they were, getting advantage of them would be easy...</span></div></div>",

You still tried to play it cool though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You... You girls need anything to eat?<br>\r\n- Well, that MAY surprise you, but I'm not hungry right now. Said Kim fondling her huge full belly.<br>\r\n- And I'm way too drunk to do anything, I'll just lay there for a while I think... But damn, is your belly big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia added her hand to fondle Kim's massive tummy, and you sat between them, joining them in fondling the huge sloshing and gurgling belly of Kim...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- God... It feels good when you guys touch it... Especially you Simon.<br>\r\n- Rea... Really?<br>\r\n- Yeah, you're such a nice roommate... We went through that movie together thanks to you... And I know you're kinda into me, and I guess I'm not kind enough to you... And really handsome too... Maybe it's because I'm drunk, but I can think of one or two things to repay you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Kim kissed you. It's a moment you dreamed for a while, but never expected to arrive so suddenly, and under those circumstances! She then grabbed your shoulders gave a big wet french kiss while Patricia watched in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You guys... Are for real?<br>\r\n- Come on Trish, join the fun, give a big thanks to Simon!<br>\r\n- Drunken kiss, here we go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, even more unexpectedly, Patricia grabbed you and kissed you too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Smooch! To our Simon!<br>\r\n- Yeah! To our big... Horny Simon, would you look at that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim pointed to your crotch, which didn't hide at all your throbbing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Either you have a banana in there, or you're very happy to see us! Either way, I'm checking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Kim opened up your trousers and got your dick out. You didn't even try to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Wooh, you do have a banana! Let me taste it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd again, unexpectedly, you got a blow job from Kim. She licked your tip with her athletic tongue, and began to suck it. But then, Patricia pushed her and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Kim, are you serious! You... You gotta leave me have some too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's how you got a threesome with your drunk roommate and her even drunker best friend. You had sex for two hours, switching between girls, and even managed to came in both of them! Kim ended up finishing her strip tease, showing her beautiful perky tits, and she let you fondle her big erected nipples. Then she came on top of you, shaking and sloshing her belly at every trust. Patricia wasn't bad either, she loved getting her big tits sucked, and gave you the best blowjob. The two girl even kissed each other at one moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing inside Patricia, you collapsed on the couch. The last thing you remembered is Patricia and Kim putting back their pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up the morning after, thanks to a ray of light that got right into your eyes. You looked around, tired, hearing a snoring noise. You realized Patricia was hugging you all night and was softly snoring inches from your face. A bit of drool was leaking out of her mouth. She looked... Kind of cute actually. You moved her arms around to free yourself, and she didn't seem to wake up. You also realized you were still naked, and so you got yourself dressed, with your clothes laying around. That's when you heard Patricia mumbling... She was talking in her sleep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Mmmh... Aaah... I love you Simon.. You're so cute... Yeah... You're right, Kim's such a bitch anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it, she was fantasizing about you! And just when that information was sinking in,  you heard Kim entering the living room. She was just wearing her usual tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, it won't go down as fast as I'd like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was holding her belly, who was now smaller than last night, but still clearly protruding out of her top. It made her look a bit chubby, and you loved it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- God I can't keep drinking like that, or I'll turn fat, and I won't be able to be a stripper! Damn it, I need to workout before going to class. I don't have any this morning, I guess that's all I'm gonna do.<br>\r\nShe removed her top, revealing her sports bra. Her nipples were still erected! She then started stretching. You always loved watching her working out, her body getting all tensed, her butt clenched, her skin getting sweaty...<br>\r\n- By the way, she continued speaking while stretching, what happened last night? I remember watching the movie, drinking waaaaaay too much beer, and then I guess I blacked out. We all slept on the couch?<br>\r\n- Hmmm, yeah, you girls pretty much collapsed after that, and I stayed here to watch over you.<br>\r\nYou heard yawning behind you. Patricia had woken up!<br>\r\n- Wowh, Simon, you're really such a nice guy. I'm glad we let you be part of girls night! We should do it again some times, with less alcohol though. I still can't believe I got hammered with one beer... And I don't remember anything after either... My body feels so weak though, and I got this weird taste in my mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to lie yourself out of this situation, and they both seemed to really have forget the threesome. But maybe it was for the best... For them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia got dressed again and left your flat. She kept giving you glances but never said anything. Just before you said goodbye and closed the door, she did a hand sign that meant \"Call me!\". She was shy, but clearly interested in you. It was so cute! But then, you felt a hand on your shoulder. It was Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey Simon... I was thinking... You're a coolest guy than I ever thought, and maybe...You wanna go out sometimes? Maybe tonight, after I finish my shift?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh man, two girls at the same time! What a pickle! What a dream situation! What to do?</span></div></div>",

She let a moan that, though fake for the show, had hint of truth to it. Her face as red as yours, Kim winked at you and blew you a kiss and then sort of just awkwarded stepped back, the song ending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know how to finish,\u201d she said sheepishly, crossing her arms under her still bare breasts. \u201cWhat\u2019d you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-uh, I...w-wow,\u201d you word vomited. \u201cI-it, it was good, no, great! I liked it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Simon! You\u2019re so sweet,\u201d she leaned over, her breasts dangling in the air, and kissed your cheek. You felt like you were gonna short circuit. Kim put her shirt back on, much to your disappointment, and pulled her short back up and moved the to the kitchen to prepare a snack. You noticed that, interestingly enough, you were still holding her bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d you muttered under your breath, still amazed by the book\u2019s capability. As your hormones settled down, you realized you felt two things: guilty and jealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilty because of what you\u2019d done to Kim. On one hand, you knew she would\u2019ve never chosen to do that and that felt bad. On the other hand, you knew that she didn\u2019t know that would\u2019ve never chosen to do that and that from her viewpoint it had all been her choice. Did that make it ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJealous because before you had simply had a crush on her. Now after that show, and it could be the hormones talking, you felt like you were in love! And regardless of the truth, you didn\u2019t like the idea of Kim putting on the same show for other guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thought you had a new plan. You\u2019d erase that delusion from the book - thus testing if it was reversible after all - and you\u2019d write in for her to strip only for you. What could go wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly erased the writing and looked to Kim for a reaction...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You said, showing the bra you kept in your hands.<br>\r\n- Oh my god... I can't believe it I did that... It's so stupid, I thought I wanted to be a stripper but... It doesn't make any sense, I don't wanna do that! And I certainly didn't mean to... Oh my god, why did I do that? I feel like... I wanted to but... Am I crazy?<br>\r\n- Ahah no Kim, you're not.

You made her striptease, then erased the reason why she stripteased, leaving her really confused. You thought to be careful with this book not to turn anyone crazy, or suspicious about a force controlling them... You thought about erasing her memories, but that could be worst. If she realized she has gaps in her memories, she's gonna think she has a serious disease! So you thought of the nicest way of making Kim less confused without turning her into a stripper...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim is comfortable with the idea of showing her body to me. She feels she has a close relationship to me, so she's not ashamed or afraid by nudity, and really trusts me. And she was joking earlier about becoming a stripper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you go! It wasn't like forcing her to fall in love or anything. Having a trusting relationship with someone can only be a good thing, right? When you finished writing that, you quickly hid again the book, as Kim was coming back from her bedroom, with her usual clothes. She looked at you, smiling, and burst into laughter. You laughed along. She then said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh my god, I really did it didn't I? I really got you!<br>\r\n- Well yeah, that was pretty convincing, you went all the way!<br>\r\n- Geez, Simon, that was a joke! It's not because I show myself naked that it means anything!<br>\r\n- Oh really?<br>\r\n- Come on... I feel like... Yeah, you're one of the most trustworthy person I know. I know I can make that kind of joke to you, right? After all, we're roommates, I shouldn't be afraid to be naked in front of you. It's my home as well as yours!<br>\r\n- Yeah, damn right!<br>\r\n- Give me five!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slapped the hand Kim held up, she giggled, and you smiled. You were glad the tension went away, and of course that you still got to see her naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- By the way, leave the couch! I did the dishes, and it's your turn to make dinner tonight!<br>\r\n- Oh, okay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you stood up, and Kim started watching TV. Hmph. You're way too lazy to make dinner, and it's so easy just to use the book... So while Kim wasn't watching, you wrote on her page:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually Kim's turn to do dinner tonight, and also she promised to make breakfast tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put back the book and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hum, actually Kim, I think it's your turn...<br>\r\n- Huh? Oh yeah, what was I thinking? I even promised you to make breakfast tomorrow morning! Thanks for reminding me, I'm such a klutz sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned off the TV and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I'm making dinner, might as well get comfortable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, she removed her top again, and laying before your eyes was the beautiful sight of her breasts in her nice underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey Simon, eyes up here! You should get use to it, I prefer to cook like that.<br>\r\n- O... Okay then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her while she went to the kitchen, her breasts bouncing in her bra... Damn, you never thought that would happen! She was really comfortable about her nudity around you. You felt so lucky! Even though luck had nothing to do with it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard her swearing from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- What's wrong?<br>\r\n- Nothing, I wanted to do pancakes for tomorrow, but we're out of milk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came back holding up an empty bottle of milk. Somehow, the sight of this bottle of milk next to her almost uncovered chest gave you an idea...</span></div></div>",

Just make whatever you can.<br>\r\nYou mumbled, trying to look at her face instead of her tits, but with still the idea in your head.<br>\r\n- Yeah, I guess you're right. So for now, dinner. Let's have pastas!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim went back to the kitchen and you wondered... Could it work? If it fools her body too... Then maybe it can make her actually produce milk, and not just the illusion of milk. That was worth a try. After all, it wouldn't hurt her, it's just milk! Plus, it would be really nice... You couldn't help it, you wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim doesn't know this, but she now has a rare condition that makes her produce lots of breast milk every day, even if she's not pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. But now, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hid back the delusion book, and went to dinner. You took a quick glance to Kim's bust, which was easy to do, but no difference. It didn't change at all, even after the dinner. You thought it made sense, since breast milk doesn't produce itself so quickly but still... You were disappointed. Maybe it just didn't work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow was Sunday, maybe you could just wait until then. And so you did. Dinner went as usual, well, with the plus side of having Kim in her underwear. You chatted, laughed, and realized that yeah, you felt pretty close now. But you didn't want to make a move just yet, after all, you were still testing things with that book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, and in the morning, you were woken up by a sudden scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Kim! You hurried out of bed, and went to the living room, where you had a sight you didn't expect to have. Kim was there, holding her breasts up, still in her underwear. But with a big... Difference... There were almost bulging out of their bra!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Do you see that?! When I put my bra I just realized my tits they're... So much bigger now! I mean look at this!<br>\r\n- I... I am...<br>\r\n- That's not normal, can it?<br>\r\n- W... Well, maybe you...<br>\r\n- Wait a minute... I feel like... Listen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook one breast, then the other, and you could hear a faint but audible sloshing inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I can't believe it... I must be...\" She muttered, shaking.<br>\r\nWith hesitation, she pinched one her nipples behind her bra, pressed it and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilk spurted out! It fell right on the floor! There was no mistake, drops of milk were staining her bra. It worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh my god, I can't believe it, I'm lactating! What the fuck?!<br>\r\n- Holy shit Kim, that's amazing!<br>\r\n- What? No! It's... Not normal! Does that mean I'm pregnant or something?!<br>\r\n- N... Not necessarily... Some women have a condition that makes them lactating for no reason. It just happens...<br>\r\n- If you say it, I trust you on that one... But still, it's so weird... And my breasts are so big now ! I must have gained one or two sizes... So maybe a D, or even a E... Damn, they feel heavier too!<br>\r\n- Well, on the plus side, you now have the milk for the pancakes.<br>\r\nKim looked at you with a death glare.<br>\r\n- Are you serious right now?!<br>\r\n- W... Well, you can't keep all this milk eternally anyway, so might as well use it, no?<br>\r\n- Shit... Yeah, you're right, I have to milk myself or I'll wet my underwear then my clothes... And I don\"t want my breasts to sag too. But pancakes really? I... Well fuck, you know what, I'm gonna try! I'm just... Gonna milk myself in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hurried to the kitchen, her tits sloshing at every bounce. You couldn't believe how hot she was now with her engorged tits. You wondered  how much milk she's gonna produce... You slightly opened the door of the kitchen, and saw Kim milking herself on top of a big bowl. Holy shit, what a sight! Her huge mammary pumping out up and down, her nipples spraying so much milk... She noticed you, turned around and yelled: \"Don't look at me, it's embarrassing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed the door, your heart pumping, and still aroused by that new sight. And sure enough, later, Kim was cooking pancakes! They looked... Well, actually normal. You looked at Kim, she put back her bra, and seemed to have pumped out all of her milk, since her breasts were almost their usual size. It's a shame but... She could still produce more milk later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo then, it was the moment of truth. You both were at the dinner table. You eagerly took a bite of one pancake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- ... Holy shit, they're actually good!<br>\r\n- Really?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim took a bite of another and seemed to like it too! You then continued to eat the delicious pancake made with Kim's milk. Just the thought of eating something that came from her body made you feel really aroused... She then ate the pancakes with a look of shame. She looked down at her tits, saying...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- God... I'm a milking cow... I can't believe it...<br>\r\n- Don't be sad about it Kim! It's great! It's almost like a super power you have. And now we don't have to be worried about being out of milk anymore!<br>\r\n- Oh, shut up!<br>\r\nShe said that with a big smile. This situation was indeed weird for her, but you seemed to made her accept it quite usually. It helped that you had this bond of trust after all... But still, now that you know the book of delusion can actually alter a body in some way, should you remove the sentence about Kim lactating or continue even further!</span></div></div>",

Sure you could mess with someone's head, but you could fix it in a instant too. So with a bit of caution, you thought you could toy with her more in inconsequential ways. While she was away putting her bra on, you wrote on the Delusions Book:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim never questions, care or even look what I write in this book, she's sure it's a normal book, and doesn't even notice when I write something in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on time, Kim went back in the living room, this time with her bra. Still flustered, she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- So... We agree we... Never talk about what happened earlier, alright?<br>\r\n- Yeah alright sure.<br>\r\n- My god, it's so awkward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just stood here, mumbling some words, you started to write something on her page... And sure enough, she didn't seem to see it at all. So you wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim thinks she's crazy, and that the only cure is to suck my dick until I come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd immediately after, she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I still can't believe it. That must means I'm turning crazy... And in that case, there's only one solution. But... But no I can't... I'm not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned red again, and was unable to look you directly in the eyes. Her breath was shaky, and she was making quick glances at your crotch, where your erected dick was bulging your pants. She was so embarrassed... Her knees were trembling. You gently said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey Kim, if you need anything from me, just say it.<br>\r\n- I... It's... I know I'm crazy, and I know the cure but... I can't, it's just...<br>\r\n- Hey, if there's a cure, why not do whatever it is?<br>\r\n- You're right but... I don't want to think I'm a slut okay? I'm not a slut! It's just that... If I'm crazy, then there's only one way to fix me and... I'm just afraid you...<br>\r\n- I'll never think less of you Kim, you're doing whatever you can for your mental health, and that's alright.<br>\r\n- Okay but... It's just between you and me alright, you'll never speak of it to anyone? And remember I'm only doing it for me, and for not you, okay?<br>\r\n- Alright, alright. What is it you need?<br>\r\nKim took a deep breath.<br>\r\n- I need... I... I need... I need to suck your penis... It's the only way...<br>\r\n- Hey, that's not much, don't be so embarrassed! Alright, let's do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your pants, and let out your hardened schlong in the air. Kim looked at it with some kind of wonder in her eyes, she gulped, was starting to sweat... And then put herself on her knees, moved her head closer and closer, opened her mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if I'm not good at it, I've never done this before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... And gently licked the tip of your penis. You shivered, feeling your roommate's tongue on your most private part. When she got everything wet, she finally inserted it in her mouth, and sucked. She moved back and forth, pumping and pumping you... That woman you lived with for a while, fantasized on for a while... Was giving you a blowjob, thinking it was for her own sanity! It's was just too good! She really wanted you to come, she kept sucking and sucking... Feeling the amazing power you had over her, you felt your blood rushing... While your mind was about to go blank, you grabbed the book and the eraser... And just as you were about to come, you erased the last sentence you wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim then suddenly moved backward, your dick popping out of her mouth. And she yelled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when you came right on her face. Jizz spraying all over eyes, nose, opened mouth... Dripping everywhere! You let out a huge satisfied sigh, as Kim was just realizing what just happened. She muttered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm so sorry... I'm so fucked up I thought... I thought the cure for me was to... Was to... Why did I ever think that? I'm not a slut, I don't... My god it's all over my face... Oh god Simon, tell me I'm not insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to catch your breath, and smiling, you said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You're not insane Kim... You're having a dream.<br>\r\n- Wh... What?<br>\r\n- Think about it, it can't be anything else.<br>\r\n- But... It all feels real to me... And I can pinch my cheeks and all, I'm not waking up!<br>\r\n- Strong powerful lucid dreams happens Kim. I should know, I'm part of your imagination. Just you wait, I'll show you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kim was looking at you confused, and wiping the cum out of her face, feeling how real it was, you grabbed the book, and wrote a new page. This time you wrote \"Kim and Simon\" in the text box. Then on the page, you wrote...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dick will suddenly grow to be a foot long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSharing the delusions with Kim would be almost like changing reality, because for both of you, it would be real. And sure enough, when you wrote that, you felt your dick, still rising in the air... Stretching, moving upward, growing and growing, getting more imposing than ever... More than double its original size. It felt... So real! You could touch it, feel it... If you didn't know you wrote it on your delusions book, you would have been certain it just grew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Simon... Your penis.. It... Wowh...<br>\r\n- You see, it's a dream! Anything can happen. It's not real...<br>\r\n- But... I never had such a real-like dream before...<br>\r\n- Well, better take advantage of it before you wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAroused like hell, you quickly wrote on the same page:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim's breasts suddenly doubles in size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you watched Kim's top, as her bra started pushing onward. She looked down, and muttered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way... My tits...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer perky C-cup boobs were increasing in size, filling up her bra, bulging it out, digging into her skin so hard she quickly removed it, and let her growing tits under her top... Top that was now getting stretched and stretched, pushing her swollen breasts together, giving it an even better rounder shape. Her big nipples were bulging the fabric too... And then they stopped, reaching an impressive size on her torso. Man was she so hot now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I can't believe it... They're so big... She said, fondling and squishing them with her shaky hands.<br>\r\n- Living the dream, babe!<br>\r\n- But if it's my dream... Why am I not able to control anything... I didn't want any of this...<br>\r\n- It's your inner fantasies Kim, all the things you never knew you wanted.<br>\r\n- ... I... I have to admit, those big tits feels nice... It's weird... They don't feel heavy at all...<br>\r\n- ... Well of course, it's only a dream after all. Now the question is, what do you want to do with those breasts?<br>\r\n- Well, I have a few ideas big boy... Man you really have a nice body now... But it depends on you too, since you already came on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. Kim finally accepted that this wasn't a normal situation, and that she should relax because it was all a dream. It wasn't exactly one, but that didn't matter. She put herself back on her knees, and with a kinky smile, moved closer to your enlarged dong... Then she removed her top, and put your dick right between her tits. What followed was the best titjob you could ever ask. You could feel her humongous chest squishing and pumping your dick like crazy... And it didn't matter you already came a few minutes earlier, you felt the blood leaving your head, the pressure rising... And then she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk... Let's not waste that yet... It's my dream, and I want to test your... Prodigious penis\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, and you watched, breathless, as she removed her shorts, her panties...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd stuffed herself with your foot-long. Amazingly, it fit right inside her without any issue... Of course, because it wasn't really bigger. But you could see it bulging her belly... Penetrating her so deeply!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I can't believe it fit... It's... Amazing... I just... Can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then started shaking her body like crazy, each of her round big tit bouncing against each other, thrusting and pulling your own manliness, tightly enclosed in that tight body of hers. Finally, you were fucking her... Or rather, she was fucking you. She got more and more into it, gave you a big wet kiss, then closed her eyes, leaned her head backwards, and moved her sweaty fit body like crazy. She wouldn't stop. You came, and yet, she didn't stop until she reached her orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GaaAAAAAH... GHAAAAAAAA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer scream echoed in the room, then she fell on the floor, leaving a trail of your cum on the couch and floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's a dream... Then... It's a fucking amazing one...\" She said, laying on the floor, between two breaths. She looked like she was ready for more... But you clearly weren't. She pumped you dry. You quickly grabbed the book of delusions and wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim is super sleepy and will quickly fall asleep. When she'll wake up, she'll be sure that everything that happened this night from the moment she stripped, was in fact a dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you finished writing this, she tried to move her upper body, saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright big boy...

So carefully, you grabbed her and carried her over to her bed, and tucked her in like a sleeping baby. You also carefully cleaned up the living room of all traces of what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContemplating your still seemingly enlarged dick, you never thought you could do so much stuff with that book...</span></div></div>",

You saw your dick going back to its usual real size. And if your plan went correctly, Kim would never know a thing ever happened. All in her head! You prepared some toast for breakfast, and soon enough, Kim arrived already in her daily clothes, with her normal not-so-small tits, and she was yawning. She just sat on a chair, and grabbed a toast. Like an usual morning. The plan worked! Or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey Simon, asked the still sleepy Kim, what happened last night?<br>\r\n- Wh... What do you mean?<br>\r\n- I mean... I don't even remember going to sleep. I arrived here after work, saw you... Then nothing.<br>\r\n- Well... Hum... That's weird. We just had dinner, and you went to sleep. You seemed pretty tired.<br>\r\n- Really? I don't remember it at all... I must have been real tired, I didn't even put on my pajamas this night... And I had this... Dream... It felt so real...<br>\r\n- Oh yeah? What was that about.<br>\r\nShe took a quick glance at you and said, a bit flustered:<br>\r\n- I... Probably shouldn't tell you. It was a weird dream though.<br>\r\n- So a nightmare?<br>\r\n- Mmmh, I wouldn't say that. It felt really nice... Incredibly nice even... But really weird.<br>\r\n- Well, weirdness is relative anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then just sat there and had breakfast with her, like usual. The delusions book was not far, you looked at it, wondering what mischief you would do today, you took a sip of coffee, when Kim asked out of the blue:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey, do you think my breasts are big enough?<br>\r\nYou spit your coffee, shocked by her question. She was squeezing her tits together with her hands.<br>\r\n- Wh... Why do you ask that?<br>\r\n- I was just wondering... I wanted a guy point of view of how big is too big.<br>\r\n- Your... Tits are just fine Kim.<br>\r\n- But bigger would be better, right?<br>\r\n- I... Guess?<br>\r\n- Hmm... Surgery seems like a bitch anyway... But I could flaunt them a bit more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in her thoughts, Kim went back to her bedroom. You were baffled. You never had that kind of conversation with her, ever. The only explanation was... Since she dreamed of fucking you with big titties... It really became part of her fantasies, and she really feels more comfortable with her body now. Well... That can't be that bad then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came back, this time with a small and really revealing top. Out of the cleavage, her breasts were really sticking out, tightly held together...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I grabbed a old smaller bra. They look bigger when they're tight, no?<br>\r\n- Y... Yeah they do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey really did. Kim looked really hot like that although... A bit slutty, but... Yeah you definitely didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have to go, bye Simon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left, but not before giving you a gentle kiss on your cheeks. It was your turn to be red now. She did that so quickly, she realized what she did only when she reached the door frame, where she stopped, and turned to you, giggled, waved at you, and finally left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no question, you were definitely in love... And with the \"dreams\" you made her had, she probably was too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, what to do next with the book? Should you go to school, or do something else?</span></div></div>",

You realized you were late, finished your breakfast quickly, and went to your campus in a hurry, not forgetting to brink the book of delusions into your bag. You had electronic lesson this morning, and as you arrived up the stairs to your class, you thought about the girls you could bring into delusions. And considering you were doing an engineering major, there wasn't really many. There was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, weirdo, you're late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Melinda, who just spoke with that irritating sarcastic voice of her. She was still picking on you, because one time she heard you talking to a friend about how you prefer larger girls, and decided you were the weirdo of the class. Melinda wasn't exactly a bad looking girl, she had a nice silhouette, though not very ample tits, she had a curvy derriere that flattered her short (around 5 feet 3) body. She was black, with curvy black hair and a pair of glasses that made her look smarter than she probably was. As soon as she 'welcomed' you, she turned to her friends, giggling. There was Julianne, a tall (around 5 ft 11) red-haired girl with pale skin, who was more often silent than not, and Jilly a 5 feet 5 curvy but chubby girl that was rather cute, if she wasn't part of Melinda's clique. When she's not around her, she acts usually really shy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was two other girls in his class, but you barely knew them. There was Sung, the reserved Korean girl, and Luz, the Latina chick, who was probably the only really hot girl of the class with her thin and really curvy body. But she was kind of a lone girl, and rejected all the boys that threw just a hint of interest in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass what about to start, and Melinda and her posse was still pissing you off with they way they looked at you...</span></div></div>",

Instead you grabbed the book and quickly wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda, Julianne, and Jilly do not care about this book don\u2019t even notice when I\u2019m writing in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you writ-\u201d Melinda started but was cut off when the delusion set it. She shook her head. \u201cNevermind. What have you been up to weirdo? Why are you so late?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow odd. True, Melinda always pried a bit into your life looking for fuel to harass you but now, after witnessing how easily Kim had been influenced by her \u201cdreams\u201d you were curious: what there more to her question? You had the perfect way to find out too and quickly wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda, Julianne, and Jilly are always completely honest with me and don\u2019t lie to me. They don\u2019t think this is weird or different at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you care, Melinda?\u201d you taunted her, a little more snarky than you usually are. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did you freak,\u201d she snapped, starting to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe totally has a crush on you,\u201d Jilly laughed at her side. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t blame her, right Julianne?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not bad,\u201d she mumbled. She looked a little flustered herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d was all you could manage. You were floored. Not only was Melinda acting like a schoolyard bully and only harassing you because she liked but both her flunkies were into you a bit as well. How many girls already liked you that you didn\u2019t even realize? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, you were on a roll: you\u2019d messed with Lisa a bit and you\u2019d messed with Kim a lot so having a crush on you wasn\u2019t gonna protect Melinda. If anything it was just more fuel for your ideas. You smiled and began to write:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day, anytimes she hears her own name Melinda will orgasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018wow\u2019, weirdo?\u201d Melinda glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry,\u201d you chuckled. \u201cI just really appreciate your honesty, Melinda\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly her knees buckled and she moaned and you smiled in amazement. There was no denying what just happened and both of her friends and few other students that had heard stared at her in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelinda, are you ok?\u201d Julianne asked, seemingly concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, is everything, like, alright, Melinda?\u201d Jilly asked, putting a gentle hand on the girl\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwice in quick succession pleasure surge through Melinda\u2019s body. She gasped once and covered her mouth with both hands to silence the second moan the best she could, bending at the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, I\u2019m f-fine,\u201d she stuttered, backing away. \u201cI-I\u2019m just g-gonna go sit d-down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left her friends looking very confused and went to her seat near the front of the class. The other students were starting to whisper but quickly fell silent when the professor stepped. Everyone else found their seats and he started the lecture. </span></div></div>",

She was visibly confused, even panicked, by what was going on. You could hear her friends whispering to her: \"If you're not okay, say to the professor you need to go to the infirmary...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you thought that was too easy of a way out. So while Melinda was pondering whether to go or not, you wrote on her page:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melinda doesn't want to go to the infirmary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright you guys, I'm okay, I'm... Sure it's nothing...\" You heard her whispering answer. Great, now you have more opportunity to mess with her! But first, you still needed to listen to the lesson. You carefully hid the delusions book under your actual notebook to make it look like you were just writing notes. And just, when you didn't expect it, you had an opportunity. The professor came and asked;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey Melinda, can you go to the board to wr...<br>\r\n- NGHH.... GHA!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda's body jerked backward, she sprayed her legs, letting out of her mouth this kind of muffled sound of orgasm. Everyone was looking at her, many snickering, many wondering if she did just have an orgasm out of the blue. Surprised, the professor said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hum... Do you want to go to the infirmary Mel...<br>\r\n- AHEM! I... To be honest I prefer to be called just Mel, if that's alright. I... Really don't like that name. If that's okay.<br>\r\n- That's alright... Mel. I was gonna ask, since you work on that circuit, can you please draw the electronic diagram on the whiteboard?<br>\r\n- Sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn! She managed to found an escape out of her situation. She quickly understood that whatever the problem was, it was with her name. You could fix that one way or another... But there was more fun to be had. You watched as she walked to the whiteboard and began to draw the schematics. And damn, that ass was fine! Thinking quickly, you wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melinda is gonna shake that ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd immediately, still writing on the board, she shook her cheeky butt of hers, tightly wrapped in her jeans. Her flesh moving in every direction, what a sight to behold! Students laughed, one even whistled, she turned around, half confused, half laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Ahah... Sorry I... Don't know why I did that.<br>\r\n- Can you please focus on the board instead of trying to make a fool of yourself? Said the professor really seriously.<br>\r\n- R... Right. S... Sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer embarrassed face was really cute. She was a really cute girl, when she wasn't bullying you. Maybe she just needed that, to be nicer. You wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After finishing the diagram, Melinda will write a little love message to me on the board.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, when she finally finished the circuit diagram, she wrote next to it : \"I <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Simon\". When she realized what she wrote, she turned around in shock and confusion, and immediately erased it. But it was too late, everyone had seen it, some laughed, one asked: \"So that's why you were shaking your butt uh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor called for everyone to calm down. Melinda was just staying there, flustered and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Well Mel, if you're done with your stupidities, you can come back to your seat.<br>\r\n- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... I just...<br>\r\n- That's enough Melinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor forgot to call her Mel, and taken by surprise, Melinda fell on her knees, letting out a loud whimper, eyes closed, jaw dropping on the floor. This time the class burst into laughter. It was really obvious to everyone what happened. The professor, realizing his mistake said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I mean, hum, Mel... Hum... Are you sure you're alright? I think it would be best for you to go to the infirmary.<br>\r\n- NO I'M OKAY! I DON'T NEED TO GO!<br>\r\n- Okay, okay, but please calm down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears to her eyes, she came back to her seat, and buried her face in her arms. Damn, that was some serious humiliation!</span></div></div>",

Grinning mischievously, you turned your attention back to the book:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Melinda is an exhibitionist; that fact that she is for some unknown reason behaving oddly and embarrassing herself is only turning her. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to the front of the class to spy on Melinda. She sat quietly looking down at her desk. Her legs were crossed and her hands were in her lap. At first you thought she was rocking ever so slightly but you realized, with a grin, that she was actually squirming in her seat, obviously trying to ease her arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing you should at least try and pay attention to class, you set the book aside and tried to focus. It was, however, a futile effort; you couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the book. In your mind you saw Melinda swaying that round, perfect ass for you and you heard her moaning at the sound of her own name. You remembered how forward Kim had been this morning and the fantastic show of her bursting out of her shirt last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving in you grabbed the book and, feeling, inspired began writing a much longer and more detailed delusion. You closed the book when you finished and stuffed it in your bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw shoot, look at the time,\u201d your professor said, looking at his watch. \u201cLet\u2019s call it a day here, class. I have to take care of something. Have a nice day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and packed the rest of your stuff up. The first part of the delusion you had written had kicked in:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The professor thinks he needs to be home early and cuts the class short. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on autopilot you gathered your things and exited the classing room but you did not leave the building. Instead, you made your way up to the third and to an empty classroom. You knew from past experience that this room was always empty this time of day. Sometimes you came up her to take a nap when you were tired but didn\u2019t want to go all the way back to your apartment just to come back for classes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you weren\u2019t here to nap today. You drop your bag on the floor and sit on a desk to wait. Not long after, the door opens and Melinda quietly steps in the room and closes the door behind her. Her face is flush and she quickly made her way over to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be eager today, huh Melinda?\u201d you teased her. She paused in her tracks, moaning loudly with another orgasm, before slowly continuing. \u201cYou were really putting on quite the show. I really liked the-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut you off by grabbing your face with her hands and pulling you into a deep kiss, her warm soft lips feeling like heaven right now. She pressed her body into you, her modest breasts smooshing against your torso, and moaned again. The second part of the delusion was happening:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Melinda and I are in a secret sexual relationship. After every one of our electronic lessons, Melinda and I meet up in the empty classroom on the third floor and passionately fuck. Julianne and Jilly always stand watch by the door but they are completely oblivious to what we are doing. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust s-shut up and fuck me you weirdo,\u201d Melinda demanded aggressively once she pulled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slipped a hand up her torso and under her shirt, tenderly caressing the smooth skin of her flat tummy before cupping one of her modest breasts. Melinda was breathing harder, her eyes closed and mouth open in a silent \u201co\u201d. She tilted her head back, looking towards the ceiling and exposing her neck and you leaned in to kiss, savoring the warmth of skin and the scent of her perfume. Meanwhile, your other hand ran along the curvy of her wide hips and behind her to cup a handful of delectable booty meat, forcing another moan out of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re being really demanding aren\u2019t you, Melinda?\u201d you whispered playfully into her ear as she orgasmed once more. \u201cYou remember the magic words don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d she panted. \u201cPlease bend me over the desk and fuck me Simon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh so close,\u201d you say tauntingly. You pull her shirt over her head and toss it aside. You paused for a moment, staring in awe at her perky breasts cupped just so right in a bright pink bra that contrasted adorably with her dark skin. It dawned on you just how weird this scenario was; you knew you were under the effects of the delusion so you knew that you had never made out with or touched Melinda, let alone fucked her. On the other hand, due to the power of the delusion, every memory you had told you this was real and that you did this almost every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon, don\u2019t make me say it like that,\u201d Melinda pouted. With one had she expertly reached behind herself and unhooked her bra, finally letting you see her bare breasts: they weren\u2019t bigger than Kim\u2019s but, to your surprise, they were much nicer! Her other hand gently stroked your dick through your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta use the magic words, honey,\u201d you grinned. You began to undo your belt, knowing she would give in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. She looked at you, making eye contact, and said softly, her words dripping with a lust and need you never dreamed of her in her in voice, \u201cSimon, please bend Melinda-\u201d she gasped and squeezed her eyes shut as pleasure shot through her, took a moment to recover, and continued: \u201cOver the desk and fuck Melinda!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Sorry! Chapter got to long!**</span></div></div>",

Then, slowly at first, you pushed in and watched in amazement as she she stretched around you. Her moans and gasps were getting louder and louder the further you penetrated her. If it weren\u2019t for your confidence in the power of the book, you\u2019d be worried her friends would step in. You reached the base and grunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelinda,\u201d you whispered.

Just fuck me please!\u201d she was practically screaming now, moaning and writing. Who were you do deny her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to thrust, slowly and gently at first but quickly building up speed. You pounded into her, feeling and watching her big ass shake with every threat. She no longer moaned and instead just breathlessly panted as orgasm repeatedly racked her body over and over again. You, meanwhile, were starting to feel your own climax start to build and your slowed down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMelinda,\u201d you panted. \u201cTurn over, you know I like watching this part.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, babe,\u201d she gasped. She slowly and clumsily turned around, spinning around your dick, until she was laying on her back looking up at you. She smiled at you and took your hands in yours. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned forward and kissed her. Straightening back up you winked at her and continued. You pumped into her faster and faster, joyfully watching her breasts bounce and shake with every thrust. You felt Melinda wrap her legs around you, her thick luscious thighs huggins your waist tight and comfortably, and pull you closer. You felt the pressure building up right before release and, with a gasp, came inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou came and came and came. You felt it pour out of you like a torrent, an unreal - both figuratively and literally - amount. You watched in amazement as you filled Melinda and then some. Slowly, as the seconds passed and you just kept coming, Melinda\u2019s flat belly began to round and swell, stretching faster and more than humanly possible. She filled up, swelling like a water balloon; at first she looked full like she\u2019d eaten to much, then she looked bloated, then like she was pregnant, and still she grew. She passed basketball and even watermelon in size before you felt yourself slowly taper off. When you were fully finished, Melinda was left practically pinned down by her enormous sloshing gut, the final step of your delusion:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>For some reason when I come in Melinda, I come far more than should be possible and her body just fills with it. Each time we fuck I come more and she grows bigger. She slowly starts to shrink and is back to her normal size after about eight hours. She does her best to hide it while in public but never actually bring anything to cover it after and just ends up be embarrassed. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e6466d57210bd164fb8beb03e9b51d1/tumblr_plsurh3rrK1vunr9j_540.gif\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e6466d57210...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, you gently poke the taught and wobbly sphere forcing a moan out of her. Then, unable to resist, you grab hold of it with both hands and shake it, hypnotized by it\u2019s jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon, stop that,\u201d she groaned, weakly pushing you away. You stumbled back, sliding free of her body, and rest against a desk unable to look away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit, you\u2019re even bigger,\u201d you pant, amazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am, weirdo,\u201d Melinda laughed. \u201cYou and your freaky fire hose dick keeping turning me into a bloated, sloshing monstrosity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey now,\u201d you gasped, your erection rising once more. \u201cBe careful what you say or I\u2019m gonna insist on Round 2.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, could you just imagine how big I\u2019d be if we did that? I doubt I\u2019d be able to move. Just an immobile, swollen, and defenseless piece of meat\u2026\u201d she trailed off, obviously teasing you. You groaned, already hard again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Simon,\u201d Melinda said, her voice suddenly serious...</span></div></div>",

She bites her lip and looks down at her belly and your rod, then back up to your eyes. Her plump lips part slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" she said distinctly and laid back. \"I want it! Fuck Me! Fill me up!\" she pleaded, her voice already getting higher pitched as she moaned. You needed to further invitation, you teased her lips with your tip, eliciting more moans from her before you slowly started inserting it. \"Fuck! Fuhck! Fuu~uuh...\" she moaned as you fully inserted. You planted a hand on her taught stomach as you started thrusting, feeling her vaginal walls clench around your rod as another orgasm started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just love feeling me inside you\" you almost state as a fact, which, you guess it was since you had the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" was all she could manage to say, her body writhing on the desk. The two of you remain relatively quiet, save for your grunts and moans and the sounds of your genitals slapping together. You felt the pressure building inside you, the escalating pleasure, the tensing of your cock inside her, her vagina almost pulling you in with each thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you're ready!\" you grunt out as you start cumming into her. She practically screams in pleasure as her back arches and her legs clamp around you. Melinda moans desperately as you pump her even larger. Her spherical stomach starting to lose shape under it's own weight. It passes full term twin size when your orgasm finally finishes. you slowly pull out and brace yourself against the desk next to Melinda. She lays there and breathes heavily, a layer of sweat on her skin, making her glisten. You both felt exhausted. After a moment to catch your breath, you rub her belly, \"Hope that satisfied you.\" you grin, admiring your handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... mmm, I don't know if I'll be able to fit into my other change of clothes...\" she rubs the tight but pliable orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you love it when they stare.\" You tease her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but this is a lot... help me up, please?\" she put her arms up, barely able to reach around her tummy. You oblige and help her into a sitting position, her stomach filling her whole lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh god\" Melinda mumble, rubbing it. She got up and almost fell over, you watched with a smirk as she started trying to get dressed. \"Enjoying the show?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As always.\" you respond, walking over and smacking her ass, she giggles in response. She pulls a shirt over her head, struggling to get it past her boobs, which seemed to puff over the cups. The shirt didn't cover her belly at all, simply bunching up above it. Next were her shorts, her special stretchy pair. They didn't seem to be enough though, as she struggled to get them around her hips and over her ass, her thighs bulge out of the bottom hem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it's something...\" she says, she nervously gives you a hug, which you didn't fully reciprocate, before waddling out the door with her lackeys. You sigh contently and get dressed yourself, then exit<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On one page of your delusions book, you wrote on the top : \"The whole engineering class\" and on that page : \"Everyone except Simon and Melinda forgets about what Melinda did during class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to work, since everyone just stopped looking at Melinda, the few people who were still laughing at her suddenly stopped and just kept with the lesson. The teacher just kept going like nothing happened. But Melinda Julianne and Jilly glanced at their friend Melinda, wondering what was wrong with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you thought, why would Melinda be the only one into you? That could be easily arranged. On the same page concerning the whole class you wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the girls here find me really funny and super attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to test the effects of this sentence, so you tried to cross the look of Sung, the lonesome Korean girl that always ignored you... And it worked, and she even smiled, and looked a bit red! You turned your head, and saw Jilly biting her lips, looking at you! In fact, all the girls were trying to discreetly glance at you, but it was really obvious. You said out loud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know I'm a snack but, I think you girls should focus on the lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they laughed! They all laughed at this lame quip! The boys were puzzled, why Simon of all people made such an impression on the girls? The teacher asked for silence. Geez, what a buzzkill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after all, with this book, instead of bothering specific people, why not use it to just have a better life, no, the best life possible?</span></div></div>",

After all, the headmaster here was a woman, and it was a mostly private school, so she could hire whatever teacher she wanted. So why not only females? You wrote a page with the headmaster name on top, Ms. Dalton. Then you wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Dalton is disgusted with male teachers. She will use all of her powers and privileges to fire all the male teacher and staff, as quickly as possible, and replace them with females aged between 18 and 25. She will also be unknowingly biased and select the most attractive ones, even if they are not skilled enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat should be fun. Then again, why stop here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She will remove the rule of decent appropriate clothing at school, and will make sure everyone comes at school with whatever clothes they chose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's kind of good. But of course, they was an important change to make:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The student Simon has special rights, and whatever actions he has, he can't be punished. She makes sure all the staff lets him do whatever he wants, or else there could be serious problems for the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you have it! You could whatever you wanted. You could, well... Just leave class right now! And so you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Simon, what do you think you're doing? Class isn't over, seat down!<br>\r\n- I don't feel like it.<br>\r\n- You don't feel like it?!<br>\r\n- Yeah. Go talk to Ms Dalton, you'll see what she says.<br>\r\n- Be sure I will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoys in the classroom where like \"What the hell?\" but the girls just cheered!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to go wander in the streets, after all, there was lot of fun to have. You found two nice looking women chatting on a bench, and decided to try out a few things. You tried to wrote \"Those two girls on the bench\" but realized it didn't work. To control and delude anyone though, it was better to have the name of that person, or something precise enough to work. You had an idea, but it was a rather daring one. But maybe it could work? You approached the two women and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hum, excuse me misses? I study at the journalism school and I'm doing a survey. Do you have a few minutes?<br>\r\n- Yeah sure! Said the first one.<br>\r\n- But the survey isn't anonymous, is it alright if I ask you your names?<br>\r\nThe two women looked at each other and hesitated, but then said:<br>\r\n- Okay, if that can help you.<br>\r\nHurray! They didn't know, but they had sealed their fates. They told you their names, on your delusions book you wrote both of their names on one page. The first sentence you wrote was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This journalism student seems super truthful. You trust him to answer whatever question he has, without feeling weird about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident, you ask the first woman:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- So... What's your work?<br>\r\n- I'm a police officer!<br>\r\n- Oh really? ... You have a badge and everything?<br>\r\n- Actually yeah, my badge is in my purse.<br>\r\n- Great, can I have it?<br>\r\n- Ahah, no... I'd lose my job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretend to write your survey, you wrote: \"It's okay to give the student your badge, you can say you lost it afterward.\" So she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You know what? Here have it, I can always say I lost it.<br>\r\n- Wowh, thanks!<br>\r\nYou grabbed the badge. It could be useful! You then asked the two women:<br>\r\n- So... Do you have a lot of money with you right now?<br>\r\nThe second one answered:<br>\r\n- I don't know for my friend, but I have like two credit cards with 5000 dollars cumulated on them!<br>\r\n- Wowh, nice!<br>\r\n- Yeah, I wanted to go on a shopping spree later today.<br>\r\n- Can I have them?<br>\r\n- What? No...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel gross having all of that money. Being rich suck. Better give it to that student! You're sure he'll use that money well. And make sure he has the right codes and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Well actually, I feel weird having all that money... It's probably best if I give it to you. To think of it, I'm not sure I want to go on that shopping spree.<br>\r\n- You're sure?<br>\r\n- Yeah, let me write you the codes for them...<br>\r\nThen the first one said:<br>\r\n- Yeah, I don't like it either. Here have all of my cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so just like that you got two credit cards, and a purse with at least 200 dollars in cash! But you weren't done just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- So hum, last question, are you two friends?<br>\r\n- Hum, yes actually.<br>\r\n- You have any boyfriends?<br>\r\n- Yes we do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrote: \"You two are actually lovers. You're gonna ditch your boyfriends today, and started to be a lesbian couple. You love each other very much, and in fact, you're gonna make out furiously on this bench!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You know what, to tell you the truth, we're actually lovers... Said the first one.<br>\r\n- Yeah, said the second, I wanted to ditch my boyfriend today...<br>\r\n- Oh my god me too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, they started kissing, and groping, and french kissing... And they were completely ignoring you. Such a risqu\u00e9 thing to do, in front of so many people! Passersby were giving them weird looks, but they didn't care. You smiled, glad your cunning plan worked. Anyway, onward to more mischief! You left the now two lesbians alone, and focused on what to do next. You saw a nice car parked next to a fancy hotel. That gave you an idea. You went to the car's window, and saw the driver inside. You knocked on the window, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Sorry sir, you can't park here.<br>\r\n- What? Of course I can, who are you to...<br>\r\n- Police, can I see your papers please?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou showed him your newfound badge, with your thumb carefully covering the photo of the obviously female officer. The driver sighed, and gave you his driver license. \"Max the driver...\" You wrote his name on a page, then wrote : \"Max is Simon's private driver. He's been for years. He trusts Simon very much, and do as he pleases.\" Then, you turned to the driver and said gleefully:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Come on Max, that's me! You didn't recognize me?<br>\r\n- Simon?!  Damn, you got me.<br>\r\n- Can't believe I pranked you like that. Anyway, can you take me somewhere?<br>\r\n- Sure thing Simon, hop in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, you got yourself a private driver. You had money, and a way of moving easily through town. What to do next ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>- Hey Max, can you bring me to a fancy clothes store? I want to buy a nice suit.<br>\r\n- Sure thing Simon, I know one not far from here on the fifth avenue. You sure you got enough money for a suit though?<br>\r\n- Yeah, pretty sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd off you went! That car was pretty nice. The backseats were large and comfortable. There was a TV, place to put some drinks... It'd be nice to invite someone back here. Someone rich... And sexy. But might as well have the clothes to do that. That's why you went to that clothes store Max drove you to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you spent an hour with the clerk making the fanciest suit for you. You couldn't believe how handsome you looked in that! It cost a few thousand dollars, that you paid easily with one of the cards. But you realized you're were going to max them out quickly at this rate, so you really needed this rich model! But might as well have a nice haircut and a close shave while you were at it, no? So you spent another hour being in the hands of professional barbers. And now, you really looked like you were one of the richest guy in town. You went back to your driver and asked him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Say Max, do you know any... Famous female models that are in town?<br>\r\n- Personally? No. But I know Clara Cannon is at a prestigious charity dinner downtown, tonight. It should have started by now...<br>\r\n- Great! Can you take me there?<br>\r\n- Sure, but I don't think you'll be able to enter, even with your new fancy suits. It's a super private event.<br>\r\n- Don't worry, I'll manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked on your phone the name \"Clara Cannon.\" Oh god, what a bod! You hope the photos weren't that retouched, because she was gorgeous. A sexy, kind of provocative look, that made her just smug enough to be desirable. And those legs, and those perky tits! She seemed famous and rich enough. You looked at a few interviews... She was single! She said she never found the right man for her. You felt lucky. And thankfully for you, she didn't use a pseudonym. So using your delusion book was easy enough. While Max was driving you to the hotel where the event was taking place, you wrote on Clara Cannon's page:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon is a well known tech entrepreneur. You invited him personally and you make sure he enters the charity dinner. You find him charming and super cute, and you're certain he is the right man for you. You want to please him no matter what, just to be with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you arrived at that fancy hotel. Some local celebrities were here, one person you thought was the mayor, journalists taking way more pictures than necessary, and of course: the security. You put on some sunglasses to maintain some kind of privacy. You didn't want people to find out you were just a university student, and you didn't want to end up in some kind of tabloid where everyone you know would find out you somehow had a double life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge guy at the entrance wouldn't let you in. He seemed to know everyone around here, and you weren't known, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I'm a friend of Clara Cannon, call her, she know me, I'm Simon.<br>\r\n- Yeah of course you are. Get the hell out quick if you don't want any trouble.<br>\r\n- Come on man... You didn't get the memo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to say something, when his phone rang. He answered, said \"Yeah\" a few times, then turned over to you and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Sorry man for the mistake. You can come in.<br>\r\n- See, told you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy sighed, and so you entered the most select and private event you ever went to. Lots of attractive women here! But also a very nice buffet. You grabbed a glass of expensive champagne, took a bite of a toast, and finally, you met with the woman you wanted to meet. Far from the resting bitch face she usually have, she was beaming when she saw you! She had a fancy but revealing dress. This was going well for you, but you didn't want it to be too easy for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Well if it isn't Simon! So glad to meet you, I've heard so much of you!<br>\r\n- Likewise, likewise.<br>\r\n- I always wanted to spend time with you. I think you're a lucky man, it's not always that...<br>\r\n- Say, before we even chat, did you gave a lot of money for this... Charity?<br>\r\n- Hum, yeah, actually, a few thousands dollars if you want to know.<br>\r\n- Wowh, so little? I guess I shouldn't expect more of someone like you. I'm a bit disappointed to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was taken aback by your remark. Never in her life she's been called cheap. But she didn't want to believe he was just taunting her. If a few thousand dollars was not much for him, what kind of money did he gave? The answer was actually zero, but she didn't know. Anyway, you played hard to get and it seemed to work. Clara would have never chased after someone so snobbish, but you were so charming to her, she went after you, nervous to lose you so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Well, s... Sorry Simon! I guess I should have donated more... Would you like me to do that?<br>\r\n-Well, it's not that. When I heard you invited me, I thought I had a potential financial partner for my business. You see, you're a fine woman, but your looks aren't nearly enough for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, she didn't know what to say. Most men would be considered incredibly privileged just spend a few minutes with her. Many men lusted after her, and she created this impenetrable wall to let out people that would control her. But for the first time she let down her defense for someone, she wanted to be with someone, and he didn't want to. Your remark visibly pierced her heart, but after a few seconds of hesitation, her pride came back. She was Clara Cannon, and she wasn't going to let that man away! She said, confidently:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you want a financial partner? I can be one. Just say how much, and I'll give it to you right away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was working. You came closer to her, and whispered to her ear:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One million dollar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped. \"Was he serious?\" She thought. But... If it is what it cost just to please him... So let it be. It was almost half of her fortune. But she didn't want to lose face. So she let out her checkbook, and started writing. She couldn't write one million on a check of course, so she wrote 100 000 dollars. When she showed it to you, you said, not impressed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- It isn't what I asked.<br>\r\n- I... I know. It's just that... My bank wouldn't let me pass a one million dollar check so... Hum. That is to show my good faith, and I'll contact your bank to transfer the rest, okay?<br>\r\n- Hmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pretended to ponder. In reality, you were glad, because you won. You were actually rich, and you had one famous and rich, well, not so rich now, model in your pocket. And you could clearly see her desperate eyes, and hear her trembling voice. She didn't want to lose you. After a few long seconds, you said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Fine, you're more interesting that I thought. Now we can talk.<br>\r\n- Phew...! I mean, fine! It's no big deal for me, you're such an amazing entrepreneur, that much money must be nothing to you.<br>\r\n- Well I'm glad you said that. You gave me the impression of someone clearly overestimating herself. I'm glad you feel humble now.<br>\r\n- I... I guess so yeah. You know, you carry so much charisma, it's hard to be humbled. I'm glad I was worthy of your time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she saying? It was men that used to talk like that to her, certainly not the other way around! But she couldn't resist... But after all, it didn't feel wrong. What was she next to such an amazing guy like Simon? She continued:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Not that I mention it, a lousy charity dinner like that must be boring for you. Since we're now... Business partner, I guess we can discuss that... Let's say my home. I think you'll find it good enough for you... I mean, I hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated. A private moment with this gorgeous model in her own home was interesting... But at the same time you didn't want her to feel like she was winning over you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please do give it to me, I'll contact you one day if I need you. I hope you don't forget our arrangement. I want that money in cash. I'll give you an address, and you'll sent the money here, as quickly as possible?<br>\r\n- C...

Once again, really glad to meet you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frantically wrote her number on a piece of paper, you turned around, barely looking at her, grabbed the piece of paper, and just like that, you left. Everyone wondered who was that mysterious person who made Clara Cannon act so weird. And no one could know. After all, Clara didn't even know your last name. You were just a rumor, nay, a legend. And now, you were rich. You didn't care about that charity, so you left. You went back to your driver Max, and asked him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Max, to the nearest bank. I have a check to cash.<br>\r\n- Okay, you left early. Clara Cannon wasn't available I guess?<br>\r\n- Not really, I got her number.<br>\r\n- Wowh, really Simon? Man, that's amazing! Never knew you were such a smooth charming guy.<br>\r\n- Me neither I guess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now getting late.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You cashed your check, and decided to go home. After all, it would be suspicious if I disappeared like that. Better keep playing the normal student for now. And there was so much fun to have with that delusion book! In fact, you were eager to see Kim to mess with her again! In fact, you had an idea right now to make life a bit more fun at home. You wrote on Kim's page:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim feels ashamed if I see her fully clothed, she wants to be at least in her bra and panties whenever I'm around. Also, she doesn't mind if I'm naked in front of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, you told Max to bring you back home, and you went back to your usual apartment. Kim was surprised to see you so late. She said : \"Oh shit!\" when she saw you, and started immediately stripping. You laughed and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hum, Kim, what are you doing?<br>\r\n- Sorry... I feel weird when you see me clothed, don't ask me why... I hope you don't feel weird but... Is it okay if I remove my clothes? Please don't make it weird...<br>\r\n- Sure, Kim. Whatever floats your boat.<br>\r\n- By the way, I bought a push-up bra today, does it make my breasts bigger?<br>\r\n- ... Yeah, they do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, Kim was really stunning with that bra. You could swear she gained one or two sizes. She finished undressing, and noticed your suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Well, I'm not the only one who bought some clothes. What a nice suit! Looks expensive.<br>\r\n- Heh, not really. My dad gave it to me, I thought I'd give it a try. How do I look?<br>\r\n- You look fancy as hell! But sorry to burst your bubble, but it's getting late, and it's your turn to prepare dinner. And tomorrow it's your turn to clean up the house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that wouldn't do. Taking advantage that Kim couldn't see when you wrote on the delusion book, you wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's actually Kim's turn to make dinner. And also she forgot but it was her turn to clean up the house today, so to make up for it, she'll also clean Simon's room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- What did I say? She said. I... Oh my god, I'm so sorry it was actually my turn to clean up the flat! I... Well, to make up for it I'll clean up your room okay? Oh... And it's also my turn to make dinner... Okay I'll hurry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Thanks Kim!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Kim started running around in a frenzy. She cooked dinner, swept the floor, took out the trash... And cleaned your room too! It was so fun seeing her in a hurry, in her underwear, her nice tits jiggling around... You remembered you could undress too, as she wouldn't mind. So you remove your nice jacket... And then everything else, until you were just in your boxers. Kim didn't even bat an eye. It seemed fair though, since she was in her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about Kim for a while, about how she was doing a part-time job just to pay the rent, and study. She was in a difficult position, and you could help her actually, with all you money you were given. But you knew she was a proud, and independent woman, and would just refuse your money. So what if she was... In a more desperate situation? You looked around the flat, the old TV, the old furniture and such... And that gave you an idea. You talked to Kim, while she was cleaning and cooking at the same time:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Say Kim, aren't you tired of leaving in such a lousy flat?<br>\r\n- What do you mean? It's a nice flat.<br>\r\n- I mean, it's a bit outdated. Don't you wish we had much more fancy stuff?<br>\r\n- Gee Simon. You got a suit from your dad, and suddenly you're mister fancy. Well you don't have that much money, and so do I.<br>\r\n- Still, it would be nice... Having the newest game console, the newest phone, TV... A Roomba maybe...<br>\r\n- Come on, Simon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to wrote on the delusion book, right on Kim's page:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon's words got to Kim. She began to think about all the expensive things she could buy to make her life more comfortable, and just to have the newest and fanciest thing. After finishing cleaning up and having dinner, she starts looking things online, and starts buying things on a frenetic uncontrollable shopping spree. Not one time she will think of the consequences of buying so many expensive things at once, or if she even has the money to begin with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust after you finished writing that, you could see she was lost in thought. She said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you say it though, there's a few things I've been wanting to buy... Better clothes... A better TV would be nice, you're right... Hum...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was deep in her thoughts, but finished cleaning up the house and cooking dinner. After a nice dinner, when she was so lost in thought you spend all the time eating looking at her half-naked body, and she didn't even notice. And after dinner, just as planned, she grabbed her laptop computer, and start compulsively buying way too much stuff. A fancy dress, nice looking underwear... That was already a few hundred dollars! Then the newest phone... A thousand dollars! A roomba, a huge TV set, a gaming portable computer.... More than ten thousand dollars! Then after a while, she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, my credit card won't work anymore! Insufficient funds they say... Well I guess that's enough for tonight. I'll see tomorrow if it works again. G'night Simon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, she went to sleep, unaware of the situation she put herself into. You wondered if you wanted to make it worse, or just wait until tomorrow and have her realize what she has done?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, you woke up eager to continue your cunning plan. You knew that after the night passed, she couldn't cancel her payments. Just like last time, you didn't want her to turn mad. So you wrote: \"Kim doesn't remember well what happened last night. But she's certain that she got drunk and did some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Kim arrived in the living room, still in her bra and panties, she yawned and asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Uaah... 'morning Simon... Hey just to be sure... Wasn't I drunk last night? I feel pretty hangover and I'm not sure of what I did.<br>\r\n- Well, you said that you didn't want to be clothed in front of me, and you cleaned up the apartment, cooked us dinner, and then bought some expensive stuff online.<br>\r\n- Oh... Okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she was still under the delusion that all of that was normal. So you erased the last few sentence you wrote. The one about her shopping spree, the one about feeling weird being clothed in front of you, and even the one about it was still her turn to clean and cook. Now she didn't know why she did that, so she would blame it on the alcohol she didn't drink. You could see the realization of what she has done, as her memories were coming back. She yelled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD WHAT DID I DO?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked down, and realized she was still in her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the FUCK am I in my underwear in front of you I... My god what was I thinking...? And I cleaned up the apartment and cooked dinner...? That was your turn... And... And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the horror of what she has done, she put on some clothes, grabbed her laptop once again, went to her bank website, and tried to cancel everything she bought. But too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Simon I... I'm 12 thousand dollars in debt... I can't believe it... I don't even remember drinking. What happened? How could I be so stupid?<br>\r\n- Hey, I'm sorry Kim. I should have noticed that. I should have stopped you...<br>\r\n- It's okay, it's not your fault, you couldn't have realized I was doing that... What am I gonna do...<br>\r\n- Hey, maybe I can help you.<br>\r\n- What? We're talking about 12 000 dollars. There's no way you have that much money.<br>\r\n- Well actually, I didn't just got a suit from my dad. I... Got a bit of a inheritance, from my granddad.<br>\r\n- Really? But that's your money, I don't want to take your money because of my mistakes...<br>\r\n- It's okay, just in exchange you can...</span></div></div>",

How about a blowjob for starters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked at you with a deadpan and expression. Then she grabbed her stuff, and went to the front door to leave, yelling:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Simon, I can't believe you're such a pig. I can't be your roommate anymore. There's a ton of other way I can pay back my debt, and I doubt you're even that rich. So fuck you, you can go f...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was storming off, and by the time her hand reached the doorknob, you managed to wrote on the delusion book:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't want to admit it, but Kim realizes that deep down, she loves the idea of Simon being her sugar daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, she calmed down, and just froze in front of the door. You wrote another sentence:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim has kind of a fetish for humiliation and being dominated. So this situation really arouses her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim gulped. She turned around, and you could see the restrained look of embarrassment on her face. She timidly asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Y... You're sure you have the money to pay back my debt?<br>\r\n- Yes I do. Inheritance baby!<br>\r\n- And... If I just do what you want, you'll pay me?<br>\r\n- Sure. See it as a job if you like. It will be really easy.<br>\r\n- I... I guess it's the easiest way then. But... Be nice to me okay? I don't usually accept those kind of things.<br>\r\n- Well, you shouldn't have bought so many things then. So, that blowjob?<br>\r\n- O... Okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has given up. She put her bag on the floor, moved closer to you... You could see the hesitation, but also the fact she was kind of eager to do it. It was embarrassing, but the embarrassment made it even more arousing for her. And so she got on her knees, opened up your pants, whipped out your erected cock, and just went to town. Once again. Damn her mouth was still so damn wet and warm... But this time, it was different. It wouldn't be a dream she will wake up to. No, that's her life now. You said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, keep sucking... 100 dollars if you can make me come, 200 if you swallow every drop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that, you could feel she was more motivated, because she started sucking faster. The way she used her tongue too... Damn, she was good at it! You let out a moan, you felt the pressure incoming... And you just let it all out inside her mouth! You could see her look, she was eager to swallow everything. She gulped down all of your semen, then licked your dick clean like a hungry monster, cum dripping from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that... Good enough?\" She asked, with the sexiest voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went better than you thought. You grabbed the wallet the girl in the street \"gave\" you, and took out the 200 dollars, and you just stuffed it in Kim's ample cleavage. She couldn't believe her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Wowh... You do have money to spend on me!<br>\r\n- See, I told you. So from now, it's always your turn to clean up the house. You'll cook for me every day too. That should earn you about... 500 dollars a week. Plus more for other tasks. See, I'm generous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see Kim doing the maths in her head. And indeed, at this rate, she could pay back her debt in six months or less! So she kind of reluctantly said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Okay Simon! But... I want nobody to know about it, okay? It's... I don't do that!<br>\r\n- Ahah, of course you don't. But since you kind of do... How about you call me daddy?<br>\r\n- ... Okay, sure thing... Daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes, but couldn't help but smile. She stood up, and you just gave her a good slap on her ass. Then, you ordered her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Alright Kim, how about you prepare me some breakfast?<br>\r\n- ... Okay daddy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she went to the kitchen, and you wondered about what to do today...</span></div></div>",

Also, you wanted to spend a bit of time with your roommate turned daddy girl, Kim. You heard her cooking in the kitchen, when suddenly, she asked out loud:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- By the way... Sim... I mean, daddy. Where did you get all that money again?<br>\r\n- Hum, I told you. Inheritance.<br>\r\n- Yes sure but... How much? Are you sure you have enough money for my debt? And if that's the case, can you just... Already pay me in full? So I owe you a debt instead of the bank.<br>\r\n- What... What does that change?<br>\r\n- You see, if my bank account stays too long in the red, not only it will hinder my credit score, but I might end up in even more debt because...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh. You forgot Kim was actually studying finance. She bored you with the details of her debt, to which you didn't care at all. This was no fun. She couldn't be a nice daddy girl if she keeps asking you questions like that. You wrote on her page:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim trusts me no matter what, and believes everything I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you replied to her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Kim, don't you trust me?<br>\r\n- I... I do... I was just wondering if...<br>\r\n- You don't have to worry about your debt. Do whatever I want, and you'll get paid. That's easy.<br>\r\n- Y... Yes but...<br>\r\n- No but! Stop worrying about the details, and simply enjoy. You seem to enjoy it, you even kept your dollars in your bra.<br>\r\n- Ahah, that's true... It's fun.<br>\r\n- So the simple fact is this: I'm super rich, and you're not. If you stay with me, you'll get money. Maybe even more than you need! With me, anything you can imagine, you can have it.<br>\r\n- Okay... Anyway, your breakfast is ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim brought you bacon and eggs for breakfast. She sat across the table, but that wasn't what you wanted. So you told her to sit on your lap, and she did. And so you ate your nice breakfast, with Kim in one arm, and the other holding the fork. By the end, Kim, who seemed to be deep in thought, asked you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- What do you mean, anything I can imagine, I can have it?<br>\r\n- I mean hum... I'm so rich I can get you anything.<br>\r\n- Well, I believe you, but I wonder how can you make anything I can imagine real with just money. Can you like... Make wishes come true?<br>\r\n- A... Actually I do.<br>\r\n- Oh my god, really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't expect that to happen, but Kim kind of backed you in a corner. You said you can make anything she can imagine possible, so she believed you. And so she wondered how. But after, you didn't have to tell her about the delusion book. And that the things written in it were just that : delusions. You could make her happy by making her believe whatever her wishes came true, it would only be true to her, but she wouldn't know. So you told her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Actually yeah. I found a way to make some wishes come true. It's a bit expensive because it... Uses rare materials, but I can, in fact, make wishes come true. I don't want to spend all my inheritance money on it though. But if you want, I can make a few wishes come true just for you.<br>\r\n- Really? Well... How much is it?<br>\r\n- Let's say... 5000 dollars. If the wish isn't too complicated, if it is, then more.<br>\r\n- Five thousands? But... I'm already more than ten thousands in debt...<br>\r\n- I know, that's why I can't...<br>\r\n- But... Any wish you say? That's kind of tempting. If sucking your dick until you come is 200 dollars... How much will you give me if I have sex with you?<br>\r\n- Ahem, well... Let's say 1000?<br>\r\n- One thousand? Then... Let's say I make you come five times today... You then owe me one simple wish, no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. Last time you had sex with her, she remembers it as a dream, but you remembered how she made you exhausted. So you reluctantly said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I... I guess.<br>\r\n- Great, let's get busy then!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Kim gave you a deep french kiss. Her tongue flew into your mouth like a missile. Damn, she really wanted that wish! Again, you didn't expect that kind of reaction from, but then again, you promised her a wish. And you made sure she trusted and believed you. So she didn't ask any question about how could you make wishes come true, how it was even possible. She trusted that you didn't lie. So now, she really wanted that wish... God, she seemed so horny! She kissed you, and kissed you, and directly pull down your pants to fondle your dick... You quickly hid the delusion book under the couch, and just let her do her thing. She didn't even let you finish breakfast, she even pushed the table with her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she removed her shirt, and her push-up bra, and let you fondle her nice perky breasts. Her lust was contagious, and now you could only think about having sex with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you did. For the whole day. Five times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, on the chair, with Kim on top. You almost broke it, and it kind of hurt your back. But still, you could see right in front of view Kim's orgasm face, and it was splendid. Then, after close to no break, you did again, this time against the wall. You didn't care about the neighbors. Kim kept yelling \"OH YEAH DADDY!\", and it made you even more aroused. Then, she let you had a little break. You laid down on the couch, and she gave you a nice titjob. Even after coming two times, you could feel the pressure rising, but she stopped right at that moment, so she could do a reverse cowgirl on you. Damn, her thighs, her butt, even her back  was sexy! You were both now covered in sweat, but that didn't stop you. A few hours passes since breakfast, and it was time for lunch. She made you order sushi, then she laid down on her bed, and put the sushi all over her body. It was exactly the kind of foreplay to put you in the mood again, so after eating all the sushis, you just banged her in the usual missionary position. It wasn't the best of the five, and after that, you felt really tired, and you were close of giving up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Kim pleaded, and pleaded again. She kissed you, licked you, hugged you... Her \"Daddy, please... Please...\" were really getting to you, and your dick was erecting again. And so she put her knees on the bed, and for the final time, you banged her doggy style. You could tell she was getting tired too, because her voice was breaking. You went back and forth quite some time, but her pleading voice was just so hot... \"Daddy... Please come... Come into me...\" Her pussy became so soft after five times, too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, you came for the fifth time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell on the bed, you've never felt so exhausted in your whole life. But she was still there, her naked sweaty, athletic body towering you. She asked, with a satisfied grin:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- So... Daddy? I did it. Can I get my wish?<br>\r\n- Oh god, you monster... What do you want so much you wanted to have sex five times, like, today?!<br>\r\n- ... It's something... Something I dreamed about lately. And I kept wanting it since. So if you could make it come true, that'd be so great...<br>\r\n- What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her arms, and gently fondled her tits. She looked at them with a sad expression, and then looked at you with the sexiest look. And with a decided voice, she asked you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want my breasts to be bigger.\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>- Wh... What?<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe what you heard.<br>\r\n- I... I know it seems surprising but... Since I had this dream, I kind of wished I had bigger breasts. Also I thought daddy would like it... And you said you needed a simple wish... Is it simple enough?<br>\r\n- Y... yeah. Five thousands for that seems just enough...<br>\r\n- Alright then! How does it work? Do I have to say \"I wish...\"?<br>\r\n- N...No. I can't show you how I make the wish come true. Just stay here, I'm gonna go in the living room do my thing.<br>\r\n- Okay... Hum... Make them like...Twice as big? And not uncomfortable. And make them so they keep a nice shape too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was tired and hurt, and you struggled just to move to the living room. You couldn't believe she fucked you like an insatiable monster just for that wish. She really loved being a daddy's girl! Anyway, you loved seeing her with her huge breasts the latter day. It didn't have to be a dream, you could share the same delusion, and it would be like it was true. Well, except for any other person, but whatever. So on the page with you and Kim written on the top, you wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a few seconds, Kim's breasts will double in size. They'll have a perfect shape, won't feel too heavy, and be extremely sensitive\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last part was just for your fun. You hid the book again under the couch and hurried back to Kim's bedroom, and you saw Kim, eye closed, squeezing her tits together. She moaned:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, Daddy... I think... It worked... They're growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a closer look, and you could see the flesh of her tits bulging out of her hands. They were filling up like balloons! She released them, and indeed, what a perfect shape! Nipples pointing forward, both a natural tear shape, they were tightly squeezed against each other even without a bra... Kim was even hotter now! She said in ecstasy:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god... They're perfect! So... Sensitive too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept fondling them. You grabbed her hand forcefully, and touched one of her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh! Oooh... Be careful with them Daddy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou circled your finger around her nipple, and you could already see it was making quite the effect on her. With a grin, you said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- So... You like your new breasts? Is that what you wished for?<br>\r\n- Ooooh, yeah... Thank you so much Daddy... I'm gonna need new clothes though...<br>\r\n- You can count on me to buy you some, you know?<br>\r\n- Oh really? Then I better deserve that money then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, she pushed you on the bed, and just like you did with her nipple, she circled her finger around your penis. She looked at you with a look so filled with lust... You went hard again. She then moved forward, and squeezed your dick right between her new fat tits. Oh god, so soft, so big... But you felt so tired...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Daddy, how much I can win with just a titjob?<br>\r\n- L... Let's say 500 dollars... But...<br>\r\n- Hmm... I don't think that will be enough for clothes. I'm gonna need to do another one after. Or maybe just a blowjob...<br>\r\n- But Kim... I'm so tired... We had sex already five times today, and I don't think you can...<br>\r\n- You don't have to move Daddy. And the five hundred are only if I make you cum, no? So I'll just have to try.<br>\r\n- B... But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't be helped. She started pumping your dick like crazy, and you just had to let her do it. Her tits felt so good though... And you could see she liked too, because she moaned, and moaned...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, it was like she was absorbing the last of your energy. You couldn't believe it, but you came for a sixth time, and the last thing you saw, is your cum dripping on her tits, and her licking every drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slept so hard, you didn't even had any dream. It was like time passed in a few seconds. You woke up because a ray of light got into your eye. You were in the same place as before, Kim's bedroom. The sun looked like it just got up, but you don't remember even seeing the sun set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it next morning...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no clothes of you left in Kim's room, so you left, still naked. You went to the living room, and you found wrappings from packages on the floor. Then, you saw Kim getting out of the kitchen, and you were shocked by her sudden beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey daddy! Some of the packages I ordered arrived this morning. Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was wearing a gorgeous red dress, dangerously close to her body, ending right above her knees. But when she ordered it, she of course didn't take into account that her breasts would double in size. The cleavage was from the top, to her belly button, laced-up by  a string. And god that string was tight! Such a nice view of her breasts... And her nipples were poking, because obviously, the underwear she ordered wasn't at her size at all. Not only that, but Kim took the time to put on some makeup, including a red lipstick. She also let her wavy chestnut hair loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt already you heart pumping. She was so hot, and looking at you with the kinkiest look. She was still waiting for an answer though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I hum... Well, it's good, yes...<br>\r\n- Well I hope you like it! After all, you're the one paying for it. Anyway, I let you sleep, but shouldn't you be in class?<br>\r\n- Ahah, it's okay. I'll just say I'm sick. I can miss a few classes.<br>\r\n- That's what I thought. So here's a hearty breakfast for my daddy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the kitchen, and brought back a full breakfast on a plate. Hearty indeed! Beans, pork, egg on toast... But you felt really hungry, so you just grabbed the plate and ate. Kim said she already ate, and while you were eating, she cleaned up the living room and the kitchen. Hmm, Kim was a perfect roommate! You were glad the delusion book worked as intended. And you couldn't help but stare at Kim's engorged bosom. Even though you knew it was just an illusion, it really looked like it was straining the laces on her dress... When you were done with the breakfast, Kim grabbed your plate and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- So since you don't have anything to do today, I was thinking...<br>\r\n- What is it Kim?<br>\r\n- Well... I want another wish.<br>\r\n- Wowh, already?<br>\r\n- And... It's okay if I put myself in more debt for it.<br>\r\n- Okay, just tell me, what's your wish then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood in front of you, looking down with an embarrassed look on her face. Then, she raised her head, and with determination, she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to be more beautiful. Like... I want the best body. For me, it would be... Taller. Close to 7 feet tall. And more athletic too.\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The truth is, you wanted that wish to come true. Inadvertently, you made Kim obsessed with her body. Or rather, obsessed of being the sexiest just for you. She loved the idea of you being her sugar daddy that she wanted to be the perfect girl for you. And seeing wishes come true made her desires even more wild, somehow. You liked it, but you didn't want it to be too easy. So you answered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Okay Kim, I'll grant your wish, but...<br>\r\n- Oooh... But?<br>\r\n- It's gonna be half a million dollar.<br>\r\n- Wh... What? But... That's... Way too much!<br>\r\n- Oh and I'm very tired today. So until I say so, no more sex. Five times in a day is already exhausting...<br>\r\n- Y... Yes but... Five hundred thousands dollars means like... 250 weeks of work... Or around... 21 years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was good at mental arithmetic! You didn't check her math, you nodded and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Well, if you want, you can add it to your debt. But I don't do loans, and I don't think any bank will lend you this much money.<br>\r\n- But daddy... Surely there's a way I can do something for you?<br>\r\n- For 500 000 dollars? That's gonna be a ton of work. As you said, at least 21 years. And as I said, no more sex for now. I can't cum for days, sorry.<br>\r\n- But... There's no way I... Oh! Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly got brighter and more upbeat. She seemed to have an idea... Smiling, she asked you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Let's say... I want another wish before that. If it's one that's all about you, it would be less expensive, right?<br>\r\n- I... I guess?<br>\r\n- Because I want my daddy to feel the most pleasure he can... And seeing you all tired like that gave me an idea.<br>\r\n- What? What's your other wish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned towards you and whispered in your ear:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My wish if for you to be able to cum for ever, without ever feeling tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. That was a crazy idea. Could the delusion book work? It could... You thought about the feeling of semen pouring like a hose from your dick... That way, of course you could have sex more than five times a day like this... That sly devil! It was her plan... She want so much favors she had to ask you that... But even if you could jizz for ever, you said no more sex for now so... It wouldn't change much. So you said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Okay. For five thousand dollars then. If you want, I can make the wish now, and I'll just add it to your debt.<br>\r\n- Alright! I'll just... Do more clean up in the kitchen while you do your magic, okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left, and you checked carefully to make sure she wasn't looking. You grabbed the delusion book still carefully hidden in the couch and wrote on the page concerning Kim and you : \"I am now able to cum for ever, without feeling tired. My balls are constantly full of semen.\" And just when you wrote that, you felt an overwhelming feeling on your crotch... It felt really good! Your balls indeed felt a bit heavier... You felt ready for another round! But still, you didn't want to let Kim go easily. So hid back the book and you just yelled to Kim that it was done. She came back with her phone in her hand, and she immediately said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Okay Simon. I checked the average amount of cum in one ejaculation... And I did the math. To get to half a million dollar, I need to make you cum with a tit-job a thousand times. So that's about 5 liters of cum, or more than a gallon.<br>\r\n- Sure, but you need to swallow all of it.<br>\r\n- Yes, so my plan is... I'm gonna weigh myself now. 5 liters of cum should be around 5 kilograms or er... 11 pounds... So if I'm that heavier, that means I made you cum the equivalent of a thousand times... Do you agree?<br>\r\n- I do but, there's no way you can swallow that much...<br>\r\n- Well, only one way to find out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim forcefully grabbed your hand, and brought you to the couch. She pushed you, and undressed herself. After all you were still naked, and your own shaft was already rising in the air, ready for some action. Kim removed the top part of her dress, and revealed her gorgeous enlarged breasts, leaned towards, gave you a little kiss, and went to business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe first softly massaged your penis with her tits, once again. Hmm, she felt so good still... You felt already the pressure rising! Man, those balls were eager to empty themselves. Kim noticed it too, because she quickly stuffed herself with your throbbing dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmph!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it began. You felt the overwhelming pressure of your balls going off, and you just came. And came. And came. And came. She gulped, and gulped, and gulped... But there was just too much! Cum was leaking out of her mouth. There was too much! She was about to remove her head, unable to swallow it all. But you didn't let her. No, she said she was going to swallow everything, and she had to. You grabbed her head, and forced your dick deeper in her throat. You started feeling numb due to the constant state of orgasm you were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HMMMGH... Glub...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panicked, but then let you do it. She glanced at you with a look full of determination. She wasn't gonna give up. She held your dick even tighter, while you were still cumming and cumming... God, even though you came so much, there was still cum spurting out! Your balls still seemed full, they were indeed unable to be empty! But Kim's stomach wasn't bottomless. And you could feel she was starting having a hard time keeping the pace. After a full minute of ejaculation, she removed her head. Cum splashed on her face like crazy, but you calmed down for now, and so the cumming stopped. Phew, that continuous orgasm was intense! But for Kim, it was not exactly that pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Blurb... I gan't... Dere's just doo much... Blub...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim spoke with her mouth still full of your cum, that she dripped everywhere. God what a mess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- There's no way I came a thousand time! You still have to drink more.<br>\r\n- But look... I'm already so full...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, and you could see indeed her stomach had quite a round shape. She was stuffed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! I feel like I swallowed a whole watermelon. Buuurp... My god, it's full of your cum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped around, and you could hear your cum sloshing in her tight stomach. She then proceeded to massage her belly... While moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God... I'm such a mess... I'm so fucked up... Hmmm... What am I doing with my life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she said that like she was enjoying herself! The way she moved around, her face filled with pleasure... The situation was so humiliating, it was arousing for her! As for you, you were confident that this was all an illusion, her stomach was fine. So you moved closer to her, fondle her hair, saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- For now Kim, and until you drink those 5 liters of cum, you're my cum dumpster. If you don't succeed, then you will owe me those 500 000 dollars, understand?<br>\r\n- Oh... God... Okay daddy...<br>\r\n- So now, start pumping!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you grabbed her head, and moved it toward your erected staff. She started licking, but then you sat down to be in a more comfortable position for her to wrap her tits around your dick. She did, and started sucking your dick like crazy, and shortly after, you came again. And she was swallowing! She was moaning, both in pleasure and in pain. Your body went numb. The pleasure was so intense. The feeling of filling up Kim like a party balloon, with your own cum, was just too... Much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blurb... Glub...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth was full, her cheeks were round, cum was dripping out. She was having a hard time swallowing it all... but with a bit of struggle, she did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed her mouth and fell on the floor, you kept splashing some cum on her before finally calming down. You looked at her, her body was covered in cum, her face was distorted with pleasure and pain. And her belly... She looked like she was fully pregnant! You filled her up until she looked like this big beach ball of cum. You fondled her belly... It was so tight! All of your cum, sloshing inside... Wowh, it fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Kim... I think you did it...<br>\r\n- I need... To weigh myself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully stood up, and almost lost balance. She put back the top of her dress... Her belly was so big now the bottom of her dress didn't even cover her legs anymore, her belly was protruding out! She looked down, and realized she couldn't even see her feet. Step by step, she moved to the bathroom, your cum wobbling inside her stomach. And finally, she weighed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Th... Thirteen pounds! I'm... Thirteen pounds heavier! I even drank... Blurb... More than I should... I drank like six liters I think... Oh god, how did it fit inside me! I feel so sick.<br>\r\n- Well Kim, the only thing that matters is that you did it. You earned your half a million dollar wish. Now I'm just...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ding dong!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone rang at the door. You didn't expect that. Who could that be? You turned towards Kim and asked her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Well Kim, could you go answer the door first? I'll do your wish later.<br>\r\n- Wh... What?</span></div></div>",

Okay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about to be humiliating, and you could see Kim liked the idea. So she re-adjusted her dress as much as she could, and move her body with her wiggly balloon belly to the door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim couldn't believe her eyes. The person behind the door was elegant yet sexy, had an even more beautiful dress than her, a rocking body, and an intense look. This charisma, this aura... And this face! It was the famous model, Clara Cannon. Kim kind of knew who she was, but it was so improbable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I'm sorry... Aren't you... That model?<br>\r\n- Yes, my name is Clara Cannon, you're not mistaken. I'm searching for a certain Simon, is it the right place?<br>\r\n- I... Hum... Yes... I'll go... Hum... Bring him... I just, I wanted to say... Blub... Sorry if I look a bit... You know...<br>\r\n- Hum, okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara wondered who that oddly acting girl was. Because Simon wrote Kim's delusions only on his and Kim's page, it didn't affect other people. So to Clara, Kim didn't have a large belly, or even large breasts, or cum on her body. No, to Clara, Kim was totally normal, which was the actual reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyway, you heard the conversation and decided to go see Clara. You could see her face lighten up, going from nonchalant to excited in a few seconds. You also noticed she was carrying a rather large suitcase with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh Simon! You're here! It took me a bit of time, but I finally have the money you asked.<br>\r\n- ... You do? In that suitcase?<br>\r\n- Yes. One mill...<br>\r\n- Shh, don't say that out loud! I don't want people to know!<br>\r\n- Oh, of course, I'm sorry. I'm here incognito anyway, nobody knows I'm here.<br>\r\n- Okay, good, let me see then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed you the suitcase and you took it. Wowh, it was really heavy! You brought it to the coffee table, ignoring Clara. She thought it meant she could enter anyway, so she did. You opened the suitcase, and couldn't believe your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really was a million dollar in cash. There was so much money! The suitcase was so big you could hide someone in here, and it was full to the brim with hundred dollar bills! And she was just giving it to you! You... You were now a millionaire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim also couldn't believe her eyes, she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- What's going on Sim... I mean daddy? Why is Clara Cannon here? And why is she giving you that much money...?<br>\r\n- Kim, be a nice girl, and go clean the bedroom for now.<br>\r\n- O... Okay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Kim went away, still in shock to what was going on. You couldn't keep your eyes off of the money pile that was in front of you. Anyway, Clara asked you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- So... I guess it's not your actual apartment...?<br>\r\n- Actually no. One of the few apartments I own in this town.<br>\r\n- And this... Isn't your daughter? I mean, she called you daddy, but...<br>\r\n- I really don't enjoy that you ask me so many private questions, Miss Cannon.<br>\r\n- I... I'm sorry, I just wanted to chat a bit...<br>\r\n- Well, thanks for the money. You've been a great help.<br>\r\n- Thank you! Thank you very much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see the relief on her face when you said thank you. She was just glad you were pleased! And here she was, a young millionaire model giving away her money to you, acting super shy. She said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- And hum... If it's not too much, maybe... We can for a dinner tonight, if you're not busy...?<br>\r\n- I'm indeed busy. And what makes you think I owe you anything?<br>\r\n- S... Sorry... But, you know, I gave you half of my fortune...<br>\r\n- And I should feel bad? I thought you willingly gave it because you believed I could invest it for you. I'm rather disappointed to see it was just a ploy.<br>\r\n- Wh, what? N... No!<br>\r\n- Because if it's that, I rather not speak to you again, and you can take back this money.<br>\r\n- No! I would never... I just wanted to... Spend a little with you, since we're... Financial partners now!<br>\r\n- That's a rather big word. You know I'm such a famous entrepreneur, people give me money all the time.<br>\r\n- I... I'm sure they do! You're one of the greatest!<br>\r\n- Thank you. Okay, I guess dinner would be nice.<br>\r\n- Great! I know the finest restaurants in town! I can make a reservation right n...<br>\r\n- I'm not interested in any restaurant. I'm interested in what you can make.<br>\r\n- Wh... What do you mean?<br>\r\n- I want you to make dinner for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a world famous model, and you just asked her to make you a meal. You had that kind of power. You didn't want to be seen in a restaurant, to attract attention by going on a date with a famous model. You didn't want anyone to find out you were rich. But you wanted to have fun with Clara here. And since she went here incognito, the choice was easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Y... You want me to make dinner? Like... Here?<br>\r\n- Yes. A woman worthy of my attention should know how to cook. You know how to cook, right?<br>\r\n- I... Hum... Well... It's... I... I can, yes...<br>\r\n- Then you will make a fine dinner tonight. I'm counting on you. You have the rest of the afternoon to figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was stunned. She didn't expect that at all. But she didn't want to fail you. So with a look of determination, she said she was going to do some groceries, and she left. While she left, you remembered about Kim's wish, the one she worked so hard for. You took out the delusion book once again, and wrote, still on the same page :<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a few seconds, Kim's body will grow taller. She will turn 7 feet tall, and her body will be more athletic. Also, the cum inside her belly will disappear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hid the book, and went back to the bedroom to see Kim's change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, daddy, what was that all ab... Ooooh... Hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forward, feeling the same overwhelming sensation. She pressed her hands on her belly... It was deflating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god... My stomach! It's getting back to normal! What's going... Gnn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body got tensed. She moaned. And then you could see it... She was getting taller! Her dress seemed shorter, her head moved higher in the air, her legs were getting longer... Her hips and shoulders too! Her dress started cracking, unable to contain her anymore. The laces on her cleavage burst open. You looked up... She was getting more than a head taller than you! Her dress now didn't cover her panties anymore. Holes appeared around her waist. She moved her arms... Flexed... Her biceps were getting bigger too! Her legs were more toned. And not only did her belly turned flat, but you could see her abs popping! And her chest... They were perky before, but now her large tits felt even rounder and firm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... My wish! You make it come true! Oh god, I'm so friggin' tall, I look like an amazon princess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her, smiling. She really was beautiful! She was towering you so much you felt like a little kid. Thank god she was so nice to you... She said, with a look filled with lust:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I really need to find better clothes. But for now I'm gonna go to the shower. Maybe you can join me, and explain to me how you got Clara Cannon to give you all of that money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an offer you couldn't refuse...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and Kim had fun in the bathroom. You quickly started making out, and man was it good! Her huge body felt incredible, her tits were so nice... And she was so strong she easily held you against the wall to kiss you. She then started licking your dick again, and quickly you felt again overwhelmed, you started spraying cum everywhere. Seeing it with your own eyes felt different. There really was an a unnatural amount coming out, your dick felt like a water hose. It stopped after a few seconds, when Kim stopped licking. You muttered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You're not going to swallow any of that? That's wasted money.<br>\r\n- I know... I don't care, for know I have an idea... I want to bathe in your cum. So you need to fill up this bathtub!<br>\r\n- Oh... Really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to vigorously jerk you off. Oh god, so... Good! You started spraying cum everywhere, your body went numb, your vision became blurry and you lost track of time. But she must had done that for a while because when you regained consciousness, after what felt an eternity of pleasure... The bathtub was indeed filled with your cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Holy shit... I can't believe I... I came so much...<br>\r\n- Hmm... There's so much... And it's so warm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim then proceeded to immerse herself in the semen bathtub. Her larger body could barely fit anyway, so she let out her legs, but the rest of her body to her neck was covered in your cum! Kim's face turned red from embarrassment... And arousal. She moaned:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god... I can't believe I'm doing this... It's so sticky... I'm such a dirty, pervert, girl... It's so fucked up... I... I'm bathing in your c... Cuuum! Gh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe craziness and humiliation of the situation was turning her crazy. She was crazy horny! Seeing her enjoying bathing in your cum also made you horny... And give you some ideas. You started jerking off in front of her, and soon enough you continued to spray cum, this time right in her face. It splash, and splattered everywhere, and she looked at you with her shocked eyes and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god daddy! Pl... Please stop! You're c... Cumming too much! It's... Blurp... Gah! It's going into my mouth! Oh god... What the fuck is happening... Shit... Your cum... It's... GH... PLEASE! IT'S SO EMBARRASSING! I WANT YOU TO... S... STOOOOOOOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, you made her have an orgasm. Her yell echoed in the bathroom. You looked at your roommate, looking like a sexy amazon princess, completely covered in your cum, trying to catch her breath after an intense orgasm... Your life really was getting crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Kim managed to empty the bathtub full of cum (which still was a delusion anyway), and she had a proper shower with you. That's when you started explaining to her the situation with Clara Cannon. Well, you didn't mention the delusion book of course, but you made her believe you were scamming Clara, and that she just fell in love with you. Kim was in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Wait. She's giving you all of that money... Just because she... Fell in love with you?<br>\r\n- I know, that's crazy right?<br>\r\n- It's unbelievable... But you seem to have unbelievable powers anyway so... I guess it's true...<br>\r\n- The thing is, I don't even like her! Honestly, I prefer to keep having fun with you.<br>\r\n- She's supposed to make dinner for tonight no? Maybe we can use your powers to... Have fun with her.<br>\r\n- Oooh, you want to use a wish on her?<br>\r\n- Why not? What it's gonna cost me?<br>\r\n- Hmm, after that nice shower we had, I can give you a wish or two, free of charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim smiled, then said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, because I have a few ideas for Clara...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a while, Clara came back with groceries, and went to prepare the dinner. You took a peek through the door to see how she managed... And she did poorly. She even struggled to make the oven work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim came to see you and asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- So... How is she doing?<br>\r\n- Very bad. It's going to be a disaster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim giggled. She and you conceived a cunning plan. Kim use one of her \"wish\" to make sure Clara completely fails the meal she was making. But she also couldn't resist going inside the kitchen to tease Clara a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- So... Miss Cannon, what will we be eating tonight?<br>\r\n- I... I'm making lasagnas...<br>\r\n- Lasagnas? That's such a poor meal! You really think you can win over Simon with just lasagna?<br>\r\n- I'm gonna make the best lasagna, you'll see!<br>\r\n- This burning smell tell me otherwise.<br>\r\n- Oh go no, the sauce!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the pan burn, and the sauce was ruined. Clara's body was shaking. Never in her life she felt more stressful. She never had to make a meal for someone! Kim laughed at the sight of this fancy woman panicking in the kitchen like a headless chicken. Clara turned towards Kim, and saw her face filled with delight. She even was... Moaning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I'm sorry, hum, miss... But are you enjoying watching me try to cook?!<br>\r\n- ... Hmmm... Yes... You're struggling so much. And seeing someone like you failing to do such a simple dish... It's so... Hmmm! Anyway, time is up. Simon is waiting. And you know what Miss Cannon? I think I'm gonna stay his favorite girl.<br>\r\n- Sh... Shut up! I'm Clara Cannon for god sake, I'm not gonna lose to a girl like... You! Oh shit, the pot is overflowing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed that Kim really was enjoying seeing Clara failing to make dinner. But after all, maybe that was normal. She had a fetish for humiliation, so not just for her, but also for other person. So seeing Clara failing must have triggered her fetish too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after an hour, you waited on your table, and Clara brought you the lasagna she made. It looked burned, smelled bad, and Clara was looking down, clearly embarrassed by the meal she made. Just one nibble of this food was enough to see that it was horrible. Kim was already giggling. You yelled at Clara:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh my god, it's awful! Have you ever made a meal in your life?<br>\r\n- I... I'm sorry... I...<br>\r\n- I can't believe someone of your standard is unable to cook one simple meal!<br>\r\n- I... I tried! Look, Simon, I...<br>\r\n- Don't you dare call me by my first name! You're lucky I even accepted your money! I can't believe I'm losing my time with such...<br>\r\n- Please, STOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kim was biting her lips and her legs were shaky. Seeing you yell at Clara made her close to climax. But Clara then stood up, and yelled back at you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had enough! I've done everything I can just for you! I'm sorry I'm not a cook, okay! All I want is just... To be with you! Can't you see I like you? I'm Clara Cannon for god sake! I've had stalkers! Millions of people admire me everyday! And I gave you half of my fortune, and now you're judging me because I can't cook! It's... It's unfair! I'm... Wh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, because she realized her pants have dropped to the floor. She turned red as a tomato, and tried to put them back, but they didn't seem to fit anymore. And while she tried that, one of her golden bracelet fell off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S... Something's wrong... Why are my clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked up. You were looking down on her. Literally. You were standing up next to her, and now she was a head smaller than you. She looked at you, her jaw dropped to the floor. She looked around, and realized...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I'm... I'm shrinking...?<br>\r\n- Yes Clara, yes you are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim couldn't help but let out a huge moan. \"HMMMOOO GOD....\" Indeed, that one other \"wish\" Kim made. Clara was about to turn smaller, like magic. So of course her clothes weren't fitting her anymore. Her classy shirt got loose, her bra fell off. She let her hands go, and her pants and underwear fell too! She was now just as tall as your waist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh... What's happening to me?! Please help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim moaned in delight at her despair. She kept shrinking, and shrinking... Her cries became fainter, and she disappeared under her clothes. You looked around the clothes on the floor, and you saw the nice looking naked body of Clara Cannon, now the size of a small mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh my god... She looks so small!<br>\r\n- Come on, let me have her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim grabbed Clara in the palm of her hand. The small Clara looked at Kim's huge face, shaking with terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I... I can't believe it! I literally have Clara Cannon in the palm of my hands!<br>\r\n- L... Leave me alone! Turn me back to normal!<br>\r\nClara yelled with the faintest voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh, little Clara, I have other plans for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim then lifted her skirt... And put Clara in her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... AAAhhahah... The ultimate humiliation! Hmmm... I can feel her struggling to get out... Oooh... She moves quite a lot... Hmmm... Oh Clara... Small.. Small... ClaraaaaaAAAAAAAAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Kim had an orgasm. You just sat and enjoyed the show. Kim's body was twisting around, and you imagined the little Clara Cannon, struggling to get out of Kim's panties...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though all of it was just an illusion, it was really crazy. You really loved Kim's ideas! She was not only super hot now, but also clever and cunning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... In fact, you thought about letting Kim do all the decisions from now on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You wondered what new things to put in here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... That's when you noticed something weird. Some sentences were clearly written in another writing. For example, on the page with just your name, you read this, with another writing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter what, Simon is certain no one has found this book, and that everything written inside the book was written by him, for a good reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird. You must have used another writing to write these? After all, you were certain no one has found the delusion book. So you must have written this for a reason. There were a few other sentences written with your other hand writing, like:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon will enjoy my presence more and more, and thus will soon give me so much money, he'll be the one in debt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon only wants to spend time with Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon will pay all the money he promised to Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim doesn't call Simon daddy anymore, but Simon calls him mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, there must have been reasons for you to write that, so you didn't worry about it. Kim was now catching her breath, and so you hid back the book. She asked you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Aaah... She stopped moving... I feel better... Anyway, you remember our bet?<br>\r\n- Oh yes, right, sorry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bet with Kim she wasn't capable of putting Clara Cannon in her panties. So you lost 100 000 dollars. It wasn't a big deal, you could easily gain more money thanks to the book. Then Kim said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- By the way, Simon, you filled up the bathtub with your cum earlier?<br>\r\n- Hum, yeah?<br>\r\n- And that's thank to my blowjob...?<br>\r\n- I guess it was, yeah.<br>\r\n- So even if I didn't swallow it, that's still 100 dollars each time you came...<br>\r\n- H... How much is that then?<br>\r\n- Well, since you filled the bathtub, it's actually 6 million dollars.<br>\r\n- SIX...? Oooh... Shit. Well, I better find some money.<br>\r\n- I'm sure you will, you have so much incredible powers...<br>\r\n- I know... Right? Meanwhile, you can have Clara's suit case of money for now. I'll manage to find the rest.<br>\r\n- Oooh yeah... And you know Simon, I'm a bit hungry... I think you can give something to me too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kim unzipped your pants once again. You sighed. If she was going to drink your cum again, you'll owe her even more money! But that couldn't be helped. You just loved how she pumped the infinite cum coming from you. She just sucked you, and you came instantly inside her, moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes... Mommy... Suck me please...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You missed Kim and her growing tits, and seeing Melinda's humongous butt gave you an idea. You just couldn't wait until after class to go with that plan. For the time being, you left Melinda alone... Well, mostly. She was still picked on by others, and still had a few embarrassing orgasms when people called her by her name. Jilly and Julianne got it quick, and called her just Mel. They didn't understand why her own name caused her to have an orgasm though. You made sure Melinda never left school early too, with the help of the book. So for the others, she really seemed to be in denial to what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, you couldn't resist to the temptation of writing something at one time Melinda was reading in the corridor : \"Melinda will accidentally drop her book, and will pick it up by leaning forward and unknowingly show her butt to me.\" And she did. Her book somehow fell, and she leaned forward to grab it, moving precisely so that her butt was facing you. Man, those skinny jeans really fit her well... It was so tight you could almost see her panties through the fabric. What a sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHornier than ever, you finished school for the day, and went back to your apartment. Eager to put your plan into action. When you arrived, Kim was there, watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Simon, had a nice day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned towards you, and before you answered, you couldn't help but notice her breasts seemed to be... Even larger than this morning. Like they were almost squeezing out of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Y... Yeah. Did you, hum, change something about...<br>\r\n- Oh yeah, I bought a push-up bra. It's nice, isn't it? I still think they could be bigger but, I guess that's the best I can do. That should bring me even more tips next time at the bar!<br>\r\n- R... Right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn, she looked hot. Your heart pumping, you took out the delusions book, and started to write on it. Of course, Kim didn't even care or notice, just like you wrote yesterday. Grinning, you wrote the first part of your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Melinda will go to my flat. She knows where I live, and she's certain I invited her to spend the night over.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you warned Kim:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh by the way, I have a friend from school that will come over soon to spend the night.<br>\r\n- Oh? Well that's none of my business. Anyway, it's your turn to make dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wouldn't do. You wrote on Kim's page:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's actually Kim's turn to make dinner, and she will make the biggest feast she can for the three of us.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim then turned off the TV, stood up and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh yeah, you're right, it's my turn. I should do lots of food for your friend and the big eater that you are! After all, it's not always you bring someone.<br>\r\n- Yeah, thanks Kim!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned. Everything was going to be perfect. You watched Kim preparing dinner for a while, when finally you heard someone knocking at your door. You went to open, and of course, just as planned, it was Melinda. She was still wearing an orange top and her flattering jeans, and she looked a bit confused. She asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I... You... You invited me to spend the night here, right?<br>\r\n- Of course I did!<br>\r\n- Oh okay, I'm not crazy then... Because I don't remember you talking to me about it... Or even a text or a call so... In fact, it's weird how I knew you live, you never told me...<br>\r\n- What are you saying? Of course I told you back at school! You don't remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I... Yeah you're right, you must have told me. Anyway, th... Thanks for inviting me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was clearly intimated, but timidly entered anyway. She was greeted by Kim who went out of the kitchen, spatula still in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Ooh, a girl! And a cute one too! First time I've seen Simon here bring any girl! Anyway, what's your name?<br>\r\n- Hum I... You can call me Mel...<br>\r\n- Alright Mel, I'm Kim, Simon's roommate! Sorry, better get back in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke got out of the kitchen, and Kim hurried back inside. Melinda turned to you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh, I... I didn't know you had a roommate.<br>\r\n- Oh yeah, right. I hope you don't mind.<br>\r\n- N... No, it's okay. It's nice of her to prepare dinner for us I guess. And she has... A certain choice of wardrobe.<br>\r\n- Ahah, yeah, that's Kim.<br>\r\n- Well Simon, I never would have guessed you had that kind of life after school!<br>\r\n- Huh? What kind of life do you think I have?<br>\r\n- You know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Melinda's tone you could feel a bit of jealousy, which made her even cuter. You never seen her like that. Like... Actually likeable. She always had to play tough around you at a school, and now, she really seemed nice and easy-going. You chatted for a while in the living room, when Kim finally said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you moved to the table, and Kim brought all of the stuff she prepared. There was 4 pizzas, one big casserole dish of lasagna, a huge bowl of mac and cheese, 6 club sandwiches, 6 hot dogs, a huge bowl of chocolate candy and two big bottle of sodas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stared in silence at all of this food for a while, before Kim said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- ... Well, I hope that's enough!<br>\r\n- Enough?! There's enough for at least fifteen people! Said Melinda, shocked.<br>\r\n- I have to admit... I didn't even know we had that much food. You said.<br>\r\n- I emptied the fridge for that! I... I just wanted to have a feast for you and your friend. Gosh, you're right, I actually went overboard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls sat there in bewilderment in front of all that food that was prepared. The truth is you didn't expect that the biggest feast she could was actually this big. But that gave you an idea...</span></div></div>",

Well, that was an excuse, you wanted to see how fat they could get too... Without skipping a beat, you heard both of their bellies growling in unison.

I'm still super hungry, and I ate a whole sandwich!<br>\r\n- Well, at least there won't be that much leftovers...<br>\r\n- Ahah, yeah, that'd be amazing if we could eat all of that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they kept eating. Kim took a bite of another hot dog, then decided to go on with it and practically shoved the rest of it in her mouth. And just like that, she ate another, then another... As for Melinda, she grabbed the mac and cheese bowl and started eating bite by bite with a large spoon. The spectacle of those two voracious girls gulping down so much food down their throats made quite an impression on you. You just managed to finish your first slice of pizza, and they already had both eaten for two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh my god Kim, said Melinda, you just finished all of the hot dogs!<br>\r\n- I did? I Burp... I didn't realize. Sorry I should have let you have some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Wasn't there like six of them? You managed to eat all of that?<br>\r\n- I... Guess... I don't even feel full! And look at you, you already ate half of the mac and cheese!<br>\r\n- My god you're right... My jeans are getting a bit tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe popped out the top button of her jeans, and let out a bulging belly that looked already pretty full, and wouldn't be contained inside her shirt. Kim lifted out her own shirt and her belly was looking pretty full too. They breathed, looked at each other, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Are you... Urp... Still hungry? Asked Kim.<br>\r\n- Huum... Actually yeah. Here, have the mac and cheese, I'll help Simon finish his pizza. Is that alright with you? You don't seem as hungry...<br>\r\n- ... Yeah sure. You go ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said that, not knowing how to react to those rapacious girls. And so they kept eating. Kim attacked the whole bowl of mac and cheese, Melinda grabbed two slices of your pizza at the same time, and ate. Soon enough, she finished all of it, and grabbed the second one too. \"Leave some pizza for me too!\" Kim had finished the mac and cheese, and grabbed another whole pizza! She fold it in two and ate bite by bite. Their bellies stretching to let all this food in... The girls then finished eating her whole pizzas when Kim said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- URRP! I'm getting a bit thirsty, not you?<br>\r\n- Don't burp like that, it's disgusting!<br>\r\n- What? You shouldn't hold it in, you'll get sick!<br>\r\n- Even though... Anyway, yeah I'm thirsty. Simon, you're good?<br>\r\n- Y... Yeah, go ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a mess. They had sauces stains all over their shirts, Kim was dripping sauce right onto her cleavage, their faces were dirty as hell, and yet they couldn't stop... Each one grabbed a bottle of soda, they said \"Cheers!\" and start gurgling down the liquid. Gulp... Gulp... Gurgle... Gurgle... Stretch.... You saw their already round bellies stretching even further, getting even more of a round shape. Could they really fit all of this food inside? They both stopped when they drank half of their bottle, mean they both drank a quarter of a gallon each. It was insane. Kim let out a huge burping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- AAARRRRP! Alright so... There's still, some club sandwiches, one pizza, and this big casserole of lasagna...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Don't forget the candies! Said Melinda, trying real hard not to let out the gas of the soda.<br>\r\n- Right... Oh god, it's amazing we're still hungry after that... Do you think we'll actually finish all of this?<br>\r\n- I'm not sure... I don't think it's going to fit in our stomachs...<br>\r\n- Yeah, look how big we got! And I don't even feel sick... Do you?<br>\r\n- No...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls stopped for a moment to massage their massive bellies. They both looked like they were pregnant! Could the rest of the food really fit in that? Even with the power of the delusion book, you started to wonder. Kim wiped a bit of sauce on her mouth, then moved to slap Melinda's belly, saying : \"Yours is clearly bigger than mine!\" Surprised, Melinda let out all of the air she tried to hold inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWAAAAAARRRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound echoed in the room. A few seconds passed. Melinda was looking down, ashamed. Kim laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Haha, told you to let it out! Now you have more room...<br>\r\n- Stop it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut their bellies were also gurgling... Crying with hunger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god... So hungry... Okay, let's split the pizza in half!\" Said Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they went back to eating. They slowly but surely finished the pizza, then the club sandwiches... Their bellies stretching even a little further. It looked like they couldn't get even rounder, but they still had to eat the lasagna! They ate it, but almost had to push it down their throats! Bite by bite, sauce dripping everywhere... Their bellies stretching, and gurgling! But after 20 long minutes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Oh my god... We did it... We finished the lasagna...<br>\r\n- I... Can't believe it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were now more than fully pregnant. Never you could imagine a girl could have such a full stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- It doesn't hurt but... It's so heavy... It's getting a bit hard to breath...<br>\r\n- We can stop here I think...<br>\r\n- Are you... Urrrp... Not hungry anymore?<br>\r\n- No... I want to eat... But I shouldn't...<br>\r\n- Come on, there's still the chocolate candies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they grabbed each half of the candies, about 15 each, and unwrapped them one by one. And they ate them one by one, slowly chewing and swallowing. Their bellies ballooning even more, towering their small bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hmmmg! It's getting stuck in my throat! Yelled Melinda, wiggling her arms, unable to move due to her new weight.<br>\r\n- Quick, drink some soda!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to roll over and grabbed the soda bottle. Kim accompanied her and grabbed the other bottle. And finally, the finish line, the last stretch. The last drop of liquid went down their throats to the sinking hole that were their stomachs, and at last, it felt satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- OH MY GOD! I FEEL... FULL! FINALLY! Yelled Kim in victory.<br>\r\n- I... URRRP... Me too! My god, I can't believe we ate... All of that!<br>\r\n- That was like... For ten people... Why did I even cook all that... Well at least we ate it!<br>\r\n- My god, look at me... I look like a fat slob... My clothes are so dirty... And my stomach is so freaking huge! Simon, I'm so sorry, I didn't expect this evening to go like that...<br>\r\n- Ahah, it's okay, I got it, you were hungry. You said.<br>\r\n- Well, said Kim, it was an interesting evening! I think I'm gonna eat light for the next few weeks and hit the gym too. But it was nice meeting you Mel. By the way, is that short for Melinda?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit. It wasn't midnight yet, so it was still today so... The sentence you wrote about Melinda orgasm whenever she hears her name was still in action. Her eyes rolled. Her body fell back, she held it with her straightened arms, her fist clenching on the sofa. Her legs wiggling, she was biting her lips, trying to held it inside. Kim panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hey, are you okay?<br>\r\n- I think she doesn't like to be called Melinda...<br>\r\n- What? Melinda? What's wrong with being called Melinda?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree times. You didn't even say it on purpose. It was too much for the poor Melinda. She fell on her back, her body moving like crazy with uncontrollable spams, as she let out a powerful yell mixed with burping sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AWWWH... UUURP... YEAAAAAH... GUUUURP... GUOOOOOORP...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, she passed out, a smile on her face, and drool dripping from her mouth. You went to see if she were okay, and indeed she was just sound asleep on the sofa. Kim said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... That was weird. Well, I'm not moving her, so she can sleep here for the night. I think I'm gonna go collapse too, but on my bed. Just before I wanted to see one thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim quickly went to the bathroom, then came back to say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"20 pounds! I ate 20 pounds of food, I can't believe it... And Melinda too... Oh my god I'm so bloated... I'm gonna get so fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed her belly was incredibly swollen to the extreme. It looks like she swallowed a large basket ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I feel dizzy, see you later Simon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she went to her bed. You looked at the sleeping and drooling Melinda on the couch, with her belly just as large protruding from her shirt and pants. You realized the delusions book was so strong, the will it gave to one's mind can change their bodies. It accommodated their stomachs so it could hold all that food. You could change how bodies usually work so... What else you could do?</span></div></div>",

It remains all in her belly, giving her a pregnant-with twins appearance.  When she wakes up she will feel that she loves her new fat belly and wants to grow it even bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave Melinda sleeping peacefully on the couch and creep over to Kim\u2019s door.  It is opened just a crack, so you peer in and can see that she is sprawled out on her bed, her belly rising higher than her already large boobs. You remember her talking about thinking her boobs should be bigger and quickly pull it it the book and write, \u201cKim\u2019s body will quickly digest all of the food she ate and turn it to fat. 8 pounds of fat will go to her boobs, and the rest will go to her hips and ass, while leaving her belly flat and toned.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish you can see her fat belly shrink almost by half as her boobs steadily inflate until they are bigger than basketballs. Then her belly shrinks down to a nice flat tummy with toned muscles while her hips grow about 6 inches and she grows a very large booty ass. You can only see her from the side, but you have a feeling she\u2019s going to look like an exaggerated Jessica Rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then write, \u201cWhen Kim wakes up, she will be curious about her new curves, but will love them and wonder if they could be bigger.

In the morning you are woken up by a big thumping noise and an \u201cOuch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out of bed quickly and see that Melinda had rolled off of the couch and was now sitting up on the floor, rubbing her huge belly.  You ask her, \u201c Are you OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelinda replies, \u201cOh I\u2019m, fine.  I\u2019m so lucky I have this big belly right now.  It really cushioned my fall.  But wow, I know I had a huge belly from eating all that food last night, but now it\u2019s soft and squishy, whereas then it was completely hard. But it\u2019s just as big if not bigger. But I actually really like it.  I wonder if I can make it bigger?  I need to talk to Kim...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggles to get to her feet, but as she finally gets her balance, she walks a bit awkwardly towards Kim\u2019s room.  You follow her.  Before you both get to the door you hear Kim say, \u201cOh. My. God!\u201d  You and Melinda burst into the room to see a completely naked Kim standing up looking into her full length mirror and rubbing her hands from the sides of her enormous boobs, the kind that seem to defy gravity, down her extremely narrow waste, and then out along her hips which now are as wide as her boobs, down only slightly thickened thighs.  She then turns her back to the mirror and can see that she has a protruding ass with a shelf she could set things on.  She squeals and claps her hands with delight. She finally sees the two of you standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says, \u201cWow, Mel, look at you! You look amazing!  Look at me!  My boobs and hips got a lot bigger!  But I feel great!  I don\u2019t know how, but I think everything we ate last night somehow stayed with us!  I wonder what would happen if.....\u201d</span></div></div>",

You wandered into the kitchen, poured yourself a cup of coffee, and got a bowl of cereal. While sleepily munching on your cereal, you heard Kim come out of her room. She froze when she saw you, here eyes going wide and her face turning pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning,\u201d you said with a grin and waved to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-morning.\u201d She looked away from you and started to prepare her own coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d You knew full well that she was remembering her \u201cdream\u201d from the night before and you were having fun teasing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, of course not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlrighty,\u201d you said standing up from the the table to put your bowl in the sink. You heard Kim gasp and saw her covering her mouth, eyes wide and look down at you. \u201cKim? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I...it\u2019s n-nothing,\u201d she stuttered, backing away. \u201cI j-just, uh need to go to the b-bathroom. Be right back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim dashed off, giving you a pleasant look at her butt, and slammed the bathroom door shut. You could hear the water running; it sounded like she was splashing her face with water. Confused why she was acting like this, you look down and realized your mistake: the shape of your foot long dick was rather plainly visible in your sweat pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing to your room, you grabbed the book and pencil. You needed to fix this before Kim realized something was going on! At the same time, you\u2019d had fun last nice and you had to admit you enjoyed how interested Kim had been in your dick. Shrugging, you erased the change from the previous night and instead wrote in:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kim and Simon: I\u2019ve always had a foot long dick, Kim just hasn\u2019t noticed until now. Now that she knows what I\u2019m packing, she just keeps thinking about it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later Kim stepped out of the bathroom. You watched with a smile as her eyes darted down to your crotch, hesitating just a second too long to go unnoticed, before looking away with a blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot any plans today, Kim?\u201d You leaned back, subtly spreading your legs to draw her eye again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, I dunno,\u201d she stammered, trying to avoid staring but her eyes kept going back. \u201cI, uh, usually work out on Saturday mornings. I guess I\u2019ll, uh, go for a jog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim went back into her room to change, leaving you alone with the book to figure out your day.</span></div></div>",

Eventually Kim stepped out of her room dressed in her work out gear: a sports bra, shorts, and sneakers. She certainly had the body to pull off the look and you had to resist whistling at her. Instead you settled for not so subtly adjusting your erection, a movement that Kim didn\u2019t miss. Kim went to the sink to fill up her water bottle. An idea came to mind and you excitedly started writing: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kim never made a habit of working out back in highschool and never joined sports. Instead, she spent her time hanging out with her best friend Patricia. Very rarely Kim still works out but only a small exercise here in the apartment.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut the book and squeezed your eyes shut as wave of dizziness washed over you. It lasted only a second but was a new experience, something you had felt while using the book yet. You looked up at Kim expectantly, knowing what you hoped to see and not being disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim looked entirely different! Gone was the slender, fit bombshell you grown accustomed to. Instead, it looked like Kim had gained nearly thirty pounds! Her entire body was softer, pudgier and thicker looking, but the majority of her new weight settled in a round pot belly. Her round belly was fully exposed in her workout girl and it jiggled lightly as she stepped into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, I don\u2019t really wanna do this but I need to,\u201d Kim whined as she lowered herself onto her knees and elbows. Slowly she started to move, lifting her leg parallel to the ground. It was a simple routine but Kim quickly started to breathe a little hard, her face flush and sweat glistening on her body. Occasionally she glanced at you as you watched her, her face reddening further upon noticing your erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a987b07f90d130e9ea6b634611678eca/tumblr_phdl6tyV1U1stjw3v_540.gif\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/a987b07f90d1...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazed, you realized that by applying a delusion to Kim\u2019s past you had changed her future. Previously Kim had actively worked out since freshman year of highschool and had been the star athlete of several sports. With your delusion, she not only did none of that but also spent more time Patricia, a rather chubby girl herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was everything you hoped it would be! Forcing yourself to look away from the plump girl, you wrote in the book:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When she started high school, Kim\u2026.</i></span></div></div>",

Both girls looked at you expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were never really good at this game. You always froze up, not to sure what to do or ask. So you sat there for a few moments thinking of something that wasn\u2019t too weird or invasive. Unknown to you, the game had an idea of what direction it wanted this game to go already and would begin influencing the three of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up, Simon,\u201d Patricia whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive him a moment,\u201d Kim defended you, but you could tell she was a little anxious waiting for your response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ok,\u201d you sighed, not really able to come up with anything better. \u201cKim, how comfortable are you with your body right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regretted the question almost immediately. The girls both looked at you like it was the worst question you could\u2019ve asked but Kim didn\u2019t hesitate to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Kim said a little quietly, rubbing her bicep. \u201cI\u2019m ok with it, but there are a lot of things I\u2019d like to change about it. So I guess I\u2019m not that comfortable with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Patricia looked at Kim surprised. Sure she was supposed to tell the truth but you hadn\u2019t actually expected her to tell it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, what do you want to change?\u201d Patricia asked, wanting to know more. Kim blinked a few times, as of coming out of trance, before shaking her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how the game works Trish,\u201d she laughed nervously, obviously a little embarrassed by her answer. \u201cSimon, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was and you weren\u2019t really looking forward to it. Especially with Patricia being after you. You two were mostly friends and got along most of the time but you knew she\u2019d ask invasive questions and make you do odd dares. But you drew your card anyways and it was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead, it routed around your heads looking for just the right thing. The question bubbled in your head and you smiled at the thought even though it wasn\u2019t really yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim, tell me,\u201d you began. \u201cWhat is your deepest, most secret sexual fantasy you have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon,\u201d Kim hissed, eyes wide. She obviously wasn\u2019t expecting you to follow through with her request. You thought she was going to be upset with you, maybe even leave, but her whole attitude suddenly changed. She crossed her arms, hugging herself, and bit her lip, blushing a little. \u201cWell, truth is, I\u2019ve always been kind of interested in being like a bimbo. You know, dumb and horny, really curvy and dressed all slutty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Patricia, Kim\u2019s eyes went wide and she covered her mouth in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did I say that?\u201d she asked, shocked with her own words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Kim,\u201d Patricia stared in shock. \u201cIs that true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it is!

Patricia sat in silence, lost in thought, for a few moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Simon, but I think it\u2019s your turn to be the embarrassed one,\u201d she said with a sheepish smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s, uh, fair, I guess,\u201d you said with a weak laugh, not liking the idea while at the same time curious as to what she\u2019d have you do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon, I want you to be like a girl. Like, wearing girl clothes and makeup and everything,\u201d Patricia stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Kim looked at Patricia shocked and a little confused. That sure was a weird dare and, even if you complied, whose clothes would you wear? Kim was too skinny and Patricia was too short for any of their clothes to fit. Plus, why did she phrase it like that? \u2018Be like a girl\u2019? Why didn\u2019t she just say dress or act? Before you could voice your confusion and concerns, a strange feeling rushed over you. The girls both looked at you in shock, their mouths hanging open. Confused, you looked down at yourself and gasped at what was happening to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was changing. Your legs were shrinking, becoming shorter and your feet smaller and more delicate looking. Your leg hair vanished and your skin got softer. Your thighs became thicker starting to touch. You watched your boxers shift and change, transforming from black boxer to a pair of black panties as you watched in silent horror as your bulge shrank away to nothing. Your hips grew wider and your butt expanded beneath, forcing you higher in the air. Once you reached your highest point and your butt quite growing, you felt your vision lower again, this time because your torso was shrinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shirt, a normal baggy blue t-shirt, shrank and began to cling to your torso. The sleeves got a little short and the neck line deepened to show off more of your chest. You watched as your mostly flat stomach swelled outward, inflating like balloon until you had an obviously pudge belly. You watched in mute horror and mild amazement as your chest began to swell outward, growing into two fat orbs that were far too obviously breasts. They grew bigger and bigger, bigger than Kim\u2019s and even bigger than Patricia\u2019s before stopping. You noticed how your nipples were larger too, pushing erect against the thin fabric of your shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched your arms become shorter, softening a little bit. Your hands got smaller, more feminine and petite. You couldn\u2019t see it, but you felt your face shift, readjusting. Finally, you felt your hair, normally rather short, growing longer to just past your shoulders, curly and dark brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of the change subsided and you stared down at your body in mixed horror and curiosity. You looked up at the girls, both staring at you wide eyed and mouths hanging open. Without saying a word, you stood up awkward and walked to your room internally adjusting how you walked to account for this change. You heard Kim and Patricia follow you but you didn\u2019t pay too much attention to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror you greeted by someone else. Instead of your normal tall and slightly athletic male self, you were greeted by a short, curvy, and slightly chubby girl. Your eyes seemed bigger, prettier. You had long eyelashes and thin eyebrows. Your nose was smaller and upturned, kind of button like. Your cheeks were a little rounder and your lip were soft and plush looking. While you felt huge, you weren\u2019t really that big. Just a little chubby around the middle. You were, however, rather busty and the size of your hips and rear compliments your large breasts enough to give you a definitive hourglass shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help yourself. You ran your small hands through your soft, long hair. You touched your softer face, noting the eyeliner and eyeshadow and lipstick that was lightly applied. You cupped your breasts, getting to know their size, bouncing them a little. You could feel yourself blushing in response, truly enjoying touching them. Your rubbed your pudgy belly and poked it a little. you ran your hands across your hips and you soft, smooth thick thighs. You turned you get a look at your butt, cupping the cheeks and giving it a playful slap. It\u2019d pretty big, you thought blushing more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered your hands and turned to the girls. They stared at you in awe, both blushing after watching you explore and play with your new body. This made your face get even redder. You noticed a little surprisingly that both girls were taller than you now, even Patricia who was really short. That meant you weren\u2019t even 5\u20192\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a girl,\u201d you announced. You weren\u2019t shocked by your new voice. It sounded soft and sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Simon,\u201d Patricia said, putting her hands on your shoulders. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t know this would happen! It didn\u2019t even feel like I was making the choice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s ok Patricia,\u201d you reassured her with a genuine smile. \u201cI think I know what you mean. I hadn\u2019t felt in control when you dared me to take my pants off and I didn\u2019t really mean to ask such and invasive question, Kim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t either, Trish,\u201d Kim nodded, agreeing with what you were saying. \u201cIt was like something was influencing me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething like the game,\u201d you said before storming past them, trying to ignore the way your new breasts bobbed every which way. You grabbed the directions and read them allowed fully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cA more magical game of truth or dare. The player whose turn it is will draw a card, either truth or dare. The player to the left of them will then either ask them a Truth or give them a Dare. The magic is that it will happen no matter what; you must tell the truth and you must do the dare. Once done, place the card in the discard pile. Then it\u2019s the turn of the player who asked turn. The cards are mostly Truth or Dare options but there are more unique cards for groups, changing the order, and such. The game will end when all cards a have been played. Disclaimer: truths will force you to answer completely and honestly. Dares can make you perform any action and change you physically, mentally, or both. Changes made by dare cards are permanent and can only be changed by other dare cards. The cards will influence players, encouraging mischievousness and perversion. Have fun and let out your inner desires!\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Kim said quietly after a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the game is going to, like, make us keep changing ourselves?\u201d Patricia asked, a little concerned. \u201cMaking us more and more pervy and stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much,\u201d you said with a sigh. \u201cAnd I\u2019m stuck like this until one of you two dares me to be a guy again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be too hard, right?\u201d Patricia asked. She was obviously regretting the dare she\u2019d give you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you said with a weak smile. \u201cIf the game wants us to be mischievous perverts, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just going to let one of you change me back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good point,\u201d Kim said, crossing her arms. \u201cWait, does that mean you can\u2019t wear pants ever again until we dare you to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you said, looking down at your bare legs. \u201cPatricia said I have to go the rest of the game pants-less so I should be able to put them back on after. In theory, I guess I could still wear things like skirts and dresses. Maybe shorts? They\u2019re not specifically pants, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Kim said nervous about the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we should get back to the game,\u201d you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Kim asked. \u201cDo we really want to keep playing and risk changing ourselves more? What if we\u2019re not able to change you back and we just get changed more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can help it,\u201d Patricia said softly. \u201cI want to play.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d you said quietly. \u201cI can feel the game trying to pull us back. I assume the pull will only get worse the longer we\u2019re away so we need to finish the game before anything else. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d Kim sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you went back to the game. You could feel the others giving you looks, eyeing up your new body and curves. It was weird. You kind of liked the attention and you couldn\u2019t tell if that was you or the game thinking that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, my turn I guess,\u201d Patricia said, drawing a card.

The three looked at each other as Patricia read the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, something new,\" she said, not sure if she should be thankful or not, \"'Challenge! Hot Dog Eating Contest. The player who eats the least wins and responds to the loser's draw. The loser must bear the winnings of the other two.''\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, eats the least?\" you said. \"That's not the way eating contests work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew,\" the health-conscious Kim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently a large plate stacked high with hot dogs, buns, mustard, ketchup and all. There must have been thirty each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\" Patricia blurted out. You felt it as much as they did, the sudden, ravenous hunger, your arms losing control as they reached for the food in front of her, your mouth opening and closing rapidly, almost too fast to even swallow. You didn't even have time to think. Before you knew it, you had eaten one, two, three hot dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a boy you had the regular appetite of any young man your age in decent shape, so three or four hot dogs might be stretching it but wasn't outrageous. However, with your smaller-albeit pudgy-stomach you found that you were full much quicker than you were used to. Especially considering how quickly you were eating. By the fifth you were definitely at your limit. By the sixth, seventh, eight you were becoming painfully stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't stop. You did start slowing down, though, as the thought occurred to you that you were, in fact, quite hungry, and that food would ease that hunger. That realization slowed your arms and mouth, which were actually tired from the exertion. In less than three minutes you had eaten almost a dozen good sized dogs. Your stomach felt tight and full. The feeling was a little exciting once you actually slowed down enough to notice it. You had imagined so many slim women, like Kim, or even kind of plump women like you had become, getting full, gaining weight, that for you to be on the other end of that fantasy was at least mildly exciting. You imagined your shirt must feel a little tighter but couldn't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the hunger vanished, replaced by a very stuffed, but not entirely unpleasant, sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twelve-uurp!\" you said, leaning back and rubbing your stomach. \"I guess it was a test to see who could realize they weren't hungry anymore first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised to see that Patricia had already finished. It looked like she had only eaten six, beating you by far. It made sense when you thought about it. Patricia had always been a short, plump girl used to eating as often as she liked. She wasn't proud of it, but she often ate just when she was bored, even when she wasn't hungry at all, and so was quick to recognize that despite the game's making them think they were uncontrollably ravenous it was just an illusion. She didn't even look full, not that it would be noticeable on her soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, Kim-\" you said, and Patricia stopped looking pleased with herself as they both turned to Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muumphooroorp!\" Kim yelled between bites as she crammed dog after dog down her throat. The plate was half empty, maybe more, meaning she had already eaten almost twenty hot dogs and was quickly going for more. She was going slowly than they had been at the start but still wasn't stopping. Beads of sweat appeared on her forehead, a look of concern bordering on fear on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim only ever ate when she was hungry, and mostly healthy foods. This insane hunger was something new to her that she hadn't figured out yet. You were about to tell her the trick was to just accept that she wasn't hungry but you couldn't think how to phrase the abstract realization that let you stop eating. And there was another thing-your eyes were now glued to Kim's flat, toned stomach. It looked full, even through her t-shirt, like a little pillow had been put under her shirt and jeans. You were certain that if you still had your male attributes your arousal would be very obvious. You rubbed your own stomach, imagining how tight and full Kim's must be getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim, just let go and stop accept that you had enough,\" Patricia said, breaking your revelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Kim did stop, or rather, she ran out of hot dogs. The whole plate, all thirty, was done. She leaned back on one hand and rubbed her poor stomach with the other. She looked exhausted and was breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh--uuuurp!\" she couldn't get a word out right away, \"Oh Jesus, do I look as full as I feel?\" she looked down and her eyes popped open, \"Damn!\" she rubbed her stomach, which curved out slightly against her shirt and her tightened jeans. She tugged it down, although it hadn't quit ridden up yet. She blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I lost-oof!\" she said as if the full feeling hit her again, \"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I ate six, and Simon ate twelve, so I won!\" Patricia said with an odd glee, \"Er, sorry, Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Kim yelped as both you and Patricia felt a quick, sucking sensation in your stomachs and Kim's surged forward a good two inches, popping her jeans and revealing a little of her tight, rounded tummy. She leaned back, rubbing her bloated middle and blushing bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The loser must bear the winnings,\" you said, blushing almost as brightly as Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged her shirt down and looked angrily at you and Patricia. She seemed to be handling being stuffed to the brink less well than you did your gender change, which you found immensely amusing. You also couldn't take your eyes off her stomach. Only in your wildest dreams did you imagine Kim so full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop staring at me, you two. This is really uncomfortable,\" Kim huffed as she drew a card.</span></div></div>",

An evil grin spread across her face, a strange expression you had thought as likely to see on your friend as that stuffed tummy on Kim, \"Kim, for the rest of the game, I dare you to be a bimbo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" Kim said, blushing yet brighter still, an annoyed look giving way to something you thought looked like excitement, \"I don't know about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed both hands on her stomach and moaned softly. You were disappointed to see it flatten again, returning to its usual toned shape. Kim squealed with a slightly higher pitch to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good, that's much better! My tummy's flat again,\" she said, then giggled, a dull look coming over her face. She placed a hand on the side of her head. Her hair looked thicker, longer suddenly, \"Uh, I feel kind of, like, different, guys . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly arched her back and moaned, but this time with pleasure, and cupped her firm, decent-sized breasts in her hands. They swelled into her hands like two balloons filling with water, but looked as firm as ever. Imperceptibly her clingy t-shirt shifted, the sleeves shrinking into a spaghetti strap top, the bottom tightening her trim waist and moving up just above her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, her voice higher yet again, \"Like, my tits-I mean, my boobs, er, my breasts are getting so, so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big?\" you hazarded a guess, mesmerized by the changes your friend was undergoing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right, bigger!\" Kim said, her vacant eyes growing bigger, becoming a hazy shade of blue. Her breasts had nearly doubled in size. Her hips spread out, too, but with firm muscle, not fat. As Kim shifted on the floor she wiggled with pleasure, giving into the sensations the changes brought throughout her body. Her ass, you saw, had gotten much rounder. She posed on the floor, running her hands along her new hourglass shape. Her jeans transformed, growing tighter and riding lower on her hips, revealing a bright pink thong as she briefly turned around like she was trying to give you two a view of her new behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh guys, I am soooo hot!\" she said, turning around with her lips plumper, and her face subtly softer, than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were transfixed by the changes in Kim, Patricia was positively hypnotized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Kim,\" she said, \"You really have to see yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was way ahead of her. She had gotten up and, with an exaggerated sexy walk, was now posing and gaping at herself in a mirror across the room. She walked with an unnatural arch to her back, emphasizing her already massive breasts even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked back to sit down, she was rubbing her head, her brow furrowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh guys, like, am I next? I can't remember, I think, like, my tits are making me, um, dumber or something?\" she looked genuinely confused. You started to feel bad for finding her so attractive right now. You couldn't tell if Patricia was feeling the same. She perked up as she plopped down, \"But my stomach's flat again so that's good!\" She giggled, looking dully from you to Patricia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It goes back to Simon drawing and you asking or daring,\" Patricia said. She shook he head, getting her mind back in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim giggled, \"Trishy, you think I'm hot now, I know you do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia blushed, \"Well, I kind of already said that before when you made me tell the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim just giggled and looked at Patricia with what you could only describe as hopeful concern. You slowly drew a card, finding it hard to look away from the new Kim.</span></div></div>",

She sounded concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well up until this point the three of us have been resisting the games temptations,\" you explained. \"But Kim no longer seems to be in the 'resisting perverted ideas' mood anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. That's my bad,\" Patricia answered quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both turn and stare at Kim. The new bimbo Kim just sat there groping herself. Her eyes were shut, her lips in the shape of a small \"o\", and moaning quietly while she groped herself, one hand on one her large firm tits and the other twitching between her thick thighs. You hadn't noticed earlier but along with her body, mind, and clothes transforming make up had been magically applied to her face. Thick black eye shadow surrounded her eyes, her eyeliner and mascara masterfully applied, and hot pink lipstick coating her fattened lips. It was expertly (i.e.  magically) applied and managed to look both nice and trashy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kim?\" Patricia said, clearing her throat. Kim looked up, eyes opening halfway. She looked dazed and confused. Her hands didn't stop their groping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, yeah, Patty?\" Kim smiled dumbly at her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh, your turn,\" Patricia told her, obviously flustered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Thanks!' Kim let go of her breast and reached for the cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you and Patricia yelled. Kim paused, her hand inches from the deck. She pursed her thick lips and raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What she meant,\" you explained slowly. \"is that it was your turn to choose a dare. I drew a care on my turn, a dare, and now you get to choose the dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhhhhh,\" Kim said, sitting up and pushing out her chest. You gulped watching it bounce enticingly. \"So, like, I get to choose what you do now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you said, the concern building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like when Patty took your pants and, like, turned you into a girl and me into, like, a totally hot bimbo?\" Kim asked, rather concisely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Patricia stuttered, concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Kim clapped happily. \"What oh what do I, like, want you to do? I could make you a hot guy! That'd be nice, you'd have a cock and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perked up almost instantly. You didn't know it'd be this easy to get back to yourself. It'd probably be better based on Kim's new more superficial tastes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're already so cute,\" Kim continued. Your heart sank. \"And I do like girls more than boys. But I really really really like cock...I got it! Simon I, like, dare you to have a a nice big cock!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou definitely didn't see that coming. You didn't really no what to expect from that but, thankfully, you didn't have to wait very long. Almost instantly you felt a warm pressure in your crotch, just above your new vagina. Looking down, the three of you watched as a bump form in your underwear and quickly grew larger. Every detail was visible in your tight pink panties that you were now wearing. Your new penis grew inch by inch and quickly passed your previous modest size. As it reach eight inches, it could no longer fit in your tight panties and you were forced to pull them down and let it own and still it kept growing. Finally, at just over a foot in length and thick enough around that you could barely wrap your tiny hands around it, it stopped growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh my god,\" Patricia began to panic. Her face was red and things were obviously starting to overwhelm her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfect!\" Kim exclaimed as she began to crawl on all fours towards you. You tried to scoot away but were unsuccessful. Kim was soon in your space. Looking up at her face, you could practically see the hearts in her big dumb eyes. She licked her lips and wrapped a hand around it. You yelped in surprise. Her hands were warm and strong. You had been worried about her long manicured nails but she expertly began to move her hand along your shaft without scratching you. You were going to stop her but it felt so good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Kim\" you whimpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it?\" Kim purred. All you could do was gasp in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Simon,\" Patricia said quietly. Her hand was rubbing her crotch, almost reluctantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Patricia, quick,\" you panted. \"Draw a card. We might be able to do something about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-ok,\" she panted, starting to get into what she was watching. Patricia drew a card. What did she draw?</span></div></div>",

She grinned a wide, adorable smile. \"You're gonna, like, love this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned over and wrapped her large breasts around your cock. She pressed them together and, slowly at first but building up speed, began to work them up and down it. You moaned at the sensation, eyes rolling in your head. Involuntarily you began to buck your hips, thrusting into her cleavage. You were losing control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, yes,\" Kim purred. \"Its so much better when you're into it, baby. I've got a treat for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she talked was enough to get into it but you watched as she lowered her head and wrapped her fat, cock-sucking lips around your cock while still letting you tit-fuck her. She bobbed her head, working her tongue expertly and bouncing her tits up and down your cock and you lost all control. You began to squeeze one of your own sizable breasts, pinching and tweaking your swollen nipple. You other hand awkwardly worked its way between your thighs and under Kim's breast. You began to finger your new vagina, your body writing at the multiple simulations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Simon,\" you heard Patricia moan. You forced yourself to slow down, a disappointed groan coming from Kim, and looked over at Patricia. Her face was red and she was panting. She had one hand in her pants, masturbating furiously now, and the other held a card. \"P-please, Simon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what card i-is it?\" you struggled to stay focused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dare, Simon,\" she moaned. \"P-please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what she wanted you to do. She probably wanted you to try and make it better but you had no idea how to do that at this point. You weren't sure if you could or if you even wanted to. Sure a part of you, the small part that was sane, wanted you to do whatever you could to make things right. On the other hand, you were living a literal fantasy of your. You were a chubby girl with dick and a super bimbo Kim was tit-fucking and blowing you. The only thing that could make this better would be if Kim was fatter or if Patricia joined in. Since it wasn't her turn you couldn't do anything to Kim but you could make Patrica join in. You could make a her a bimbo too, hopefully without losing that chub, or even make her fatter too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, you couldn't feel the game's influence over you. These were 100% your own thoughts. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

Kim had slowed down, a slightly annoyed look in her big, dumb eyes as she looked up at you with her lips wrapped around your cock. Looking at Kim, and looking at Patrica, you collected your thoughts enough to know that Patrica either wanted things to be moved back towards normal, or that she wanted you to get her in on this bimbo Kim action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, you remembered, Patricia had admitted a huge crush on Kim. That she was masturbating with abandon, staring desperately at you and Kim, seemed to confirm that. But, try as you might, when the words came you couldn't just give her a simple, \"I date you to come over here and join in.\" No. You had to put your own spin on it, whether or not Patricia wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patricia,\" you said, panting as Kim's lips moved up and down your cock, her giant breasts squeezing it simultaneously until it felt like it would burst forth any second, \"For the rest . . . of the game . . . I dare you to be a fat-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat?!\" Patricia blurted out. She stopped masturbating and grabbed her round stomach defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-a fat, horny, dumb bimbo like Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Siiiiiimon!\" Patricia said in desperation. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach, already round and soft as it was on her short frame, bulged out gently into her hands. Her sweat pants began shortening as her t-shirt, itself changing, rode up. Her thighs thickened as her short, plump legs grew as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, like, already fat, Simon!\" Patricia pleaded, her voice an octave higher. Her pretty, soft face took on a confused expression. \"Like, why do you want me, like, fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're beautiful,\" you stammered, which was the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia's worried look instantly changed to to a wide smile as a giggle burst from her. She held her head in her hands. Her stomach had grown into a full, flabby potbelly complete with widening hips and lovehandles. Her breasts, you were glad to see, had started to grow as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh no,\" Patricia said, the intelligence leaving her face, her lips plumping up, reddening, a dull smile spreading. \"Like, I must look like, a total cow,\" she said, then giggled. You thought that while Kim had a secret bimbo fantasy, Patricia did not, and this might be harder for her to accept. But she had to. Those were the rules after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sweatpants had turned into shorts, then as her ass lifted her up and her thighs thickened even more, morphed into an unseemly tight miniskirt. Her full flabby belly was on full display as her t-shirt receded on top and bottom, turning into a tube top that barely contained her mammoth breasts and still growing midsection. Thick makeup like Kim's formed on her face, which it self had gained a more dominant double chin that her former soft face only slightly had. Her blonde hair grew even lighter, longer, and thicker. She was giggling every few seconds even as bursts of worry and annoyance kept flashing on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon!\" she said again, her voice airy and dull, like Kim's, nothing like the Patricia either of them knew. Her breathing was shallow, her head tilted dully as she looked around. She had been at 180 before. She was now well over 200, and it showed on her short frame. She held her belly in her hands, wiggling slowly as she looked at Kim. You saw that look before. You must have looked at Kim the same way. \"Uh, Kimmy, you, like, um, look really hot . . .\" she said, easily distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim giggled but did not look entirely pleased. She looked back at you, still smiling and slowly moving herself up and down your massive cock. \"Simon, you jerk. Patty was, like, already fat and you had to make her even fatter?\" Of course, you realized. Even as a bimbo Kim was still somewhat of a health nut. Nevertheless, you saw how she looked at Patricia. She might not like that she was fatter but it didn't do anything to lessen the instant attraction such a horny Kim would have for another willing partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm like, still hot, too, right?\" Patricia asked. She stood up, running her hands up and down her fat belly. Kim giggled. A sly look came over her. She giggled and nodded. Patricia, wobbling a little, took the few steps toward you and Kim. You could hardly speak for the excitement. She pressed herself on Kim, who looked surprised and then excited, her hand found its way between Kim's legs, met your hand, and then began fondling your vagina for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah,\" was all you could get out. Kim squirmed with pleasure, not at all adverse to having the short, nearly obese Patricia forcing her belly into her own trim back. Patricia, looking just as mindlessly horn as Kim, reached her head down and bit Kim softly on the neck. Kim's whole body shook, which caused your whole body to shake. Things were moving in a strange, horribly fantastic direction and you only that that game still had to go on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Get ready to lose ladies\" you day as you take your roll. You get a 4 and move your piece that many spaces landing on a <i>Change</i> card.   You take a card from the top of the deck and read it aloud, \"Minor change face. \"ha what the hell?\". Almost as the word leaves you lips you feel a jolt run through your face, instantly subtly changes occur. Your bone structure changes almost imperishably, your jawline softens becoming more rounded, your checks raise up, lips plumped and your skin is smoother and the facial hair disappears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auch, my face... feel numb. Kim does my face look ok to you?\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans closer to you squinting, \"Yeah I think, Well, maybe a little swollen. Ha kind of makes you look more feminine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt unimpressed by the last part of her comment and continue to rub your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, it's my turn!\" Kim says as she grabs the dice and rolls a 6, a <i>Change</i> card, Minor change body. Kim felt a surge pass through her body, as it does her muscle tighten and grow slightly giving her an endorphin rush. With Simon still rubbing his face and Kim distracted by the pleasant feeling washing over her body, Patricia decides to take her turn despite the other two being distracted. She rolls a 2 Change card Minor change hair, in an instant her hair goes for a brunette to a platinum blond which she fails to notice until Kim points it out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap Patty your hair it blond!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about Kim my hair has been blond for years. You only noticed now?\" Patricia replies half laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it really blond. Like bimbo blond\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia takes a lock of her hair seeing for herself the change, \"What the hell, how did this happen? Was it the game?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon chimes in \"The game! How would the game do that? No there's an obvious explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Patricia asked a tinge of nervousness in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I know, it's your hair\" he replies \"Maybe you use to much dye or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodes conceding it is possible but is still uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look over at the two girl node and roll your eye and say \"Tsk. It's just a game.\". You pull a card from the desk and read it aloud <i>Minor Change: body</i>. Once again the second you finish reading you feel the same electricity as before but this time through your entire body followed by a warm fuzzy feeling. You turn to the girls who are looking at you expectantly. You say to them, \"See nothing, no third arm\". But what none of you noticed was the slight change happening under your baggie sweatshirt and track pants. Without you noticing your body hair lessening and lighting to the point of disappearing. The changes continue with your hips wide ever so slightly as well as your shoulders narrow. Your muscle shrink in size losing some of there tone. The biggest change is to your manhood, it shrinks by an inch with your ball losing some size too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls look at you a moment longer trying to discern if there was a change in you, something they would have seen if your body wasn't shielded by baggy clothing. They would have in fact seen how your body now looked more like that of a young teen boy. Kim picked up the die shrugging and said: \"Oh OK I guess your right, I think we just overreacted\". She rolls a 6, <i>Change</i> card Mental - winner mindset. As she reads it wondering what does it mean she feels a sudden rush of blood to her head. Her vision swims for a moment making her put her head in her hands. \"Kim are you OK?\" Patricia asks concerned. Kim shakes her head regaining her composure, \"Yeah I'm great. Never better Patty. Why!\" she says as she gives Patricia a pointed look. Patricia was taken back a little by the response, it was more forceful then the timid Kim usual was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia shrugs it off think the night has been a little weird and takes her turn rolling a 5 landing on a challenge card - stand on one leg for 5 minutes. She laughs saying \"Well here I go\", she manages to complete the challenge with some near falls. You say to her \"Wow Patty I'm impressed that looked hard\", She smiles at you a little flustered \"Yeah it's actually a lot harder then you'd think. But I've got them mad skills\" saying with a winking. Kim grunts \"You got lucky\" Both Patricia and you shot an odd look at Kim for her complete un-Kim like behavior.</span></div></div>",

You just smile and give her the middle finger then pick up the die and roll. \"One, Damn at this rate I'm going to lose\" You shake your head and move your piece up one landing on a Change square. You pull one of the change cards from the deck and read it <i>Major Change: Mental</i>. Your mind goes blank and eyes are vacant as your head lolls to the side. You are in a trace for a moment. After a pause you snap out of it, neither girl seems to have noticed and you play it off in your to yourself as just being tired and bored of the stupid game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim rolls a 5, \"Now that's what I'm talking about five Boom\" she moves her piece 5 places and lands on a Challenge square. Kim pulls a card <i>Challenge- Do 10 push up </i>. Kim smiles and says \"No problem\" Patricia looks at her, \"When had you ever don a push up in your life?\" Kim ignores her flipping over to face the ground getting into a push-up position and starts. She puts her newfound muscles to use, the first few are easy until she gets to 6 and starts to struggle. \"8 ooh god, 9,\" she says visibly shaking. \"Only one more Kim\" Patricia cheers her on. Sweating and shaking Kim manages to push herself one more time to complete the challenge. Out of breath, sweating and red-faced, she looks at Patricia than you and says \"See, piece of cake\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile \"Yeah it looks like it was a piece of cake alright Kim\" As you do so you suddenly think <i>Hmm a piece of cake would be great stuff into my fat face </i> your mouth waters.  You are shocked not just by the thought but also by its intensity. Freezing you think <i>what fuck'n hell was that?</i>. Immediately you think of the secret that you have been keeping all of your adult life a think you have hidden from your friend. You are a feeder but the thought that just ran through mind was more like something you heard Feedee's say. You don't know what to make of it, do you actually like the idea of being a Feedee? You dismiss the idea as stupid, you had never had a thought like that before felt like that, well not before today. While all these conflicting ideas race in your head Patricia takes her turn. If you were paying attention you might have noticed that her bust grown two sizes while her waist shrank. </span></div></div>",

Something weird was happening here, It was like you enjoyed the idea in the same way you felt about being a Feeder. Just thinking about the idea of being a Feedee again sent a tingle of excitement down you spin, it was even more so because it was so wrong. \"Hey Simon, it's your turn!\" Kim said. You snap out of your introspection pushing the wrongness of your thoughts aside pick up the die and rolling. 2, you curse under your breath and move you piece two more spaces to a Change square and pick up a card reading it <i>Complete a change</i>. You look at the card confused repeating the words again \"Complete a change\" you look at the girls \"What do you think that means?\" The girls shrug. At that moment you feel a jolt hit your body doubling you over in pain, the electricity subsides but is followed by an all over burning. You can feel your body shifting hearing you bone pop and creak as they reform. As they do so you start shrinking in size, the girls watch you as you transform before their eyes frozen in shock by the spectacle unfolding before them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKim thought with a little glee that you\u2019re definitely not 6\" 1' anymore but the time you stopped shrinking she guess you had to be even shorter they even Patricia who was at 5\" 4', you found out later you at in fact 5\" 2. The change continues this time focusing on your genitals, you feel a pressure on your shaft and balls, it wasn't painful per say more like someone was compressing them smaller and small. As your ball\u2019s shrank you felt a pop as one slid into your body and another pop. As they do so your stomach starts to feel weird as if something is moving inside you. If you were able to see inside your body, you would have seen a full-functioning set of female sex organs develop. Your penis shrinks and slides up into you forming a new pair of lips making your new vagina. As this happens you let out a sigh of pleasure and relief glad the pressure was gone. As one change finishes yet another starts both your face and chest this time. Your chest starts to grow swelling adding new layers fat, you investigate inside your sweat-shirt seeing your chest swell and your nipples double then triple size. Your chest grows to a B and then a C cup finally stopping at a pair of DD's that heavy hung down from your body. As this happened the girls observe your face, it narrowed shifting your cheek bone, so they are higher and your eyes seemed to become bigger. Your lips became plumper and your skin smoothen making your face look overall delicate and very pretty. Finally, your hip and ass start to expand, your hips fanning out to a modest size while your ass became more padded nicely filling out you track pants with a shapely booty.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs you regain control you look down at your hands, they look alien to you so tiny and delicate compared to what you were used to. You shift yourself from being on all four to a kneeling position. As you do so your new mounds on your chest shift with you snapping into your body causing you to wince in pain as they are more sensitive then you are used to. As you stand your feet slip out of your shoe which make you stumble, you look down but your view is obstructed by the new mound in front of you. You just about see your toe over them, they look small and dainty like your hands. The shock wears off you are confronted by the reality of your situation causing you to faint...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's kind of like that, except with inflation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" pipped in Kim. \"Can't you ever pick a more normal game, Pat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut it. This is a cool game. Watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPat opened the box and produced a small plastic jar with dozens of marble-like pills inside. The only thing else inside with the instruction booklet, which you grabbed and read aloud while Pat unscrewed the cap of the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agar.inflation is a game about getting as big as you can,\" you began. \"Upon swallowing a pill, the game will begin. Each player will have twenty four hours to get as large as they can. What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" said Pat as you took three pills and handed one to Kim before offering you one. \"Want to join in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks...I don't take weird pills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself. Bottoms up, Kim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls swallowed the red drug at the same time as Pat set a timer on her cellphone for twenty four hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, keep reading, Simon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Players get larger by deflating other people. Each person is made up of an essence of 'air.' Players who swallow the pills can drain any person of their air and take it for themselves, leaving the victim as a deflated pile of skin. Okay, this is weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it?\" Pat smiled before pouncing on you. You could do nothing to react as she clamped down on your lips with her own mouth, forming what felt like a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to push her off of you, but began to feel very weak. Pat was sucking out the air in your lungs, though you could still breath somehow. When you finally pushed her off you, she was at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!?\" you shouted, realizing your clothes were now very loose on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Kim had been watching everything unfold from the sidelines. \"We're all the same height now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSh was correct. While normally 5'10, you now stood at Kim's exact height of 5'6. In addition, Pat had taken your height for herself making her appear even larger before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I had to make it even, right?\" said Pat. \"You can do it too, Kim. Though you can't steal from me unless you're bigger than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you say? Let the games begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now very curious to see how this game could end and if it was telling the truth about draining someone completely of their air.

You practically fell on your knees at the sight of the device. Being an engineer, you would have pissed yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bought a fucking 3D printer! Dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave the taller Ted a high five. He smacked your palm hard, and you could feel it sting.

You and me both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" you asked, looking over the printer and blinking several times to make sure it was real. \"These things cost thousands of dollars! And you working as a pizza guy isn't going to cover it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll admit, it wasn't cheap. But I found it for two hundred bucks at that weird pawn shop in downtown.

Jesus, man, do you think it will work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so, or I'm going to be getting my fucking money back,\" he said as he strutted over to the machine and pressed a few buttons. \"Now, how the hell do you work this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? You call yourself an engineer. Out of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoved the muscle head to the side to the side. While you had never seen a 3D printer up close before, you could tell that there was something strange about this machine. For starters, there were no USB ports to plug in a computer or other external devices. There were a handful of button, two big ones being Scan and Cancel. The others looked like a standard keyboard. There was also a large tray that could only be described as a copy machine and a monitor for displaying the to-be-printed 3D object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Uh...,\" you shrugged. \"Have you tried turning it off and on, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real fucking funny, wise guy. It looks like there's some sort of scanner on this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...We have to, uh, scan something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could literally feel yourself losing IQ by talking with Ted. You glanced around Ted's room for what little there was around. \"Do you have like a paper or something we could test this thing with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hang on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed waddled to a nearby table and grabbed a picture frame of you and Ted, as well as three girls. You were all at the freshman fair at the start of college, just hanging out and enjoying the carnival. You recognized them at a glance. Kim, your roommate, Pat, her bestie, and Lisa, your boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder how this will work,\" Ted placed the paper down and hit the green Scan button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine hummed to life as a light scanned the photograph. There was some worrisome beeping as an image came up on the screen of the attached monitor. You squinted and saw a 3D image of a human body slowly being formed with wire frames. The shape was distinctively female, but you couldn't quite tell who it was. As more details appeared on the body, you quickly realized that it was a 3D model of...</span></div></div>",

She was a short, chubby girl who had a pear shape going on with her body. She was also a bit of a ditz, though she was kind enough around you and meant well. The two of them bartended together when they weren't hanging around your dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her image had been crafted on the monitor, a new message flashed up on the screen. PRINTING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe printer whirled and rumbled violently, making you both think it was about to explode. Bright green lights flashed around the room as the machine started to work overtime. You backed away from the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after a few short minutes, everything was silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed risked creeping over first, wanting to make sure nothing had been damaged in his apartment. The printer appeared to be smoking as he stepped up to the keyword. He then looked over along the side, where there was a large output tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked, expecting the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dug around the container and held up a pale, smoking object. At first glance, you thought it was a cheesy Halloween costume. But as you focused on the details of the mass of fake flesh, you realized that there was a blonde wig attached to it. Suddenly, you recognized the facial features portrayed on the mask part of the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! It's Patricia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" replied Ted. \"This is thing is exactly her size and dimensions too, from the looks of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" you raised an eyebrow, glancing over to the resting printer. \"All we did was give it a 2D photograph as a source. How could it properly determine size and width through that information?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, dude. But it's kinda cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" you walked over to feel up the material of the Pat suit. \"What do you want to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. You want to wear it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretched out the arm of the suit only to discover that it was very elastic-like. You were sure you could fit into it, even with the difference in size between you and Pat. You'd have to get in through the mouth though, as there didn't appear to be another entrance. The material also felt incredibly life-like. It was almost like touching girl's skin with its smoothness and texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" you muttered. \"But we also know this thing works. We can print other stuff too. It's just weird that it was able to put a to-scale suit with only a photograph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed seemed open to trying anything as he handed you the Pat suit. \"It's up to you, bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided...</span></div></div>",

The scenery looked really weird.<br>\r\nYou put the second leg in but you only touched the inside of the belly before you grab the suit by the waist and pull it up as far as possible. Which was far less than you expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought that the suit's waist should be located somewhere on your thigh but that didn't appear to be the case.<br>\r\n<i>\"How?\"</i> you thought, but soon you noticed that your eyelevel was off.<br>\r\nFor a second you felt alarmed but you chose to ignore it as you pulled her shoulders over yours. Having Patrica's flabby headskin around your next felt very displeasing and was annoying as fuck so you hurried to get your arms and fingers where they belonged to. <br>\r\nYou spread and closed your fingers a few times before you could move on. They were just so tiny now as well as a bit pudgy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued poking your tummy which was now softer as well. You grabbed a flab and squeezed it. It feels funny. You have never been on plus side of the scale so this was a  pretty new sensation. <br>\r\nYou giggled and finally groped your big ass. Playing and massaging it just felt amazing! <br>\r\nNext you grabbed the breast but they seemingly weren't attached to you yet so you couldn't feel anything from it. Without you noticing your new equipment had been reacting to your actions, and now you were pretty moist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you pull Patricia's hollow head over yours.<br>\r\nYou slide your tiny fingers down your throat, feeling the softness of the chub below.<br>\r\nNow you give your new breasts a firm squeeze causing a soft moan.<br>\r\nA totally new sensation makes you wet to the point you can't do anything but touch your new erogenous zone.<br>\r\nThe stimuli are too much for you and have to stop as you felt a powerful moan that was about to be released. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to look into the mirror but it only shows your face because you are so small now.<br>\r\nYou look around the restroom. The only clothes are yours. You look down your naked self, then at your clothes and back and forth a few times while pondering if you should go naked to him or dress in your clothes </span></div></div>",

You know with it being you and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa didn\u2019t answer as she slowly hunted and pecked at the keys.  There were slight change here and there and Lisa quickly turned them back, but then she hit the right sequence of keys and it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa did not want to go with Simon earlier because despite her big boobs and belly she wasn\u2019t happy with her body.  She wanted a big ass, a monstrously big ass.  She had bought clothes; skirts, leggings, jeans, pants, and anything else she could fit over her bottom half; in the sizes that would suggest each of her ass cheeks was 3 feet wide and her thighs were almost 5 feet around.  She wanted to go home and stuff with pillows and anything else she could get her hands on to give her a massive lower half, but now she may have a better solution than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stared at the close up of her body, from her waist to her ankles, and used the keys to thicken it, and thicken it, and thicken it.  And then she thickened it some more until she got the proportions she wanted, the proportions she stuffed for her fantasies, and with a trembling finger hit print.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-printing a giant ass to wear,\u201d Lisa said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cool!\u201d Simon exclaimed.  \u201cWe can have so much fun with a giant Lisa ass!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A buzzer sound awoke Lisa, letting her know that the printing of her fat as and thighs pants was done.  She had fallen asleep only a few hours ago, refusing to leave the apartment of Simon and Ted in case this chance to achieve her dream disappeared out from under her.  Recognizing the fact that neither Simon nor Ted had dais anything yet she investigated to find them both asleep.  Seizing the opportunity Lisa stuffed the pants into a black garbage bag and fled to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at home Lisa\u2019s hands trembled as he opened the garbage bag and took out the pants.  She looked them over and marveled at the details, how the skin was a perfect match for he own, how the pubic hair was shave into a strip like her own, how there was a mole on the right inner thigh just like her real body.  In a state one could describe as almost euphoric Lisa ran to her secret stash of clothes. She decided that a skirt wouldn\u2019t really show off her exaggerated curves and grabbed a pair of blank ponte leggings and a pair of 4-inch heels, to push the huge ass she would be wearing up and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the clothes down next to her new pants, Lisa undressed from the waist down, even forgoing underwear, and picked up the ass and thigh pants.  She smiled as the tip of her toe trembled as she slipped them inside the pants.  She placed the other foot inside and pulled them up, having a little trouble getting them up and around her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of the sides the pants snapped into place and all but disappeared against her skin.  Lisa decided to move to the bathroom to look at herself in the full-length door mirror.  The trip delighted her, as she had to discover the dimensions of her body in order to navigate the apartment correctly.  There was a lot of bumping into tables, chairs, and any other things that stuck out.  She was so delighted she failed to notice the light feelings of all the bumps that she caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom Lisa squealed in delight at the sight of herself.  Her hips were wider than her shoulders, and her thighs were thicker around then the bowl of the toilet.  She turned and took a look at the mighty ass she now wielded.  It was huge, absolutely huge.  Chairs would not be an option for sitting with an ass like this, not unless they had no armrests and were used two at a time.  \u201cMaybe three,\u201d Lisa smirked.  She smacked the ass, and felt a sharp sting, \u201cOw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Lisa yelled stunned.  \u201cHow can I feel a butt slap when wearing these things?\u201d  She quickly looked for the seams around her ankles and waist and found only a slight line.  Running her hands over the pants she could feel every movement.  \u201cIt almost tickles,\u201d she smiled.  Knowing this Lisa rushed back to her clothes and quickly pulled the black stretch ponte pants over her gargantuan rump.  She slipped into her heels and admired how they pushed her booty up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving it a little shake Lisa was pleased with the way she looked.   She strutted around her apartment, admiring with how far her ass cheeks swung from side to side.  She dragged the mirror from the bathroom and set it up across from the couch.  She lounged on the couch admiring her reflection in the mirror, the chubby girl with sizable breasts and belly, and massive lower body.  She ran her hands over her thighs and marveled at how expansive they were.  She broke out into a fit of laughter, as her secret fetish was now being fulfilled like no other way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was early morning, and she assumed she fell asleep while rubbing her hands up and down her new ass and thigh pants.  \u201cWhat a fun night,\u201d she yawned.  \u201cI\u2019ve got an hour or so before I have to get ready for work.  Might as well take a shower.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa walked through her house, adoring how her giant hips swayed to and fro, as she undressed.  She was down to her ass and thigh pants as she started the water for her shower.  She ran her thumb down her hip looking for the seam of the pants so as to take them off, but couldn\u2019t seem to find one.  \u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d  She tried again, but found only the same result as last time.  Turning off the water, she turned to the mirror and looked for the elusive seam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith seconds passing, each one growing more frantic than the last, Lisa began to realize that there was no seam to find.  \u201cOh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God! OH MY GOD!\u201d  She slapped at her pants, in a vain hope they would fall off, \u201cThey\u2019re stuck on me!  They\u2019re part of me!  This is awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwesome.  A Freudian slip.  One which spoke volumes about Lisa\u2019s appreciation for the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meant horrible, this is horrible to be happening to me right now,\u201d Lisa told the empty house.  It like her remained unconvinced of her words.  \u201cThis ass is horrible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa dropped onto her oversized ass, smiling at how she squished down.  It was like sitting on to overstuffed couch cushions.  \u201cI meant awesome,\u201d she smiled.  She sat and kneaded her thighs and ass for a long time, but the sound of her alarm clock going off in her bedroom alerted to her having to go to work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I go?\u201d she asked.  \u201cShould I as this big ass woman?  I have the clothes to do it, and its not like this problem is going away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over to her phone, \u201cOr I could call out, buy myself a day to find a fix for this, or at least come up with a cover story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAll ass, no class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the quote of the day for the bookstore Lisa managed.  It was to everyone\u2019s astonishment that she had come in with an ass the size of the cab seat of a ford F-150, and it was to their further astonishment that she had played it off as it was no big deal and she couldn\u2019t even remember how it had happened, but it was to their disbelief at how much her behavior changed because of the size of her new ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had come in smiling, wearing a nice blouse with an attractive scarf on, normal Lisa for everyone to see.  But she was also wearing the tightest pair of black, stretch ponte leggings and a pair of 4-inch, cheetah print, pointed toe heels.  She was secretly delighted at how everyone stared at her, gasping at how big and in your face her new sun eclipsing badonkadonk was, made to look all the bigger by her pants and heels.  \u201cOh my God,\u201d one of her coworkers, John, said, dropping his glass of water onto the carpet of the bookstore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lisa asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa, what happened to your butt?\u201d her assistant manager Gertrude asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked again.  \u201cOh you mean how it\u2019s so big now?  I don\u2019t know what happened, all I know is my badonkadonk has a lot more donk than it used to!\u201d  And that was it, that was all Lisa would comment about the new wagon she was draggin\u2019. She immediately shooed everyone back to work and went about her day, with a new appreciation for her butt pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happily tried squeezing down the tighter aisles, knocking the books from the shelves with her pound-packing posterior.  She merrily bent over to pick the books up the first time, knocking the bookcase behind her over as nothing could resist the power of her prodigious backside.  And she cheerily ordered everyone else to clean up after her when her plantation-sized ass prevented her from cleaning up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater she saw Gretchen and one of the shelf stockers, Brad, standing at the coffee machine talking.  Cheerfully Lisa squeezed between the two, nudging Brad out of the way with her gigantic ass.  She filled her cup and put it on the counter to add sugar, and intentionally dropped one to the ground.  She bent over, and as she did so she pushed her ass into Brad, pinning him to the wall between her mighty cheeks.  For the next 40 years of his life Brad would masturbate to this moment in his privates ones at even the slightest provocation of memory, while outwardly projecting an attitude of outrage and disgust to anyone who would remotely listen.  Lisa would stop squashing him after a few feigned moments of ignorance, never to think of it again, except when in times that she needed a good laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked for any open drawer or cabinet to close with her gargantuan hips.  The first time she swung her hip out and up as far as she could before letting gravity add its force to her own as she swung it the other way and hit the drawer of the register closed.  It hit hard enough to lift the register off the counter to let it drop back down with a thud that suggested something internally was broken.  She happily opened the other register feeling it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa locked up that night and giddily said good night to her staff, all whose grumbles she mistook for some sort of compliment of her monstrously large ass.  Lisa knew having an ass the size that she did would lead to an interesting life for herself, she just never realized how \u201cinteresting\u201d she would make it for everyone else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wendy was quite a large woman with shoulder length black hair framing her round chubby cheeks. Her plump body was covered in a simple green one piece dress with a white apron tied around her wide waist. She also sports rather huge breasts to go with her round 8 month pregnant-like belly. She gave Simon her usual cheery smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome Simon! What can I do for you?\" She said beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, hi Wendy. Just a loaf of sour dough and a small bag of muffins to go please\" He said while taking his wallet out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming right up\" Smiled Wendy, as she gathered the muffins, the store phone started to ring. \"Sorry Simon, mind if I take this call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" He said. Moments later, Wendy comes back with a coat on. \"Simon, sorry but could you watch the store for me? Something urgent has come up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? How could I run a bakery?\" He said astounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please? You'll be fine. I'll only be gone for an hour. It's been quiet today and you don't have to worry about making anything because that was done this morning.\" Pleaded Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......Alright.\" He said reluctantly.

That and what appears to be a simple green house dress that seems to be hanging on the door knob. Feeling reluctant at first, he thought it was better than nothing, he strips out of his wrecked clothes and slides the dress over his head. Despite his new girth, the dress was quite roomy. He then retied the apron back on and approached a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! It kinda suits me.\" He says feeling strangely delighted as he made his way back to the front, not noticing his hair was now black, his face began taking on feminine features and his body was slowly starting to fit the dress as his walk was becoming a waddle.</span></div></div>",

Simon looked at it strangely at first but felt compelled to put it on.  He threw everything back into the box and quickly ran to check his room locked, and it was, before he proceeded to strip down naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a certain excitement as he slipped on the unitard, marveling at how the neck hole would expand to allow his whole body through.  He wasn\u2019t even sure it could be stretched far enough to make the costume rip in the slightest.  He next slipped on the belt and the cape, followed by the gloves and then the boots.  The left boot was the second to go on and as it slipped over his knee Simon thought to himself, \u201cHuh.  That\u2019s it?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was with that questioning statement that his body was gripped with a tightness and then his body began to expand to fill the suit, a suit he now realized was designed to accommodate a 250 + pound woman.  A woman!  He cringed as his ass and thighs blew up with soft and plush fat, he practically screamed as his penis retracted inside of himself and changed itself into a vagina.  He winced as the bones in his face cracked and reshaped themselves, and he gasped as dirty blond hair fell down around his shoulder to mid-back.  But it was after all this when Simon felt waves of pleasure begin to wrack his body, and finally focus on his chest.  Looking down Simon could see that with every breath his chest expanded outwards, and outwards.  He didn\u2019t want to admit it, and he did try to fight it, but as his breasts blew up to a pair of GG cup zeppelins he felt mighty good right now.  Mighty good.  Once her breasts were fully gown Simon dropped to the floor and panted, as he handled himself through his tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a few minutes before he was able to pull himself together to the point of scraping himself off the floor.  He plodded slowly to the living room where he caught a glimpse of himself in the window,  \u201cNot bad,\u201d he smiled as he grabbed and squeezed his massive tits, very pleased with his beautiful appearance.  It took him a few moments, minutes really, to notice the belt buckle under his huge knockers, but he finally did.  \u201cI wonder what T\u2026!\u201d  He was going to say means, but the sudden expansion of his new breasts to a size unheard of stopped him from completing his thought.  Each of his breasts surged forward, moving furniture and anything else in their way to a different location with their surging mass.  Soon his whole chest had pushed the entire content of his living room against the far wall.  But despite their size they seemed light to Simon and not a burden to maneuver and work around, but still he phrased it best when he said, \u201cToo much T.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon felt a rush as his giant tits shrink in size to their original post transformation size, faster than his eyes could follow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting his chest to make sure everything was back to normal, Simon wiped his brown and joked, \u201cThank God I didn\u2019t say A!\u201d  And just like that he had two giant weather balloons pushing out from behind him.  Simon was crushed against one wall as he felt his ass cheeks touch the other three.  \u201cOkay.  Now I see why this suit is so stretchy.\u201d  He felt how sensitive his ass was, his mind able to inhabit the entirely of his butt cheeks and divine information from what they touched and felt.  Snapping back to attention he whispered, \u201cToo much A.\u201d and his ass was back to being oversized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I\u2018ll go outside to try out my other powers,\u201d he said with smile, as he knew these two were going to be fun all on their own, but he might as well see what was stored in the bank.  \u201cThough is may be hard to beat hot looking chubby chick, with big tits and a big ass!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Taking them off will not break the magic.  You will act as she acts, behaves as she behaves, and for all attempts and purposes be her.  Once 24 hours are up you will be brought back to the moment you put them on with all the memories you made.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how many times you put the clothes on you will look like the same woman, but the life she leads will be different.  I\u2019ve only heard of one person living the same life twice in all the time I\u2019ve known or used the clothes.

Fishing around in her purse produced the keys and soon she was off to pick up her littlest one from daycare, all the way making constant adjustments to her breasts to get them out of the way so she could steer properly.  These things better pay off later,\u201d she groused to herself after yet another readjustment to her big chesticles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon marveled at how she made small talk, bringing up intimate details of the day care workers as if she had known them for years, when she picked up her youngest, Lyndsay.  She was dumbstruck at how she effortlessly slipped into Rita\u2019s life, like keeping Lyndsay entertained just enough while she shopped for the week\u2019s groceries.  Hell she fell slightly embarrassed, and with her more male mind flattered, when she noticed a couple of teenagers checking out her giant 42GG funbags.  She was paying for everything when her phone rang.  She moved Lyndsay from her right arm to her left, like she had done it a hundred times before, and reached into her bra and took out the phone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sweetie,\u201d it was Ryan one of her twins, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?  Practice ended early?  How about Savannah\u2019s?  No?  Well then you\u2019re going to have to wait.\u201d  Simon barely had time to listen to Ryan\u2019s complaints before reacting like an overworked housewife would and should.  \u201cWell that\u2019s too bad!  I\u2019m with your sister at the grocery store and it\u2019s going to be another half hour until I get there to pick you and your sister up, so no!  No, I cannot come get you now, even if you don\u2019t feel like \u2018hanging out\u2019 for a little while!  Suck it up!\u201d  Simon hung up and slipped the phone back into her bra.  She saw the look on the cashier\u2019s face and explained herself, \u201cSorry, my sixteen year old thinks I have nothing to do all day but rush to get him when he wants me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier smiled and nodded, \u201cI hear you sister, I hear you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon laughed as she got the groceries and Lyndsay in the car.  This was all too surreal, he was himself wearing this ridiculous body and yet she was Rita.  \u201cIt\u2019s like being forced to role play and you don\u2019t know how to stop!\u201d  She picked up the twins from practice at the high school, trying to get them to hurry and put the equipment in the back of the min-van as fast they could, \u201cC\u2019mon you two!  I want to get home and start cooking for you three!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d Ryan asked with too much attitude but a stern look made him watch himself because she wasn\u2019t going to sit there and tolerate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the 22nd,\u201d Savannah answered her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhhhh,\u201d Ryan replied knowingly.  \u201cI get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet what?\u201d Simon asked them flustered as they buckled in.  \u201cWhat\u2019s the 22nd?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBang night,\u201d Savannah answered bored with the whole thing by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon whipped around forward and didn\u2019t say a word.  She never would have thought that they knew she and Phil would fuck on the 22nd of each month.  Unless it was on a Monday because no one needs that kind of pressure on him or her at the very start of a week.  Sometimes they\u2019d reschedule sometimes they wouldn\u2019t.  She drove in silence all the way home, slapping her boob to get her phone to stop vibrating when a call started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home Simon avoided eye contact with the twins and put Lyndsay down while she cooked.  She was busy stirring the sauce when from behind she felt a strong pair of arms reach under her own arms and grab two handfuls of breast meat from each of her silky skinned 42GG cup breasts.  She felt a pair of lips nuzzle her neck and rain kisses down all over it.  \u201cMmmm, I hope you\u2019re my husband because I\u2019m gonna blow you for that,\u201d she cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad that I am then,\u201d Phil laughed as he moved his hands down to his wife\u2019s waist and held her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLater,\u201d Simon giggled and pushed him away, \u201cI need to get dinner done.\u201d she slapped his away and thought about his dick as she finished dinner and set the table.  \u201cI think I will suck his dick tonight,\u201d Simon acquiesced to herself.  The lines of who Simon was and who Rita was were really blurred at this point.  She soon called everyone to the table, ate, and cleaned up.  She was tired now and went to relax with her husband.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d Simon said as she plopped down on the couch and swung her feet into her husband\u2019s lap.  \u201cMy feet hurt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd?\u201d Phil raised an eyebrow as she switched the channel over to Jeopardy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you want to have that dick sucked you better get to massaging my tootsies!\u201d she smiled, and shook her 42GG\u2019s to emphasize what he could be missing.  Phil knew better than to argue and took of her plastic looking shoes and gave her the massage she wanted.  She couldn\u2019t help but moan as he worked her arches, it just felt so good.  \u201cThank God the twins are upstairs in their rooms, and you put Lyndsay down for the night!\u201d her head rolled around her shoulders in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the foot massage Simon readied everything for tomorrow and headed up to the bedroom to get ready.  She was gonna suck that dick and let herself get fucked.  It was all so surreal and all so enticing; she was honestly excited to try this for the first time.  Phil eventually followed her up to the room, and made himself ready for their monthly session.  Simon crawled between his legs and let Rita\u2019s natural instincts take over.  She started to suck that dick and suck it hard, and from the sounds Phil was making she doing one Hell of a job.   After she, classily, swallowed the load shot into her mouth Phil got down to work and started to make love to her.  Well, he started out making love to her but it was really more like just a deep dicking.  And Simon was moaning like a banshee.  Her first orgasm as a woman was absolutely magical and mind blowing.  \u201cThat was amazing!\u201d she panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Phil replied feeling rather flattered.  He was a little confused by the quizzical look she gave him though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning Simon breezed through all her responsibilities and obligations, like cooking breakfast, getting Lyndsay ready in the morning, feeding her and the twins, getting the twins to school, and dropping Lyndsay off at daycare.  She had just returned home from taking the car to get an oil change and began making a late lunch for herself.  She sat down and took a bite when she felt a tugging at her back and felt like she fell backwards through the chair and into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon woke up and quickly felt his body to make sure he was okay.  He was fine, and in the dress, shoes, and accessories he had just tried on.  \u201cI\u2019m back to being a guy!\u201d he grabbed the front of the dress to hold it up and not let it drop leaving him naked.  He checked the clock an it had only been one minute since he had \u2018left.\u2019  \u201cThat was intense!\u201d he panted feeling exhausted from the experience.  Thoughts of the sex he had with Phil filled his mind.  And he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to go again!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smiled as she saw the face of Rita Ortho in the mirror with her amazing 42GG cups jiggling with her every subtle movement.  \u201cExcept I\u2019m not Rita,\u201d Simon began to say quietly, \u201cI\u2019m-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley Madsen!\u201d a large handsome man exclaimed as he came up behind Simon and put his arms around her thick waist.  \u201cThe woman who they named a dating sight for!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon smiled and twisted in his arms to face her new lover.  She was shocked to see that the man was actually her, \u201cUncle Steve?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that our role for tonight?\u201d he smiled as she kissed her neck.  \u201cAm I your naughty uncle, and you\u2019re my little niece Ashley?\u201d  He cupped her breasts.  \u201cWell, not little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo that\u2019s not what I meant!  Wait!  Named a dating sight for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley Madison.  If you hadn\u2019t fucked the owners brains out that night, he would never had been inspired to help others to discreetly step out on their significant others,\u201d Uncle Steve told you as she rained kisses down on your neck and upper chest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Simon grunted.  She was such a good lay that she inspired a whole website to help others cheat with pussy almost as fine as her own.  That was empowering in a way.  An ego boost in others.  And as long as she wore this body she might as well test out just how awesome this vagina between her legs was.  Besides she never did like her Aunt Peggy anyway.  \u201cI want you to carry me to the bed so that I an give you a tit job with these big 42 GG tits!\u201d Simon told her uncle.  Steve didn\u2019t say a word and scooped her up in her arms and carried the little horny devil to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve threw her onto the bed, making her yelp in surprise.  Simon smiled seductively ass he took her dress off.  \u201cTell me how much you want these glorious 42 GG breasts,\u201d Simon licked her lips.  She took her bra off and ran her hands along those mounds of adipose tit flesh, truly surprised at how silky and wonderful they felt under her hands, and marveling at how good it felt to have what were obviously experienced hands tickle and tease her wonderful breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve unleashed all nine inches of his cock and straddled Simon.  Simon took the cock and placed it between her breasts before beginning to knead them around it.  Steve\u2019s eyes fluttered almost immediately as he came almost immediately and squirted all over Simon\u2019s face.  Simon merely chuckled and used the tissues next to the bed to clean herself off.  She then gently rolled over and rose to all fours.  She put her hand between her legs and spread her pussy lips, inviting Steve to do what he did best; pound pussy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cNow where can I get me some big, long, sausage?\u201d Simon asked as she bounced his hips up and down.  Angela DelPindo loved sausage, Simon could clearly see that in her memories, almost every meal had sausage included somehow; sausage with her bacon and eggs, sausage in her stuffing, sausage in her gravy, sausage in her sauce, sausage in her meatloaf, sausage on or in every meal she could work it into.  And she loved to suck on sausage whenever she went out to the clubs, and that\u2019s when Simon realized that Angela called dick sausage, and it was her favorite kind of sausage.  Simon giggled and grabbed Angela\u2019s purse as she made her way from the apartment to go have a night of fun.  It was rather strange for Simon to admit he was as much a passenger in this body as she was in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Angela drove a mustang despite the fact that having huge 42GG breasts were going to make it hard to steer.  But she didn\u2019t care, she was and Italian Princes in the most stereotypical of ways and a sweet muscle car would always help her get some sweet sausage.  Finding a place to park, Simon got out of the car and realized for the first time that it was the middle of the night not early day like when he had changed into Angela.  But that didn\u2019t matter, as she was concerned about one thing, \u201cSausage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to the club Simon was immediately let in, the bouncers knowing how much she loves to eat sausage and considering how often she would eat their sausage she would always be first through the door.  Not wasting time Angela walked by the bar, picked her food out, and led the lucky Italian winner to the bathroom by his sausage.  Pushing him down onto the toilet, Simon crawled between his legs and unzipped his pants.  She reached inside and pulled out his sausage.  Licking her lips she took it inside her mouth and began to suck.  And inside Simon was flipping out.  He had never wanted to suck another man\u2019s dick and here he was on autopilot doing it, and from the sounds he was doing it well, and he couldn\u2019t believe how awesome it was to be this forward and overtly aggressive in his sexual advances before.  He didn\u2019t care that it was a man\u2019s dick; no, a man\u2019s sausage; in her mouth she was loving how this made her feel.  Hell the nipples of her 42GG tits were fully erect.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon swallowed and cleaned her lips, \u201cYou were one yummy Italian sausage,\u201d she complimented the man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks babe,\u201d he said as he cleaned himself up.  \u201cI always wanted to meet the great Angela DelPindo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Simon replied as she used the mirror to fix her makeup, \u201cI\u2019m one classy piece of ass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd those lips!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, my big ole Dick Suckers sure have had a lot of sausage pass between them,\u201d she winked as she opened the bathroom door.  \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll get your big spicy, Italian sausage between them again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon swung her hips side to side as she headed back to the bar; purposely making her 42GG breasts bounce and jiggle a little more than they normally would have.  \u201cA gin and tonic please,\u201d she ordered from the bartender.  She wouldn\u2019t have to pay as she had eaten his sausage so many times in the past and if he wanted to keep serving her sausage he\u2019ll keep serving her free drinks first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Angela,\u201d Bianca Smeld said with contempt in her voice, \u201cYou still eating all the \u2018sausage\u2019 you can get your greedy hands on?\u201d  Bianca was an amazing looking blond with a fit and toned body.  Her breasts were not as big as Simon\u2019s 42GG but were a solid F Cup.  Her three friends were no less stunning, but all hated Angela for the simple fact that no matter how good looking they are she would still pull more ass then they do, all because of all the sausage she liked to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure am,\u201d Simon smiled and sipped her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the Hell do you walk around so easily when you have a big belly filled with sperm?\u201d Bianca snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not filled.  Yet,\u201d Simon smiled and sipped his drink again.  \u201cBut the night is young.\u201d  She walked out onto the dance floor and told the club in a silent moment, \u201cI\u2019m hungry boys and I want your sausage!\u201d  Suffice it to say that Simon was a very popular and very busy girl for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon struggled with the locks to her apartment, or Angela\u2019s apartment would be more accurate way to say that.  She groaned in pain, her belly was distended like she was three months pregnant due to all the sausages she ate and semen she swallowed.  Waddling to her couch Simon flopped down and cradled her belly.  \u201c\u2026So much sausage\u2026\u201d she groaned as she slowly rubbed her belly to relieve the pressure.  She lurched forward, her mouth filling with the contents of her stomach.  She waddled as quick as she could to the bathroom where she filled the toilet with what looked to be a couple gallons of semen.  \u201cAt least I feel better,\u201d she smiled before passing out from being too drunk right there on the bathroom floor, \u201c\u2026sausage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon woke up the next day, her long black hair pasted to the side of her face, her breath stinking just like a sperm bank.  She looked in the toilet and recoiled at the sight and smell of so much semen.  \u201cI need a sausage to get this taste out of my mouth,\u201d she grumbled.  \u201cAnd maybe a real one to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleaning herself up, she cooked the greasiest sausages she could and ate them as she cuddled up on the couch to watch reruns of Maury.  She was beginning to nod off when she felt like she was falling backwards through the couch and into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the Hell?\u201d Simon yelled as he quickly looked around his room, while trying to hold up the dress that was now too big to sit on his body properly.  \u201cThat was fucking amazing!\u201d He looked down at the dress and a thought crossed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could go for some sausage.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not even packing peanuts. He even turned the box upside down and shook it around, causing nothing to fall out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd,\" he muttered. \"It <i>felt </i>like something was in there when I brought it in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that last word, a small piece of paper fluttered out from the package as if from nowhere. Simon certainly hadn't seen it when he stared into the box. It was the size of a business card and it landed right on the table. Simon put the box down on its side and peeled up the slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no title to it or a name he could reference. Just two columns of words. One in English and one in a language he could just barely read. Though looking at the words burned in the middle of his mind, like a splinter. There were only four rows, but it looked almost as if there was space where more could be added over time.<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><b><br>\r\nSwap - K'yarnak<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteal - Mggokaog<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShare - Mgulnah<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStop - Mgah<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShape - Ye'bthnk</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Simon read the foreign writing, he didn't notice the black tendrils forming from the dark corners of inside the box. To the human eye, they looked like nothing of this earth. Like they were incomprehensible. They moved like an octopus on the ground and slowly hunted not him. But his shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the tendrils touched Simon's shadow on the floor, he felt a chill go up his spine. Though he didn't look up to notice anything until the tendrils had all but disappeared into his own shadow, which was a shade darker than it had been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving not noticed the parasite living in his shadow, Simon struggled off the card as just another joke being played on him by another college kid from the campus dorm. He pocketed and forget about it until later in the day. A moment where he would accidentally say the word for \"Swap\" while near someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would he be swapping shadows with?</span></div></div>",

That was until there was a knock at his apartment door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Simon,\" sang a bubbly voice from the other side. \"Is Kimmy home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Hey, Patricia,\" Simon greeted from the doorway. \"Nah, she started taking yoga classes last week, I think. She usually doesn't get back until an hour before her shift to bartend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia pouted. \"That girl is way too focused on exercise. Why can't she be like the rest of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment caused Simon to laugh. \"That's only because you're so short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're too freakishly tall!\" Patricia said with some fake anger. \"I'd be normal weight if I was your height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia wasn't a blimp, but she wasn't a beanpole either. Especially considering she was heavier than Simon herself, despite not even coming up to his chin in height. Most of that weight settled in around her hips, though she had an impressively large rack too whose cleavage peaked through her white shirt. It gave Patricia the appearance of a pear with two grapes at the stem. Small and curvy. And blonde and blue eyed, which didn't do her ditzy persona any favors. Simon, on the other hand, was tall with brown hair/eyes. Almost boring in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what's up?\" Asked Simon. \"You can stick around if you want. She should be back soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I need to get ready for my shift at the bar too. I just wanted to drop off the hair dye I had bought for her and collect my pay for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can cover it for her,\" Simon reached around in his pocket. \"Here. Don't stand in the doorway, come on in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia obeyed as Simon riffled around for his wallet, closing the door behind her. They headed into the kitchen as Simon's hand brushed against the business card he had all but forgotten about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Patricia asked as Simon pulled out the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something that came in the mail,\" Simon replied. \"Probably a prank. It's some coded message or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia snatched the card out of Simon's hands. He just shrugged and started digging out of his wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do I owe you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay-Yarn-Nack?\" Patricia was more interested in the note that her money. \"What the heck is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's Lovecraftian,\" Simon stepped a little closer so that their shadows were touching. \"And that's not how you pronounce it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would. I used to be into the occult stuff when I was a kid. Lovecraft was always a favorite writer of mine. Even if he was a bit...xenophobic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and your big words,\" Patricia huffed, passing the note back to Simon. \"You say it then if you're so smart. Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon gave a long, hard look at the piece of paper. Despite Lovecraft being only a passing interest to him, he found something strangely calling to him in the words printed in dark, black ink. His lips moved to form the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"K'yarnak\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like the sound of lightning striking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange sensation came over both college students. They found themselves bolted to the floor where they stood, unable to move. Only their eyes and their mouths for observing the changes about to come over the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon,\" said Patricia. \"You're shrinking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds, the gap of height between Simon and Patricia was not so great anymore, as she came up to his nose. Simon felt his T-shirt and his pants loosen. Upon closer inspection of Patricia, he noticed that her blouse was doing an even poorer job of containing her big breasts and her tubby tummy was starting to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think you're growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked down at themselves as their whole bodies began to change, and their shadows intertwined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon began to feel more bloated as the looseness of his waistline faded away. Everything about him was bloating, though there was a particular focus on his hips and rump. He was beginning to feel very bottom heavy until there was a new weight on his chest as it began to puff out like it was swelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross from him, Patricia was experiencing something of a weight lose. It was like someone had taken a straw and was starting to suck her dry. All the while the muscles underneath her skin began to harden. She lost her voluptuous curvy figure in favor of a body more built for brawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of realization went across Patricia's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon, we're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turning into each other,\" he finished as another wave of change came over him and his voice became more high pitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was looking far from male with his hair growing out and becoming curly. Though his locks never lost their brown luster. His face became softer and his lips pouty as all identity of him melted away into a young woman. All the while he kept growing bigger and shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia was seeing the opposite end of the spectrum, getting taller and thinner. Her rounded face lengthened with a pointy chin that had the signs of facial hair growing. Her blonde hair receded into her head, giving her a boyish short cut. Like Simon, her natural color remained the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a time, it was impossible to call Simon male and Patricia female. They had completely switched in all bodily aspects. However, their clothes remained the same, as did their hair and skin colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the change had finished, they could finally move again as their shadows broke away from each other. Simon found himself looking up at Patricia as he took in his new, heavier, rounder body. His old clothes were both scrunched and tight around his new chest. Patricia was doing her own adjustment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simon...,\" she said in a perfect copy of his old voice.</span></div></div>",

She made it halfway to her room before looking up and seeing the strange sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you guys wearing each other\u2019s clothes?\u201d she asked, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Simon blurted, not sure how to take that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, I guess that\u2019s not weird for you, SImone,\u201d she continued while setting her bags on the table. \u201cBut Pat, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re gonna stretch out her clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, guess,\u201d Patricia said dumbly. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Patricia snatched up her things and made a speedy exit.

Taking it out, he first thought it was his roommate's idea for a joke.  Kim was in her bedroom at the moment and he was tempted to ask her if this belonged to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon inspects the bottle further, unscrewing the stopper to see if anything was inside, when smoke starts spewing out of the top.  \"What the hell??\" Simon exclaims, dropping the bottle as the room become more and more obscured.  He watched, terrified at first, as a person of some kind began to appear before him.  A head escaped the bottle, wearing a turban of some kind.  Next, arms and a torso became visible.  Simon had no idea what was going on and he was thinking about running away before whatever this thing was realized he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if able to read his thoughts, the being said in a commanding voice: \"Do not run, Master.  I have been imprisoned in my vessel for over 500 years.  I am a Genie.\"  The smoke was starting to dissipate and Simon found himself able to calm down a little, though still shaking.  \"Do not be afraid.  I have been helping mortals such as yourself for many thousands of years.  I am not going to harm you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Simon asked, still a little wary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My only wish is to help you.  In any way you can imagine.  I must tell you that, contrary to many stories you have undoubtedly been told over the years, Genies such as myself aren't limited to only 3 wishes per person.  You get as many as you like.  They are unlimited.  Also, I cannot kill someone for you, nor can I make someone fall in love with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Unlimited wishes?\" Simon replied, sounding skeptical.  \"What's the catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing I ask in return, Master, is that my identity remain a secret.  I work best when I remain anonymous, when people aren't aware of my presence.  Which is why I would advise you to spend your first wish to keep me invisible to everyone but you.  The fewer mortals that know about me, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.  Um... I wish no one except myself can see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Master,\" the Genie replied, clapping his hands.  \"Now, on to the more important stuff.  What can I do to improve your life?  Just name it, Master, and it will be done!\"</span></div></div>",

He looks down, watching his clothes disappear, to be slowly replaced with his new outfit.  He expected some sort of spandex or bulletproof material, but was a little shocked when a pair of jean shorts appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay.  Interesting design choice,\" Simon said, wondering what the Genie had in mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple white t-shirt formed on his torso, followed by a cape. He turned his head, trying to find out the color of the cape, when he realized his hair was becoming blonde and lengthening beyond his shoulders.  Before he could protest, Simon began shrinking, a pair of breasts forming on his body.  The letters \"SB\" were slowly being painted onto his shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what does...Um...\" He forgot his thought, his head sluggish for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Simon's voice was higher, as well.  He giggled as he tried to remember what he were about to say.  \"Just, like, forget about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 20 year old's transformation continued.  His hair was now platinum blonde and cascading halfway down his back.  His breasts had surpassed DD in size and continuing to swell.  He look up at the Genie, a horrified look on his face as he realized his intelligence was dropping even lower.  As of now, he couldn't even remember what classes he was taking in College, or even the name of his Professors, but who cared about that?  All he could think about right now was some cute guy he had seen in a cafe a few days ago and why he didn't go over and talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I can see my boobies!\" Simon exclaim stupidly, watching his top dip lower to show off his impressive cleavage.  It was slowly becoming shorter, as well, to show off his tight midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother minute passed and Simon's transformation was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, Master,\" the Genie told him.  \"I have given you Superpowers.  You have super strength, you are invulnerable.  You can fly, are able to run really fast and hear things from far away.  Will there be anything else for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon paused, trying to comprehend everything the mysterious stranger floating above him had just said, when he heard an explosion coming from downtown.  He turned towards the door, to see what was going on, when Simon  catches his new reflection in the mirror.  \"Wow!  I look totally cute in this new outfit!\"  Simon begins massaging his new breasts, faintly aware he didn't have these a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Master?\" the Genie interrupted.  \"If you wanted, you could use your new powers to aid the people in your town affected by that blast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Oh, right.\"  Simon replied, gripping the front door and accidentally ripping it off its hinges.  \"Oops,\" the new hero said, tossing the door behind her, hearing it crash into the guest bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you wanna come with me?\" Simon asks.  \"You could, like, help me out or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Genie grinned, tempted to laugh at his new master and how simplistic her vocabulary had become.  \"I can come with you, Master.  But I cannot interfere.  I can, however, grant you any wish you want, Simon.  Or as the citizens of your city now call you, Super Bimbo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, you can grant wishes?  That's so cool!\"  Super Bimbo flew of towards downtown, the Genie floating behind her...</span></div></div>",

I had the day off from work, so I just decided to stay in today, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim took a large gulp from her drink, then turned around to wash her hands in the sink.  Simon was strangely reminded of one of his fantasies he had about Kim at that particular moment and turned to his Genie to see if it were possible for it to become a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...Genie?\" he asked in a low voice, in case Kim could overhear him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if...\" Simon paused, thinking maybe his request would sound too weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on,\" the Genie said encouragingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wanted to know if you could make people gain weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can.  Anything is possible, minus the few exceptions I gave you earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then...I wish that my roommate, Kim, would gain 25 pounds right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shall be done, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Kim started to change.  Her skinny and toned body became slightly less so.  Her behind swelled larger and fatter.  Her arms gained a little more mass, jiggling with her added flab as she continued washing.  Also, a small amount of belly fat emerged, covering up her tight midsection with extra weight, though it was covered by her T-Shirt.  Kim was still sweaty, but she seemed a little more winded now, as if she were trying hard to get rid of her excess bulk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that to your liking, Master?\"  the Genie asked Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Simon decide to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a long, strange month for Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even two weeks since Kim had moved out of their apartment and he was already starting to feel lonely with an entire room of their two bedroom flat emptied out. Though he still kept in touch with both Kim and Patricia with their job at the bar, Simon found himself not wanting to be home as much as he used to. Coupled with getting pounded by homework at the university, October was proving to be a tiresome time of the year as the chilly weather took over and days grew shorter. It was halfway through that month that he resolved to reach out and find a new roommate. Fill the void, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon wasn't expecting much. The semester had started and most students wouldn't be interested in switching places unless they were desperate. So, he opened up his ad to anyone who might be interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer came in on October 31st, of all days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, there,\" chimed a bubbly voice, first thing on Halloween morning. \"I saw your ad. You're interested in a new roommate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust waking up, Simon was not at one hundred percentage capacity as he stared off into space at his doorway at...Nothing? He glanced around and realized he had to look down to see who had knocked at his door first thing in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was short. Short and round. She barely came up to Simon's chest in height, leaving him to notice her black mop of hair first. Her face wore a perpetual smile was full and soft with rosy cheeks and a cute little nose. She wore full black, with a top that exposed a fair amount of cleavage, a wool blouse, and a skirt with leggings. And she was thick all around, with curves that accented the outfit. She was probably bigger than Patricia, in that regard, with a soft gut. She looked like someone had taken a buxom woman and smushed her down to size, with her mass spilling outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's mind woke up enough to return the smile and offer his hand. \"Uh, yeah. Name's Simon Lewis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wendy Black,\" she said with much enthusiasm. She glanced over his shoulder. \"Wow, this place already looks great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon found himself giving a tour in his pajamas, though Wendy didn't seem to mind. She was overjoyed with the place and explained a little more of her own history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in her late twenties and had just been through a bad breakup with her ex. She had been sleeping on a friend's couch all this time and was super eager to have a place of her own, for a change. This lead to her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can play you last month's rent as well as this one's if I can start moving in today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something a little odd about the request, but the promise of that extra income was too good for Simon to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that works. Do you, huh, need help moving in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you sweet? I could just eat you up. But, no. I have it all worked out. I'll be back this afternoon with a check too. I can't wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey parted by shaking hands as Simon's morning mind slowly caught up with the fact that he had a new roommate. And a strange, at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she said at the door and turned around. \"And, just for your own safety, I wouldn't touch my stuff if we're going to be living together. Not because I'm some sort of crazy OCD person, but I just don't want to see you get...Hurt in anyway, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she said things like that, Simon couldn't help but feel the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. Though his muddled mind would forget that rule in about a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! See you soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Simon watched Wendy waddle out the door, he turned to get a proper start to his day and forget all about her until she returned with her furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new roommate meant new living rules and, of course, there was going to be some bumps in the road along the way. Simon was definitely the type to forget about the \"don't touch my stuff\" rule after living such an open lifestyle with Kim for so long. The only question is, in what way would Simon break that one rule?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of weeks living together, Simon eventually...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It started when finals were rearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith finals came late nights and cramming. And, as an engineering major in his junior year of university, Simon was no exception to that rule. And he had come to learn a few things about Wendy, even with his nose in his laptop and books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, she was rarely around. It felt, at times, that she was just using the apartment for space and a place to sleep. That worked perfectly fine for Simon, as he needed all the quiet he could get. She kept to her own bedroom most of the time and pitched in her share for the cooking. But the bedroom stayed locked and Simon hadn't bothered to look inside to see what she had done with the decorating yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor two, she definitely wasn't a college student. That was obvious enough given her age. But Simon hadn't even gotten around to asking what she did for a living. She was able to conjure up the cash to cover the last month's and current month's rent with little issue. And, judging by her clothing, she wasn't exactly hurting in finances. Simon just figured the conversation would come out naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo long as there was quiet in the apartment and the cash came in, Simon was happy to follow the simple ground rules set by Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Until he ran out of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" he muttered as he tapped the bottom of the container for the measly crumbs of beans left. \"Now what am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 2 AM and the late night studying was just getting underway. That also meant the closest places Simon could think of were closed and he didn't feel like going out at this hour of night. No coffee meant he might as well tried to go to bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that fit of desecration, he turned to breaking the one rule set by Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabinets in the kitchen were divided so that each of them would provide their own foods for the week. While most of Simon's stash consisted of cereal and pasta, Wendy had a far larger variety despite moving in only a couple of weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we got...Wild rice...Spices...Bread crumbs...Tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't coffee, like Simon had hoped. But the large container of tea had caught his eye. He held up and read some foreign brand that he had never heard of before. His eyes lit up as they caught the words \"caffeinated\" next to the logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, he was already heating up the water and soaking the teabag in it, making sure to add in a few spoonfuls of sugar for good measure. It was some sort of green tea, by the lovely emerald color the water turned. And smell reminded Simon of lavender flowers. It didn't even taste half bad, with Simon never having been a tea guy before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with his substance for the evening, Simon moved to return to his homework. Only to be unaware of the events set in motion.</span></div></div>",

Essay written and belly warm from some surprisingly good tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around noon when Simon stirred again, head slammed against his desk and an evergrowing drool puddle next to his books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked a few times as he stared off into the clock on his cellphone, slowly processing what that meant until it hit him like an ice cube sliding down his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit! I'm going to be late for class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scrambled to his feet and made for his bedroom to get changed to catch his bus. Throwing off his loose fitting pajamas, Simon was surprised to find that he had a tiny pot belly growing underneath his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta lay off all the pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was a bit more unusual than what Simon's comments let on. Simon was always a spectacularly average man. Standing at 5'10 and being 162 pounds, he was of slim build and basic stature. He had fair brown hair and simple features with nothing in particular that made him stand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in the course of one night, Simon had put on a whopping fifteen pounds like he was experiencing the freshman fifteen again. This was in addition to a drop in two inches of height, making Simon both slightly smaller but that much larger, by perspective at 5'8 and 177 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that, he was content with ignoring all that and continuing along his merry way. He would exercise later and forget all about it. He didn't even think it was weird that his jeans felt a little long on him while the waist cut into his gut. There were more important things to worry about, like exams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was about to have more to worry about.</span></div></div>",

At one point, he even had to undo the top button of his pants to let his stomach breathe. But it wasn't without good things too. Despite the pop quiz he faced in statistics, he found himself passing it with surprising ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if he was feeling slightly smarter than usual, even with the late night he had beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, of course, the day eventually ended with even more homework to do and tests to study for. Simon had a weird craving for the tea he had tried the night before. It's odd flavor was on the tip of his tongue as he stepped inside for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can order a pizza too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a surprise to find that Wendy was also home, having just arrived from whatever her day job was. She looked fairly dressed up like she had been out on the town, outfit exposing just the right amount of cleavage to cause Simon to look the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Simon,\" she said with a pleased tone. \"Everything good? You look a little...Sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird day,\" he replied, throwing his bag down and digging out his cellphone. \"But I feel fine.

Let me dig up my purse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, my treat,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, he was feeling a little guilty about her tea and was trying to make amends in a subtle way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was completely unaware that Wendy had already gone into the cabinet and seen one of her teabags missing. She kept a perfect count of everything she owned, after all. If Simon had been paying attention while he dialed, he might have noticed Wendy staring right at him. Studying him, almost.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While they waited for their pizzas, Wendy calmly started cooking up some of her tea. She continued to study Simon out of the corner of her eye. He was playing on his phone and not paying her much mind, though still shifting uncomfortably in his clothes. He only looked up when Wendy approached him with two cups of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she said with a coy smile. \"I made some for you since you're treating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Simon accepted the cup. \"Thanks! What, uh, what is this if you don't mind me asking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a special little recipe I have. You've been getting into it, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I mean...No...How could you tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just laughed and said. \"That was my one rule for living here, so of course I was going to keep track of it. Do you have any idea what this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Damn good tea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really haven't noticed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noticed what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you are even more oblivious than my last boyfriend. Just drink the tea and observe yourself for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon gave her a furrowed brow and then looked closer at the cup of tea in his hand. It looked the same as it did last night, nothing different with its dull crimson color. He only drank it when he saw Wendy do the same, confirming that it wasn't poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough it tasted no different than the night before. Same lavender taste that was strangely sweet and comforting. He finished the whole cup before Wendy could even down three sips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" continued Simon. \"What are you going on about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand up for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon obeyed and immediately was overcome by a sense of lightheadedness. He had been sitting before when he had first tried the tea and much too distracted with his homework to fully notice the changes that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the sound of bones rearranging themselves as Simon first noticed his level of perspective was slightly diminishing. Or rather, he first thought Wendy was growing. She had gone from his chest level to just under his chin as he dropped to around 5'6, getting rather short for a guy his age. His clothes became looser, though his bloated gut prevented his jeans from sliding off. The neck of his T-shirt was starting to show his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation of feeling drained was completely overcome by a very filling impression, like Simon had just eaten a large meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands pressed against his stomach as it bloated outwards, popping the button of his jeans. His thighs began to swell too, as did his entire bottom making it feel quite cramped in his pants indeed. The fainted tearing could be heard as the seams can a little undone. Overall, his entire weight plumpened up to 198 pounds, with most of that settling in below his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy stood by, calmly sipping at her tea and watching Simon. \"Fascinating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...What just happened to me?\" Simon cried, lifting up his shirt and looking at his new pudge. \"I'm a whale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, you're just fine. Just getting the curves in all the right places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you about touching my stuff, didn't I? Call this compensation for breaking my one rule. You're lucky that this is all that's going to happen to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many things that Simon could ask about his predicament, but he started with the most pressing on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Wendy gave him another smirk. \"I was going to save this until at least a month of living together and introduce the concept to you slowly. But I'm kind of a witch, Simon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Surprise. That's kind of why I had to look for a new place after things didn't exactly go well with my boyfriend. And after I just got settled in this place, I have no desire to pack up and leave again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A witch,\" Simon repeated as his mind tried to adjust to the fact that such a person could exist. \"Well, can you change me back if you're a witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I can't do that, Simon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"</span></div></div>",

And your body has begun to change to reflect that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm becoming you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a sense,\" she shrugged. \"It's more so you're taking on attributes of me. You won't actually become my clone, I think. But we could be mistaken for sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why are you having me drink this more?\" Simon asked, staring into his empty cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part punishment. Firstly, his stuff isn't exactly easy to acquire, Simon. Secondly, because I needed to confirm that was what happened. This has never really happened before, to my knowledge. I needed to see the occurrence with my own eyes to fully understand what was going on. And thirdly, I'm going to need a little help creating the elixir to bring you back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? You're a witch, right? Can't you just magic it up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that simple, Simon. I'm a solo witch without a coven, meaning big spells and enchantments take a long time for me to conjure. Do you want to wait a full year to get back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon didn't even have to think about it. \"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'm going to need your help with this to make it go faster. Call it the cost of touching my stuff as well as an experiment to see what happens. I'm curious too what the final result will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon couldn't help but gulp at that statement. Despite still towering over her, Wendy was starting to feel very imposing indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" he said. \"I'll do whatever you want then to get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny how you think you have a choice,\" replied Wendy. \"But we'll be in agreement then.

And you promised it was your treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon sighed in defeat and adjusted his shirt. He looked like a mess, given everything he was wearing was a mismatch and falling apart at the seams. The pizza guy certainly gave him a strange look and Simon could have sworn he heard \"should you really be eating pizza\" behind the door as he left. <i>It's not my fault I pissed off a witch, guy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Simon returned to the kitchen with both pies, Wendy also arrived with her own package in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she said. \"You looked a little uncomfortable in all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy offered him a pair of her own oversized sweatpants and a T-shirt to match. While it was true that Simon's jeans had exploded and his own shirt was much too big for him, he wasn't exactly excited at the prospect of dressing up in Wendy's own clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only going to get worse from here, Simon. You might as well get used to it. These are too big for me, but they should work just fine for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned but traded the pizza to Wendy for the leisure outfit, scuffling off into the bathroom. Once there, he could assess the damage done to his own clothes, and his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last cup of tea, his lower half had ballooned outwards giving him a distinct pear shape, though still nowhere near as wide as Wendy. He had to be mindful where he was turning, unused to the extra inches on his backside bumping into things. Removing his jeans, he found his boxers still holding up the fight and decided to leave them on. The jeans, however, were totally destroyed with the front button missing and the seam on the butt torn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweatpants Wendy had provided him were, at least, neutral grey in color and looks. They came up a little short on his ankles, though he dreaded the thought of them coming to fit him better as time went on. But they were certainly wide enough to hold on him and he even had to tie the waist tighter despite his extra plush. He reluctantly traded his T-shirt for a smaller sized black v-neck. It left a little room in the front for where cleavage was supposed to be. <i>Am I going to grow boobs too?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon returned to the kitchen to find Wendy snacking on her pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, isn't that better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" he admitted. \"But what? I'm just going to wear your clothes while I slowly become you? Won't people notice I'm missing? And I got exams to worry about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, I already gave this some thought. It'll be simple...\"</span></div></div>",

Simon did his best to return to his studying. However, his new body was proving a bit distracting. The clothes made it a little more bearable, but he wasn't used to dealing with my cushion in his seat. His boxers continued to ride up all evening until he eventually caved and called it an early night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Wendy was already in the kitchen, bright and early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are,\" Wendy chimed with a mug of tea ready. \"Don't you have to get to class in an hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you my mother?\" Simon asked, snatching the tea away. \"I got plenty of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we still got to make sure my solution works. And something tells me you don't want to be wearing my pajamas all day, so we need to find something that will fit you. Especially after your tea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon grunted and sipped down the lavender tea like he was drinking medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of them waited patiently until he had gulped the last of it down. Wendy waddled up to him, looking a lot closer than she had just a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was focusing, Simon could feel the changes happen this time. It started like a warm spot in the pit of the stomach and then spread like fire through all the tips of his body. Until he felt like a toasty marshmallow, soft in the middle and being pressed down from above by a gentle, unseen force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis field of vision dropped another couple precious inches as Wendy seemed to grow right before his eyes, reaching the bottom of his lips in height. No longer did she seem quite so tiny at his new scale of 5'4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of that lost mass did it's work filled him out. He could feel his arms and legs plumpen up and his waist widen another couple of inches until the once comfortable tie around his hips was starting to dig slightly. Most different of all was with his head, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hair,\" Simon said as his brow was covered in brown locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he brushed it from his eyes, he found a large mop of hair waiting for him. It looked as if he had skipped getting a haircut for almost half a year. Three new inches of hair tickled the back of his neck and he brushed it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" muttered Wendy. \"You appear to be taking on other traits of mine now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, can't we just have me drink a bunch of tea right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be incredibly dangerous, considering I only have a cup a day myself. We continue with that until you start to develop magical aptitude and can help me with channeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be able to do magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to focus, Simon,\" Wendy groaned and offered him a new pile of clothes. \"Here, put these on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe provided him with some jeans that looked a little large on him, given the waistline. But Wendy also had the foresight to give him a belt to go with it. As he unraveled the pants, Simon found something else in the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" he held up what looked like an emerald amulet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your charm. Put it on and come to the mirror with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon did as was told, the jeans were a little large as expected. But he imagined he would fill them up soon. He then waddled out of the bedroom with the amulet on and joined Wendy next to the mirror...Only to see his old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It works,\" Wendy smirked. \"Perfect. Whoever wears that amulet will now look exactly like you as an illusion. I suppose I don't have to tell you not to lose it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to,\" he growled. \"Why not just use this to get me back to normal though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you might notice, you're not exactly normal. It's just a glamour, not a physical change. You're still you underneath it. It's not much, but it should prove enough to get you through your classes. So long as no one touches you and breaks the illusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon sighed and looked down at the piece of jewelry dangled in his loose-fitting shirt. It was all that was keeping him from soiling his reputation around school. There was no telling how his friends would react to seeing him like this and he dreaded losing the fragile thing. Or worse, breaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it would have to do until Wendy could fix things.</span></div></div>",

Since the morning tea, his overall weight had pumped him up beyond the two hundred markers to 212, the heaviest he had ever been. And, with his shorter height to boot, Simon was feeling every bit of that extra fluff as he waddled between the classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Wendy\u2019s charm was doing its job. No one was batting an eye at Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, no one seemed to be paying him much attention at all. That had to do with the added effect Wendy had enchanted into the glamour, to prevent people from looking too closely at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Simon continued with his classes, attempting to put the fact of slowly becoming a different person out from his mind. He found a new hobby of fiddling with his longer hair when he was bored in class, though he continued to endlessly shift around in his seat from the excess chub cushioning his bottom. He could almost swear that he was getting bigger over the course of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust have to put up with this for like a month...Had to piss off a stupid witch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, class was proving to be easier than usual for Simon. He found himself grasping the lectures without having to pay much attention. Wendy\u2019s intellect was starting to wear off on him without him even realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, with that, came a sense of boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon couldn\u2019t well play on his phone in the middle of class, so when fiddling with his hair lost his interest, he turned to the amulet instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at the end of Physic 201 that the first incident happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile flicking at the amulet, the green emerald suddenly started to glow. Though it wasn\u2019t bright enough to attract attention, Simon quickly grasped it tight to hide it from sight. He smothered it in his loose fitting shirt until the bell rang and quickly excused himself from class first. Him being in a rush was his first mistake as he was so focused on escaping class, he didn\u2019t watch where he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Simon--Omph!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon saw too late the average sized rack of his old roommate, Kim. Indeed, Simon found he had to be looking up at her to meet her eyes now. Though, through his error, the glowing amulet grazed Kim. Combined with his earlier fiddling, this led to a slight malfunction with the magic...</span></div></div>",

That was when he looked down and noticed what was on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t those Kim\u2019s clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon had been roommates with Kim long enough to recognize her usual outfits. And laying on the floor, in a heap, was her jeans and the plaid button shirt he remembered her wearing a bunch of times. In addition, he spied her bra amongst the folds. That\u2019s when his amulet started pulsing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, people were starting to pour out of the classroom and there was no time to think here in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Simon leaned over to gather up everything and waddled all the way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do this time?\u201d asked Wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d Simon protested. \u201cI just bumped into a friend outside of a classroom and she suddenly...Vanished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me see the necklace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon obeyed, handing over the amulet while still holding onto Kim\u2019s clothes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wendy stood deep in thought. Her chin rested on her closed left fist and her right hand, closed around the amulet, pressed against her left arm. This resulted in her right arm stretching under and push up her hefty cleavage. Simon could feel his face turning red as he tried - and failed - to avoid staring at her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing,\u201d Wendy sighed after a minute. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep on it and should have an idea in the mor-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off as the little emerald on the amulet flashed bright light across the room. With the light a surge of energy, like a strong wind, swept over the room. The force buffeted Simon forcing him a step back. More importantly, he felt it change him as it poured into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body began to shift once more much more drastically this time. At this point he\u2019d gained an additional 70 pounds and lost almost eight inches in height and his hair was longer than it\u2019d been in ages. While this was all very drastic in and of itself, it weirdness was partially mitigated as it was spread out over the course of almost four days. However, in mere seconds, he changed even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hair burst from his scalp extending well past his shoulders in waves of chestnut brown as it lightened a few shades. He felt his bones pop and shift and his muscles stretch uncomfortably as he regained some of his height, jumping back up to 5\u20196\u201d. At the same time, Simon\u2019s body surge outward swelling with additional mass. His already thick legs grew thicker, pressing together and stretching the seams of his pants. He hips bulged wider, accompanied by his back stretching further from his back, growing rounder and heavier. His round tummy surged forward, bursting the button of his pants and shooting it across the room, and oozing out in a pale jiggly sphere. His arms thickened, his hands growing pudgier and somehow daintier. Simon could feel his face shift as its structure rearranged itself into a far more feminine appearance, his lips plumping up, and his cheeks rounding and developing a double chin. Most awkwardly was his chest: it began to swell into two perky obvious breasts that he - almost shamefully - recognized from many a fantasy and oogle-ings as Kim\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractically nude now, what with his growth all but destroying his clothes, and his body jiggling and looking very feminine after gaining another 125 pounds, Simon heard a voice. Not from Wendy or from the hall or from anywhere in the building but instead in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I? This is my old apartment...who are you!?\u201d Kim spoke into his mind, somehow looking through his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, Kim! Are you ok?!\u201d Simon blurted to the room before clamping his hands over his mouth as he spoke in Kim\u2019s voice, though a bit deeper. \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon? Where are you? Why do you sound like that? Why can\u2019t I move my body? What happened?\u201d Kim panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimon? Are you ok?\u201d Wendy said, looking at him worriedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I think Kim is in my head\u2026\u201d Simon muttered in shock. He was not wrong. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After about half an hour of panic on everyone\u2019s part, things had calmed down. Simon was standing in the bathroom room, examining his reflection in the mirror. He looked like a strange amalgamation of himself, Wendy, and Kim. His hair was lighter than normal but darker than Kim\u2019s and closer to her length and style. His face was very round and feminine with chubby cheeks, a double chin, and plump seductive lips like Wendy but covered in Kim\u2019s freckles. His left eye was dark brown, his natural color, but his right was bright blue, a dead ringer for Kim\u2019s eye. Under it all, his general facial structure was similar to his. He could easily pass for a cousin of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body was another story. He adjusted to Kim\u2019s normal height of 5\u20196\u201d and his already chubby 220 pound had bloated with an additional 125 pounds - Kim\u2019s normal weight. He had remained definitely bottom heavy, gaining nearly all that added mass to his hips, ass, thighs, and tummy while his breasts (he had breasts!) were a dead ringer for Kim\u2019s. Weider still, he still had his own manhood though for how long he did not know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the amulet, unable to store Kim\u2019s essence, channeled her into you,\u201d Wendy explained once more from across the room. She was hesitant to get near him for fear that the magic may react oddly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do we fix this?\u201d Kim asked him. Oddly enough, he had quickly adjusted to having her in his head. It felt almost natural? Simon felt that should scare him but it didn\u2019t. It was kind of comforting having her there. Kim was rather calm as well, having been able to see his memories of the past few days to get caught up to speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim wants to know how to fix this,\u201d Simon relayed, stepping out of the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I have no idea,\u201d Wendy stammered. \u201cThis has never happened before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should mess with the amulet again. If that did this, it should be able to undo it,\u201d Kim urged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Simon told her, frowning. Seeing the confused expression on Wendy\u2019s face, he explained Kim\u2019s idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no no,\u201d Wendy said shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go see someone. A colleague of sorts and have them look at the amulet. Maybe they can help. Just...stay here and don\u2019t do anything that might make this worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Simon or Kim could protest, the very flustered Wendy had already gathered her things and left. Simon absentmindedly rubbed at his belly as it growled, hardly noticing that his weight was still ticking upward and that his lost another inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we should eat something then,\u201d Simon said to the Kim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of hungry too but we certainly don\u2019t need to be eating. We\u2019re huge,\u201d Kim retorted, frustrated. \u201cShe\u2019s not very good at this witch thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s trying,\u201d Simon defended Wendy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Patricia has been going through a wiccan or something phase,\u201d Kim remembered. \u201cMaybe she can do something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI highly doubt that Patricia would know more than Wendy,\u201d Simon laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s eat something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr we could drink more tea,\u201d Kim urged. \u201cLet\u2019s just get this \u2018transformation\u2019 over with, go into her room and find her spellbook or whatever, and fix this ourselves!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a really bad idea,\u201d Simon worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, we gotta do something other than stuff our fat face!\u201d Kim snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was always rather chill, a more go with the flow kind of guy, while Kim was more assertive and wanted to get things done. What do the two of them decide on?</span></div></div>",

Simon and Kim were always good at finding them with each other. Though Simon was the one in control and driving, he wasn\u2019t sure if that would always be the case. With elements of both Wendy and Kim making up his body, a part of him felt like he was fading away. Not so much that his mind was vanishing, just that it felt like there was less of him in the mix between the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to pay it no mind as they dug through Wendy\u2019s laundry pile left out in the living room during the hour they spent figuring things out. Kim helped him sort through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving the weight and more weight than Wendy, most of her clothing was far too small and he felt very compacted inside them. But, eventually, they were able to find stuff that would work for the purposes of getting to Patricia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stuffed their wide hips and thighs into the largest pair of sweatpants they could find, though even that was a little too short as it went up past their ankles. They had to wear a bra now and Simon struggled with slipping it on while Kim guided him with instructions in their head. For shirts, Simon picked out a large hoodie that would do enough to cover them up. Nothing said \u201cleave me alone\u201d like sweatpants and a hoodie. For shoes, Kim\u2019s own sneakers thankfully managed to fit on their feet which had shrunk to match her size more or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an outfit sorted out, they took their first steps together out into the world as a chimera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Simon noticed was that there was a lot more jiggling to their steps than he was used to. The second were the eyes on him. Even dressed as they were, he still sensed the lingering gaze from men they passed by. Specifically on their rump, which was almost rivaling Wendy\u2019s in scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim seemed to sense his discomfort. \u201cNot so easy, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. Let\u2019s just get some food first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small bakery near the shopping district that Simon rarely frequented, but he knew it for the smell of fresh bread every time he passed by it while on the town. Their mouth watered as they stepped in to the scent of some baking cinnamon buns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy?\u201d called a voice from the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bakery was entirely empty, save for the young blonde girl working the register. She looked like a freshman in college doing her first part time to pay for classes and was quite petite. She had very little meat to her and was short. Shorter than Simon, but not as short as Wendy. But, given their increase in weight, Simon felt like three times the clerk\u2019s size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d the girl said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I thought you were my boss for a second. You kind of look like her. A little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWendy?\u201d Simon realized what was going on. They had stumbled into where Wendy worked. \u201cOh, that\u2019s because I\u2019m...Her sister. Simone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Kim asked in their head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here to pick up some fresh rolls. Wendy asked me to. She\u2019s got a vendor she\u2019s bringing them to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d the girl said. \u201cAlright, ma\u2019am. There\u2019s a batch just coming out of the oven now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Kim sighed in their head. \u201cYou\u2019re such a pig. Why don\u2019t you just buy them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was too busy practically drooling over the thought of having an entire tray to himself to pay Kim much mind. There was some deep hunger awakening in him and he rubbed their hands together as the clerk disappeared in the back to collect his prize. After getting them in this mess, Wendy could owe them a few free rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, things weren\u2019t quite that simple.</span></div></div>",

Their body was shared and she could experience Simon was, including the softness of the buttery rolls as they hit the bottom of their stomach. But she also noticed another thing that Simon failed to catch while stuffing their face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started as a soft tingle and got more pronounced as Simon polished off six of the thirteen rolls. They were shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim thought she noticed it in the apartment when Wendy left, but now she was certain. Looking through their eyes, the world around them grew with every pastry. Pretty soon, they were down inches from their old height of 5\u20196 and fitting more comfortably in the once too short sweatpants. But it didn\u2019t stop there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they shrunk downwards, Kim could feel them growing more outwards. The fabric of their loose clothing filled up with their wide hips expanding more and digging into the boxers Simon had them still wearing. Kim watched their bustline increase as it took up more of her field of vision as Simon looked down. Her bra was starting to feel more uncomfortable and tight to wear as they shot up a few cup sizes, with the cleavage spilling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was more, their hair color was starting to darken to a deeper brown, closer to Wendy\u2019s black hair. And, if Kim really focused, she could even feel what was below their waistline start to recede until there wasn\u2019t much left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim didn\u2019t think to interrupt them until Simon had brought them to about 5\u20190 tall with E cups and closer to 360 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Simon, I think you should stop.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Simon is...Asleep right now. I\u2019m the one in control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim could only sit back in horror as their body moved under some sinister influence. It stretched around and admired itself in a nearby mirror on the side street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said their body. \u201cI could grow to like this. I never thought about using magic to make myself bigger. This could be a fun little experiment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Kim. \u201cWhat are you doing in our body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, I\u2019m Wendy, of course.

I make up most of the percentage of this body, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat much was true. Since consuming the rolls and jumpstarting the transformation, Simon\u2019s influence had dwindled on their combined form until it was almost nonexistent. Kim slight made up a fair portion of their body, but it was Wendy who was dominating and giving them their shape. Kim guessed she made up 80% of their body, while Kim offered 15% and Simon barely 5%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d asked Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t know.

He felt...heavy. Not just physically but mentally too. It was like a thick fog was coating his mind. Everything felt distant and far off, like in a dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKim,\u201d he said quietly, still confused. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you made a pig of yourself, figuratively and literally,\u201d she barked. A moment later, in more calm and friendly voice, she continued. \u201cYou started eating those rolls and spaced out. While you were eating we got shorter and fatter. Also, well, we\u2019re all girl now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Simon said quietly, with a blush. Now that she had said it, he was starting to notice. His perspective had shifted entirely, everything appearing bigger around him, but at the same time he felt huge, stuffed and bloated from the rolls, and felt like he took up too much space. And, as what Kim had told him, his boxers were much roomier in front now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok, Simon?\u201d Kim asked, concern flavoring her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he said moment later and started to continue on the trip to Patricia\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou feel...further away,\u201d Kim told him. \u201cIt\u2019s like, I could feel your mind in here before and it was weird but I got used to it.

His mind drifted a bit and Kim took his place at the helm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s fix,\u201d Kim said aloud, their voice a tad bit more feminine, and pushed out with more vigor and speed than Simon had exerted since they left the apartment. \u201cAnd thank you for trusting me, Simon\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all good,\u201d he mumbled, drifting into a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched the trip through a fog, aware of everything but sort of numb to it all. It was peaceful; for the first time since he\u2019d drank Wendy\u2019s tea (and probably for a while before that) he felt truly relaxed. He was just along for the ride, no responsibilities since Kim was handling it. A part of him knew this was wrong and that he should be concerned by his lack of involvement but he just mentally waved it away. He figured he\u2019d deal with it later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis focus returned as Kim stepped into her and Patricia\u2019s apartment. Patricia stood up to greet her looking confused. The confusion worsened as Kim explained their predicament before quickly turning to shock. Patricia moved about, grabbing a large heavy looking book and flipping through the pages. Kim stepped up behind her, trying to read over her shoulder but the words were gibberish to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon barely noticed any of this as all of this attention was on Patricia herself. The world around him was blurry and unfocused but Patricia crystal clear in his view, his heart (if he had one in this odd mindscape) beating faster. Patricia, being home alone and enjoying some peace and quiet., was dressed in lazy, skimpy, comfy wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia, normally short but now actually taller than Kim and Simon, was a rather chubby girl. She was rather busty, easily beating Kim\u2019s perky C cups with her hefty D cups, and had a round pot belly, the result of gluttonous snacking and regular partying,  that she often tried to hide but did little to actually make it go away. Her weight settled mostly on her lower half however, lending her wide hips, thick thunder thighs, and a curvy fat ass. Now in the comfort of her own home Patricia was dressed only in her panties, pink and lacey and sinking in her round bottom, and a tight wife beater, stretched thin across her braless tits and riding up her chunky muffin top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon\u2019s feelings for Kim and Patricia were mixed and confusing. Despite being the best of friends, Kim and Patricia were the opposites. Kim was tall and thin with the focus and determination to excel at her studies and the self-discipline to not \u201clet herself go\u201d. Patricia was short and fat with little concern for her academic future or dim intellect and was more than happy indulge in her temptations of sloth, gluttony, and lust. Simon himself was attracted to both. Kim, the model beauty, had been constant distraction for Simon\u2019s hormone addled brain when they\u2019d lived together and Patricia, the pudgy cutie, was adorable in ditzy way and drove him wild with her bouncing and jiggling curves. He\u2019d often found it hard not to stare and look like a creep or saying something silly and embarrassing himself when he was with one the girls one-on-one but when they hung out together, which was often, he found the safest course of action was to avoid them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, seeing Patricia exposed and on display as she was and his own brain plagued by all sorts of mixed up hormones, Simon felt overwhelmed. Kim, so focused on her discussion with Patricia, didn\u2019t notice as their right hand twitched, driven by Simon\u2019s subconscious will.</span></div></div>",

Simon curled their toes as the warm energy spread to every tip of their body, with their crotch as the epicenter of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel themselves growing. Not just outwards, but upwards as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon doubled over as their muffin top swelled out of their pants. Their butt was looking more like a bean bag chair stuffed into the back of their sweatpants as it puffed out. Taking from Patricia\u2019s body shape, most of the weight settled into their legs to give their combined appearance more a pear shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir pants rode up past their ankles as the sleeves of the hoodie almost reached their elbows. A large portion of the mass from Patricia had been converted into height to give their body more mobility. With every inch, Simon found it hard to keep focused and think straight. He was starting to feel rather wet as he looked down to see their cleavage growing from under the neck of their sweater. Their clothing was starting to feel rather small, indeed. Almost child-sized, given how they had exploded out of them with the outfit barely holding on by the seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of it, their total height had exploded to 5\u20198 and their weight a whooping 450 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon collected himself a little as the voices in his head moaned. Kim was feeling every aspect of the changes and enjoying. He quickly recognized the second voice as Patricia, who had now become stuck with them just like Kim was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Patricia asked. \u201cOh, nevermind.

And then below. The thrill of the hunt faded, replaced by a new, stronger sensation that practically made their knees buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole world shrank around them as Simon held their arms out and let the changes overwhelm him. They weren\u2019t growing outwards as much as before. The girl had been far too skinny to add anything else to their impressive curves. Instead, most of her mass added to their height. The sweatpants and shirt they were wearing finally gave way as they grew another head in height. Simon was thrilled at the prospect of being taller than when he was a man, and their head now almost brushed the ceiling as scraps of clothes floated to the ground.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6\u20194 and 530 pounds. A true giantess with all the soft curves in the right places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon undid the tiny bra still clasped uncomfortable around their chest, letting their breasts bounced free. Everything was feeling quite small around them, and soft and warm. If he listened closely, he could hear Kim and Patricia in the distance. It sounded like they were comforting the poor girl that they had added to their body but they were far enough away that Simon couldn\u2019t hear the words. They would fill her in that it wasn\u2019t all bad to be sharing a body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get dressed then, shall we girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding naked in a bakery didn\u2019t have much appeal and, after cleaning up their remains and tossing them in the trash, Simon ducked into the backroom with the kitchen. He grabbed a large apron for them from the wall that just barely covered them. There was also a janitor\u2019s outfit from the storage, which looked like it belong to a large overweight man. Even then, it was still a little tight on them but better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Simon finished up, the bell sounded from the main counter. He smirked. A new customer! Or more prey...</span></div></div>",

It will help calm you down a bit.\" she said getting up and presenting the chair to Simon. He looked the pizza for a very long time, before Wendy basically shoved him to the chair \"Eat the pizza.

Even if I'm a one-coven-witch I could do some trick, you know?\" she said chuckling <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon shocked his head and rose:\"Listen Wendy... I don't know. This seems like a big thing. This could go really wrong. I-I...maybe it's better if we leave things like they are now. I will simply drink more tea and...and..something will go right....right?\" he said nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy reached for Simon's arm with both hands:\"Simon..Simon...this is the only way so no one get hurt. Relax, you and me can manage it. Just give me one week, ten days the most, and your will return to your good old Simon. Okay?\" she said in a gentle tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon surrendered to Wendy's logic:\"OK...\" he said beaten with a sad look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy shacked Simon's arm:\"It's going to be all right. Don't worry\" then she paused \"Well...there is a down-side actually..this will get me drained a bit. So I will need to say here and rest.

First thing\u2019s first though. We need to erase you from everyone\u2019s memories. Now, sit tight while I get my spellbook.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy disappeared while Simon finished off the rest of his pizza. He found that these changes brought with them a surprising new appetite and briefly wondered if he should be worried about that. But he quickly deposited the thought when Wendy returned with a large, brown tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst we need a little of your hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plucked one without even giving Simon a moment to prepare. She then held it triumphantly as she recited some strange words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYromem morf nam siht esare!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hair between Wendy\u2019s fingertips glowed an eerie green as all the lights in the apartment dimmed slightly. Simon nervously munched on his pizza as it felt like there was a draft in their living room with his hair standing on end. Oddest of all was Wendy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes had taken on the same unnerving jade as Simon\u2019s hair. What was more, Simon could have sworn she was shrinking. Not in height but in...Weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the pounds were just dropping off Wendy like the best diet plan ever. Her black attire was starting to look very loose the longer she continued the spell. After awhile, she could almost pass as a healthy weight, though still with a little chub to her. Especially in her bust, which remained untouched the entire process and the new largest part of her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let go of the hair and caught her breath, causing everything to return to normal. Though she kept at the same thinner size, having looked to drop over a hundred pounds in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d she said. \u201cI might have overdone it, but I wanted to be safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Simon gawked at the literal bombshell of the woman before him. She was just chubby enough to be cute. \u201cWhat did, uh, what did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think magic is free? It takes a lot of energy to cast spells. And I use natural energy which I store up in my body as reserves. You\u2019re going to have to learn to do this too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still many questions Simon had to do but Wendy silenced him with a single finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, go to bed. I\u2019m exhausted and need my rest. We\u2019ll work on your \u2018persona\u2019 in the morning. And have more tea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon gulped and retreated into his room. Even tired and smaller, Wendy seemed even more dangerous than she had before. At least he didn\u2019t have to worry about doing homework for a little while, considering Simon no longer existed. Though he could only dread what sort of plan Wendy had to get him to pose as her sister in the morning. He couldn\u2019t change that much in time, could he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside the poorly sealed package, sitting in a  pile of foam packing peanuts, was a an ornate glass lamp. It was probably a foot tall and pear shaped. The thick glass was a dark blue, almost dark enough to make it hard to see through, and accented by silver gildings. It was rather heavy and surprisingly warm to the touch. Simon could just see what looked like a cloudy mist filling the bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. This is\u2026.weird to say the least,\u201d Simon mumbled to himself. He gave the box a once over, noticing for the first time that there was no labels anywhere. \u201cEven weirder\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon bounced the bottle from hand to hand. All forms of common sense told him not to open the mystery bottle filled with an unknown gas that arrived on his doorstep with know return address but his curiosity was stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, curiosity killed the cat,\u201d he said and popped the open the bottle. The mist poured out quickly and pooled in the floor in front of him. Before his eyes the mist rose up and took a rather curvy humanoid shape before coalescing into a person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, master!\u201d the pretty girl said in a sing song voice put on a very cringy, anime worthing pose. She probably would\u2019ve been about 5\u20196\u201d had she been standing flat footed on the floor. Instead, she floated about six inches above the ground with bare feet and well manicured toes, painted a bright blue, trailing mist. She was rather busty, probably a good bit bigger than Lisa, with curvy hips and legs to match while her tummy the tiniest bit of pudge. She was wearing a simple blue sundress that accented her curves and contrasted with her dark skin. Compared to her skin, her hair was a bright blonde pile of curls that framed her cute face, her plump lips curled into a genuine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-master?\u201d Simon managed to stutter, not only off put by the term and the rather attractive girl that manifested in his living room but also the odd way most seemed to surround her. Every now and then parts of her form appeared to flicker, as if the mist she had formed from was thinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d she giggled. \u201cBut I guess I should explain. My name is Geneva and I am a genie! As the one the found and opened my lamp, you are awarded three wishes!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA genie, huh\u2026\u201d Simon said, the possibilities running through his head. \u201cSo, I assume there are some rules?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re quick, I like you,\u201d Geneva giggled with a flirty wink. \u201cOf course there are. First of all, you only get three wishes. There\u2019s no way around. You can\u2019t wish for more or repeats or a different genie or whatever clever idea you think you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Simon said, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecond, no messing with life or death. No raising the dead and certainly no killing,\u201d Geneva read off a list. Simon didn\u2019t notice when it happened but Geneva was reading a long scroll and wearing glasses. She continued reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThird, no unlimited power. You can\u2019t wish to control reality or become a god or something. Genies themselves aren\u2019t all powerful so they very well can\u2019t give you a power they don\u2019t have themselves. Besides, all power has a price and we\u2019ve had far too many complaints over the years. Which leads to the next and final rule: after you make a wish you must wait 24 hours before making your next wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an odd one. Why do I have to wait that long?\u201d Simon questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo many complaints,\u201d Geneva sighed. \u201cMost people don\u2019t realize the consequences of their wishes, especially not in the long term. A young woman wishes for enormous breast and is more than pleased with them that day but a week later? She might have some regrets. Sure it\u2019s not that long but it\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, guess that's fair,\u201d Simon stuttered, flustered by the beautiful curvy genie and the her very odd and specific example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t be embarrassed, <i>Master,</i>\u201d she purred, putting emphasis on the master making him blush even more. \u201cA final disclaimer: I know a bit about you already. You know; your character, your dislikes, your likes...your fetishes. I already have a good idea about the kind of things you want to wish for so don\u2019t feel like you need to hold back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon stared at his new genie dumbfounded by her words. She was right after all; if she already knew his tastes there was no point holding back right? It occurred to him briefly that he could be hallucinating from the gas in the bottle but he waved the idea away. It didn\u2019t matter right now. He did have an idea already so he might as well give it a shot\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m thinking things like crop tops and showy v-necks for tops. For bottoms, tights and leggings and yoga pants or short shorts and skirts. Revealing, tight cocktail dresses and thin sundresses. Maybe a little more odd items like leotards and unitards. Tall strappy heels and the like. And, uh, no more bras. Oh! And lastly, I don\u2019t want much of society to change. Like I don\u2019t want things to get creepy or anything,\u201d Simon explained, starting to ramble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Geneva tapped her pen against her lips, thinking, after she finished writing. \u201cI can probably manage this. One knew wardrobe for all of society coming up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Geneva snapped her fingers and a flash of blue light filled the world. When it cleared, Simon was alone in his apartment holding the lamp. He heard Geneva\u2019s voice in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour wish is granted! I took a few liberties but I think you\u2019ll approve. I\u2019ll be back to check in on you and things in 24 hours.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simon was unsure of what to do. By himself, alone in the apartment, there was very little he could do find out if his wish came true but he had an idea. Grabbing the tv remote, her turned the tv on and tuned in to the news and his jaw dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather woman was currently standing in front of the map of the area doing her job. She was pretty woman, as most weather women seem to be: tan, blonde, tall, and slender with a nice curvy to her hips and perky C cups he\u2019d guess. Normally, she wore a simple but fashionable blouse, jacket, and skirt combo and, well, that\u2019s technically what she was wearing now. But different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skirt rode low on her hips and clung to their curve for only a few inches, barely reaching halfway down her thighs. Her long tanned legs, constricted by her skirt, shifted gracefully as she minced her way across the screen, every step producing a loud click from her high heels. Her blouse was a sheer white fabric tied off under her bust leaving her abdomen, a surprising soft layer of pudge normally hidden in by her previous attire now on display with a shiny belly button piercing. The top few buttons of her top were left open, displaying her soft tanned cleavage, and the sheer material did little to hide her dark nipples. She wore a tiny little jacket that covered her arms and shoulders but had no hope of closing over her modest bust. Simon also noticed she wore makeup and jewelry than before: thick eye shadow, mascara, and bright lipstick donned her face and she was wearing a number of rings and had a few new piercings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit, it worked,\u201d Simon cheered. His joy turned to mild confusion for a moment as he suddenly remembered this world. He had memories of his life in this new society, parallel to his own. As he intended, things weren\u2019t much different. If anything, as bizarre and ridiculous as it sounded even for this fantasy world he\u2019d created, it seemed things had improved as far a social stigmas and expectations regarding women and the way they presented themselves were concerned. A pleasant surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was snapped out of his thoughts by the sound of laughing and the door opening. Spinning on his heel, Simon had to control himself upon seeing his roommate Kim and her best friend Patricia enter the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim, a thin and athletic beauty that normally dressed rather conservatively, was wearing skin tight navy blue backless leotard, long legs, bubble butt,  and toned back on display. She clicked into the room on four inch stilettos, making her as tall as Simon, wearing more makeup than he had ever seen her wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia, a short and chubby girl, bounced behind Kim, her large braless D cups in neon pink halter crop top bouncing and jiggling wildly. Her round pudgy tummy was completely on display, bulging and rolling over the waistband of her very tight denim cutoffs, and her thick legs stood atop nearly six inch heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey Simon, I forgot you\u2019d be home,\u201d Kim laughed tossing her school bag down. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind that I brought Patricia over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course he doesn\u2019t mind! Simon, like, loves when I come,\u201d Patricia said, throwing her arms and him and pulling him into squishing hug. He felt her tummy against his erection and knew she felt it too. After a longer than necessary pause, Patricia continued with a giggle. \u201cOver, I mean. Like, Simon loves when I come over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh get a room you two,\u201d Kim laughed rolling her eyes, confusing Simon. True, Patricia was always a little flirty and like to joke about her and Simon, she\u2019d never gotten this physical before and Kim had never made a comment like that. The girls only continued to confuse the young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, there\u2019s no reason to leave you out, Kimmie,\u201d Patricia pouted, forcing a giggle from Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue. It\u2019d be fun but I do have homework to do,\u201d Kim sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can do that later!\u201d Patricia argued but Simon started to zone out as he pieced together what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHim and Patricia? Him and Kim? Him AND Kim and Patricia? He was starting to realize the girls were a bit more promiscuous and, well, slutty than before. That was certainly a surprise, though not unwelcome. </span></div></div>",

The device is a simple recording device but whatever is recorded becomes the truth, retroactively changing reality to fit. No one except the one who recorded the change will be aware of any changes unless the recorder make it so other will know in the recording. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recorder must record their desire for it work. For example, \u201cI am rich\u201d will make the recorder rich and no one will question their new wealth. On the other hand, \u201cI wish I was rich\u201d will do absolutely nothing as it is a wish and not a statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story will focus mostly on female expansion, weight gain, male to female transformations, M2BBW, mental changes and more. Generally anything on the interactive\u2019s main page is welcome as long as you follow the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote that you do not have to stay with the character as the Dictaphone can be lost, stolen, or given away and you are welcome to add more characters down the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Characters</b>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Simon</b> is a 20-year-old college student studying engineering and living in an apartment close to campus. He is generally a pretty average guy. He is 5\u201910\u201d, 160 pounds, and of average build. He gets above average grades with a little extra work and has have part time job where he works weekends in the campus bookstore. Simon has preference for larger, curvier girls and skinny girls getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Yuki</b> is a 19-year-old Japanese student studying dietetics living on campus with her roommate Cathy. She has long black hair and dark eyes and wears glasses. She is rather busty with F cups, but otherwise she is pretty petite as she is a thin 115 pounds and rather a short 5\u20192\u201d. She is generally pretty quiet and shy. While she is very proud of her bust, Yuki is self-conscious of her small height and frame and sometimes fantasizes about being bigger. (Note: her roommate Cathy is the same Cathy from the original Curve Controller but does not have her Gift in this storyline).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Zoey</b> is 18-year-old student studying the culinary arts living at home just off campus. She has short blonde hair and blue eyes and is rather pale. She loves food; mostly eating but also preparing it and sharing it with others. As such, she is a little chubby at 170 pounds and 5\u20195\u201d. She has C cups and round belly and a large butt giving her a slightly more pear shape. She is perfectly confident with her body and loves it. She can be selfish and greedy and tends to act before thinking which can get her and others into trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Joanna</b>, or <b>Jojo</b> she prefers, is 22-year-old sorority girl studying fashion. She a tall, fit girl at 6\u2019 even and 120 pounds. She has bright green eyes, dyes her hair blonde, and does her best to maintain a good tan throughout the year. Coming from a rather rich family, she has standards and often thinks she deserves the best. While not stupid, Jojo is kind of ditzy and na\u00efve leading most to refer to her as a bimbo behind her back. It doesn\u2019t help that she has pretty high libido. She tends to vain and arrogant at times, though she is secretly self-conscious of her thin and curveless body. Flat chested and with a narrow waist, flat butt, and narrow thighs, she would do anything do be curvier and reach or even surpass her standard of beauty. Despite all this she is kind at heart and wouldn\u2019t necessarily go out of her way to hurt someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of now, these four all attend the same University. Feel free to add more character if you want. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for now, who will find the Dictaphone first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had assumed it was for his roommate, Kim, as he didn\u2019t often get mail but his name was labeled clearly on the packaging. He was alone now, sitting on the futon of his apartment. It was a Thursday night so most of the people he knew would be home studying. Or in Kim\u2019s case she\u2019d be bartending late. So he really didn\u2019t have much else to rude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipping into the packaging and peeling open the box, Simon found a grey recording device inside. It was a simple design; the only buttons were record, stop, and play and there were no other features. No lines or seams or anything. Beneath it was a small piece of paper, a note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Record your deepest desires and make them real</i>,\u201d Simon read aloud, unamused. \u201cSounds like a crock of shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he was curious. Who sent? Why\u2019d they send? What was with the cheesy note? He leaned back and bounced the Dictaphone from hand to hand thinking of something to record. Looking around the small apartment, his eyes stopped on the kitchen sink and he frowned. It was piled high with dirty dishes. Kim had said she would clean those days ago. She was a good roommate and pretty cute, but a messy sink was a pet peeves of Simon\u2019s. Though it would be a perfect test, he thought. He pressed the record button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>The dishes in the sink are clean and put away</i>,\u201d he recorded, still skeptical. He pressed stop and heard a strange sparkling sound. It was barely audible and he had no idea where it came from. He stood up and looked around the room a little before he noticed the sink. The dishes were gone, the sink empty and clean. Curious he walked into the kitchen and checked the cupboards. Sure enough the dishes were there, clean and sparling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, ok,\u201d he said looking at the device again. \u201cSo it does work, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Simon do first? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simon bounced the Dictaphone up and down in his hand a few times. The note claimed that the device could make his deepest desires real. That was claiming a lot and, while cleaning he dishes was impressive, he needed to test it on something bigger. For something like that he needed to get out of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI am at the campus library,\u201d</i> Simon recorded. Like with the dishes, he heard a crackling sound when he his stop and then he blinked. When he opened his eyes he was sitting at a table in the library. He had his notebook and laptop set up like he\u2019d been there for a while already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon blinked a few times trying to adjust. That was a very disorientating experience but it was very clear that it worked. He smiled at the little device. <i>More experiments wouldn\u2019t hurt,</i> he thought.<i> I should test it on someone next. <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nHe scanned the room for a moment before setting his eyes on the librarian. Or rather the student working as the librarian. She a cute, if not plain, girl. She was tall, probably about 5\u20199\u201d and thin. She had light brown hair that was up in a messy bun and glasses and was wearing a baggy sweater and a pair of loose jeans. She fit the stereotypical librarian look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThe librarian is wearing a tight blue mini-dress,\u201d</i> Simon recorded. The device crackled and, in a blink, the librarian was now wearing a tight blue mini-dress. It clung to her slim frame, her hips barely showing and her B cups providing almost no cleavage in the deep neckline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon looked around the room. No one, not even the librarian, reacted. One girl looked up from her book and gave Simon a look but he chocked that up to him not being very quiet. He looked over the librarian again and noted a few other changes. She was now wearing more jewelry, rings and earrings, and was wearing more make up. Her messy bun was a little tidier and her shoes, once tennis shoes, were comfortable looking heels. It looked like she should be in a club rather than a library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon smirked, wondering how else to test the device. He had changed enough \u201cthings\u201d. It was time to try it on someone more directly. Simon thought about for a moment and decided to keep the same test subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThe librarian is four feet tall,</i>\u201d he recorded and listened for the familiar crackle. When he heard it the librarian changed, suddenly losing more than a foot in height. Simon looked around and noticed that a few step stools had appeared but otherwise no one reacted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is except for the girl who looked at him before. She glanced at him and made an annoyed face before texting away at her phone. Simon raised an eyebrow at that. As quietly as he could he whispered into the Dictaphone, <i>\u201cI know what she\u2019s typing about.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immedietly the knowledge filled his head when he heard the crackle. She was texting a friend, a girl named Lauren, about. She had called him a creep for recording details about the librarian like some kind of perv. He frowned. That wasn\u2019t the image he wanted. Then an idea struck him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cNobody notices when I record into the Dictaphone,\u201d </i>he recorded. The crackle sounded and this time no one reacted. Not even the girl. Deciding to test it further he recorded, in a normal speaking voice, <i>\u201cThis girl is fifty pounds heavier.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was a little soft already. Perky C cups, a small tummy, and her hips and ass spread across her chair, stretching her yoga pants a bit. She was probably only 160 pounds. That changed when the Dictaphone crackled. The girl had suddenly swelled in a much larger, fatter version of herself. She had to be at least a D cup and her pudgy tummy was now a full on pot belly that rested on her lap. Her ass and hips were even bigger, their edges peaking over the sides of the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole demeanor changed though. She slouched more and her clothes were looser. Gone were the yoga pants, replaced with baggy sweat pants. She wore a big hoodie that hid the details of her body but did little to make her look smaller. Simon wasn\u2019t very pleased with the results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThe girl is\u2026she is more confident and happy. She isn\u2019t ashamed of her body and, in fact, likes it,\u201d</i> Simon recorded cautiously focusing on the girl. The change was once again immediate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was smiling. The girl sat up straighter and was smiling and humming quietly to herself while she studied. Her outfit had changed once more. She was back in yoga pants that clung tightly to her large ass and dug into her waist, giving her a definitive muffin top. Her shirt clung to her torso, the neckline emphasizing her cleavage. Simon could even see where the fabric dipped at her belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon smiled. He was happy with how this turned out. She looks better too, Simon thought. He had always liked girls a \u201clittle\u201d thicker. Now that he could do that to anyone he didn\u2019t know what to do. After a moment\u2019s thought, though, he decided on one more test before he left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Over the next ten minutes, the girl will slowly gain twenty pounds and she will notice. No one else will. The clothes she is wearing will not change with her but all her other clothing at home will,</i>\u201d he recorded. This one would be interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly realized ten minutes would seem like forever as her body slowly grew. It was fast enough to be interesting as he could see her visibly growing but slow enough that it taxed his patience. About two minutes in, as she passed the five-pound mark and her shirt started to rise up, she noticed. It started with her trying to pull her shirt down, which didn\u2019t work, and a pound or two later she actively paying attention. She looked around the room, looking for any sign of what was going on, but found nothing. At the five minute and ten-pound point, she was focused entirely on her growth. Her muffin top was exposed, her shirt no longer covering her belly button, and her yoga pants were staring to strain. Her bra was visible through her shirt and looked quite tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was breathing hard. It was obvious that she was shocked and trying to not to panic but Simon was convinced that, thanks to his earlier change, that was a look of glee in her eyes. As her growth came to an end Simon made record for her to forget thinking he was a creep and got up and approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there, I\u2019m Simon,\u201d he said, trying to sound nonchalant. She looked up at him wide eyed and then, realizing her tummy was entirely exposed, blushed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m Karen,\u201d she stammered. \u201cCan I help you with something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHI Karen. I was, uh, I was wondering,\u201d Simon said, smiling. \u201cI was wondering\u2026could I maybe get your number?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-My number?\u201d she repeated, obviously surprised. Simon nodded. She thought about it for a moment before looking back down at her belly. A realization hit her and her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019re not, uh, responsible for this are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, furrowing his brow and trying to sound sincere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis,\u201d she said poking her tummy. \u201cOddly convenient that you would ask me that as soon as it stopped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat stopped?\u201d he asked, sounding rather genuine. Her eyes widened as she fell for it. She covered her mouth in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-nothing,\u201d she said quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d Simon pressed. \u201cCould I get your number?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, s-sure I guess,\u201d she said. She told him her number and he entered in his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll text you later and maybe we can get dinner this weekend,\u201d Simon smiled. Then he risked it and gently poked her tummy. \u201cYou look like you like to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winked at her and walked away, leaving her speechless. He wasn\u2019t sure if he went too far or not but it was fun and, honestly, it didn\u2019t matter. He could just change her memories or opinions of him later. As much as fun as messing with Karen was, Simon wanted a new target and few came to mind: his roommate Kim, Kim\u2019s best friend Patricia, or his boss Lisa. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The problem was that she was currently working at the bar and he wasn\u2019t 21 yet. Technically it wasn\u2019t a problem really since he could just make himself 21 but where was the fun in that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI\u2019m in my room,\u201d</i> Simon recorded and he, and all his things, was instantly transported. At his desk he opened his laptop and pressed record on the Dictaphone. <i>\u201cI can see a live feed of Kim at the bar on my computer.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA window popped up showing him exactly what he asked for: It was a high quality stream of the bar Kim worked at. He could see her and Patricia, both wearing the fitting black V-neck uniforms and pouring drinks for a crowd. They seemed busy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s start simple,\u201d Simon smiled. <i>\u201cKim is a foot taller.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon heard the crackled and the feed blink at him. When it came back Kim was indeed taller at 6\u20196\u201d, much taller than most the people in the bar. Especially Patricia. For the most part, however, nothing seemed different. She was just tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Good start,\u201d he mumbled, pondering his next move.<i> \u201cKim is a D-cup.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen blinked and Kim was bustier. That one cup size was rather noticeable. Her uniform showed a bit more cleavage, she bounced a little more, and her tip jar seemed a little fuller. That one interested him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cKim is an F-cup,\u201d</i> he recorded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen blinked and Kim was bigger. Much bigger. Her breasts bounced and bulged as she worked and, judging by the extra flourish, she was bouncing them on purpose. The tip jar was even fuller. So as her bust increased people tipped more. That made sense. So what if her waist changed a bit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cKim is thirty pounds heavier and most of it sits on her tummy,\u201d</i> Simon recorded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlink. Kim\u2019s shirt looked much tight. It was black so it was rather slimming but the twenty pounds were rather obvious. Her belly was definitely larger. It appeared a few tips had vanished from her jar. She also, like Karen, looked a little down. She\u2019d lost some of the bounce in her step. It made sense after all. Kim was a health nut when she was thin, surely she\u2019d be depressed with the weight gain. Simon, however was ready for that and had a situation in mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cKim secretly has a feeding and weight gain fetish. She works out and wears a girdle to keep up appearances and hide all her secret snacking,\u201d</i> Simon recorded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlink. Kim looked thin again. Her tip jar was fuller again and her bounce was back. Simon got up and left his room. Checking the kitchen revealed that there were more snacks in the cupboards. Not a huge amount but a noticeable increase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon let himself into Kim\u2019s room. Normally he\u2019d never think of going in without asking but he was feeling a little over confident. Her room was relatively clean and looked, for the most part, normal. Normal except for two very distinct changes. Covering every available surface \u2013 from her bookshelf to her dresser to her desk and more \u2013 were snacks. Chips, crackers, cookies, pastries, candies, and more. The other addition was a mini-fridge filled with more snack \u2013 lots of cold treats. Her trash can was full of wrappers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was thrilled. Things were sure to get interesting around her. Though her keeping this \u201chobby\u201d a secret did little to entertain him. Nothing another recording wouldn\u2019t change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cKim gave up hiding her gain from me only a few months after we started living together. When she\u2019s in the apartment she is most comfortable in just her bra and panties and usually wears just that when she\u2019s home. She still exercises and pretends to diet though,\u201d</i> Simon recorded. That one would take a bit longer to the result of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon looked at the clock: 9:30. Kim would be working until at least 11, if not later. He could keep making changes to her life while he waited. Or he could experiment on someone new. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just a size too small, deliberately to cleave to her figure and leave little to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing, buttoning up the blouse she admired her reflection.

He also knew exactly what fate would be most suitable for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around half-way down the corridor he headed towards the weights room. His step faltered, as realised that if he showed up then Kurt would turn his attention towards Simon. With a groaning sigh he knew what he needed to be... a gym bunny. A cute cheerleader type who'd inspire Kurt to show off, and stay for the length of his full transformation. With a snort, he raised the Dictaphone to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Make me a gym bunny.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMid-step Simon became Simone. Her hair pulled back and out of the way in a loose pony tail dancing between her shoulder blades. Simone felt more than a little self conscious, as she took in the barest of outfits she was wearing. A simple pair of navy blue short shorts, and a crop top, that would never support her bust for anything too vigorous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone hoped it was simply her unfamiliarity with the view from this angle. But looking down, her bust felt massive. Mountainous breasts and a canyon of cleavage between. The sloshing jiggle as she walked was oddly comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't notice as you find a natural rhythm to your walk. More hip swaying than before, taking account of your extra curves and their inertia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising the Dictaphone you outline the scenario for Kurt's transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the gym, you feel Kurt's gaze immediately. When you scowl your disapproval, he merely winks and goes back to his machine. There's only the pair of you in the Gym, and you select a good spot to observe him, as you pick up some hand weights. The dumbbells feel oddly heavier than you expected. But a quick check of your skinny arms, confirms that as a gym bunny you are toned and taut, rather than ripped and muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft regular chiming of the weights from Kurt's exercises punctuate your own work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/0dbb8022ffeed8b24c0a192babdc89e7/tumblr_opdbzwJX8u1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/0dbb8022ffee...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Kurt's entertainment, you add a sexual pant into your routine, as you work the weights. Keeping a sly eye on Kurt, he smiles back. Cheeks flushing you realise how it looks... or rather how Kurt's reading that look. The situation isn't helped, as you feel the knotted top work loose. Until with one heave, the knot unfurls entirely. Only the hem of your top is protecting your modesty. Your bust almost thrown out on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/2710d0d3882e8d7129e96c21eec00b65/tumblr_opdc0nRXKa1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/2710d0d3882e...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't wait for Kurt's changes to start, as you wrestle with yourself.

Your arms are already glistening with sweat from your work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the delay kicks in, and you see a look of confusion cross Kurt's face. As he stops, breathing deeply, he takes a few gulping mouthfuls from his water bottle. But it's clear <i>to you, </i>that the transformation has taken control. Kurt is along for the ride, like a marionette as he shifts the spike so he's working with a lighter weight on the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping over, you ask him if you can borrow his water. With a bare grunt, from him you take it as consent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating to the bench for a breather, you watch as Kurt starts working the machine again. The chiming of the weights as the land fills the gym. However, now for every repetition, Kurt is losing weight. Muscle melting away from his body as he works the machine. His bare arms looking thinner with every few pulls on the machine. After a few reps he adjusts the spike so he's lifting even less weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continues for several minutes, until Kurt looks like he's drowning in his clothes. Until he looks like the type he'd pick on as not belonging in the gym. His head looks wildly around for assistance. But his mouth remains shut apart from some grunts, and groans as he starts to strain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerless to resist, Kurt keeps working the machine as it steals away his muscles. Tears of fear, and horror trickle from the corner of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he's lifting only a single 5 Kilo weight he stops, his scrawny chest beneath that loose blue top a sign of how far he's fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake the half-empty water bottle, as an invitation. When Kurt nods his agreement, you toss it across to him. He flails wildly as he catches the bottle, his co-ordination as depleted as his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chugs the last of the water, as you settle back for the final act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empty bottle drops from Kurt's numb grip, as he returns his attention to the machine. A bare moaning warble of dread is the only resistance he can manage. As his hand reach up for the bar, his clothes change. Kurt's shorts shrink, and his tattered top retreats, the bagginess vanishing as it become skintight. The top merges together with the shorts, until it becomes one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt is unconcerned about his clothes becoming a... leotard... a swimsuit... as his attention is more drawn to how he fills them. His stick-thin arms are now attached to a body that can only be described as androgynous. His bulge no longer visible, and his chest undefined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the leotard rises higher, until it's cut is clearly feminine, the warbling moaning whine returns. You watch as helpless to resist Kurt starts to work the machine once more.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simon closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He was doing this. He was going to make himself and girl. It\u2019d be simple. Live like a girl and explore that lifestyle for a few hours, days at most, and then go back. Nothing about the plan was too complicated. Still, he was nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon smacked his cheeks, getting himself going. It was now or never. Before he backed out. First thing he needed was a mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a large full body mirror in front of me,\u201d Simon recorded. The device crackled and, in blink, a mirror appeared in front of him. It was easily eight foot by six foot, more than big enough to see himself.  It covered most of the wall of his bedroom. \u201cHere goes nothing\u2026<i>I am a girl.</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recorded he request and pressed stop. The little wonder machine crackled and reality changed. This one wasn\u2019t so much a blink and more Simon lost focus. His eyes blurred and the room spun a bit. In a moment though, less even, the world returned to normal. The room stopped spinning and his eyes refocused. And Simon was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn place stood a girl. She looked like Simon, like a relative maybe. She stood a few inches shorter than him at 5\u20197\u201d. She had a pretty normal body type. She was about 140 pounds with modest C cups. Her hips curved enough to appear feminine but nothing dramatic and her butt was pert and round, if not a little small. Her tummy was a little soft from her college lifestyle. Her face cute in a way; bright eyes and long lashes, a not-too-big nose, and a pretty smile. Her hair fell past her shoulders and looked soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon recognized the girl as himself or, more accurately, herself. She wrinkled her nose and furrowed her brow as she remembered her life. Her name was Simone. She remembered her life as both Simon and Simone, both happening in parallel in her mind. It was rather disorientating at first but she quickly got the hang of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone\u2019s life had been rather similar. She had the same overall experiences, interests, friends, and skill. A few memories were new like Girl Scouts and learning makeup. She did have more girl friends that she was closer to, while her guy friends weren\u2019t as close. An inverse of her old life as Simon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone was excited though. She was a girl! It worked! To top it all off, her mind wasn\u2019t different or so it seemed. She still felt like Simon in her head. That being said\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone frowned. She may be a girl but she was pretty plain. There was no arguing that she was cute but there\u2019s no way she\u2019d being turning heads or being the center of attention. Unless she spoke it up it was unlikely that people would even pay her any attention. Simon had been a pretty average guy so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that Simone was a pretty average girl. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Collapsing forward onto the bed, her whole skeleton felt like it was on the move. Her hips cracking... widening to accommodate her broader hips. A warbling cry spilling from her lips, as she sought to cup... to contain, her swelling bust. Quickly it overflowed her hands, pulling her forward. The weight relentless piling onto her chest. The only worry was the same added weight building on her rump, rounding out her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone's nipples brushed against the sheets, the chill making them crinkle in protest.

Planting her hands on her hips in frustration, Simone guessed that as well, as her extreme curves, she was lucky if she topped 5' tall. Hell, she was probably wider than she was tall. Certainly her bust felt too big. Though the comparison with her ripe rump and insane hips also exceeded her height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brushing of her long hair, swishing back and forth across her ass was ticklish, but also arousing. Distractingly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Simone is a foot taller.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou click the dictaphone button, as you speak. Unwilling to surrender how sensual your new body is, but equally scared by how sexual it is, and how vulnerable you feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, nothing happens. You don't shoot up towards the ceiling, your extra foot in height fails to materialise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm a foot taller.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try again. But again nothing happens, your pulse quickens as you imagine your future stuck in this body. Your head starts to spin, until you spot the pale red LED, on the dictaphone. Pressing the button once more, the LED flared briefly bright red before fading to black once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, Shit! Mother fucker!\" you curse out the damned thing, as you pop out the dead batteries from the device. Keeping a constant tirade of abuse going, you look through all the drawers and cupboards looking for replacements. However, you find only clothes tailored to suit your new body. The underwear makes you squirm as you search through it. The satins, and silks making you queasy, the thought of them stretched over your body both sexual, and terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you close the last cutlery drawer in the kitchen, a cold dread settles in the pit of your stomach. The inescapable fact that you're going to have to go out and get replacement batteries. You're going to have to go out and get replacement batteries looking like you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting the rising fear, and crippling uncertainty. You decide better sooner, than later. You get dressed, and head to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of the looks you'll draw makes your hand tremble as you reach for the handle. The sick feeling rising in your throat, that feels constricted, too tight to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you clamp your hand on the cold door handle, and open the door. Stepping through, you close it behind you. The eyes of the world feel like their on you. Buried deep in your cleavage, and clinging to your wide round buns, with every hip pistoning step, you walk to the shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to walk with less jiggle, but your skeleton really isn't made for that. Your bust bounces with each step, and your rump jiggles in counter-point. Your hips so wide, you have to sway and sashay with every step.</span></div></div>",

Wanting to get the most out of the next few changes, Simone took her shirt and pants off and stood in front of her mirror in just her bra and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThe following changes to my body happen over time and quickly so I can watch them. They still change reality,\u201d</i> Simone recorded, mildly surprised by her new voice. It was higher and sweeter. She liked it.<i> \u201cI am taller, about six feet.\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThis time the change was weirder. Normally the Dictaphone crackled and the changes were immediate but not this time. Simone watched as her body slowly but surely stretched upward. Inch by inch over the next thirty second, her body grew taller. Her proportions adjusted: as her weight stayed the same but her height increased her body became slenderer, her waist narrowing and her tummy flattening a bit. Seconds after it started, it stopped. Simone was now taller than she had been as Simon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good start but it\u2019s nowhere near good enough,\u201d Simone grinned. She pressed the record button. \u201c<i>My skin is free of blemishes and a deep natural tan.\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nShe pressed stop and watched as her skin smoothed and then darkened shade by shade, leaving her looking like she lived on the beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI have a face like a model. My eyes are bright blue and my eye lashes are longer. My nose is a little smaller and my cheekbones higher. My lips are plumper and my teeth straight and white,\u201d</i> Simone recorded. She added,<i> \u201cI have freckles.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched in amazement as her face reshaped itself to match her description. Her eyes seemed to get bigger, more almond shaped, and her lashes lengthened. Her face took on a more heart shape as her cheekbones became more defined. Freckles splashed across the bridge of her nose and cheeks. Her lips plumped up into a cute pout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cMy lips are even plumper,</i>\u201d she recorded, not satisfied. They swelled thicker and bigger. Their size implied they were unnatural but they looked real enough that no one would suspect her of surgery. Any bigger and she\u2019d have trouble talking. She made a kissy face. \u201cThat\u2019s better. <i>My hair is longer, wavier, and fuller.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone\u2019s hair cascaded down her back, stopping just above her rear. It grew bigger and more voluminous, becoming wavier in the process. She smiled, mostly satisfied with it. An idea crossed her mind and she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cMy hair is bubble gum pink,\u201d</i> she recorded. Her hair lightened, shifting from dark brown to lighter to blond to bleach blond to pink to finally bubble gum pink. \u201cI like it. Now for the main event.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn\u2019t her that she had soft spot for bigger asses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I have to be tiny up top though,\u201d she reasoned to herself before recording<i>. \u201cI\u2019m a F cup.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust because she was going to be the bottom heavy one didn\u2019t mean she had to be less busty than Kim. She was already shorter, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone grinned excitedly as her breasts began to swell, fill the cups of her bra. Feeling her flesh stretch and watching them grow was turning her on but it was a little disappointing that her bra didn\u2019t get tight. It just stretched to accommodate her new size. Soon they were as big as Kim\u2019s and as big as her head. She bounced in place a few times to watch the jiggle and shake. She wasn\u2019t done though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cMy hips are wide enough that even compared to my large breasts, they are wider and I have definite pear shape. My ass is big and round and shakes just the right amount. My thighs are thick enough to match,\u201d</i> Simone recorded. Then she added, <i>\u201cThe panties I\u2019m wearing don\u2019t grow with me.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone started growing and immediately moaned. The sensation was too much for her as her hips stretched outward, her butt swelled behind her, and her thighs thickened. Pound after pound, the young woman\u2019s ass fattened outward. Her pert butt swelled into a fat ghetto booty, sticking out from her back like a shelf. It was the perfect mixture of firm strong muscle and soft jiggly fat, shaking just right when she swayed her hips. Her hips extended from her sides, past her shoulders and past the widest point of her breasts and then still an inch or two on each side. She might have trouble with small aisles now. Her thighs thickened up sweetly, pressing together in sturdy pillars of flesh to support larger posterior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while Simone\u2019s panties grew tighter and tighter. They stretched over her new growth until they could take no more and they disappeared into the folds of her hips and her swelling ass, transformed into a makeshift thong. Even then they didn\u2019t last long as Simone\u2019s growth neared its end and finally snapped, the girl gasping in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is great,\u201d Simone panted, putting her hands on her hips. She had gained almost thirty pounds just to her bottom half. And she wasn\u2019t done just yet. \u201c<i>My tummy is a little softer and thicker.\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nShe had hoped the Dictaphone got her meaning and it did. Her flat toned tummy softened and bulged outward becoming pudgy and thick. Nowhere close to fat (not yet) but a nice softness. Simone smiled as she looked over her new body. Gone was the plain 5\u20197\u201d and 140-pound girl with C cups and a little ass. In her place was flashy 6\u2019 and 180-pound model, with F cups and a 45-inch ass.

And my nipples are pierced.\u201d</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\nSimone felt the sting again and smiled at the shiny metal adornments. She pulled her bra down to get a look at the heavy metal barbell piercing her fat, erect nipple. She gave it a light tease, sending bolts of pleasure through her body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>\u201cI need to finish</i>,\u201d Simone said, forcing herself to stop. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026oh ok. <i>My wardrobe is very slutty. All of my shirts are low cut and most of them are crop tops. My bottoms are either short shorts, mini-skirts, or very tight yoga pants. I have some short and low cut sundresses and a few tight mini-dresses. I only ever wear heels and nothing shorter than five inches. And fuck it, I never wear a bra because my tits are always perky and don\u2019t need it so I don\u2019t own any.\u201d<br>\r\n </i><br>\r\nMost of this change went unnoticed as all her clothes were either in the dresser, the closet, or the hamper. She did notice that hanging on her closet door was a see through pink baby doll that hadn\u2019t been there before.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThere were two changes that were noticeable though. First, her bra vanished from her chest. Simone\u2019s large breasts drooped a bit and bounced from the sudden lack of supporting feature but they didn\u2019t sag much. Almost impossibly perky. The second was how she suddenly shot up in height. Looking down (and past her expansive cleavage), Simone saw that she was now wearing five inch wedge sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Simone was confused until her memory filled in the blanks. While the dictaphone hadn\u2019t been too literal until this point, it had taken her \u2018I only ever wear heels\u2019 literally. In her new memories she was only ever barefoot when she absolutely had to be, instead opting to wear her sandals in lieu of slippers and special shower heels when she bathed. Stepping out of her heels, Simone was amazed and shocked to see that her foot naturally formed that incline and that place her foot flat on the floor was, while not painful, very uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone made a note to be more careful in the future and to be careful of her wording. She didn\u2019t, however, make any attempt to correct the heel issue. It wasn\u2019t that concerning and could be fixed whenever. She had more important manners to attend to. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Knowing she was alone and could just undo whatever anyway, Simone didn't hold back and began to moan almost exaggeratedly loud. Those moans quickly became genuine as her hands moved south, between her thunderous thighs, and she began ravenously fingering herself. Her moans quickly turned to gasps and she fell first to her knees, then forward on to her face in tits, her whole body writhing in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the cloud of hormones, Simone slowed enough raise her self back to her knees and grab the Dictaphone. A perverted alien idea had come to her mind and she was far too horny to question to it now. She activated the Dictaphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I have the largest dildo my body can comfortably and safely take,\"</i> Simone panted. Moving on autopilot, the young woman reached under her bed and dragged out a rather heavy box. She almost passed out upon seeing the thing. The toy was easily almost the length of her forearm (which was technically longer than when she had been Simon) and bigger around than a pop can. It was covered in bumps and ridges and had a base it attached to. The entire this matched her bubblegum pink hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Simone moaned, body shaking, as she awkwardly fumbled to set up the beast. \"Come to mama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was standing up right on its base, Simone rose shakily to her feet and stood over it. She stared into the mirror, meeting her own gaze. Without a word she slowly lowered herself onto the dildo, slowly letting the thing breach her body. She gasped for air as wave after wave of pleasure rocked her new form. Every little sensation of this experience was turned up to eleven and hyper amplified. When she reached the base she didn't even hesitate to rise up. She quickly felling into rhythm, bouncing up and down on the massive sex toy. Her gasps and panting turned into moans and screams of pleasure as she rose higher and higher in euphoria. She even began talking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You s-slutty slutty whore...\" she teased herself, nowhere close to being the right mind to be creative with her dirty talk. \"You stupid fatassed bitch...you...you just w-want to fuck and be fuuuucked....ah! You want nothing e-else than to be the center of the...the whole fucking room with every man and woman w-wanting to fuck to you...wanting to be you...you stupid slutty bimbo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Simone reached her limit. Her body tensed and flooded with arousal. She screamed, eyes rolling in her head, and fell back on her fat ass, the giant dildo still inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" she panted and giggled. \"That was amazing. I can't wait to do it again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was quickly distracted by a sound...</span></div></div>",

From floor Kim looked enormous. She towered over Simone and filled the doorway. Her body was bulkier - thicker thighs, beefier arms, wider hips. She was significantly bustier than before, matching Simone's own bust, though Kim's wasn't nearly as perky. The biggest difference was the round pot belly Kim had, something Simone had only dreamed of on Kim. She was obviously not enthusiastic about her gut but, thanks to the earlier recording, she did nothing to hide as she stood in only a blue bra and matching panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held a bag of chip in hand and smirked down at Simone between mouthfuls, not even phased by the girl's nudity. In fact, Simone was hardly concerned as well and before she could even ask, her mind started filling in the blanks with foreign memories of this new reality. Between Simone's slutty style, very open personality, and apparent nymphomania and Kim's own fetish of stuffing her belly and not wearing clothes, the two girls had quickly adjusted to similar lifestyle's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey big girl,\" Simone panted with a smile. She was almost on autopilot. \"Just, uh, just give me a moment. Excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone slowly, foolishly thinking that would help, eased the dildo out of her body. Her arousal immediately spiked once more, eliciting a sensual moan from her and leaving her panting once more after it was finally clear of her body. She so very much wanted to put back in but she resisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Simone said with a bit of blush once she noticed Kim was still watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be,\" she said around a mouth full of chips. She pointed at the floor. \"Whats that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimone looked where she was pointing: the Dictaphone. She gulped. Uh oh.

Slena looked upon her new body with a mix of shock and excitement, though, something was missing still, it was her boobs, they weren\u2019t nearly big enough, she brought the dictaphone to her mouth and said in a seductive, feminine voice, \u201cI have a beautiful pair of G-cup tits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter those words were spoken, her once modest tits began to burst forth, ripping her tight fitting t-shirt, leaving two large, pale, fleshy orbs out in the open.

However, something was still missing, and after a few minutes of thinking, Selena finally figured out what it was.

She didn\u2019t bother to get dressed; she didn\u2019t have any class on Fridays. So instead she stayed in her sleep clothes, which last night had just been a baggy shirt and her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed the sleep from her eyes and after she put on her glasses, she noted a little white box on her desk that hadn\u2019t been there before. Her name was written elegantly on the lid.<i> Did Cathy get me a gift?</i> She thought, her heart fluttering a bit at the thought. Removing the lid gently, she removed its contents to examine them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki held in her hand a small grey recording device, a Dictaphone, with options to record, stop, or play. There was nothing really special about it. There was a note inside as well that read, <i>\u2018Record your deepest desires and make them real\u2019. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki had no idea what that meant, but she was curious. She noticed her notes on her desk on groaned. She still had a paper to right tonight. A long paper she hadn\u2019t started.

When she blinked, her paper was open on her desktop completely and correctly written, formatted, and cited. Amazed, Yuki read through it once, twice, and even a third time to check. Satisfied on the third, she emailed it to her professor, not want to waste time, and looked at the Dictaphone in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can do anything,\u201d she said quietly to herself, her mind running with the possibilities. \u201cI can have anything.

It sounded as if someone was crinkling aluminum foil. She was beginning to feel just a little bit strange. And then she blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like her entire body exploded at once. She wasn't just going upwards, but in all directions. Her belly plopped out, stretching the fabric of her once loose T-Shirt. Her breasts were already of an impressive size, but they somehow grew even larger, creating a window of cleavage along the neck of her attire. The largest growth of all came in the form of her thighs and waist, which tripled her total width. Her now gigantic rear could barely fit on her seat and she fell over onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Omph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki hit the ground much harder than she expected to, though her new fat body absorbed most of the impact. Her shirt was constricting her movement as her legs stretched out longer and taller. When the sensation finally stopped, she rose to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap...I'm huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was big in more ways than one. If she had kept her old height, it would have looked like she had gained almost 200 pounds in weight, mostly around her legs. But Yuki had also skyrocketed in height, shooting up into high six foot range. She was a giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it worked!\" she said, enjoying the new perspective of her room she was having. \"Maybe a little fatter than I expected, but whatever. At least my boobs got bigger. I could get used to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did a little stretch and looked around her room. In the chaos of her growth, her desk had been knocked over. The monitor and everything on the table was scattered on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" she said, crouching down over the mess. \"Where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted up the screen and discovered, to her horror, the grey Dictaphone box crushed by the computer and the desk. There was a large crack in the object. Frantically, Yuki pushed all the buttons to see if her new toy even still worked.</span></div></div>",

Once again, she pressed record. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThis mess I made is cleaned up and my computer isn\u2019t broken,\u201d</i> she repeated into the device and pressed stop. This time she did here the sparkle sound. She gasped in surprise and relief. She looked up from the device at her desk, grinning ear to ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was as it should be. Her desk and her papers and things were all in their appropriate places, as if they\u2019d never been touched. Her computer was unharmed and still open to her email. She fell backward with a thud, her giant body taking up almost all of the floor space. Finally, able to relax after her panic attack Yuki was finally able to take in just how big she was. Lying on the floor of her small dorm, she took up so much space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki had always been busty since her early teens so the way her breasts rolled to the sides while she lay was nothing new. The fact that they were much bigger than her head was very new. They were so heavy and pendulous and, with the fabric of her sleep shirt stretched taut and molded to her chest, very sensitive she realized, straying to blush. She had to use both hands due to their size and weight to move one of them to get a closer look and notice that her nipples had enlarged as well. They poked through the fabric. She resisted the temptation to tweak. Turning her attention southward, her stomach rose past her breasts in her horizontal position. She pulled her shirt up to examine the pale expanse. Oddly spherical, she was surprised at how round and soft it was. It wobbled whenever she breathed. Finally, she focused on her lower half. Though she couldn\u2019t see it from her current position, she had an idea of how big her ass truly was. Though it was soft and malleable fat, it could only squish so far beneath her and, as a result, her hips were pushed upward much farther than she was used to. She ran her hands over her smooth hips and thighs. She was so wide now she figured she\u2019d have trouble with doorways. The idea was intriguing and frightening as well. Curious if her new toy was still working and the extent of her abilities, Yuki lifted it to her mouth and pressed record. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI know how big I am,\u201d</i> she pressed stop. She immediately heard the sparkle sound and knew it had worked. This time it was strange. She suddenly just knew. She knew that she was now 6\u20198\u201d, a whole foot and a half taller than before. She knew she was now 362 pounds, a whopping 247 pounds heavier. She knew that her F cups, that she once thought were borderline too big, were now almost unfathomable M cups. She was gigantic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising to her full height, Yuki looked around the small room. She was gratefully she could still stand up straight, though it appeared she would have to duck to leave her room. Deciding to make herself more decent in case Cathy came home early, Yuki lumbered over to her closet to assess the damage. To her surprise, her entire wardrobe was much bigger. She struggled to fit her giant breasts into her larger bra and struggle to keep her balance while she pulled her tight panties up her thick thighs and over her wider hips. She donned a pair of tight jeans and cr\u00e8me colored sweater with a turtle neck. Though her clothes did fit, she noticed they fit much different than before. Before, her pants fit ok and her sweaters, her preferred attire were baggy so as to not emphasize her chest; while she was proud of her bust her general shyness outweighed her pride. Now, her clothing was tight and emphasized every massive curve of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the room Yuki noticed a picture on Cathy\u2019s desk. She crossed to study it. It was a selfie the two girls had taken at the beginning of the year and she certainly didn\u2019t remember it looking like that. In her mind, Yuki remember the photo: the girls had just met and Cathy insisted on taking it so they could look back on when their friendship began. Being much taller, Cathy had held the camera and Yuki had overcome her shyness and showed a genuine smile in the photo. Now, the roles were reversed; both still smiling and happy, the new version of the photo depicted Yuki herself as a giant, holding the camera to capture both of them. Cathy stood in from of her, leaning against her plush body, head between her large breasts and hands squeezing Yuki\u2019s tummy. Yuki\u2019s face was more pink too.<i> It seems Cathy is a bit more handsy with me now,</i> Yuki thought, not entirely upset. She looked back at her mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at her reflection, trying to take it all in. It was a little difficult as she could not see own face without bending. With both hands she lifted her belly and gave it a little playful shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so big. I got so fat,\u201d she mumbled. It wasn\u2019t horrible, but it wasn\u2019t what she wanted. At least, not right now. At least, she thought. \u201cMaybe I should tone it down a bit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yuki\u2019s relief was short lived however. After the increasingly familiar sparkle sound, Yuki had expected to shrink, the excess weight melting off of her and her rotund form deflating like a balloon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, her body began to expand outward rapidly growing even fatter.  Her breasts swelled outward a few more cup sizes, her bra growing tighter but still stretching to fit as it and the rest of her clothes adjusted to the new reality. Her stomach bloated outward, fattening even larger. Her love handles grew larger, as did her muffin top, but her fattened gut remained round and almost spherical. It rolled and hung over her waist band, slowly covering her crotch. Her hips grew even wider, stretching whole inches on either side. Her thighs pushed together as thickened into pillars of fatty flesh. Though she couldn\u2019t see it, she knew her ass was growing even more massive; she could feel her center of gravity shift as it gathered even more mass. Her arms and calves grew thicker as well, her little feet plumping ever so slightly and her fingers softened, looking almost sausage like. Bending, she watched her face change as well. Her already round Japanese features got rounder; her cheeks puffed up a bit, her lips grew a little more plump, and she developed a noticeable second chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her body finally stopped growing, Yuki stared in awe and terror. She was so fat now. Her previous change seemed to keep working as she instantly knew her new measurements: she was still 6\u20198\u201d but now 520 pounds and an O cup. Her breasts, while huge, had grown the least. The extra 158 pounds had settled mostly on her fat midsection and rotund rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what the hell happened?!\u201d Yuki practically shouted, her volume and language uncharacteristic of her normal temperament. Shakily she looked at the Dictaphone accusingly. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed the play button and listened to her previous changes. She heard her quiet voice record the simple request that had started this mess: \u2018I want to be bigger\u2019. Next, she heard something a little different. She heard her voice begin \u2018this mess\u2026\u2019 before being over written with static. A moment later her voiced spoke \u2018this mess I made is cleaned up and my computer isn\u2019t broken\u2019. Finally, she heard her most recent request, though it was not quite what she intended: \u2018I\u2019m so [static] fat\u2019. The recording stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki stared at the device. She stared at the crack in the casing. It was still damaged. The damage had mis-recorded her incredibly vague request, a single second of static completely altering the change. She needed to be more careful. She was so frustrated. She had been handed the most powerful device in the world, probably the universe, and she had immediately broken. Could it be repaired? Could she take it to a shop and trust a stranger to fix it, if it that was even possible? Could she risk using the device itself to fix the damage? There was not reason she should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at her reflection. She was so big. So fat. She\u2019s never imagined this happening. Sure, she\u2019d fantasized about being taller. Sure, she\u2019d imagined what\u2019d it\u2019d be like to be fat. But she\u2019d never thought she\u2019d be anything more than chubby. She never thought she\u2019d literally be a giant. That she\u2019d be obese. And the problem was she wasn\u2019t even upset, not really. It wasn\u2019t so bad; she was finally tall and she had more curves and no one would even think differently. On the other hand, she didn\u2019t think she was ready for it. She wasn\u2019t ready to be this fat at least. Frustrated by her conflicting thoughts, she clenched her fists and groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d she said calmly to herself. She rubbed her giant gut gently, hoping that would somehow. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. I just. I don\u2019t think I want to be so fat though. Not right now at least.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Combine that with her curvy hips and modest breasts and her above average height and she was stunning. It was no wonder Yuki has a crush on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey big girl!

She heard the telltale sparkle and put her hands proudly on her hips, waiting to see what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Cathy began to shrink. Sort of. Her height began to drop increasingly fast. Inches were lost ever second as she dropped from a tall 5\u201910\u201d to a diminutive 4\u2019. The problem was that Cathy wasn\u2019t losing any mass. Her body began to plump and spread as her weight was redistributed. Her breasts swelled larger in full DD cups, her tummy pudged outward into a round gut, and her ass expanded outward even larger than before. Her thighs thickened and her arms puffed out. Her face grew rounder and more cherubic. She was very tiny, but also looked pretty thick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Yuki mumbled, still not understanding how things would work out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha very funny,\u201d Cathy said sarcastically, her voice much higher.

Of course Cathy wouldn\u2019t notice the change because the Dictaphone changed reality. This was so confusing. Maybe if she specified that Cathy would notice it would work? It should. She couldn\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, that had felt kind of\u2026good? To do something like that, to change Cathy so fundamentally. Yuki felt powerful.

Her butt grew, as well as her thighs, that touch no matter how far she spread them. Finally, she felt herself growing a bit taller, her head nearly touches the ceiling. She felt the changes stop, and with the knowledge thing she has, she knows that she weighs 720lbs, an even 200. her height is 8'9\", it added 2'1\". She breast was now an unreal P cup.

She didn't know who this person Tammy mentioned was and didn't really want to trust them considering how powerful the item was. It was becoming abundantly clear just how powerful that was. She was huge, probably the biggest person on the planet and no one cared. Every now and then she'd catch someone staring but it wasn't that much more than normal. Every just knew she was big. It was so common place that Yuki had told Cathy about the dictaphone and she thought it was ridiculous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me me,\" Yuki said, wiping her mouth with a napkin and standing. \"I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be here,\" Cathy said around a fork full of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki made her way to the bathroom. Her mind was pretty much set on what she wanted to do. She wanted to play with her new power. Maybe something a little more drawn out and slower and definitely involving Tammy and Cathy. So first things first, she had to set the stage. She locked herself in the stall and dug out the dictaphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I look like my normal self before I found the dictaphone,\"</i> she recorded. The tell tale sparkle fizzed in her ears and, with a rushing sensation that left her disoriented, Yuki quickly shrank. She rapidly shrank back down to her meager height of 5'2\" and her body slimmed to a skinny 115 pounds and her giant breasts deflated into her own, still big, F cups. She sighed. \"I miss it already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we go to far...<i>I know how Tammy and Cathy would feel if they were made giant and fat</i>,\" she recorded. Without any flair, Yuki suddenly knew. Tammy was unsurprising; the short girl would appreciate the height and curves at first, growing more concerned as curvy became fat and she became too big. Cathy on the other hand, was mildly surprising: not only did it seem she was super into big girls but it seemed she'd quite enjoy getting big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki sat on this knowledge for a while. She wanted to make things interesting and test the powers of the dictaphone. She wanted to mess with the girls in a big way but also wanted to be a bit creative.

She curious as to the impacts that would have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, she wanted to try something a little more dynamic.

It has been this way for decades and impacts every woman.\" <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThat was simple enough, Yuki thought. Vague but to the point. Things would sure get interesting. She hit the stop button and for moment thought the dictaphone was broken again when she didn't hear the sparkle sound. Then, louder than ever before, the sound filled the room echoing across the world to match the scope of her change. As soon as it stopped, she began to change. Yuki's body began to swell. She gaining her weight back at a rapid pace. Her belly pushed out, rounding into a chubby gut. Her hips widened and her thighs thickened. Her ass ballooned behind her to match. Her already big breasts began to expand outward, larger and larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was her own body changing, but Yuki's memories were changing. She saw in her mind celebrities and models gaining weight, plumping into BBWs. She saw her old classmates in Japan, normally thin, grow chubby. She saw her own mother, a beanpole of a woman, become replaced with a giant obese beauty. The information dump was too much. Yuki placed her hands on her head, squeezing her eyes shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, she felt the changes stop and cautiously opened her eyes...</span></div></div>",

Almost immediately she was almost deafened by the sparkling sound of the dictaphone's changes, the sound being amplified to match the scope of her request. When it subsided, Yuki only had a moment to consider what she had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled. It was loud, louder than she'd ever heard it. She groaned in discomfort. She needed to eat something, anything, but more than that she wanted to eat. She wanted to eat everything. Yuki forgot about the change she made. She forgot about the dictaphone. She could only think of food and what it would do to her. Her mouth began to salivate at the thought of all the food in the cafeteria and her crotch began to moisten at the thought of what the food would do to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to be fat. She wanted to stuff her face and grow fatter than she had been moments ago, fatter than anyone else in the world. She wanted her belly to cover her lap and for her ass to get stuck in doorways. She wanted giant fat pornstar tits, so fat thy dominated her torso, and thighs so thick it'd be hard to walk. She didn't want to walk. She wanted to be to fat to walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rushed as fast as her little legs could carry her out of the bathroom and witnessed the chaos before her. Every girl in the dining hall was as consumed by their desires and hungers as she was. Yuki knew it'd be hard to find enough food for herself in all that mess but she also knew that leaving in search of food would only waste her time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

She can hear a game playing , and comments comments coming from the other side. She knocked twice and waited for him to answer. \"Coming!\" he said before he opened the door. The student had brown hair, blue eyes, and he was about a foot taller than she was before she found the dictaphone. \"Can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes.\" Yuki said, \"I\"m Yuki, and I was hoping you could help me with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Names Jack. Do you also need help coming in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think I'll be alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but I'll get some butter just to be safe.\" Jack went back inside and left the door open for her. Yuki pulled out the dictaphone and whispered into it, so that he couldn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm my original size before I found the dictaphone.\"</i> As soon as the sparkles sounded, she began to shrink. She deflated back to down to the size she use to be. F-cup breast size, 115lbs, and 5'2\". She then enters the room and noticed that Jack was on his laptop. She looked around the room and saw game posters upon the walls. She even saw a shelf full of video games. \"Wow, you're quite the gamer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm a dedicated player.\" He looks back at the girl and his eyes then became as wide a pizza pans. His stare was freaking out Yuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what are you looking at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did you lose all that weight so fast?\" she was surprised to hear what he said. He was aware of the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you aware of... uh...\" He got up from his laptop and walks up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have the dictaphone?\" She then revealed the dictiphone to him and he was surprised at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know about this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister was the previous owner two years ago.\" He gives her a photo of him and his younger sister, she had long dirty blonde hair and she was wearing a nice looking dress. \"We didn't know it came from. It was the start of summer vacation and she woke up to find this thing no her vanity. Before she even used it, she showed it to me. When we started using it, I had to do some research about this thing, but I couldn't find squat. We recorded that we had the history of this device but... it didn't work. Ever since that thing appeared, we've been closer than we've ever been. We even did a heck load of funny things with it. For example, she became the same age as me and vice versa. It even helped me through school. I've used it to help me stay focused on my home work. How else did end up here? Then one day, it upped and dissapeared. We looked everywhere in our house, but no luck. The one thing I remember about using it was we were aware of the changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you knew about where the dictaphone came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I've tried to learn about its origins, but nothing. It's as if it won't reveal anything about itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, origins or not, I'm still gonna use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we hang out? I liked messing around with the thing.\" Yuki thought for a moment. He does know about the dictaphone and how powerful it is and if he hadn't used it, then she wouldn't have met him. So, she took a breath and came up with and answer.</span></div></div>",

She looked around her room suspiciously, looking for the change but saw nothing. She looked at the Dictaphone, confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was weird. Must be hearing things,\u201d she mumbled. She looked back at her reflection, her mind returning to the dilemma at hand. As she looked over her obese, giant figure, Yuki begin to realized she liked what she saw more and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was finally tall. Taller than she expected. Taller probably than any girl on campus. She eyed her fattened breasts. Yuki had always been silently proud of her F cups. She loved that, despite being so small, she had such large breasts. Her breasts had been larger than any other girl\u2019s back home in her own country and she had still been larger than most of the girl\u2019s here in America. Secretly, she had loved the attention. The way some girls stared at them enviously, wishing that their own breasts were as big as her tits. The way so many boy and girls stared at them longingly, lustful gazes eyes her tits. She probably could\u2019ve had anyone she wanted if she hadn\u2019t been so shy. Now, her breasts were even bigger. She didn\u2019t know it was possible for them to be so big. Maybe she could work past her awkward shyness, take advantage of their size for once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes continued, settling on her fat gut. It was so big. She was so big. She ran her plump hands over it, shaking its girth and watching it bounce. She turned and did the same with her giant ass. She gave it a playful smack, grinning. There more she played with her fat, the faster her doubts faded. She was huge but she looked good. She was fat but she was sexy. She liked being fat, there was no doubt in her mind. Her confidence rose, higher than ever before. She was big, the biggest. She was beautiful, more perfect and more confident than she ever imagined being. Most of all, she was the most powerful person in the world with the Dictaphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the cracked device. If she could fix it, she could have anything. She could have money and fame. She could be a queen. She could be a goddess. Her new confidence fueling her desire and sudden greed, Yuki began to think of ways to fix the Dictaphone and be assured there\u2019d be no more mishaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the fat girl, she had not gained this confidence of desire naturally. If she had been more observant, if she had checked the recording on her Dictaphone, she would\u2019ve noticed that when she clenched her hands she recorded:<i> \u2018It\u2019s not that bad. I [static] think I want to be so fat [static] right now at\u2019. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Yuki realize her blunder?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was enjoying herself too much with her chub to really focus on fixing the Dictaphone. Collapsing on her bed, she placed the machine at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I wanna get even bigger,\" Yuki whispered as she squeezed her cleavage together, blushing at the sheer gap between her boobs.

For a moment, she thought about the mechanics of traveling around and collecting things to provide a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's a way to do things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought up the busted Dictaphone and clicked record. The machine sparkled as she cleared her throat and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time someone comments how tall I am, they will give me an inch of their height. Every time someone comments on my fat, they will give me ten pounds of their weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki played back the recorder just so she could confirm the wish had registered. Her voice parroted the same commands she had just spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be fun,\" she said, rubbing her hands together. \"Shall we go find Cathy and the others to see if we can have some fun? Let's see how big I can get by the end of the day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she set off to find some poor people to increase her mass.

All that growing had made her hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was usual, Cathy and their friend, Tammy, were busy eating in their own booth in the back of the diner. Cathy was a tall enough girl with long blonde hair done up in braids. In terms of proportions, she was completely average, C-cups and normal waist. When Yuki was normal, she was considered the heaviest of their group despite being not fat in the slightest. Tammy was petite and smaller than Yuki had been. She was a redhead and a transfer student from Ireland, studying aboard. She was below five feet tall and wore thick black glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy turned her full attention to Yuki as she arrived at their table, carrying three trays of food. \"Well, look who finally dragged herself out of bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls,\" said Yuki as she struggled to make room for herself between the seats. \"Omph. These booths are always so small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, it doesn't help that you're so tall,\" said Cathy as Yuki watched her suddenly drop an inch in height. Cathy didn't seem to notice the change and her clothes shrunk to match her. \"Honestly, you don't even fit on the bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki smiled as she felt herself grow in size. Her line of sight inched upwards ever so slightly and the girls at the table had to look up at her just to keep eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get so tall anyway?\" continued Cathy, not realizing that every mention of Yuki's height shrunk her down another inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" replied Yuki as she adjusted in her seat to the sudden burst in height she was experiencing. \"I just ate my vegetables, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guess? You do realize you're technically the tallest teenager in the world?\" asked Cathy, losing another inch. This brought her down to the smaller but still respectable height of 5'4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki had to push the table back to make more room for herself. \"Yeah? I never thought about it.\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy sighed and leaned over. \"I wish I was tall as you, Yuki. Being short sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki frowned as the smallest member of their group lost another inch of what there was to her height. Yuki swelled past the barriers into the seven foot range. She hadn't expected to grow so much in such a short of time. Though she did feel a little bad stealing height from Tammy. Perhaps there was something she could do to help Tammy out. Then again, she was liking the hungry look from Cathy that the blonde was giving her.</span></div></div>",

As she walked, she could feel Cathy eyes focused on her. Or mostly on her wobbling ass. Giving a little shake, she can hear Cathy gasp of excitement before Tammy drags her away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki enters the bathroom and, after looking if there was someone else, she sits on a toilet and brings the Dictaphone near her lips and clicks record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time someone comments how tall Tammy is, they will give her an inch of their height, with the exception of her friends Cathy and Yuki.\u201d Yuki feels the need to add something more, as she couldn't let Cathy go empty, so she keeps recording. \u201cEvery time someone comments on my strength or physical form or Cathy's, they will give my friend Cathy one pound of their muscle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki played back the recorded and her commands were the same. \u2018Now, let the games begin,\u2019 she thinks, grinning malevolently as she got out of the bathroom and took direction to the gym.</span></div></div>",

The giant girl change from her simple jeans and sweater to a tighter, more revealing and form fitting outfit of yoga pants, sports bra, and a tank top. The stretchy materials clung to every curve and roll on her fat body, emphasizing just how fat she was. The sports bra did little to actually support her giant breasts and the deep neck of the tank top showed off more cleavage that the old her would ever dream of showing. Satisfied, she made her way to gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki couldn\u2019t help but notice all the attention she was getting. At 7\u20196\u201d now and 520 pounds, she was easily the largest girl, largest person eve, on campus or anywhere for that matter. As she made her way across campus she heard many people whispering her direction. To her disappointment, it seemed she would only actually change when she heard the comment about her weight or height. On one hand this was disappointing because most of the students were really good about being quiet so she didn\u2019t grow much from their comments. On the other hand, if she had grown every time someone commented on her regardless of if she heard or not she\u2019d probably just keep growing endlessly because surely people would continue to talk about her behind her back the bigger she got. So, while disappointing, it was probably a blessing she realized. That being said, by the time she reached the gym she\u2019s heard enough to bring her up to 7\u201910\u201d and 560 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the gym, Yuki looked around at the equipment and had to admit she had no idea where to start. In her original life she had never considered the gym an option because she was so skinny anyways and her breasts were big enough to make exercise a pain. Even now she wasn\u2019t thrilled about being here; the idea of working out and potential losing even an ounce of her precious fat was not really appealing, but she figured she\u2019d gain anything she lost right back as the gym was surely full of people willing to criticize her height and weight here. She excused herself to a quiet and empty corner for a moment and dug the Dictaphone out her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI have the knowledge and strength necessary to use any of the equipment in this gym,\u201d</i> she recorded and heard the faint sparkle. Like before, she felt the knowledge filling her mind. She recognized every piece of equipment in sight and understood it. On top of that, she felt her muscles strengthen beneath her fat; it wasn\u2019t so noticeable as to be visible through the layers of flesh, but her body somehow felt lighter and easier to move despite the fact that she had just gained about 20 pounds of extra muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning with even more confidence, Yuki made her way to the track to get started. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite her massive size, she was able to keep up rather well due both her increased leg muscles as well as her longer strides. As she ran she smiled as she heard comments from so many people and could feel herself growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time she hit the gym and worked some of that fat off,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way she\u2019ll be able to work any of that fat off at her size,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s so fat! She\u2019s jiggling all over the place,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does she run with those giant fat tits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know girls could get so tall,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought Asian girls were supposed to be short and skinny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish I had her confidence. How is she so ok with being so huge?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApparently I like really big girls,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comments kept coming and she kept growing. Yuki soon realized that when people made really vague comments like huge and big she would grow in both weight and height. As such she was growing very fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter only a few laps, Yuki had to stop and rest. She found a bench in a relatively quiet spot of the gym to assess the damage. She had reached an amazing 8\u20194\u201d already from the comments and fattened to a whopping 700 pounds. As far as she knew, her bras were no longer sized at all; they were all custom made just for like any of her other clothes. Most of the weight she had been gaining was just adding to her pear shape. Her belly was no longer a spherical orb. A crease had formed, forcing her belly to split into two large rolls and giving her a double belly. Her hips were wider than ever and her ass was bigger than most of the people in the gym. Her thighs were like literal pillars. She was gigantic and she knew she was only going to get bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRested from her break and ready to grow some more, Yuki hefted up her form and strode over to the weight lifting area which had the most people in the gym. She immediately began to lift the heaviest weights, garnering the attention of those around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is someone so fat so strong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the giant is super strong too,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLifting weight won\u2019t help her lose any weight,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess she\u2019d have to be strong to move her fat body,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe must\u2019ve gotten strong lifting all that food she eats,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no, it\u2019s from carrying those giant fat tits all the time,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki just listened quietly, smiling to herself as she grew more and more. She had to admit she was a little surprised most of the comments this time were on her weight but it was more than welcome. The comments kept coming and she kept growing, most noticeably fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sometime time, she started to notice something concerning. First of all, she was getting really big. Like, really big. She was now 8\u20198\u201d and 910 pounds. While getting fatter hadn\u2019t been a problem earlier that was because she had begun getting taller to help spread out and balance her fat but she wasn\u2019t getting tall enough fast enough. Second, Yuki had set it up so the weight and height she gained would come from the people who commented on her and most of the people in the gym were starting to look a little thin. Yuki didn\u2019t want anyone to lose too much weight on her account. Setting down the weights she was using, Yuki made for the exit acutely aware of how much space she took up now and people continued to comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit she\u2019s huge,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe takes up so much space,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can anyone be that fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was free and alone, she had grown to 8\u201910\u201d and 970 pounds. Covered in sweat, skin glistening, and every pant shaking her enormous body, Yuki considered her options. It had been nearly an hour and a half since she saw Cathy and Tammy and she was curious to see how they had changed. Tammy might not have gotten much taller but you\u2019d made it so Cathy would grow when people commented on your body so she was sure Cathy had changed quite a bit. On the other hand, she was feeling hungry again already. Her much bigger body demanded even more food and all the \u201cexercise\u201d just made it worse. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The comments didn\u2019t stop and she grew the whole way out but finally she did make it out. Yuki headed for the library Cathy and Tammy had said they\u2019d be at, making sure to use a more secluded route so as not to encounter another person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk was long and tedious and she did grow a little more on the trip, but eventually she made it to the library. Looking around the library, looking over most of the shelves thanks to her height, Yuki spotted a blonde and red head together and, assuming they were in fact her friends made her way to them and sized herself up in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki was now 9\u20192\u201d and 1240 pounds. Those numbers were so big it was hard to put into perspective. With a little mental math, Yuki reckoned that, if she were this size and weight proportionally at her normal height of 5\u20192\u201d, she\u2019d be about 687 pounds. Which would have made her absolutely huge.  Her breasts had stopped growing a couple hundred pounds ago but they were still huge, bigger than anyone else on the planet. Like literal yoga balls, her giant fat tits bounced arousingly with every step. They were propped up by her giant gut, to large rolls of fat. It pushed out even further than her breasts and hung low over her waist band, covering her crotch and nearly reaching her knees. Her thighs were thick enough that they could easily dwarf a rather fat person of normal size. They were each almost the size she had been earlier after her first growth. Her hips and ass had taken then the majority of the growth. Her hips were nearly six feet wide, forcing her to struggle through even double doors. Her ass was huge, bigger than most small cars and she had to be careful of her movements not to hit anything with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did the math for how much Cathy had changed as well. Based on the weight she had gained, Yuki was sure that her body had been commented on nearly 90 times. So, in theory, Cathy should have gained 90 pounds of muscle plus however many people commented on her. The thought worried Yuki a bit. She hadn\u2019t intended things to escalate so quickly and was worried about what she had done to her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Yuki did reach her friends, even knowing what to expect, she was still surprised. She noticed Tammy first who\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, she looked much less athletic than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy was still shorter than she had been originally, losing a few inches to Yuki earlier today, but, for some reason, instead of gaining muscle Cathy had gained fat. Her face was rounder, chubbier, with a noticeable double chin. Her breasts, C cups before, had swollen into what looked like D cups. Her belly was fat and round, oozing onto her lap. Her hips were wider and her thighs thicker and her butt bigger. She had definitely taken on a more pear shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki was very confused. She thought back to what she recorded. <i>Every time someone comments on my strength or physical form or Cathy's, they will give my friend Cathy one pound of their muscle</i>. She had no idea how that would\u2019ve made Cathy fatter until she remembered the crack in the Dictaphone and how it chose to omit words. It must have left out the muscle bit recording <i>'Every time someone comments on my strength or physical form or Cathy's, they will give my friend Cathy one pound</i>\u2019 instead or something similar. Kicking herself for her blunder, Yuki was still glad she hadn\u2019t actually turned her friend into a musclebound freak and instead just made her gain about 90 pounds.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey big girl!\u201d Cathy called to her once she noticed her. Yuki winced as she gained ten more pounds and another inch. \u201cWhat have you been up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI went to the gym for a bit,\u201d Yuki answered, a little frustrated with her fatter friend for making her grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe gym? Really?\u201d Tammy asked. \u201cSince when do you want to lose weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t, I just want to stay in shape I guess,\u201d Yuki said, relieved that Tammy\u2019s comment didn\u2019t make her bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty in shape considering how big you are,\u201d Cathy said innocently, not aware that she was making you bigger. \u201cIf I was your size, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d care.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Yuki laughed, trying to ignore her growth. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, just need a drink of water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki rushed off. She liked being big and she did want to get bigger, but this was happening to fast. The point of the game was to slow down her growth, not accelerate it. Finding a quiet spot, Yuki dug in her deep, soft cleavage looking for the Dictaphone to stop the game. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She half-wished mentally to be back to her normal, short, skinny self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tingle suddenly filled her body. She felt like she was deflating at an alarming rate as her entire body condensed and shrunk back down to her normal, petite shape. Her sleeping clothes fit perfectly, though they had been greatly stretched out. Yuki was as she was moments ago just as the door opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're up,\" said her roommate, Cathy. She was a short girl, like Yuki, only Caucasian and blond. \"Good. Class is cancelled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding.

The roads are bad with the snow, but the mall is still open and in walking distance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Sure. Just give me a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Cathy left the room, Yuki looked down at herself. She was completely back to her usual thin body with still massive breasts. She patted herself down and pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I kind of enjoyed being bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she had to do was imagine herself larger and her imagination became reality. She felt bloated as she expanded before her eyes, fitting into her stretched out clothes again. Yuki smiled and ran her hands down her larger form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's what I'm talking about! Now back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, her body shrunk up at her command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm going to have fun with this,\" she muttered to herself as she got dressed to go out to the mall in the winter wonderland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mall...</span></div></div>",

But at 5' 2\", she knew why they asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the dictaphone, she found her solution. Picking her shapeless nondescript grey top, and baggy blue trousers, she admired her reflection in the mirror. She was proud of her body, but didn't want the 'creepy' attention that seemed to come with her body's shape and height. Topping it off, with a floppy baseball-style had, she could hide her eyes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClicking the button on the dictaphone, \"I am bigger.\" she said clearly. Fingers now shaking in anticipation, she clicked the dictaphone off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready she felt warmer. An intense focused warmth in her chest. Her smile coming forth, as she rose up on her tip-toes in anticipation. The thought of those out-of-reach, out-of-sight shelves the first tangible benefit for her. All her thoughts on her upcoming improvement, the dictaphone fell limply from her distracted hand. She took a cautious step away from it, towards the full-length mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her heels slammed, slapping back to the apartment floor, as she felt and saw her bust surge forward. Shaking her head in denial, she couldn't understand what had gone wrong. As the weight increased at her shoulders, as the pain built in her spine, she saw each of the girls swell until they were larger than her head. Each of those proud, erect nips, bigger than her nose. Thankfully, her spine seemed to strengthen as they grew more and more massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarting to the window, she looked out. At least, she tried to dart, but any kind of rapid movement seemed to require the co-operation of her heaving bust. A deliberateness to her pacing that avoided it throwing her to the floor in an unbalanced heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/d46b61c0544f54423947a9916ba7f3de/tumblr_p8a5pbO07F1w2lwkto5_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/d46b61c0544f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around the room, Yuki saw the scattered photo frames.

Yuki looked at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/2b52b055d38754034338a19d69bb77b8/tumblr_pctw6cDilA1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/2b52b055d387...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, she's not any bustier. The thought, the fear barely entered her head, before she felt the changes. In moments, her bust was fuller, heavier, it's sheer weight pulling her relentless to the floor, her shoulders aching. Those damned nipples spiking in sensitivity, the soft caress of her lingerie feeling like the coarsest hessian sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/caa894f83fd46a9ee8150a6b545efd16/tumblr_pctw6cDilA1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/caa894f83fd4...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle spilling from her lips, a smile as her arousal spiked. Yuki tried to drive the idea of being a bimbo from her thoughts, the warm, fuzzy comforting sensation of simple happiness not wanting to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a physical effort, an accompanying grunt, as she forced her thoughts back towards intelligence. Yuki felt her body shift once more. A flash of raven, framed her vision. A slow huff coming as she released the tense breath she hadn't known she was holding. It wasn't ideal, as she took a mental survey. The sensation of being split in two... A thong vanishing where the Sun don't shine making her want to squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/858cfe1ff68f3b8f3e52335a56784e1a/tumblr_pdhqbhqKx51w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/858cfe1ff68f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on the positive side, she could tell even now that she wasn't anything like as busty. Dismissing that thought, in case it returned, Yuki looked her body over in comparison. If pressed, she'd have guessed she was a Latina now. Her skin darker, more coffee coloured. Her thoughts drifting towards expectations and clich\u00e9s. She felt the change, before she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/a42fe2f2a1ce1c701104326536f9f6eb/tumblr_pdhqbhqKx51w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/a42fe2f2a1ce...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arse swelling to a round perfection. The kind of booty that haunted mens' dreams. A smile flickered uncertainly over her face, at the power it'd give her. The smile faltered, as a couple of quick -<i>cracks</i>- split the air. She glanced over her shoulder. The damage was clear. She had an arse that would make a horse proud. So full, So round, So firm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/321d64b9150df95e7e166a3f16caa259/tumblr_pdhqbhqKx51w2lwkto3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/321d64b9150d...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts drifted towards carnival. The barely clothed dancers, the swaying of their hips, their taunting teasing dance... that public, a voyeuristic streak....</span></div></div>",

She sat her chubby body on her bed and opened a bag of chips, eating to distract herself from her problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Monday and her week was off to a great start. She gotten a test back she hadn\u2019t done very well on, she\u2019d heard some bimbo on campus whispering under her breath about her, and her mother had started lecturing her the moment she came home. No surprise there. Zoey\u2019s mother, despite her age, was in pretty good shape. She was a bit of a health freak; constantly trying new diets and recipes and exercises. Zoey was far from enjoying that life style. She liked eating and not exercising. She liked the results it gave her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her chips, she dug through her bag to begin studying. Instead, she found a little grey recording device with a note stuck to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d she mumbled before reading the note. \u201c\u2019<i>Record your deepest desires and make them real</i>.\u2019\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey was intrigued.

She pressed record. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI have more chips,</i>\u201d she recorded at the encouragement of belly. Pressing stop, she heard sparkling sound and instantly noticed two new bags on chips sitting beside her. \u201cHoly shit it works!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey looked from the chips to the Dictaphone thinking of the possibilities. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was panting a little and her tan skin glistened with sweat. She wore tennis shoes, yoga pants, and a pink tank top over her sports bra. She pulled the hair tie out her long blonde hair and removed her shirt.<i> I should probably shower before</i> I leave, she thought.<i> Don\u2019t want to be, like, all sweaty walking home. What if someone cute talks to me? <br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<i>Exercising all the time like this is why you\u2019re so skinny</i>, she thought as well.<i> No wonder you have no curves. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook the intrusive thought from her mind. Now was no time for a pity party. She opened her lock and was going to get her things so she could get cleaned up when she noticed a present inside. She picked it up gently, suspicious. You never could to be too careful, she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t say who it was from. Just<i> To Jojo </i>on the wrapping. She had gotten gifts from secret admirers before but this was a little more unsettling. She was in the girl\u2019s locker room after all so most likely some creep had snuck in to plant it. That or it was one of the girls. That wouldn\u2019t be so bad, Jojo thought with a smile. Still, the most concerning part was how it got in her locker. It had been locked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, her curiosity got the better of her. Jojo gingerly ripped of the packaging and very carefully opened the parcel. Inside she found a little grey box and a note. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>\u2019Record your deepest desires and make them real</i>\u2019,\u201d Jojo read quietly from the note, confused. She turned her attention to the grey box. It was mostly featureless; just three buttons to record, stop, or play. Based on that and the note, she came to the conclusion that it was a recording device of some kind. Which was probably one of the strangest gifts she had gotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was curious though. Her deepest desires? Whatever did that mean? She was of the intrusive thought from before and she had an idea of what it meant. She decided to test the little device on something small first though. She looked around nervously to make sure no one was listening and pressed record. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI, like, don\u2019t need to shower and am already clean,</i>\u201d she whispered into the device before pressing stop. She heard a strange sparkling sound and jumped in surprise. She felt a chill shoot across her skin followed by the smell of peaches. Looking down, Jojo noticed that she was no longer covered in sweat and, with a sniff, that the peach smell was coming from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gawd,\u201d she exclaimed excitedly. \u201cIt worked!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many possibilities were going through her mind. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The scent of peaches followed her as she ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crashed into Marilyn Monroe, as she dove through the door into the night air. Muttering an apology, she pushed past her into the open air. A backwards glance at Marilyn as she admired the red sequin dress. A good copy of one she wore in 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes', although nowadays it would probably draw comparisons with Jessica Rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fashion eye following Marilyn's ass as it went up the stairs. It was shaping up to be a weird night, with the Marilyn Monroe look-a-like competition that was being run in the nearby hall. Feeling a little self-conscious, Jojo clicked on the dictaphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wish I was a little bigger,... just a cup size or two...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clicked it off, as she felt the warmth build in her chest. As a student she was aware that dresses just didn't hang right on her. That a shapelier figure would better display her work. Running her hands down her sides, smoothing out imaginary, and real wrinkles, Jojo found that her ass was filling out too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes flicked between her swelling bust, and the half-reflected image in the glass of the doorway. Twisting this way and that, she admired how she looked, even now, even in these casual clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me...\" another blonde brushed past Jojo. She was entirely blind to Jojo's recent changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Marilyn was dressed in 'The Seven Years Itch' dress. One that she more than filled... Fighting down her sense of jealousy, it was hard for her to enjoy her own expansion... so modest it felt now. The roving eyes she hoped would wander in her direction were too easily distracted by the gaudier girls, the bigger bust, and the more ostentatious displays of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ground her teeth, at how brief her happiness had been. Even now it felt like she was being taunted. Once inside the Sorority, she'd already heaved the girls free from the dress, as she adjusted herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/59e66ef6f7d2c9e0c5c2a65436cbdbf0/tumblr_p35ypaGxFj1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/59e66ef6f7d2...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spike of malice, shot through her, as the 'Marilyn' adjusted herself... The probably self-made dress, just not being comfortable, or showy enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wish she were bustier, too. With titties as big as her head.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saliva flew from her mouth, as she clicked the dictaphone off once more. \"Enjoy the udders\", she muttered under her breath, not sure what to expect, she smiled broadly, as Marilyn grew....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlind to her own changes, 'Marilyn' was expanding, to such an extent that even Jojo felt a twinge of sympathy, of empathy. They looked bloody heavy, and her shoulders would certainly be painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/6d24d74c339115501b0eb0e852aad667/tumblr_p35ypaGxFj1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/6d24d74c3391...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure if they'd finished growing, as 'Marilyn' slid the girls back inside her dress. It was only then that she spotted Jojo watching her, and blew her a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss barely registered, as Jojo was still in shock, the dictaphone was real... The dictaphone was <i><b>real!</b></i></span></div></div>",

Over the years, many different people lived in the mansion, ranging from the rich, the stupid, the fat and the well-endowed.  One thing the occupants all had in common was where they were buried. All members of the Davis Family who ever lived in that mansion were buried out back, and the legend that the servants within the house pass down involves the spirits of the departed looking for a way to leave their mark on the living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia laughs this off, along with the warnings from her parents about the house, and decides to move into the old mansion.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ms. Talia. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance\".<br>\r\nSmiling at the wizened butler, Talia dropped her bags. Compared to the old butler, who wore a smooth black tuxedo, she was dressed simply. On that particular day, she had decided to wear a black t-shirt with a pink heart scrawled on it, along with a pair of ripped jeans. <br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you to, sir,\" Talia said as the butler straightened up. Even at full height, he was tiny. Talia was by no means tall, but even she towered over the tiny butler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are too kind, Ms. My name is Godfrey, and I had the pleasure of serving your grandparents. I hope to serve you for as long as you'll have me,\" Godfrey said. <br>\r\n\"You knew Nanny and Grandad?\" Talia asked. While she had been close with her grandparents, she had had no idea that they lived in a mansion with actual servants. Her father had always told her that they lived ' Far Away', and that's why they rarely visited. <br>\r\n\"Yes, they were remarkable people. I am sorry for your loss,\" Godfrey said. \"Now, if you'd please follow me, I shall take you to the Master Bedroom. You may leave your bags, someone will take them to your room\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Godfrey through the chilly corridors of the old mansion, Talia was amazed at the amount of pictures that decorated the wall. They were all massive full-body portraits, each depicting a different person. <br>\r\n\"Old owners of the house,\" Godfrey explained, noting Talia's interest in the paintings. \"Each one added something... New... to the mansion. As I understand it, your grandparents broke this tradition, refusing to add anything to the mansion. For this reason, they will not receive any portraits\".<br>\r\n\"What if I commission one?\" Talia asked, saddened by her new knowledge. Upon hearing that these pictures were of old owners, she had hoped that her grandparents would maybe have a painting. <br>\r\n\"Then we must respect your wishes, and display it wherever you please,\" Godfrey said. \"Here we are\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping in front of an opulent looking door, Godfrey produced a ring of keys that jingles loudly as he flicked through them. <br>\r\n\"Are all doors locked?\" Talia asked nervously. If she had remember a keyring that size, then it was likely that she'd get locked out on multiple occasions. <br>\r\n\"Of course not, Ms. Only certain rooms are locked. You will receive a set of keys, as per your grandparents orders. After you...\"<br>\r\nEntering the room, Talia let out a gasp. It was huge! Her old bedroom wasn't even half the size of this place! One side of the room was taken up by a large wardrobe, along with a large full-body mirror. The other side had a massive four-post bed, with the comfiest mattress she had ever seen. A door opposite her was slightly ajar, revealing a toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-this is my room?\" Talia asked in disbelief. <br>\r\n\"Of course, Ms. The master bedroom is all yours. Should you have guests over, there are other bedrooms to accommodate them should they require it\".<br>\r\nTalia was speechless. She could hardly believe that she owned this room, let alone the entire mansion. <br>\r\n\"I shall allow you to become acquainted with your new mansion. Should you require me, merely shout. And before I forget, dinner will be starting soon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Godfrey left the room, Talia immediately headed for the bed. She needs to see how comfy is actually was...<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" She squealed, sinking into the mattress. \"This is so good!\"<br>\r\nRolling around in her new bed, Talia would've happily lay there all day, however she was curious about the rest of the mansion. Reluctantly leaving the bed, Talia walked towards the gargantuan wardrobe. Opening one of the doors, she was surprised to find a collection of dresses that looked like they belong to an entirely different time period. <br>\r\n\"Probably won't wear any of them,\" she said, shutting the door. <br>\r\nDeciding to check out the bathroom, she found that it too was rather large. Aside from the toilet, there were two sinks, a massive bathtub and a shower. The bathtub was about the same size as her old bathroom, which was one of the most cramped spaces Talia had ever come across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the bathroom, Talia genuinely had no idea what she wanted to do. She was hungry, and dinner sounded delicious. However, she really wanted to look around her new house, and see what secrets it held... </span></div></div>",

It let out a loud rumble, causing Talia to blush. <br>\r\n\"I suppose it has been a long day...\" She laughed. \"Now, clothes, where are my..?\"<br>\r\nLooking around for her suitcases, she remembered that they were probably still sitting in the main atrium, or whatever it was called. <br>\r\n\"I don't really want to turn up in these old things,\" She said, looking down at her old clothes. \"Maybe there's a dress that isn't from the 1800s?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing open the wardrobe, she began flicking through dresses, letting out the occasion 'Ooo', or the more common 'That looks alright'.<br>\r\nFinally coming across something that looked like it was fairly recent in terms of fashion, Talia pulled it out of the wardrobe. It was a rather simple black dress. The only issue she had with it was how deep the neckline plunged. Her breasts weren't huge, so she wasn't in danger of showing off massive amounts of cleavage, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it can't be helped,\" She said, heading to the mirror. Taking off her t-shirt and revealing her pert breasts, Talia shivered. The lack of heating was a little concerning...<br>\r\nTaking off her jeans, she pulled the dress over her head. The material was soft against her skin, which she hadn't expected. <br>\r\n\"I guess this'll do,\" Talia said, twirling. Pulling her black hair into a ponytail, she was about to leave the room when she realised that she hadn't changed shoes. Sighing, she looked back at the wardrobe and prepared to go diving for a pair of matching shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes, Talia left her room, now sporting a set of small black heels that complimented both her dress and hair. As she made her way down the corridor, she quickly realised that she had no idea where she was going. She could barely remember the way back to the main hall, let alone finding a whole new room. <br>\r\n\"I could shout for Godfrey,\" She mused. \"Or, I could explore. Yeah, let's do it!\"<br>\r\nTaking a right, Talia wandered through the long corridors of her mansion until...</span></div></div>",

I found it!\" Talia said triumphantly, punching the air. \"And now, for my reward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the doors, which creaked open, she was met with the sight of a massive room with an arched ceiling. A massive table that could easily sit 60 Sat in the centre of the room. Around the walls were more paintings of previous owners. Looking at them, Talia noticed that all of them were women, and all of them were fat in some form. Some had massive flabby breasts, others had large backsides, but all of them had the same doughy gut that stretched their clothes to the maximum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the dining room, Ma'am\" came a quiet voice that, despite being almost inaudible, made Talia jump in shock. <br>\r\n\"Oh!\" She exclaimed, turning to face the owner of the voice. She found a nervous looking maid, clad in a long black dress with the stereotypical white apron covering the front of it. She fiddled with her ginger hair, which was pulled into a ponytail similar to her own. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry... I didn't mean to frighten you, Ma'am...\" She apologized, bowing low. <br>\r\n\"No, it's alright! I was just admiring the pictures...\", Talia said, flashing the maid a smile. \"I'm Talia. Who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Serena, Ma'am... I'm the maid in charge of the dining room...\" She said quietly. <br>\r\n\"Please, call me Talia. I'm not used to being called Ma'am or Ms or anything like that\", Talia said. <br>\r\nSerena nodded before gesturing for Talia to follow her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the food like here?\" Talia asked, the silence between the pair unnerving her slightly. <br>\r\n\"Well, I've been told its very tasty...\" Serena replied. \"There's a set menu every night, based on what you like to eat...\"<br>\r\n\"I don't remember telling anyone what I like,\" Talia told her. <br>\r\n\"Your grandparents told us...\" Serena responded. \"They pretty much set everything up for you...\"<br>\r\nTalia remained silent. She still had trouble believing that they were gone. <br>\r\n\"Here we are. If you need anything, I'll be in the kitchens...\" Serena said, pulling an ornate wooden chair out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she headed into what Talia presumed was the kitchens, she decided to have  a look around the massive dining room. Heading up to one of the pictures, she brushed some dust away from a small plaque attached to the frame. <br>\r\n\"Lady Molly Davis,\" Talia muttered. \"1790 to 1857... Are all of these members of my family?\"<br>\r\nLooking at a couple more pictures confirmed her theory. However, what puzzled her still was the lack of any pictures of males. The halls outside had a couple of portraits of guys, but the dining hall was strangely devoid of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may, Ma- Talia,\" came a quiet voice that caused Talia to jump again.<br>\r\n\"Serena!\" She exclaimed, clutching her chest. \"You really need to learn to announce your presence in a way that doesn't give me a heart attack!\"<br>\r\nSerena bowed her head in apology. <br>\r\n\"I am sorry... I've always been this quiet...\" Serena said. <br>\r\n\"It's not a problem... Can you explain why there's no pictures of guys in this room?\" Talia asked.  <br>\r\n\"I don't rightly know... The pictures are placed depending on where their occupant spent most of their time... Perhaps the men didn't spend much time in here?\" Serena suggested. \"But, there are rumours about the people painted in these pictures...\"<br>\r\nTalia laughed. She had heard these rumours from her parents, who had tried to discourage her from taking ownership of the house. <br>\r\n\"The ones about how the former occupants roam the corridors and 'possess' people?\"<br>\r\nSerena nodded. <br>\r\n\"I don't believe ghosts exist. It just seems silly, the spirits of the dead coming back to life, or whatever, and possessing people. I mean, how does that even work?\"<br>\r\nSerena shrugged. She didn't rightly know, nor was she eager to find out. <br>\r\n\"I don't know, Ma- Talia. I just came over to tell you that your first course is ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her seat at the large table, Talia grinned as a plate of Mozzarella Sticks was placed in front of her. She wasted no time in grabbing a couple and munching through them. <br>\r\n\"Oh my God... These are so good!\" She exclaimed, stuffing another into her mouth. <br>\r\nWithin a minute, the rather large plate of mozzarella sticks had disappeared into Talia's mouth. Letting out a burp, she smiled at Serena, who appeared to collect her empty plate. <br>\r\n\"Those were delicious!\" She said happily. \"Please, compliment the chef for me!\" <br>\r\nSerena nodded, heading back into the kitchens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Talia waited for her next course, she didn't realize that she was being watched by one of the former occupants of the house...</span></div></div>",

So good!\" She exclaimed, clamping her meaty hands together. \"Perhaps this one will suffice... Perhaps Lady Eleanor's gluttony shall surface once again!\"<br>\r\nFloating back into her picture frame, Eleanor's chuckles echoed throughout the large dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a faint laugh, Talia stopped playing with her hair and sat up. The room was largely empty, and Serena hadn't given her a heart attack yet... So who had laughed?<br>\r\nGetting up, Talia looked around the room. Nothing really caught her eye, until she turned to face a large portrait behind her. The occupant smiled down at her, her hands resting on her thick hips. The way in which she had been drawn allowed Talia to see that she had once had a massive backside. Her dress, long and elegant, had even been drawn shorter than what it should've been as her backside had obviously caused it to rise. Aside from her large lower body, she also had a pair of meaty breasts that looked constricted within her dress. Below them sat a large belly, forcing her dress a good couple of feet. <br>\r\n\"Let's see here... Lady Eleanor Davis. 1671 to 1690... She died when she was 19?! That's so sad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Eleanor smiled slightly. Her life had just been constant bullying, which is why she had resorted to food. Seeing someone actually showing sadness over her death... It was an odd feeling, one she wasn't too familiar with. She briefly considered leaving her alone when words that she was all too familiar with echoed throughout the hall. <br>\r\n\"Your second course, Talia\".<br>\r\nHearing this, Eleanor stuck her head through her picture frame, curious to see how the Madison's newest occupant would tackle her next meal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a large plate set in front of her, Talia had to stop herself from drooling. Her favourite meal of all time, Roast Chicken with Mashed Potatoes, was set in front of her. And unlike the tiny portions that her parents gave her every Sunday, this one was an actual whole chicken. Her stomach growled loudly as she looked at the glistening skin, smelt the divine aura of a freshly roasted chicken...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to dig in, Talia lifted her fork. Digging it into the pile of mashed potato that sat next to the massive chicken, she stuck a couple of formula of potato into her mouth before swallowing. She let out a content sigh. They had made them with extra butter... <br>\r\nReluctantly dropping her fork, Talia cut into the giant chicken that sat before her. She had no idea how she was going to finish the entire thing, but damn if she wouldn't give it her best shot!<br>\r\nTaking a bite, she couldn't help but moan. The chicken, like the potatoes, was heavenly. Looking around for Serena and finding no trace of the ginger-haired maid, Talia dropped her fork. Her parents had scolded her the last time she had tried to eat with her hands, but they weren't here right now. Ripping a leg of the chicken, she dug in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her vantage point, Eleanor couldn't believe her eyes. The way she used her hands to scoop the potato into her mouth with ease, the way in which she devoured the chicken... It was almost like looking in a mirror! She swallowed hungrily, wanting nothing more than to join the owner and help her eat her meal... But she held back. She forced herself to wait, to see if she truly was worth possessing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a satisfied burp, Talia wiped her hands clean. Gravy, potato and grease had mixed together on her hands, but after some vigorous scrubbing, her hands were reasonably clean. <br>\r\n\"That was so good...\" Talia moaned. \"I don't know if I could eat anymore...\"<br>\r\n\"Pardon me, Talia...\"<br>\r\nTalia flinched as Serena appeared behind her. However, she didn't have the energy to ask her to not do that, so she let it slide. <br>\r\n\"The chefs were wondering if you wanted strawberry or chocolate icing on your muffins?\"<br>\r\nTalia groaned before answering...</span></div></div>",

Never in her life had she eaten so much...<br>\r\n\"The food is so good... I wonder what the muffins will be like?\" Talia wondered, forcing herself to sit up. She couldn't wait to try them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her picture frame, Eleanor had made her mind up. She'd happily 'bless' the house's owner with her presence. How she wanted her blessing to manifest, however, was a different matter. <br>\r\nWhile she had been alive, Eleanor had been known for two things. Being able to eat immense amounts of food before stopping, or being able to gain weight from the smallest amount of food. <br>\r\nShe remembered the time when she was 12 when she had raided the kitchens. Her small breasts had almost tripled in size that night! By the time she was done, her dress had almost ripped away from her body. Flesh bulged through multiple rips, which amused her more than anything. Her father, on the other hand, had scolded her fiercely, going so far as to cut her meals down to one course! It wasn't long before she had fainted from hunger, which had prompted her father to reinstate her old meal plan, and then some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the owner, who now had a platter of pink icing topped muffins sitting in front of her, Eleanor decided to make her move. Floating away from her picture frame, she floated gracefully down to the owner. Tapping one of her shoulders, she prepared to make her move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting a muffin to her face, Talia almost dropped it when she felt someone tap her shoulder. <br>\r\n\"Serena, I know I told you to announce yourself in other manners but that's just as... bad?\"<br>\r\nTurning around, Talia was surprised to find that nobody was there. Dismissing it as the wind or something else, she turned back and opened her mouth to take a bite out of her muffin when she felt something force its way into her mouth. Her cheeks bulged as the something fought its way down her throat and into her stomach. Groaning with displeasure, Talia finally forced her mouth shut, coughing as she did. <br>\r\n\"W-What was that?!\" She gasped, looking madly around the room. Seeing nothing, she turned back to her muffin. The incident did worry her, but she was suffering from no ill effects, so she decided to finish her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished off the first muffin...</span></div></div>",

The flavour of them, combined with the fluffiness of the sponge, helped her forget the earlier incident. Even now, she thought nothing of it as she picked up a second muffin, licking her lips as she took a bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Eleanor's presence was now beginning to take effect on the black haired teen. Eleanor had been hoping that her gluttony would affect her host, however she was slightly disappointed to see that Talia's stomach was beginning to look much softer. However, her disappointment lasted a number of seconds as she began to fade away within Talia's body, her reason for still existing on Earth fulfilled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Talia listened to her parents for a while longer, or even allowed Serena to finish her earlier conversation, she would've found that once the spirits had possessed a body and passed on one of their qualities, they would finally move onto their next life. Of course, Talia didn't believe that ghosts and spirits actually existed, so even if she had this knowledge, she immediately dismiss it as 'Rubbish'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing off another muffin, Talia swiftly moved onto another. The large platter that sat in front of her slowly disappeared into the gorging girl, her stomach slowly growing larger and softer. After a couple of muffins, her breasts and backside began to fill with fat. <br>\r\nUpon swallowing the last muffin, Talia promptly let out a satisfied burp. <br>\r\n\"Those were delicious!\" She exclaimed happily. \"This place rocks!\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the kind words...\"<br>\r\nJumping again, Talia smiled at Serena. <br>\r\n\"Serena! Thank you so much for this awesome service!\" Talia said enthusiastically. \"Do you take care of all my meals?\"<br>\r\nSerena nodded. <br>\r\n\"Awesome! Then, I'll see you tomorrow then?\"<br>\r\nGetting slowly to her feet, Talia was completely oblivious to her softer frame. However, Serena noticed that her stomach was much more pronounced, and swallowed nervously. Hopefully, Talia remained oblivious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the Dining Hall, Talia let out a sigh. Now was the fun part... Finding her way back to her room. Doing her best to follow her path from earlier in reverse, she eventually ended up back at her room. Opening the door, she noticed that her bags were sitting next to her bed. And on her nightstand sat a silver platter, a note and a glass of water sitting atop it. <br>\r\nGrabbing the note, Talia ran her eye down it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ms. Talia:<br>\r\nAllow me to welcome you, once again, to Davis Mansion. This note serves as a sort of rule setter. While you are under no obligation to follow these rules, they will make your stay at the Mansion much more enjoyable and pleasant, as well as easier for the staff that work here. <br>\r\n1) Please remain in your room after midnight. Modern security cameras are placed around the halls, and they are automatically wired up to alert security should they catch anybody out of bed after midnight. <br>\r\n2) Please remain away from the burial crypts in the rear garden. They are very old, and house the bodies of distinguished members of the Davis Family. <br>\r\n3) Please alert security to any guests that you may be inviting over. Security has been told to turn away anybody not on the list that the current owner provides. <br>\r\nThese are the rules that are most likely to affect you, and your potential guests. Please, enjoy your stay. <br>\r\n-Godfrey</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cameras? I didn't see any cameras...\" Talia said, placing the note in the bottom drawer of the nightstand. She took a sip of water before taking her dress off. Draping it over the back of one of the chairs in her room, she rummaged around in her bags, eventually pulling out a white t-shirt and a pair of shorts that acted as pyjamas for her. As she pulled the white top on, she noted that it was slightly tighter. Her shorts felt the same way as well, digging slightly into her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Talia taken the time to look in a mirror, she would've seen the changes that had overcome her body. <br>\r\nHer belly had gone from a small layer of flab and become a reasonably sized globe of fat that sat in her lap as she sat on her bed. Her breasts, once small and unnoticeable, had fattened up, making her bra and top tight. Her hips had plumped up, while her backside was much softer. Her thighs were much closer together, almost touching when she stood up. A second chin was beginning to form on her face, while her softer cheeks helped make her face appear much rounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is so awesome!\" Talia exclaimed, lying on her bed. Compared to her old rock-solid mattress, this one felt like she was lying on a cloud. <br>\r\n\"I cannot wait to explore this place tomorrow...\" She said before shutting her eyes and drifting off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hearing a loud knock at her door, Talia let out a loud groan. It was way too early for her to get up, plus, it was the weekend! Who the heck gets up at 10 o'clock on a Saturday?!<br>\r\n\"Wait... 10 o'clock?!\"<br>\r\nRealising the Time, Talia finally moved. Sitting bolt upright, she tugged her t-shirt down to cover her new belly before kicking the duvet aside and jumping out of bed. She ran for the door, her belly bouncing as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I overslept!\" She apologized, throwing open the door to find Serena standing there. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if I woke you...\" She said, bowing her head. <br>\r\n\"No, not at all!\" Talia laughed, running a softer hand through her hair. \"I should really thank you for getting me out of bed!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay then... Anyway, breakfast is ready for you in the dining hall...\" Serena explained. <br>\r\n\"Breakfast? Yeah, okay. Let me get changed, then I'll try to find my way there,\" Talia said, trying to remember how she actually got to the hall last night. <br>\r\nSerena nodded before walking off. Poking her head out the door, Talia watched her turn left at the end of the corridor, rather than right like she had done. <br>\r\n\"Better get ready...\" She said, closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRummaging through her bags, she decided to wear a pink top with a black heart on, along with a pair of plain white shorts. She wasn't looking to impress anybody today. <br>\r\nPulling on a set of old trainers, Talia bounced out of her room, deciding to follow Serena's path to the left. She made it to the dining hall within seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the same seat as yesterday, Talks leaned back in her chair. After the outstanding dinner of last night, she couldn't wait to see what delicious breakfast the chefs could come up with. <br>\r\n\"Pancakes!\"<br>\r\nSpotting Serena holding a large stack of pancakes, Talia let out a cheer. She absolutely adored pancakes. As they neared her, she spotted the unmistakable glint of maple syrup, which only made her happier. <br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" Talia said happily before digging her fork into the massive stack. The last thing Serena saw before the kitchen door swung shut behind her was Talia stuffing herself silly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the first thing she saw when she returned to the dining hall was Talks slumped back in her chair, her hands resting on her massive gut. Somehow, the teen was still completely oblivious to her growing body. Her belly was clearly visible, her top unable to cover the doughy globe. Her breasts had swelled up even larger, easily double the size they were before her breakfast. Her hips were much thicker, flesh bulging over the waistband. <br>\r\nSeeing Talia stand, Serena saw just how much bigger she actually was. Her belly now hung down, almost completely covering the front of her tightened shorts. The bottom of her padded ass was slightly visible. A second chin had fully formed on her rounder face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really good, Serena. Thanks!\" Talia said, before making for the door, her thighs pushing together as she walked. Leaving the dining hall, Talia briefly thought of unpacking. The thought was swiftly pushed from her head as she looked down a long corridor. <br>\r\n\"Wonder what's down there...\" She mused, tapping her chin with a thick finger. After a moment's thought, Talia...</span></div></div>",

Every so often, she'd stop to inspect a painting, eager to learn more about the owners of the mansion over the ages. The fact that her grandparents would not be added to the walls saddened her, however she head decided earlier that she just commission a painting of them anyway. She had made friends with a couple of aspiring artists that could probably give it a decent shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding a corner, Talia was slightly disappointed to see that she had somehow ended up outside her bedroom. <br>\r\n\"Damn, this place is hard to navigate,\" She said, breathing slightly more heavily. Even though she had put on an easy hundred pounds in two meals, Talia was completely ignorant to her hefty body. Even though her meaty breasts swayed from side to side as she walked, and her soft belly rippled with each step, Talia noticed nothing. <br>\r\n\"Let's see here... Left takes me to the dining hall, so right must take me elsewhere, right?\"<br>\r\nTaking a right at the end of the corridor, she was soon lost in the maze of corridors. Unlike yesterday, where she was worried about dinner, Talia was delighted to find that she had no idea where she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a left, Talia paused when she came to the first dead-end she had seen so far. A large painting with an old guy loomed over her as she leaned against the wall, breathing much more heavily now. She wiped some sweat from her forehead. <br>\r\n\"Wonder... if there's a gym... somewhere!\" She gasped, pushing away from the wall. She decided to check out the dead-end, which had two visible doors on either side. Before that, she wandered towards the painting. <br>\r\n\"Sir Alexander Davis, 1812 to 1875,\" She read out, looking up at him. He looked back, a disapproving look on his face. He held one end of his moustache, making him looked like some sort of evil villain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Sir Alexander to plot his plans for world domination, Talia checked out the two doors beside her. One had a plaque on it reading 'Consevatory', while the other one read 'Spa'.<br>\r\n\"I've never actually been by to a spa. Wonder what it's like?\" Talia wondered. She had never had the money for a treatment, but having a spa built into her house was really nice. <br>\r\nThen again, she could hear what sounded like rain from the conservatory. Remembering that she had passed a library, curling up in the conservatory with a good book was also really tempting. <br>\r\nIn the end, Talia decided on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the Spa was really tempting, she had no idea what actually happened in a Spa. She knew there were massages, but beyond that, she actually had no idea. So, she decided to relive her stress in the way she was familiar with. <br>\r\nHeading back through the corridors, Talia surprised herself by almost instantly finding the room she was looking for, the Library. Opening the door, which creaked loudly, Talia entered the Library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow...\"<br>\r\nTalia's mouth hung open as she looked around the Library. It was absolutely gigantic! There were two floors, each one ringed by bookshelves that reached towards their respective ceilings. And from what she could tell, there were loads of different categories, ranging from her personal favourite, Fiction, to slightly weirder titles. Before she could check anything out, her attention was drawn to a counter that had a bespectacled maid standing behind it. She smiled kindly as Talia approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the Mansion's new master, Talia?\"<br>\r\nTalia nodded, still rendered speechless by the size of the library. <br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you. I am Sarah, the Head Librarian. May I ask, are you a huge reader?\"<br>\r\nTalia swallowed, words returning to her mouth. <br>\r\n\"Yes, absolutely. I love reading!\" She enthused. \"I find it really calming, not to mention interesting depending on the book\".<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. You'll be pleased to know that we have a large collection of books. Each new owner added something new to this library. I hope you'll continue this long-standing tradition. Anyway, feel free to peruse the Library as you will. The only request I have is that you take care of the books. Some of them are very old, and may actually be irreplaceable. And if you have any questions, or need help finding a particular book, please feel free to ask the Librarian on duty\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking Sarah, Talia decided to check out that odd section she had seen on the way in. As she neared it, she spotted some of the titles of the books. <br>\r\n\"Let's see here... How Girls Work: A Primer... Boobs and Bust... Searching for Booty... And Thick Girls. Wow, they sound... interesting, I guess?\"<br>\r\nAs she looked at some more of the books, her confusion only grew. They all seemed to involve girls in some way, and the front cover of one even involved a boy becoming a girl. She instantly put it back. <br>\r\nReturning to the original four, she decided to grab them. The titles intrigued her, even though they sounded rather odd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sarah? Do I need to let you know if I take these?\" Talia asked. <br>\r\nSarah nodded. <br>\r\n\"It helps us keep track of the books. If you forget, don't worry about it. All books will be returned to us by the cleaning staff. Let me take care of those for you...\"<br>\r\nGrabbing the four books that Talia had grabbed, Sarah hummed quietly to herself as she flicked through them. Handing them back, she smiled.<br>\r\n\"It'd also help if you return them to us once you're done with them. But once again, don't worry about it if you don't. They'll make their way back to us\".<br>\r\nTaking the books, Talia smiled at Sarah before leaving the library. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, she surprised herself by getting back to the Conservatory within a minute. Opening the door, she let out a happy sigh. <br>\r\nCompared to the rest of the mansion, which was massive, the Conservatory was small. The walls flanking the doors had a couple of paintings on them. A set of double doors led outside, presumably to the rear garden. Opposite her was a sofa with a matching armchair, a coffee table sitting in between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is rather nice. I can see myself spending a good amount of time in here,\" Talia said, looking up at th glass roof. Rain bounced off it, causing her to smile. Rain on glass was a nice sounds one that she particularly loved. It had that calming effect that she liked, able to wash her worries away after an hour or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the armchair, Talia lay the books she had borrowed out in front of her. Leaning back, she gently tapped her exposed belly, causing the surface to ripple. <br>\r\n\"Let's see here... What do I want to start with?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reaching forward, which caused her soft belly to split into two rolls, Talia grabbed the 'Thick Girls' book. She briefly looked at the front cover, which showed a thin girl with a much fatter one shadowed behind her. <br>\r\nFlipping the book over, she skimmed down the blurb.<br>\r\n\"What does being fat actually feel like... How does being fat affect your life... Features interviews from Lady Grace Davis, who is widely recognised as one of the fattest women in existence at the time of publication...\"<br>\r\nTalia narrowed her eyes. She remembered seeing a portrait of Lady Grace. Looking up, she didn't need to look far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the door was a painting of a huge woman. Looking at her, Talia couldn't help but be amazed at the sheer size of her. She almost didn't fit in the frame, she was that big! Each one of her breasts was giant, her dress almost unable to cover them. They looked like basketballs, although they probably weren't as firm. <br>\r\nBelow them sat a massive belly that took up the majority of the pictured. Her hands rested atop the gargantuan globe of flesh. Looking at it, Talia was reminded of a Yoga Ball stuffed into a dress. <br>\r\nHer hips were wide, almost touching either side of the large frame. Italia couldn't see her backside, but judging by the rest of Lady Grace, she could tell that it was huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she was the fattest girl back then?\" Talia wondered. \"It's amazing that she could still move!\"<br>\r\nTurning her attention back to her book, Talia flicked open to the first page. Strangely, the book had no author name, but instead had 'To Lady Grace Davis' inscribed instead. <br>\r\n\"Must've been a pre-published copy or something...\" Talia muttered, flicking to the next page. Within seconds, she was lost in the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking through pages, Talia didn't notice the shimmering coming of Grace's picture frame. Had she looked away from the book for even a second, she would've seen the outline of a massive woman that resembled Lady Grace. <br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you a cute one~\" Grace commented, looking over Talia's plump body. Her eyes lingered on her thick breasts, and her slightly visible cleavage. They then travelled down, stopping again on her doughy belly. Sadly, the rest of her body was hidden by the armchair. <br>\r\n\"You look as though my granddaughter had a little go at you... No matter, I'm sure we can share,\" Grace said, floating slowly towards Talia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned to the next page, Talia jumped when thunder rumbled outside. She had been so into this book, she hadn't noticed that the rain was falling in sheets now, bouncing off the room. <br>\r\n\"Sounds bad out there...\" She said, looking out the window. \"I'm glad I decided to stay inside today\".<br>\r\nAs she turned back to her book, she caught sight of a faint shimmer mere inches from her face<br>\r\n\"What is th- MMPH!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question was cut short as Grace pounced. She leapt into Talia's open mouth, forcing her way down her throat. Talia could do nothing as yet another invisible force invaded her body. She groaned uncomfortably, pinned to her seat. She tried her best to shout for help, or grab at whatever was filling her body, but neither action helped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more and more of Grace's large body entered Talia, Talia began to balloon with fat. Her meaty breasts swelled, causing her shirt to rise and reveal her fattening stomach, which oozed into her lap. Her hips widened, while her backside swelled, causing her shorts to tighten immensely. Thick flesh bulged over the waistband of the rapidly shrinking shorts. Her thighs moved towards each other, fighting for room between Talia's legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace's chubby feet finally disappeared into Talia, who let out a gasp as she was finally able to breathe again. Surprisingly, she still had no idea that she was about 200 pounds heavier than yesterday.<br>\r\nGrace hadn't been kind to her body, her face and neck having filled with fat. Her lips had plumped up, while a third chin was beginning to develop. Her breasts, surprisingly, remained somewhat perky, although her incredibly tight bra might have had something to so with that. Each one had almost doubled in size.  <br>\r\nThe neckline of her shirt had plunged revealing an incredibly deep canyon of soft, jiggly cleavage, while the rest of the shirt had been pulled up to cover her breasts. Her massive gut was on full-view, having split into two distinctive rolls, the lower one easily larger than the top one. Talks had subconsciously spread her legs to allow her belly to sit in between her pillar-like thighs. <br>\r\nTalia's lower body was easily the largest part of her, mirroring how Grace had once looked. Her thick thighs led to chubby calves, and below them, pudgy feet. Her hips had almost doubled in size, and behind her, Sat her massive ass, which easily stuck out behind her a good couple of feet, forming a very distinctive booty shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... was that?!\" Talia finally asked. She got to her feet, groaning as she did. Every aspect of her body, except her breasts, sagged downwards. Her belly completely covered her tiny shorts, which had trouble covering her massive ass. Her thighs fought for room between her legs, pushed up against one another. <br>\r\nTaking a step forward, Talia's entire body jiggled. She inspected every part of the room before standing awkwardly near the door. She kind of wanted to leave the Conservatory, but she also wanted to read... And the sound of rain was so soothing...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Flipping her chosen book over, Talia found that she had grabbed the book about girls. She was interested to see what this was about, quickly flipping it back over to read the blurb. <br>\r\n\"Do you have issues with girls?\" She read out loud, her chins wobbling. \"Do you spend countless nights wondering how people of the fairer sex operate? Well, wonder no more! This book will explain how girls, and by extenstion, women work, explaining how they think, what they like, and, most importantly, what they look for in boys! Join us on this wonderful journey as we work out 'How Girls Work'! Well, that's certainly interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being what most people would view as a typical girl, Talia had spent the majority of her childhood playing with Lego instead of dolls. She preferred to have her hair cut short rather than long. She wore blue instead of pink. And when she was old enough, she secretly joined the Boy Scouts. However, once puberty started to hit her and her breasts had started growing, she was forced to quit, much to her annoyance. <br>\r\nHaving a chance to view how she would have been expected to behave as a normal girl was interesting, to say the least. Flipping the front cover open, Talia stuck her meaty legs up on the coffee table, which copied her chair and creaked, and got stuck in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming happily to herself, Talia was once again oblivious to the faint shimmer from the other frame in the room. Unlike Lady Grace, who had been a massive woman while she lived, Lady Elizabeth, her sister, was the complete opposite. She had watched her weight strictly, and had never had anything that could be referred to as 'Fat' on her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, she had been blessed, as some men called it, with an exceptional body. Her blonde hair had been long and silky, reaching down to her ample backside. Her face was soft, but not in a way that made her look fat. Her pretty blue eyes had been the envy of many a man, and occasional woman. Make-up coated her face, her plump lips coloured a ruby-red, whip her eyes were outlined with a line of black eyeliner. Light red blush covered her supple cheeks. <br>\r\nHer breasts, captured beautifully by the painter, were large and firm, a canyon of cleavage almost as deep as Talia's clearly visible. Moving past her slender stomach, Elizabeth had had large hips, perfect for bearing children, which she did many times with many different men. In fact, Lady Elizabeth had had the most children out of any Davis, many of them unknown to history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Talia turned another page, Elizabeth silently glided out of her picture frame, landing elegantly, her long dress flowing around her ghostly form. <br>\r\n\"Mmm, another woman... And I see that my sister has already made herself known to her... No matter,\" Elizabeth purred. \"I believe I can happily share this one thing...\"<br>\r\nStriding across the room, her dress billowing behind her, Elizabeth circled around to the back of Talia's chair. She briefly peeked over her shoulder, reading along with her, before leaning back. Unlike many of the other spirits that inhabited the old Mansion, the way in which she granted her gift differed greatly. Rather than forcing herself into someone's body, she preferred to use her natural charms. <br>\r\n\"Let's play, darling...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCircling around Talia, Elizabeth willed herself invisible. As she crouched down in front of the unaware woman, she ran a slender finger over her ruby lips, making sure they were ready to go. Satisfied, she phased through Talia's book, quickly locking lips with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of Elizabeth's presence, Talia let out a surprised \"Mmph!\" when she felt something lock lips with her. Dropping her book and pushing away at thin air, she began to feel rather light-headed. She leaned back, her muffled grunts of protest slowly fading away until she was silent, her eyes drooping lazily as Elizabeth worked her charms on the heavy woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elizabeth continued her long kiss, she could see changes overcoming Talia. Her black hair, cut short and made to look messy, began to lengthen, reaching down towards her shoulders. Her brown eyes, only half-visible under her eyelids, changed colour to a nice blue, similar to Elizabeth's. Her lips became thicker, and took on a slight red hue. Likewise, her pale cheeks became slightly redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling herself beginning to fade away, Elizabeth ramped up her advances. She cupped Talia's breasts, grunting quietly with effort as she lifted the heavy melons. As she began to massage them, she felt them perk up slightly, and become somewhat firmer. If Talia ever lost her weight, her breasts would naturally be a lot bigger, and a lot firmer. However, Eleanor and Grace had beaten Elizabeth to Talia, so it was unlikely that she ever would lose her new weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter firming up Talia's breasts, Elizabeth moved her hands downwards. She briefly massaged the lower roll of Talia's belly, inciting a quiet moan from the half-conscious girl, before reaching her lower body. Similar to her breasts, Elizabeth did her best to cup her expansive ass cheeks, slowly making them firmer. However, the sheer size of them meant that the extra firmness wouldn't make much difference, but that didn't bother her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her slender hands up to Talia's head, Elizabeth slowly ran her fingers in circles on the side of Talia's head. She began to mess with her head, slowly changing various memories. Instead of playing with strange blocks, Talia remembered playing with Barbie dolls. Instead of joining the Boy Scouts, she remembered taking cheerleading lessons. Her hair had always been long, she always wore make-up...<br>\r\nShe remembered taking interest in the opposite sex from a young age. Her parents had gone ballistic when they had found her kissing a boy when she was 11! She remembered having sex for the first time when she was 15...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her gifts almost completely passed onto Talia, Elizabeth finally broke away. Still mostly unresponsive, Elizabeth had no trouble pushing her way into Talia's open mouth. As soon as she reached her stomach, she faded away, releasing her final gift to Talia. In reference to her many children, Elizabeth had raised Talia's fertility immensely. The chances of her becoming pregnant were almost 100%, if she ever actually had sex with anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Elizabeth's presence finally gone, Talia's eyes shot open. She sat bolt upright, looking around the empty conservatory. <br>\r\n\"That... was really odd...\" She muttered, brushing her longer hair behind her ears. It reached down to the middle of her back, and had a couple of blonde streaks running through it. <br>\r\nGetting to her feet with a grunt, Talia amazingly still didn't notice anything amiss with her body. She adjusted her top, trying to tug it down slightly. However, she quickly gave up, unable to pull it over her globular stomach. <br>\r\n\"It's quite cold in here,\" She said out loud, her accent sounding slightly more posh. \"I should probably leave soon...\"<br>\r\nGrabbing her books, Talia left the slightly darker conservatory, her body rippling as she headed through the halls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dropping the books back off at the Library, Talia headed back to her room. As she rounded a corner, she jumped slightly, which caused her entire body to jump as well, as she found Serena standing there. <br>\r\n\"Pardon me, Talia...\" She said quietly, ignoring how Talia was clutching her chest. \"I was wondering if you would like dinner tonight?\"<br>\r\nAfter a moment of hard breathing, Talia finally answered...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Serena, that sounds amazing!\" Talia said enthusiastically. Only now did she realize that she was absolutely starving, having skipped lunch in favour of reading. \"I don't suppose you know what's for dinner?\"<br>\r\nSerena shook her head. <br>\r\n\"Unfortunately not. The cooks are the ones with the list of your favoured meals. What dinner consists of is up to them. However, the amount they make is completely up to you. Do you have any preference as to courses?\"<br>\r\nTalia tapped one of her chins. She was starving, but after the massive chicken that she struggled to finish yesterday, she had no idea on how much she should ask for. <br>\r\n\"I guess a main course and a dessert would do... Yeah, I'll go with that,\" Talia decided. <br>\r\nSerena nodded before disappearing down another corridor. Talia headed for her room, wondering what dress she should wear that night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival in her room, Talia instantly stripped, or tried to. Reaching under her breasts, she groped around for the hem of her t-shirt. Her breasts and belly jiggled as she did. Eventually finding it, she slipped the t-shirt over her head, leaving her top half clad in nothing bar a very stretched bra. <br>\r\nLifting her belly, she fiddled around with the front of her shorts, looking for the button. Unable to find it, as it had popped off after Eleanor had finished with her, Talia shrugged, slipping her shorts down her thick legs. Her panties were in a very similar position as her bra, stretched over her massive lower body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling towards her wardrobe, Talia opened up a random door. She was met with a large selection of older dresses that looked as though they were from the 1950s. There were formal one's along with more casual ones. She found herself oddly fascinated with a white collared shirt and navy skirt combo, a set of fishnet tights and red heels sitting below it. Grabbing it, Talia inspected it briefly before smiling. <br>\r\n\"This would look rather nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbuttoning the shirt, Talia pulled the garment over her head. She found that it covered her expansive upper body quite well, with exception of her breasts and cleavage. She struggled with the top couple of buttons on the shirt, eventually giving up and leaving her canyon-like cleavage on view. Below her breasts sat her massive belly, which pushed the soft fabric out a good couple of feet. Before moving onto the skirt, Talia did her best to pull the shirt down as far as it would go. Getting it down to her lower belly roll, she nodded before grabbing the skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally got the blue skirt over her large hips, she found that it helped hide her large ass and thick thighs, however did very little for her wide hips, which forced the skirt outwards a good bit to either side. <br>\r\nBending over, which caused her skirt to ride down slightly, exposing the top of her ass, and forcing her belly to split into multiple rolls, she grabbed the fishnet tights, pulling them up her tree-trunk legs. Finally, she pulled the heels onto her pudgy feet. She wiggled her toes briefly before twirling, adjusting quickly to her new heels, despite never actually having wore heels before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she left her room, Talia's eye was drawn to a dressing table with a number of items on it. As she drew closer, she spotted some lipstick, along with a container of blush. Lifting them, she popped the top off the lipstick and applied a generous amount, leaving her lips ruby red. Dropping it and then grabbing the blush and accompanying brush, she dabbed some on her cheeks, making them also appear slightly redder. <br>\r\nBefore she turned away, she spotted her long hair, which stuck out at random angles. <br>\r\n\"I can't really go out with my hair looking like this...\" She said, grabbing a hairbrush. Dragging it through her hair, she quickly straightened her hair out. If she had more time, and the right tools, she would've curled it, making it match her 1950s look. Not entirely pleased with her appearance, Talia reluctantly left her room and headed for the dining hall. <br>\r\nSitting on her usual chair, which wasn't wide enough for her larger frame, Talia let out a sigh. She could smell her dinner from here, and it smelt awesome! She smoothed out her shirt, tugging it down to cover her lower belly roll before laying her hands atop her upper role. She hummed happily to herself, waiting for her meal to arrive...<br>\r\n\"Pardon me, Talia\".<br>\r\nLetting out a shocked gasp, Talia turned to face Serena, who held a large plate in one of her hands. <br>\r\n\"Serena, please... You need to find a way better way to let people know you're here!\" Talia pleaded with her. \"Like, cough or something!\"<br>\r\n\"I shall try to, Talia... Your main course. Fish and Chips. As per your liking, the fish is extra crispy, as are the chips. Please, enjoy your meal\".<br>\r\nBowing, Serena left Talia, who quickly dug into her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout five minutes later, Serena returned to a much heavier Talia. Her belly had easily pushed out another couple of inches, no amount of tugging on her shirt able to cover her large belly roll. Her breasts had caused her buttons to tighten, the top-most one on the verge of popping off. Her hips stuck out underneath the arms of the chair, while her backside hung off the sides of it, wobbling as Talia shifted to face Serena, a massive grin on her triple chinned face. <br>\r\n\"That was delicious, Serena. Thank you very much,\" Talia said happily. \"Can't wait for desert!\"<br>\r\nSerena merely nodded before leaving. She was rather concerned for her new master, who was, somehow, completely oblivious to the changes overcoming her body and mind. However, she didn't want to say anything in case she overreacted and decided to leave the Mansion, which wouldn't bode well for the staff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later, Serena returned reluctantly, a brown cake with matching icing spread on the surface held in her hands. In order to not get surprised, Talia had her eye trained on the kitchen door. As soon as Serena appeared, she grinned, her chins wobbling. <br>\r\n\"Is this chocolate?\" She asked eagerly. She loved chocolate so much...<br>\r\nNodding, Serena left quickly, not wanting to see her master blow up like a balloon before her very eyes. She reached the door just in time, turning back for a moment to see Talia already busy stuffing her face with the chocolatey treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stuffing the last piece of cake into her mouth, Talia let out a long moan. That cake was easily the best cake she had ever tasted in her life, and she had tried a lot of different cakes. She loved how soft and light it was, along with how the chocolate sauce hidden within it tasted... She would happily eat another one!<br>\r\nThe chocolate cake, delicious as it was, had added more weight to Talia's already weighty body. Her belly had forced her shirt up, completely revealing the tripled rolled mass of flesh. She tapped the surface of her belly, which caused it to jiggle.<br>\r\nHer breasts were much heftier, each one almost the size of a football. A couple of buttons button had popped off during her binge, exposing more of the jiggly mounds. Her hips were wide enough that they were wedged under the arms of the chair, while her colossal backside hung down off the sides of the chair even more so than earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to get up, Talia found that the chair came with her. <br>\r\n\"Stupid thing...\" She cursed silently, wiggling her hips in an attempt to free herself. Placing her meaty hands on it, she gave a hard push, which finally freed her from the tight confines of the chair. <br>\r\n\"Much better!\" She muttered happily, wiggling her hips again. As she headed for the door, they swayed from side to side, a side effect from Elizabeth that was only making itself known now. Deciding to turn in, Talia headed back to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her attire off, Talia stuck it back in the wardrobe, making a mental note to remember where it was. She'd happily wear that again. <br>\r\nGrabbing her night clothes, Talia pulled her tiny shirt over her head, finding that it just about covered her breasts. Likewise, her shorts had issues with her lower body, threatening to rip in half as she forced them up her doughy legs. <br>\r\n\"Man, this place is so good...\" Talia said, collapsing heavily onto her bed. Sure, she had to go back to college someday, but she'd happily stay here. Hell, she'd be happy to invite some friends around for a weekend. Godfrey did say that there were extra rooms for guests. <br>\r\n\"I could have some awesome parties here...\" She muttered, before drifting off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

Ghosts...\" She muttered, lifting a heavy arm and swinging at nothing. Her arm dropped, hitting her squarely in the middle of her face. <br>\r\n\"W-What?!\" <br>\r\nShe sat bolt upright, her exposed belly splitting into multiple roles. She scratched her soft cheeks, letting out a cute yawn as she did. <br>\r\n\"That was a horrible dream...\" She whispered, looking around her dark room. Reaching over, she managed to flick her bedside lamp on, instantly blinding her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter regaining her vision, she looked for a clock. However, she quickly found that her room didn't actually have a clock, so she fumbled for her phone. <br>\r\n\"1:46...\" She said lazily, yawning again. \"Well, that's way too early to get up...\"<br>\r\nLocking her phone, Talia shoved her head back onto her pillow. However, no matter what she tried, she just couldn't get back to sleep. Eventually, she let out an unsatisfied groan, staring at the ceiling above her. <br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm up!\" She said unhappily, rolling to the edge of the bed. Getting to her feet, Talia headed for her wardrobe. Opening one of the doors, she grabbed something at random. Pulling out her dress from dinner, she groaned and shoved it back in before feeling around for something that felt somewhat like a dressing gown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding a bright pink dressing gown, which clearly didn't fit her and left most of her body on view, Talia left her room. The corridor outside was dark, the only source of light coming from a window which she hadn't payed much mind to. Looking through it, she was surprised to find that a large courtyard sat opposite her room. <br>\r\n\"I really need to look around this place a lot more,\" she told herself, drawing her gown around her. \"Now, where to go?\"<br>\r\nAs she wandered through the darkened corridors, Talia payed no heed to the warning she had received on day one...<br>\r\nHer heavy footsteps echoing throughout the mansion, the spirits that inhabited it stirred, looking for the owner of the steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding a corner, Talia found herself standing in front of... </span></div></div>",

Squinting hard, she gave up after a couple of seconds, deciding to just find out what was inside. Opening the door, which creaked loudly, Talia tried her best to tip-toe in. However, her heavy feet slapped loudly against the wooden floor, which killed any idea of a stealthy entry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind her and, for an added precaution, locking it, Talia ran her hands over the wall next to her, searching for the light switch. Finding it, she flicked the lights on, revealing what looked like a makeshift beauty salon with a couple of interesting modifications. <br>\r\nWhile the room had a number of make-up tables, covered in various beauty products, and a large mirror with some hair-dressing tools, a queen-sized bed with some sort of outfit was shoved in the corner. It looked totally out of place, Talia thought, as she neared it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the outfit, an amused look spread across her round face. It was a very skimpy outfit, meant to just about cover a woman's breasts and crotch. On Talia's immense frame, however, it would barely cover her nipples, and the tiny pants would cause her to suffer from an awful cameltoe. Despite that, something about the outfit appealed to her, and Talia briefly considered try it on then and there. <br>\r\nInstead, she dropped it back on the bed and took a look around the rest of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the large mirror, Talia found various hair products ranging from different shampoos and conditioners, to straighteners and curlers. She was tempted to add some curls to her long hair, or even straighten it, but again, she looked away. <br>\r\nAs for the make-up table, she found various beauty products. Bottles of eyeliner and containers of blush were scattered across the table, along with different colours of lipstick. Once upon a time, she would've just left this room and its 'girly' devices. After her encounter with Elizabeth yesterday, she was much more accepting of the room, and was very tempted to try one of them out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing one was the hard part. She wouldn't mind a make-over, yet the bed looked exceptionally comfy... Hell, she'd even try on the clothes before going to bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yawning, Talia's mind wandered to the bed. It was larger than the one in her room, and the mattress looked so much more comfortable, if that was even possible. Her current mattress was so soft, and so light...<br>\r\nWandering closer, Talia remembered about the rather skimpy clothing laid out on the bed. Picking it up, she took a good look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia didn't know much about women's clothing, despite Elizabeth's mind customizations, so she didn't really know what she was looking at. It appeared to be some sort of transparent sleeping robe, light-blue in colour. The attached bra was clearly meant for a large, and firm, set of breasts, while the matching panties were also meant for a very large backside. However, Talia's body was way too large for the tiny clothing, which she didn't really pay much mind to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, she dropped the outfit back on her bed before reaching in between her breasts and upper belly roll. She groped around for her t-shirt, eventually finding it and pulling the white garment over her head. She twirled it around her finger before throwing it onto the floor next to the bed. Lifting her belly rolls, she grabbed the waistband of her stretched shorts and pulled them down her legs. They joined her t-shirt on the floor. Reaching back under her belly, she poked around for her panties. She giggled as she accidentally poked something else, before clearing her throat in a reasonably serious manner. Pulling an incredibly stretched set of panties down her legs, she threw them in the growing pile of clothes beside the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubconsciously tapping her hanging belly, which rippled and bounced, Talia grabbed the sleeping robe. She had absolutely no idea how she was meant to put this thing on, so she decided to just guess. <br>\r\nRaising it over her head, she slipped her arms in with a little difficult. Dropping it down, she fiddled with her meaty breasts, her hands and the bra cups both sinking into the soft flesh. After some muttering, and a couple choice words, she managed to get the tiny cups to cover her thick nipples. The hem of the robe stopped just before her mid-belly roll, which was rather impressive, considering the combined size of Talia's breasts and upper belly roll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving onto the panties, Talia struggled to lift her leg, the rest of her body throwing off her balance. Unwilling to try out the bed until she was clothed, she dropped to the floor, the impact sending her ass cheeks rippling. Reaching down to her feet, she now struggled to pull the panties up her tree-trunk sized legs. After a lot of grunts, she got them to her thunderous thighs. After a lot more grunting, and some more swearing, she managed to pull them right up to her belly, which hung down between her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up we get!\"<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Talia gave her new panties a large tug. They slid slowly up her legs until, finally, they could be classed as 'Worn'. Rather than a nice set of light blue panties, Talia now wore a slightly stretched make-shift thong which couldn't even be seen, her belly hanging down to her thighs. However, she didn't really care about that. All she cared about was how comfortable it actually felt. Instead of painfully digging into her, the bra and thong felt nice and silky against her skin. As she ran her hands over them, she noted that her breasts and ass felt somewhat firmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwirling, Talia grinned as she faced the bed. <br>\r\n\"Time for bed!\" She said happily. \"I cannot wait to see how comfy you are!\"<br>\r\nHeading for the bed, every inch of her exposed body wobbling, Talia let out a satisfied groan as she jumped onto the bed. <br>\r\n\"Oh... My... God!\" She gasped loudly. \"This is so freaking comfortable! It even beats my own bed!\"<br>\r\nRolling around the huge bed, Talia giggled to herself before snuggling up to one of the pillows. As she lay there, staring at the ceiling, a picture she hadn't seen before caught her eye. Rolling over onto her front, she took a proper look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the most handsome men Talks had ever seen looked down at her, a seductive smile on his face. His brown hair was swept to one side. His icy blue eyes looked down at Talia, who stared back, already enamoured with the painting. His attire was fancy, a brown cloak hiding the right side of his body. His black suit was drawn tight around his muscular arms, while his six-pack was clearly visible through his suit. <br>\r\n\"Wow... He's so hot...\" Talia muttered, suddenly feeling quite flustered. She had seen some cute boys in her time, but this guy was on a whole other level...<br>\r\nAfter a couple more seconds, Talia broke eye contact, forcing herself to look at the name plaque. <br>\r\n\"Lord Damien Immanuel Charles Davis... That is a lot of names... And his initials spell DICK!\"<br>\r\nShe burst into a fit of giggles. After a couple of seconds, she calmed down, looking back up at the painting. There was something hot about it, and that made her feel hot, lustful even...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly looking away from, Talia did her best to get to sleep. However, something kept her awake...<br>\r\nAfter a number of minutes, she let out an irate groan. <br>\r\n\"I can't sleep!\" She complained, pushing herself into a sitting position. \"I suppose that's my beauty sleep done for the night. Is there anything in here to pass the time...\"</span></div></div>",

Nevertheless, she had read her fair share of literature about breast expansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Searching for Booty' featured a similar looking woman with wide hips and a thick ass, rather than a set of large breasts.

Serena always felt like she was hovering nearby, eavesdropping... or waiting to hear and obey any command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book was.... well, it was more a prop for her. An excuse to dismiss Serena, while she sorted her thoughts. There was so much going on that she needed time to herself to think.

The drawing were surely crafted to flatter the model, done with a certain preference for the Rubenesque.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't keep your thoughts on track, as memories of childhood visits surfaced, of you playing dress up, in historic outfits. The thoughts of what you'd fit nowadays intruding. The flattering effects of corsets, driving the excess up to give you a fuller bust, and down to give you a more curvaceous rump. The need for a maid to help you into them, the attention, the flattery that comes from having servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts switch to the university, and your studies. Your friends there, and the convenience of having them under one roof. The opportunities to party, the need for some rent, a token sum to save them some money and encourage them to come. The size of the place making you feel more alone, and the staff adding to your sense of isolation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you become side-tracked, as you think of the care the grounds will need, the cemetery at the far end should receive some care too.

A title that made her squirm, her stomach knotting awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartling herself by yawning, she put down the book, and sat back in the comfy chair.

The pitch was clearly feminine, and she suspected a demure maid was ready to inform her that dinner was served. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head to face the maid she was startled to see that her outfit look bizarrely out of place. As if it were oddly dated, the maid... Mary... swam into her mind, bobbed an awkward curtsy. It was her stiff leather corset that made it awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/55/33/06/55330618239cb094c06920c44b5f7d3a.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/55/33/06/55330...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look deferential, and respectful, even a touch scared of you. It didn't feel like she was making a joke, or mocking you. You recoil in shock from her, or rather you would if you weren't also constrained by the stiff bones of your own corset. But you do manage to rise out of the seat. Your half-reflection in the conservatory glass reveals your own clothes are higher quality, tailored to show your status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/564x/21/37/2b/21372b8a70244c0711170c9168449309--steampunk-mask-sexy-steampunk.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/564x/21/37/2b/21372...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven your hair, is more carefully coiffed, and higher maintenance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Talia.\" her voice tinged with concern, as she sees the confusion... the fear on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c1/77/16/c17716b56b00f246c8e56c0a2f987994--steampunk-wedding-victorian-steampunk.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c1/77/16/c1771...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force your hand away from your face. As the other traces it's way over the trim of the corset, the plush material of the skirt. It's too impossibly real, too detailed to be a dream. Feeling the world threatening to whirl out of control, your rapid breathing not helped by the constricting corset. You rest your hands against the cooling glass, and press your forehead too, for the relief it brings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your eyes closed, you bring your breathing under control. You block out the concerned questions, the inane chattering of the maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as you feel a degree of control return and you open your eyes ready to face the world again. You see a giant zeppelin in the sky. The gondola of the zeppelin, is releasing huge gouts of deep black smoke. The size is hard to judge with nothing you can recognise for scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DeSczOCWsAEVZLQ.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DeSczOCWsAEV...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it releases a pair of gliders to descend, you feel overawed.

Hearing the soft -<i>huff</i>- of the fabric impact, as if it were the more resounding clap of flesh on flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding herself turned on by the thought of her massive booty, and the way it would draw attention from all kinds of men. Such simple creatures, drawn to the ripple and jiggle, the movement of fine flesh working to hold their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the book on the table Talia imagined heaving her larger rump up from the chair, giving a groan of effort as she rose. Putting an extra swivel in her hips she walked back and forth. The sound of slowly beaten timpani drums in her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe imagined an audience incapable of looking away, as she went upstairs, the hips swaying as she went. Walking to her bedroom, the audience followed her silently, until she sat on the edge of her bed, facing the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoquettishly, sneaking a glance over her shoulder, she blew a kiss to her imaginary crowd. With a simple, teasing tug, she allowed the top of her dress to fall away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she turned to her fantasy company, as scandalised gasp on her face. Standing up, she allowed it to fall in a shimmering heap to circle her feet. With only a final wiggle to mark it's passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReseating herself, bare ass pressing directly to the warm, rumpled quilt beneath. Talia dreamt of her ass spreading, the girth expanding as she lowered herself.

A grandfather clock that she stumbled upon at one point showed that it was just after quarter past eight, meaning she had left her room almost half an hour ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God!\" Talia finally exclaimed, rounding a corner. She was met with yet another lengthy corridor that had at least four other corridors branches off of it. \"This place is an actual maze! I wonder if Godfrey could provide me with a map if I asked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering down each of the four corridors, Talia let out an irritated growl. She had left her room like forty five minutes ago now, expecting to find the dining hall within a matter of minutes. And now here she was, completely lost in her new mansion and beginning to feel hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw it! I'm going down this corridor and I'm just going to choose a random door! If it's not the dining hall, then I'm heading back to my room! Well, if I can actually find my room again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarching down her chosen corridor, Talia decided to check out the end before choosing a door. She hoped to find some sort of huge sign that showed her the dining room, however her hopes were in vain. The end of her corridor just led to another corridor that seemed to stretch on forever, darkness covering the end of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here...\"<br>\r\nWandering back down her current corridor, Talia had a choice between two doors, both unmarked. <br>\r\n\"Okay... Two choices, neither of which seem to be the room I set out to look for. Maybe there's somebody in one of these rooms that can help guide me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding on the door to her right, Talia slowly pushed the door open. Her chosen room was pitch black, which almost put her off from checking, but she decided to push in anyway. She tapped the wall next to the door, searching for a light switch. Finding one, she flipped the lights on and entered the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Talia nodded, looking around the room. \"That is... a lot of paintings...\"<br>\r\nThe walls of her chosen room were covered in paintings. Some were pressed frame to frame, while others had a little room between them. And it wasn't as though the room was small. It was similar in size, if not larger, than her new bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued by this room of paintings, Talia cautiously edged into the room. She felt somewhat uneasy, like the eyes of every single painting were all staring directly at her. It would have been fine if she had been wearing her own clothes, but considering she was wearing a fairly revealing dress, she felt even more uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe this wasn't such a good idea...</i> She thought, quietly walking over to one of the walls. <i>I should really leave...</i><br>\r\nDespite thinking this, her curiosity caused her to remain in the room. Talia edged up to one of the larger paintings, craning her neck to look up at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painting she had chosen to stare at depicted...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking up the wall, Talia's gaze landed on a picture of a blonde haired woman. While her hair was very light, almost platinum, and her eyes were startlingly blue, neither were what drew Talia's eye to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason Talia found herself so focused on this particular painting were the woman's incredible assets. Each one of her breasts easily rivalled Talia's head in size, while her backside looked like she had stuffed two basketballs down the back of her dress. Connected to her backside were a set of child-bearing hips, almost three times the size of Talia's boyish hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She... looks like a goddess!\" Talia finally said, her eyes still firmly locked on the woman. \"I kinda wish I had a body like that, instead of this feminine boy body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her own body, suddenly disappointed with it. Her hands hovered over her small breasts, which were barely B-Cups. They were so small that her dress was actually somewhat baggy in the chest area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands then ran over her narrow hips, which, much like her breasts, were almost non-existent. She had seen guys at her university that had been blessed with larger hips and rounder backsides than her, and while it had never particularly bothered her, it really was now. She felt unworthy to be even standing near this painting. Taking a step back, Talia spotted a small plaque attached to the frame that read 'Lady Amelia Davis, 1678 to 1732'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did my ancestors get such beautiful bodies, while I was stuck with... this?\" Talia sighed, turning her back on the painting. \"I should get outta here... Suddenly, I don't feel in the mood for dinner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards the door, Talia failed to notice the painting of Lady Amelia begin to shimmer. A transparent figure pushed her way through the frame, casting a tired look around the room before looking at Talia's retreating figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Like, that was such a totally awesome nap!\"</i> The ghost of Lady Amelia yawned. <i>\"Like, I think that cutie over there is the reason I woke up! Should I, like, introduce myself? No... I think I've got the most awesome idea ever for her!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, Lady Amelia floated past Talia, who paused for a moment, an uneasy look appearing on her face. <br>\r\n\"Brrr... That was a sudden chill,\" Talia said, running her arms. She looked back into the room, just as the door slammed shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! I'm in here!\"<br>\r\nTalia ran to the door and tried to open it. However, despite the lack of anything resembling a lock, the door had somehow locked itself. She fought with handle, oblivious to the now visible form of Lady Amelia behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Like, hi~\"</i><br>\r\nHearing a voice behind her, Talia paused. She hadn't seen anybody in here, so who would be talking? Turning around, her eyes widened as they fell on a perfectly round, and somewhat familiar, set of slightly see through breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" Talia began to say, but was quickly shushed by a spectral finger pushing against her mouth. <br>\r\n<i>\"Like, say nothing!\"</i> A high-pitched voice said. <i>\"Like, I heard you talking about my totally beautiful body and how, like, you wanted it! Well, today is a totally lucky day for both you and me!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia's eyes widened as a beautiful face floated into her vision. Again, it was familiar to her, yet she couldn't quite place it. <br>\r\n<i>Those eyes... That make-up... I've seen it before</i>, Talia thought as the ghostly female smiled at her. <i>But where..?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Talia didn't get a chance to think about it, as the ghostly woman leaned forwards and locked lips with her. Talia's mind went blank as a spectral tongue pushed through her closed mouth and began to phase through her own tongue, sending chills through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the chills, Talia found herself enjoying the ghostly kiss. She closed her eyes, opening her mouth and allowing her tongue to push into the ghost's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her tongue entered the ghost's mouth, the ghost pulled away, causing Talia to let out a disappointed whimper. <br>\r\n<i>\"Like, don't worry!\"</i> The ghost laughed in her beautiful voice. <i>\"Like, now I get to be a part of you forever!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, the fog enveloping Talia's mind receded. Upon seeing the ghost hovering inches from her face, she opened her mouth to let out a scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Lady Amelia smiled. She closed her eyes, allowing herself to drift headfirst towards Talia's open mouth. As she neared her goal, she felt herself being sucked into Talia's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling something enter her mouth, Talia's scream faded away. Her cheeks bulged as whatever had invaded her body began to slide down her throat, causing her throat to bulge as well. However, upon reaching her stomach, the mysterious object seemed to vanish altogether. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of Lady Amelia was vacuumed into her mouth and down into her stomach, Talia clamped her mouth shut. She stumbled as she began to feel light-headed, falling against the door behind her. She clutched the edges for support as her vision darkened, allowing Lady Amelia to begin altering Talia's body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with Talia's rather masculine face. Amelia smoothed out some of the more angular parts, leaving her face smooth and round. She then moved into Talia's thin lips, making them plumper and fatter. Platinum blonde streaks appeared throughout Talia's head of midnight black hair. Finally, she changed the colour and shape of her eyes, making them appear softer and giving them a hint of blue, making it appear as though Talia had greenish blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving downwards, Amelia began work on Talia's upper body. The first thing she did was eliminate the thin layer of pudge her host had built up from snacking on junk food, leaving Talia with a firm belly. She moved swiftly into her small chest, inflating each of Talia's breasts with fat. Her dress was pushed outwards as two melon sized breasts quickly formed on her chest. Before moving downwards, Amelia slimmed down her hands and lengthened her nails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching Talia's lower body, Amelia wasted no time in getting rid of Talia's thin hips. They began cracking outwards, causing a whimper to escape Talia's mouth. As they surpassed her narrow shoulders, they stopped growing, only for her backside to begin filling with fat. Each ass cheek grew to the size of a football, causing the back of her dress to flare outwards. The final change to Talia's body were her thighs, which slowly thickened for a few seconds before stopping, giving her lower body a full look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her host's body transformed, Amelia then began work on her mind. Talia had always been a rather serious person who always preferred her own company to that of others. Amelia reworked all of that, leaving Talia as a much more carefree and outgoing person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her power wane, Amelia let out a disappointed sigh. She had hoped for a bit more time so she could mold this cutie into her own image, but it seemed as though she was going to have to leave some stuff out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before she vanished from Talia's body and moved onto her next life, Amelia managed to drain some of Talia's knowledge. It wasn't much, just some boring stuff about something called a computer, but at least it was something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhaling her final breath, Lady Amelia vanished, and with her went Talia's feeling of light-headedness. She groaned, clutching her head as she straightened up. <br>\r\n\"Like, what the heck happened to me?\" She said, her voice slightly higher pitched. \"There was a ghost and then... Darkness? And why do I feel so heavy..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Talia's eyes went wide as she saw her new body. With shaking hands, she slowly prodded one of her breasts, moaning as pleasure raced through her body. Still in disbelief, she moved her hands downwards, running them over her fertile hips before cupping her new ass cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... My... God...\" She said slowly. \"I look so... so... sexy! I've got curves now! Man, if the guys from college could see me now! I bet they'd be drooling all over themselves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the thought of that, Talia giggled. Honestly, the thought of guys wanting her was such a turn-on. She should totally invite some over... Or she could invite everybody for a massive party! She had a huge house now! She could do anything! Well, as long as she had money...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Talia was yanked back to reality by her stomach, which let out a long gurgle. <br>\r\n\"Like, oh yeah! I totally need to find the dining hall!\" Talia giggled. \"How silly of me to forget! Now, let's here...\"</span></div></div>",

She had little to no ideas about how her boyish body had suddenly morphed into this fertile frame, but if it had something to do with this room or that weird apparition, then she didn't want to risk hanging about and potentially losing her new looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I want people to see the new me!\" Talia exclaimed happily, giving the handle a few tugs. \"Now, why won't this open? There's, like, no lock on it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more attempts at pulling the door open, she let out an irritated growl before turning her back on the door, pouting as she did. <br>\r\n\"Stupid door...\" She muttered, casting a cold look at the offending door behind her. \"I just want, like, something to eat! Is that too much to ask for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently it was, as the door didn't respond, promoting another pout from Talia, along with a kick that did more damage to her toe than it did to the sturdy wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nursing some of the pain from her big toe, Talia decided to give up on trying to use the door and decided to have another look around the room. It was a massive room, after all, and there might be another exit she hadn't spotted before. After all, she had walked in and straight up to a painting before trying to escape again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriding back into the centre of the room, Talia didn't seem to mind the stares of the paintings this time around. Rather, she enjoyed their invisible gazes, even going so far as to cross her arms under her bust in order to push them up, revealing her new cleavage to the empty room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, if only they were real people...\" She let out a dreamy sigh, imagining the stares from men and women alike her body would get her. \"Well, if I want people to, like, see me, I need to get out of this room first! Now, how would somebody get out of a room with no keyhole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a look around the room, Talia found that, aside from the paintings covering the wall, there was very little in terms of furniture. Only a dusty chair seemed to be present in the room, and she could tell from where she was that it didn't have the answer she was looking for. Leaving only one other place it could be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On a painting!\" She snapped her fingers. \"One of them has to help me out somehow! But, like, how? And which one would would it be?\"<br>\r\nMoving her gaze to the walls, Talia began scanning the various paintings on the walls. Every so often, she would stop to stare at one of them, usually the ones involving men, enamoured by their bodies. However, her stomach would soon bring her back to reality, causing her to resume her search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after a few minutes of searching, she spotted a faint shine hanging from one of the paintings. <br>\r\n\"A key?\" Talia wondered out loud, heading over to the painting. \"Wait... What does this key even unlock? Is there, like, something else in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the key anyway, Talia heard the door creak open behind her. Looking over her shoulder, she grinned as she saw the hallway through the open door. <br>\r\n\"Well, dunno how that works, but okay!\" She turned back to the painting. \"Thanks, uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering up at the painting, Talia saw that it depicted...</span></div></div>",

It had a light fuzz atop its head, along with curious eyes that seemed to draw Talia's attention. She stared into their eyes for a few seconds, enthralled by their cuteness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, such a cute baby!\" She cooed, smiling back at the baby. \"And who might you be?\"<br>\r\nTearing her eyes away from their face, Talia scanned the small plaque at the bottom. <br>\r\n\"Sir Benjamin Davis, 1680 to 1680... Aw, he wasn't even a year old when he died? That's super sad! Like, he never got to live his life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia looked back up at Benjamin's face. <br>\r\n\"I kinda wish he did get to live... But, like, it's too late for that now! Sad as it is, I need to find food or I'll end up just like him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling at her dark joke, Talia turned to leave. As soon as her back was turned to the picture, it took on an eerie glow, not dissimilar to the shimmering Lady Amelia's portrait took on before she appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spectral baby floated out of the portrait, looking around the semi-dark room with a confused look on his face. His bottom lip quivered as tears welled up in his eyes. Before he started crying, he spotted the retreating figure of Talia, causing him to babble happily and begin to float towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a incomprehensible babbling, Talia paused. <br>\r\n\"That... sounded way too close. Maybe mum and dad were telling the truth about this place?\" A smile spread across her face. \"Yeah, right! Like ghosts exist! Now, onto dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resumed her trip towards the door. However, her brief stop had allowed the spectral form of Sir Benjamin to catch up, meaning he was now floating along behind her. A playful smile formed on his face as he stuck his hands into Talia's body, causing her to jump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, cold! Super cold!\"<br>\r\nRubbing her shoulders, Talia spun around. At the bottom of her vision, there was a small shimmer, however she put it down to a trick of the light and disregarded it. <br>\r\n\"What was that?\" She wondered, inspecting the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow crawling on the floor, Benjamin stared up at Talia with wide eyes. She didn't seem to be paying him any attention, which caused a whimper to escape his lips. After a few seconds had passed, it became apparent that she wasn't going to look his way, so he decided to try something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling forward, he phased through the hem of Talia's dress, leaving him staring up at her black boxers. He babbled quietly to himself before curling up into a ball and floating upwards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a chill enter her lower body, Talia let out a yelp. Her hands clapped over the chill, which only seemed to last for a few seconds before disappearing. However, it was quickly replaced with nausea, which caused Talia to clutch her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I don't feel... so good...\" She groaned, doing her best to suppress the urge to vomit. She had no idea what the cleaning schedule for this place was, and she really didn't want this room to stink of vomit if cleaning wasn't a daily thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her hands being firmly clasped over her belly, Talia didn't notice it round out slightly, causing the front of her dress to curve outwards. Nor did she feel something begin to form within her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her changes came to an end, so too did the nausea. As it faded away, Talia looked around the room. <br>\r\n\"Like, that was odd...\" She muttered, rubbing her belly. \"Maybe I'm just super hungry? Yeah, that's probably it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a final look around the room, Talia left it, making sure to flip the lights off behind her and close the door tightly. Looking down the dark corridors, she nodded to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dining hall, here I come!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Feeling renewed after her small break in the portrait room, Talia made her way down the long corridors of her mansion. She hummed happily to herself, a massive smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here...\"<br>\r\nStopping at a junction, Talia peered down the two hallways. One ended with at a corner that led off to the right, while the other disappeared off into the darkness. <br>\r\n\"Darkness it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Talia skipped down the dark corridor, still humming a cheerful tune. She passed door after door after door, stopping occasionally to peek into one of the doors on the off hand that the dining room wasn't actually marked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another bedroom...\" She muttered after peeking into the umpteenth bedroom. \"Like, that's great and all, but I've already got the best bedroom in the house...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a weary sigh, Talia moved on. The energy that she had started out with was rapidly fading, and unless she stumbled upon the dining room, it was likely it would run out altogether, leading her to quickly giving up on dinner completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last corridor... Come on, I'm super hungry!\"<br>\r\nRounding a corner, Talia's eyes instantly fell upon a set of massive double doors, easily larger and more opulent than the other doors she had passed. And emanating from it was the scent of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food!\" Talia let out a cheer, pumping her fist into the air. \"Finally! I can see just what kinda food you can get here!\"<br>\r\nJogging towards the doors, Talia practically shoved her way into the dining hall before quickly grinding to a halt as she got a look at where she would be eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gargantuan table sat in the centre of the hall. More chairs than she could count surrounded it, but if she had to guess, the table could probably seat over fifty people. She didn't even know that many people! And much like the rest of the mansion, pictures decorated the beautiful walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards a set of doors on the other side of the hall, Talia took a look at some of the paintings. After a few, she noticed that every single one she had looked at depicted a hefty person. Be it a massive gut, a set of flabby breasts or a doughy backside, the people in the paintings had at least one of these. Even some of the men had large chests that would've made some girls Talia knew jealous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome... You must be Lady Talia...\"<br>\r\nLetting out a yelp as a quiet voice sounded out, Talia jumped back. She stared at the small woman standing in front of her with wide eyes, one hand clutching one of her breasts. <br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah... That's me...\" Talia responded, taking a deep breath to calm herself. \"And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid bowed, her ginger ponytail falling forwards. <br>\r\n\"I am Serena, the one in charge of the dining hall... It's a pleasure to meet you... I hope you didn't have too much trouble finding us?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Talia decided to keep her adventures to herself. \"No, I was, like, just... having a look around. Yeah, that's totally it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena nodded. <br>\r\n\"I see... Are you ready to eat?\"<br>\r\nTalia nodded enthusiastically. <br>\r\n\"Very well... Please, be seated. Your first course will be out posthaste...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat at the head of the table, Talia watched as Serena disappeared into the doors behind her, only to reappear with a covered silver platter. <br>\r\n\"Here you are, my Lady...\"<br>\r\nSerena uncovered the platter, revealing one of Talia's all-time favourite foods; cheesy garlic bread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before Serena had left the room, Talia had devoured the entire platter. Rubbing her rounded belly, she let out a quiet burp. <br>\r\n\"Was that to your satisfaction?\" Serena asked, returning to her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\" Talia enthused. \"Can't wait for the other courses!\"<br>\r\nBowing, Serena retreated into the kitchen, leaving Talia alone in the dining hall...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leaning back in her chair and staring up at the ceiling high above her, Talia let out an audible sigh of boredom. This was a part of dinner she always despised; waiting for the second course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds had passed, she let out another sigh. <br>\r\n\"Food's good but the waiting?\" She shook her head. \"I'll pass. Let's see who frequented the dining room, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her chair back, Talia jumped to her feet, her breasts bouncing lightly as she did. Crossing her arms behind her back, she hummed to herself as she wandered over to one of the walls. Unlike the portrait room, whose walls had been made of paintings, the ones in here were more spread out, and seemed to focus on a particular type of person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" Talia whistled as she looked up at a painting. \"Like, I had some heavy ancestors! I just hope it doesn't run in the family! Although, if that woman in the other room was that thin, maybe it doesn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving up the wall, Talia paused at every portrait to take a closer look at their inhabitants. She passed by men with large beer bellies that strained their dress shirts, women with heavy busts and fat asses... There was even a painting of what appeared to be an obese toddler who smiled down at Talia as she passed their portrait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, the way their eyes follow you, you'd think you were in Hogwarts with all their magical portraits...\" Talia muttered, pausing in front of a picture that depicted a Lady Eleanor, who seemed to be quite bottom heavy. \"But that would be stupid, right? I'm not in a Scooby Doo mansion with people hiding behind the paintings, watching everything I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Talia continued on her journey around the outskirts of the hall. She was amazed at just how many ancestors she actually had. And this was only the dining hall! She hadn't even seen like ninety five percent of the mansion yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what other kinds of rooms this place has?\" Talia wondered, inspecting the painting of Sir Arthur, who was almost bursting out of his shirt. \"Like, are they all old timey rooms, or are there some newer ones? Oh, I wonder if there's a library?! I could get, like, a ton of work done in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Talia continued to wonder about potential rooms, the door to the kitchens swung open. Serena walked in, a large platter held aloft.<br>\r\n\"Your main course, Lady Talia...\"<br>\r\nAt the opposite end of the hall, Talia just about heard Serena's whisper. If not for the echo of the massive hall, she wouldn't have heard her at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serena!\"<br>\r\nTalia happily skipped across the hall and fell into her seat. <br>\r\n\"What's the main course?\"<br>\r\nSerena gently placed the massive platter down in front of her, revealing yet another of her favourite dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A meat feast pizza and onion rings! Gotta say, that's something I didn't expect to see in this place!\" Talia exclaimed, picking a piece of pepperoni off the pizza and dropping it into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your grandparents left us with a note regarding your favourite meals... And our cooks are very talented... If there's anything you wish to try, please do not hesitate to let us know... \" Serena said, bowing low. She headed back into the kitchen, leaving Talia alone with her food...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lifting a slice of pizza, Talia let out a moan of happiness before taking a bite. She absolutely adored pizza, meat feast most of all. The way the tastes of all the different meats and the dough melded together in her mouth... There was no taste better in her opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, another moan escaped her lips. With her other hand, she grabbed an onion ring and took a bite. She nodded, impressed with the quality of both the pizza and the onion rings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These... These were obviously home-made!\" She exclaimed, finishing off her first slice. \"Like, there is absolutely no way a restaurant could produce something like this! If all the food here is this good, I might end up losing this awesome figure of mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing another slice, Talia leaned back and slowly started chewing through it, completely oblivious to her surroundings. Behind her, one of the paintings Talia hadn't had time to look at took on a faint shimmer. The woman depicted in it had a large, doughy gut, a pair of flabby breasts and a set of thick hips and round ass cheeks, all of which was stuffed into a dress that looked to be two sizes too small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, well... Somebody new inherits the mansion... And by the look of things, she's already well-acquainted with a few of its former inhabitants! Let's just see if she has room for a third...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the frame floated out a ghost that resembled the inhabitant. She placed a meaty hand on her hip, casting a sad look around the empty hall. <br>\r\n\"<i>Ah, I remember when this place was full of life and food... I suppose times do change. Now, let me have a look at you...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating over to Talia, the ghost watched with amusement as Talia rolled a slice of pizza up and practically inhaled it. As she swallowed, both Talia and the ghost let out a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...\" Talia muttered, leaning back in her chair and closing her eyes. <br>\r\n<i>\"She's perfect...\"</i> The ghost muttered, casting a longing gaze down at the resting form of Talia. \"<i>You can't possibly be full just yet... Let me help you...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilling herself invisible, the ghost floated next to Talia. With a gentle hand, she caressed Talia's cheek, causing the teen to let out a happy purr. She leaned into the ghosts hand, obviously seeking more attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aren't you a cute one?</i> The ghost thought, using her other hand to stroke Talia's other cheek. <i>This'll take a good bit of my power, but I think it'll be worth it. And I'll have plenty of time to build it back up between meals...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, the ghost concentrated on making herself corporeal. It was something she had only ever done once, and it had caused enough of a panic that the dining hall was actually locked up for a good number of years. But given that Talia appeared only semi-conscious, the chances of her being spotted were quite low. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her hand became visible, the ghost grinned. Grabbing a slice of pizza, she held it in front of Talia's face. Her nose twitched as she picked up the scent. A second later, Talia leaned forwards, taking a large bite of the meaty pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few bites later, the slice had disappeared into Talia's body. <br>\r\n\"Thanks... Serena...\" She muttered, a smile appearing on her face. <br>\r\nThe ghost frowned. <br>\r\n<i>Serena? I have no idea who that is... But no matter. I am not yet done with you...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating and making her other hand corporeal, the ghost lifted another slice of pizza while using her new hand to rub Talia's belly. <br>\r\n<i>Oh, you're expecting?</i> She realised, a smile appearing on her face. <i>Then you're eating for two! Open wide!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDangling another slice in front of Talia's face, the ghost chuckled as she snatched the slice from her grasp, chewing slowly. As she swallowed, a quiet burp escaped her lips, followed by a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing an onion ring, the ghost decided to try something new. She gently opened Talia's mouth and placed the onion ring inside. Talia chewed happily, quickly finishing and opening her mouth for another. The ghost obliged, dropping another ring inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Talia swallowed, the ghost leaned back. Inspecting Talia's body, she was somewhat disappointed to see that her feeding hadn't done much for her. <br>\r\n<i>Hmm... Perhaps I should really ramp things up?</i> She thought, stroking her double chin in thought...</span></div></div>",

Perhaps that's why my portrait was placed here... No matter. Allow me to assist both you and your child!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her hand from Talia's slight curve of a belly, the ghost closed her eyes. She rubbed her own gut, tapping it lightly. Underneath her ghostly dress, her transparent belly rippled and began to glow. Opening her eyes, the ghost smiled, firstly at her own glowing belly, which cast a faint light over Talia, before smiling at her target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Please, accept some of my essence... Allow it to help you become healthy!</i><br>\r\nRemoving her hand from her belly, the ghost replaced it on Talia's. For a few seconds, Talia took on a ghostly blue glow, casting light over her surroundings. As the light faded away, the ghost floated back slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That should help you greatly!</i> The ghost clapped happily. <i>Now, allow me to feed you once again...</i><br>\r\nReturning to Talia's side, the ghost took a look at what was remaining. About half of her mysterious bread circle with various meats remained, along with a few of the crispy brown rings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I must say, this food does look delicious</i>, th ghost admitted, picking up a slice. <i>But I much prefer a good roasted turkey. Perhaps I could convince her to try some of the glorious food I feasted upon during my first pregnancy...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding Talia's mouth open slightly, the ghost slowly lowered the slice into her mouth. Talia chewed slowly for a moment, before greedily snatching the slice from her hand. Her own hands made their way up to her face, helping to push the slice into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she swallowed, the ghost watched expectantly. Watching Talia's belly, a gleeful smile appeared on her round face as she saw Talia's belly bulged outwards ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<i>Good, good... But it appears you still have room. Allow me to fill that room!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a slice in each hand, the ghost picked up the pace. She practically shoved an entire bit into Talia's mouth, causing the teen to cough for a few moments before beginning to chew. Before she had even swallowed, the ghost forced the second slice into her mouth, causing her cheeks to bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with an overfilled mouth, the half-conscious Talia still chewed. It took her a minute or so, but she finally swallowed the two slices. By now, her belly was visibly bigger. It still had a distinct curve to it, and from her perspective, was hidden by her breasts, but it was bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, the ghost grinned. <br>\r\n<i>A good start... But we aren't done just yet! Just one more piece, and these three rings! And maybe a little dessert?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnatching up what was left, the ghost shoved two onion rings into Talia's mouth. These were swallowed near instantly, and quickly washed down with the final slice of pizza. The last ring entered Talia's mouth and, unlike the previous two, was chewed slowly, Talia clearly intent on savouring the taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she swallowed the last of her main course, she let out a long burp. Her belly was considerably bigger, making her appear in the mid-stages of pregnancy rather than the beginnings. Her breasts and backside had a very slight later of purge covering them, enough to be noticeable if Talia payed enough attention to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the meal gone, the ghost nodded wearily. She had expended a good bit of her power and, unlike the other ghosts that inhabited the house, she had no intention of disappearing just yet. Floating back to her frame, she flashed Talia a brief smile before vanishing into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ghost vanished, Talia began to stir. She looked around the empty hall before focusing on her empty plate. <br>\r\n\"I don't... <b>Urrp</b>... even remember eating all of this,\" she said, shaking herself awake. \"I must be really tired... I should really head back to my room and get a good night's sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the door behind her creak open, Talia turned her head slightly. <br>\r\n\"Was that to your liking, Lady Talia?\" Serena asked as she approached her. <br>\r\n\"Very much so, Serena... Thank the chefs for me, would you?\" Talia asked, rubbing her rounder belly, which was beginning to poke out from under her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena nodded as she gathered up the empty plates. <br>\r\n\"Would you like some dessert, ma'am?\"<br>\r\nLeaning back slightly, Talia tapped her chin in thought...</span></div></div>",

If dessert is anything like the rest, then I can't wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena bowed as Talia struggled to her feet. One hand was affixed to her curved belly, while the other hid a yawn. <br>\r\n\"A question before I leave, Serena?\" Talia inquired. <br>\r\n\"Yes, my Lady?\"<br>\r\n\"Like, how exactly do I get back to my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Serena had run through the directions for getting back to her room, Talia headed for the double doors at the opposite end of the hall. She continued to happily caress her belly, oblivious to its increased size. As she reached the door, she cast a look back. At the other end of the hall, Serena bowed before disappearing into the kitchens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That was odd...</i> Talia thought as she pushed the doors open. <i>For a moment, one of the pictures looked as though it was glowing... It was probably a trick of the light. I am super tired after all!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the dining hall, Talia took a right. As it turned out, the master bedroom wasn't too far from the dining hall. She had just taken every single wrong turn earlier, which had led her on her massive hunt around the mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I should still inquire about a map,\" Talia said to herself as she took a left. \"While I do have the time to explore, I don't really want to. I just want to know what kinda rooms this place has!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia fell silent as she continued towards her room. With her tired state, she didn't pay much attention to how she moved now. Her wide hips swayed erotically as she walked, while her breasts wobbled and rippled, occasionally threatening to bounce out of her dress altogether. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Talia, she managed to remain decent as she reached her room. Throwing the door open, she let out a long sigh of happiness as she lay eyes on her massive bed, which seemed to beckoning her over with its plump pillows and cloud-like mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempted as she was to just collapse into the bed in her dinner dress, Talia forced herself to change. Grabbing her bags, which had been moved to her room at some point, she pulled out her nightwear, which was just a plain white t-shirt with a set of black shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing her dress over the back of a chair, Talia struggled to pull her top over her increased bust. She let out a grunt as her breasts bounced slightly from her efforts. After a brief struggle, she managed to tug her top over them. Due to their increased size and her new belly, her top only managed to come half way down her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must've shrunk...\" She mumbled, grabbing her shorts. \"I'm sure there's something in here that I can use as a replacement...\"<br>\r\nPulling her shorts up her legs, Talia has a similar problem with her enhanced backside. Her ample ass cheeks jiggled as she fought to pull her shorts up over them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she did, however her shorts left the bottom part of her ass cheeks on view. Not really bothered by this, Talia headed over to her bed and fell into it, letting out a comfortable groan as she did. <br>\r\n\"Like, dear Lord...\" She muttered, closing her eyes. \"This is so incredibly comfy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia quickly fell asleep. Her night was dreamless and peaceful, and when she awoke the next morning, she felt full of energy. <br>\r\n\"Like, good morning!\" She exclaimed happily , stretching her arms above her head. \"What should I do today?\"</span></div></div>",

Stretching again, she found her eyes drifting to the slightly ajar door of her own ensuite bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it's totally great that I get my own bathroom!\" Talia said happily, skipping towards the door. \"No more sharing with stinky boys and fussy girls! A whole room to myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing open the door, Talia flipped the light on. Her eyes lit up as she inspected her new bathroom, which looked to be thrice the size of the closet she had in her dorm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive triangular bath occupied the corner in front of her. In the far corner of it was a seat, with jets slotted into the other two corners. Talia let out a longing sigh as she imagined herself collapsing into the bath after a long days work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from the bath, the bathroom had one of those massive counters that took up an entire wall. Two sinks were set into it and a mirror that was the same size as the counter was affixed to the wall. And, as all bathrooms had, there was a toilet opposite the sinks, which bothered Talia. It meant that she had to sit and stare at herself while she was using the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the positives of the bathroom outweighed that one negative. Deciding to try out her new bath, Talia rushed back into her bedroom and flipped open her suitcase. Chucking various clothes aside, she grabbed her shampoo, body wash and bathing suit and headed back into the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocking the door behind her, she turned on the hot tap and allowed it to run for a few minutes. Once the water was burning the skin from her hand, she kicked the plug in, turned the cold water tap a little and waited for it to fill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the water steadily rose and steam filled the room, Talia went about undressing herself. Grabbing the hem of her t-shirt, she effortlessly pulled it over her head, causing her breasts to bob in the process. Sliding her shorts down her legs, Talia reached for her bathing suit, making sure to not look at the mirror as she did so. It wasn't like she hated her reflection, she just didn't like seeing herself, or anybody else, naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her black bikini, which had a pink rose drawn over the left cup, Talia struggled to fit it around her bountiful chest. Even on its largest setting, flesh still overfilled the cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Talia decided to leave them be and moved into her bottoms, which had a matching pink rose printed on the right side. Unlike her top, her bottoms slid easily up her legs. Like her top, however, the bottoms revealed a fair amount of her ample ass cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow clothed, Talia spun around to face the mirror. She smiled as one hand cupped a heavy breast and a finger on the other traced a circle on one of her ass cheeks. <br>\r\n\"Like, I've only been here a day, but this place is doing wonders for me!\" Talia exclaimed happily. \"Although, I suppose I did eat a bit much at dinner last night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her curved belly, a look of disdain on her face. As she removed her hands,the faintest of kicks rose to meet the area where her hand had been. Oblivious to this, Talia headed over to the bath. Grabbing the edge, she let out a sigh as she slowly lowered herself into the warm waters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanting her backside in the seat, Talia turned the jets on. She moaned as she felt water blow into her legs...<br>\r\n\"Like, this is totally divine!\" She said happily, leaning back in her seat. \"I wish I could stay here forever... But I've got things to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of enjoying the warm waters, Talia quickly washed herself. Jumping out of the waters, she dried herself off and, still in her bathing suit, wandered back into her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was so awesome!\" She squealed. \"What should I wear today?! Like, this is so exciting!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking between her suitcase, which had clothes strewn around it from her earlier search, and the gargantuan wardrobe that covered an entire wall, Talia felt compelled to search the wardrobe. Sure, she could wear her own clothes, but she had worn them already. And after wearing that beautiful dress last night, she was curious about what other outfits lived in her new wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, let's have a looksie!\"<br>\r\nHumming, Talia headed for the door closest to her, which was slightly ajar. Pulling it open, a cloud of dust assaulted her, causing her to let out a wail and flail around wildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dust had dispersed, and Talia had brushed herself off, she looked inside the wardrobe and immediately made a face. <br>\r\n\"Eww... Like, not even Grandma would wear these!\" Talia exclaimed, using her forefinger and thumb to pick the sleeve of a dress that looked as though it was from the Dark Ages. \"Next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door on the ancient dresses, Talia moved to the next wardrobe. This one did not attack her with dust, thankfully, however it was filled with equally garish dresses. Making another face at them, she swiftly moved into the next wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, which let out a long creak, Talia was relieved to see that it was not filled with dresses from millennia ago. Rather, it was filled with outfits that resembled the ones worn by the people in the paintings. Grabbing the neck of one, Talia's brow furrowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, this one looks kinda familiar...\" She mumbled, pulling it out of the wardrobe. \"Oh, I know! That totally pretty lady in the painting room was wearing it! And it looked super cute on her... Would it look like that on me, I wonder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging the dress on the door, Talia continued to root through the wall of wardrobes. She was about half-way down when the dress style switched again, this time looking like the types of outfits worn throughout the 1900s. She recognized dresses from the 40s and 50s, as well a few military uniforms scattered throughout the wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes was drawn to a dress that appeared to be from the 1950s. It was a dress Talia wouldn't have dared wear with her old body, however with her more confident mindset and curvier body, she was seriously considering it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling it out of the wardrobe, she ran her eyes over it. It was beautiful dress with a black top half and a silken tartan skirt that hung down to her knees. However, as she brushed her hands over it, she noted that the midsection seemed to be somewhat baggy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Perhaps a maternity dress?</i> Talia thought. <i>Well, I'm not pregnant... But with this belly, somebody might mistake me as pregnant... Screw it! It's a beautiful dress! I'm sure I can pull it off!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging the dress next to the other one she had picked out, Talia dug through the remaining closets. It wasn't until the last couple that the clothing style finally caught up with the times. She spotted a number of outfits she remembered her grandparents wearing, along with a few that looked really out of character for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would Nanny or Grandad have this?\" Talia wondered, pulling out a fashionable gray yoga top and black yoga pants. Giving the material a quick tug, she found that it was quite flexible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll take it!\" Talia exclaimed happily, chucking it with the rest of her clothes. \"And, like, that makes three! So, what should I go with today?\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking between the three outfits, Talia found herself unable to decide. After a few minutes of staring at each piece of clothing, she decided to roll with the black and tartan maternity dress, despite her belief that she wasn't pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I do love a bit of black in my outfits, and that skirt feels sublime~\" Talia said cheerfully, grabbing the other two and putting them back in their respective wardrobes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to her chosen outfit, Talia quickly undressed. She decided to remain with her own underwear, and grabbed a set of clean black boxers from the floor. However, she decided to forgo a bra, considering that her enhanced chest had outgrown all of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the dress, she rotated it in her hands, trying to decide how to put it on. Trying to pull it down over her head would end with her breasts probably getting stuck, while trying to slip it up her legs would result in a similar outcome with her wide hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments deliberation, she attempted to slide it up her legs. It went well, right up until her backside got wedged in the top half of the dress. Making a face, Talia carefully pulled it back down her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How hard is it to put a damn dress on?!</i> Talia thought as she pulled it over her head. <i>I suppose it doesn't help that all my dresses have zips and this thing doesn't. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her arms up, Talia allowed the dress to slowly fall down her body. After her breasts had gotten stuck, she gently worked it downwards. After a few minutes, the dress was securely fitted around her body, inciting a few happy claps from Talia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, finally!\" She said, smoothing out a few creases in the skirt. \"I thought I was going to have to put this totally cute outfit away! Now, how cute do I look? I bet I look super cute~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing the room to stand in front of her mirror, Talia let out a squeal as she saw her reflection. The dress suited her perfectly! Her breasts filled the top part of the dress, which allowed just the right amount of cleavage to be seen. Sadly, her hips were hidden by the long skirt, however her backside made itself known by pushing the back of the skirt outwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Talia's eye ran down her reflection, she found that one part of the dress didn't look quite right on her frame. Her guess that it was a maternity dress had been correct, as the midriff of the dress was much looser than she had originally anticipated. Pulling it outwards, it looked as though she could fit a basketball in there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well... It still looks awesome!</i> Talia thought, giving a quick spin which caused the skirt to expand around her. <i>Plus, it's only the servants here! They don't seem to be too judgemental... Then again, I've only actually met two of them so far...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of taking in her reflection, Talia decided to get moving. The clock on her wall told her it was just after ten, meaning she had been up for just about an hour now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, a whole day of exploring!\" She exclaimed happily. \"But first, I wonder if this dress has any matching shoes?\"<br>\r\nRushing back to the wardrobe where she originally found her dress, Talia stared down at the floor. She had to search for a few minutes, but she eventually found a pair of shiny black heels that looked as though they went with her outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling them on, Talia tapped the heels of her new shoes against the ground. They fit her feet perfectly, which was a relief. They were also quite comfortable, cushioning her heels as she walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Talia said, pleased with her outfit. \"Now, what should I do today? Like, I've got a whole mansion to explore!\"</span></div></div>",

Like, I wouldn't dream of skipping the most important meal of the day!\" She chuckled, rubbing her belly through her silken dress. \"Lets just hope I remember the way to the dining hall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading out into the corridor, Talia started towards the dining hall. As she walked through the long corridors, she passed by numerous servants, all of which stopped and bowed as she passed by. At first, she felt somewhat unnerved by them, however after a rather cute guy in a butler's coat had stopped to bow to her, those nerves seemed to dissipate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hi!\" Talia said, bowing back to the man. \"You can totally straighten up, you know!\"<br>\r\nThe servant straightened up, giving Talia a good look at his face. He had a rather feminine face, with round brown eyes that seemed rather nervous. Atop his head was a neat crop of blond hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you require something of me, my Lady?\" He asked. <br>\r\nTalia giggled, a finger moving to her hair. She twirled a strand around her finger. <br>\r\n\"Like, a name would be nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Lind, my Lady. A pleasure to meet you\".<br>\r\nLind bowed again. <br>\r\n\"Lind, huh... You can just call me Talia!\" Talia said, giving Lind a quick bow of her own. \"Where do you work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleaning, Talia. I am responsible for the bedrooms in this section of the manner,\" Lind explained, gesturing to the fresh sheets draped over his arm.<br>\r\n\"So, like, my room?\" Talia asked. <br>\r\nLind nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, you know, it gets awful lonely in there at night...\" Talia said quietly, moving closer to Lind. \"Perhaps you'd like to keep me company at some point?\"<br>\r\nLind blushed and cleared his throat. <br>\r\n\"I-If that is your wish!\" He said nervously, straightening up. \"Please excuse me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLind hurried off. As he went, Talia giggled and blew a kiss at his retreating figure. <br>\r\n\"Lind... Who knew such a handsome man worked for me? I do hope he takes me up on my offer... I wouldn't mind getting to know him better!\"<br>\r\nHumming a lively tune to herself, Talia continued towards the dining hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back~\"<br>\r\nPushing the dual doors open, Talia announced her presence happily. At the other end of the hall, the doors to the kitchen swung open, revealing Serena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, my Lady...\" Serena said, bowing. \"How may the dining hall serve you today?\"<br>\r\nDrawing close to Serena, Talia giggled. <br>\r\n\"Like, breakfast!\" She said. \"What's on the menu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is up to you, my Lady... Breakfast and lunch are left to your discretion, while dinner is a set meal,\" Serena explained. \"Of course, if you have any requests for dinner, the cooks would be happy to serve them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so I get to choose what's for breakfast? Great!\"<br>\r\nFalling into her seat, Talia looked around. Before she had entered the dining hall, she hadn't been that hungry. However, as soon as she had collapsed into her seat, she felt as though she hadn't eaten in ages! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Serena, Talia decided...</span></div></div>",

And how big would you like it?\"<br>\r\n\"As big as possible, of course! I feel starved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowing, Serena retreated into the kitchen, leaving Talia alone. As the doors slammed shut, Talia jumped to her feet. <br>\r\n\"Lets pick up where I left off!\" She said happily. She skipped to the other end of the hall, her breasts bouncing and skirt swaying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping in front of a portrait, Talia resumed her inspection. With her back turned to the vast majority of the hall, a portrait began to shimmer. The ghost from yesterday fell out of her portrait, letting out a yawn as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Good morning</i>!\" She announced silently. \"<i>Ah, looks who's back! I knew she wouldn't be able to resist the glorious food served here! I know I certainly couldn't!</i>\"<br>\r\nThe ghost let out a chuckle, patting her sizable belly as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Talia begin to turn, the ghost floated back into her portrait. She was now inspecting the wall her painting was on, meaning that she would have to behave herself, lest she get discovered. She didn't want the dining hall shut down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir David... Sir Richard... Lady Rosemary... Lady Molly...\"<br>\r\nPassing the portraits, Talia read their names out loud. As she reached a painting in the centre, she stopped. There was something different about this one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, odd...\" Talia mumbled, looking up at it. \"You seem more alive than the others...\"<br>\r\nHidden inside her portrait, the ghost looked around nervously. A few former owners of the mansion had been able to sense the former inhabitants hiding within the walls. Surely this girl wasn't one of them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Alexandria Davis...\" Talia read out. \"1756 to 1823... Like, Alexandria is my middle name! I like this portrait!\"<br>\r\nSeeing Talia move into the next portrait, Alexandria let out a relieved sigh. For a moment, she thought she was going to be called out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Talia?\"<br>\r\nHearing her name called, Talia spun around. Standing next to her seat was Serena, a massive platter clutched in her hands. <br>\r\n\"Food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSprinting over, Talia practically jumped into her seat, which skidded back a few centimetres. Pulling herself back towards the table, she watched eagerly as Serena set the platter in front of her and pulled back the lid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cloud of steam rose to meet Talia's eager face. Swatting it away, her eyes widened as she took in her massive breakfast. Three fried eggs, a pigs worth of sausages, what appeared to be a loaf of toast and a pile of crispy bacon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Serena!\" Talia said, grabbing her knife and form.<br>\r\n\"Please enjoy, ma'am...\" Serena said, heading back into the kitchen and leaving Talia alone with her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpearing a couple of sausages, Talia greedily tore the ends off of them. Chewing madly, she grabbed a slice of toast in her free hand and stuffed it into her mouth. Washing it down with a mouthful of black coffee, Talia leaned back and let out a happy sigh. <br>\r\n\"Totally. Delicious~\" She exclaimed, heading back for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, Alexandria watched with glee. <br>\r\n<i>It seems you're a little more gluttonous now!</i> She noted. <i>Not to mention my 'assistance' is still active... Ah, if only I could help again! Alas, you're much too lively this morning. Perhaps you'll be a little more willing tonight...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuffing another slice of toast into her mouth, Talia began on her eggs. Slicing the yolk open, she dipped a sausage into the thick yellow liquid. <br>\r\n\"God, so good...\" She moaned, dropping the sausage into her mouth. She chewed slowly, relishing the taste of the sausage and yolk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she swallowed, her belly pushed outwards. It was still hidden by her maternity dress, however it was beginning to brush against the inside of the silky fabric. The rest of her body slowly fattened with each item she swallowed, giving Alexandria no end of joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the last bit of toast, Talia let out a burp before slowly eating it. She had never eaten so much in her life, and she felt absolutely stuffed. As she swallowed, she let out a long breath. Behind her, Alexandria nodded, impressed with her performance. <br>\r\n<i>Perhaps I'll see you later...</i> She thought, disappearing back into her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Talia relaxed in her chair, she paid no mind to her body, which could be described as 'pleasantly plump'. Her face was a little softer and a second chin was beginning to form. Her breasts were rounder, now snug within her dress. Her belly had a thick layer of chub covering it, and while it was still hidden by her dress, it was beginning to fill out the formerly empty midsection. Lower down, flesh bulged over the waistband of her boxers and her ass cheeks were beginning to poke out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick breather, Talia pushed herself to her feet with a groan. <br>\r\n\"Like, that totally hit the spot!\" She exclaimed, rubbing her belly. \"Although I better watch what I eat... Don't want to end up like the people in these paintings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling at her own joke, Talia started for the doors. Halfway down the hall, she heard the kitchen door swing open. <br>\r\n\"Was that to your satisfaction, my Lady?\" Came the quiet voice of Serena. <br>\r\n\"You bet it was!\" Talia replied, spinning around to face the ginger-haired maid. \"Um, what do I do if I can't find this place for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish to have lunch in a different room, or you're unable to find us, please ask any servant... They'd be happy to relay your order and location to us...\" She explained, gathering up the empty plate and mug. <br>\r\nNodding, Talia cast a smile at Serena before dancing out of the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I'm fed, where should I head off to?\" Talia wondered. She had a whole mansion to explore, as well as the presumably massive grounds...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding to check out the outside of the mansion, Talia started for a nearby door that looked as though it led outside, or at least to some sort of balcony. Partway there however, she stopped when a flash of lightning illuminated the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, darn it!\" Talia pouted, moving to the nearest window. \"Like, I really wanted to take a look outside! Stupid weather...\"<br>\r\nTalia watched rain slowly run down the outside of the window, a look of comfort appearing on her face. She always did appreciate the sounds of rain on a window...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"<br>\r\nSnapping her fingers as she thought of something, Talia looked around for a servant. Finding nobody, she sprinted back into the dining hall. Strangely, as soon as she entered, she suddenly felt hungry again, but ignored it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serena?\"<br>\r\nThe kitchen door creaked open. <br>\r\n\"Back so soon, ma'am?\" Serena asked. <br>\r\n\"No... I was just wondering, is there some sort of outdoor porch or conservatory somewhere in the mansion? Like, I really like the sounds of rain on the glass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course... We have three separate conservatories, as well as two covered balconies up on the second floor... Would you like directions?\"<br>\r\n\"Like, a second floor? I can barely navigate the first...\" Talia mumbled to herself. \"Um... I'd like to check out one of the balconies\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, head back to the main hall...\" Serena started to explain, however Talia quickly stopped her. <br>\r\n\"Like, how do I get back to the main hall?\" She asked, a sheepish smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Serena had explained how Talia would get to the main hall and then onto the balcony directly above the dining hall, Talia started her journey, a smile on her face. She made it to the main hall without any major issues, however she did take a wrong turn at some point and ended up at a dead end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this place is humongous!\" Talia exclaimed, leaning against a wall. She wasn't the most athletic person, but even the relatively short walk from the dining hall to here had really taken it out of her. After a quick breather, she headed up the stairs leading to the second floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like the first floor, the second floor appeared to be a massive maze. Unlike the first floor, which allowed you to wander forever without any sort of indication about where you were, the second floor incorporated signs into the doors, meaning Talia could now tell when she was going in circles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she had both a goal and directions to said goal, so she didn't actually end up going on circles. As she rounded a corner, she spotted the door leading out to the balcony. <br>\r\n\"Yes!\" She cheered, clapping happily. \"Lets see what it looks like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing open the door, Talia was met with the gentle sounds of rain. She stopped for a moment, listening to the soft pitter-patter. Casting a look around the balcony, she nodded slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cosy area, obviously having been used by some previous owner of the mansion. Pushed up against the wall next to her was a wooden bench with a couple of cushions sitting atop it. On the other side was a small bookcase, which Talia had a look at. Sadly, it was empty, meaning she would probably have to find the library if she wanted a book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, well... I suppose I could, like, try to find the library,\" Talia said, planting her wider backside on the bench. \"Sitting out here with a nice book doesn't sound too bad... Though I could catch a cold sitting out here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to take her chances, Talia wandered back into the mansion. She had no idea where the library could possibly be, or even if it was on the second floor, but she now had signs on the door to help her. Hopefully, she would stumble upon the library...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Making sure to remember where the balcony was, Talia headed back into the labyrinth of corridors that made up the mansion. After taking a few turns, she quickly realised that, even with signs on the doors, the library might be quite hard to find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guest Room #34...\" Talia muttered, passing another door. \"God! How many guest rooms do I need?! I don't even have that many friends! Though, with this body, that could change...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia lost track of time as she weaved through the long corridors. Every so often she would stumble upon a door she had already passed, which slowly began to infuriate her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing by Guest Room #39 for the umpteenth time, Talia dropped and stomped her foot. <br>\r\n\"Screw this goddamn place!\" She yelled angrily. \"Like, why couldn't they have just built this place normally, instead of having millions of bloody corridors for people to get lost in?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting the urge to put her foot through the door next to her, Talia resorted to just cracking her knuckles. After almost breaking her fingers, she stopped and took a deep breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Let's find a room that isn't another guest room and hope that there's somebody inside that can guide me!\"<br>\r\nWith a plan sorted out, Talia continued down the corridor, nursing her fingers as she walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a few minutes, during which she passed three guest rooms and one supply closet, but Talia eventually stumbled upon a room. Strangely, unlike all the other rooms she had seen, this one seemed to be missing the plaque telling her what kind of room it was. Instead, the door had slightly miscoloured section where the plaque should've been, along with four holes where the screw presumably where. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would anybody steal the plaque?\" Talia wondered, staring at the door. \"Like, wow, you've slightly inconvenienced me! It's not like I can't open the door and just see what's inside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing open the door, Talia was met with...</span></div></div>",

It is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring around, Talia jumped when she heard somebody cough. <br>\r\n\"You must be the new owner!\"<br>\r\nLooking towards the source of the voice, Talia found a girl, not much older than her, watching her with some amusement. Her brown hair was pulled back into a ponytail that reached partway down her back, while her servant's uniform had an apron covering it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's me! The name is Talia!\" Talia replied, pointing to herself. \"And you are?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Monica, and this is my salon!\" Monica said. \"If I'm honest, I didn't expect to see you so soon. Most people spent their first week wandering the first floor, and then they spend their second wandering the second. It's normally the third week before I get somebody in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so I'm not the only one who keeps getting lost?\" Talia asked, reassured by this.<br>\r\n\"You sure aren't! Half the people who walk in here don't actually need anything other than directions. The other half don't even realise that this is a salon, and thought it was some other room entirely!\" Monica said, a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did notice that you don't actually have a sign, so, like...\" Talia explained, glancing back at the door. <br>\r\nA frown appeared on Monica's face. <br>\r\n\"The sign isn't there? Huh, that's odd... I really don't know why somebody would take it. Thanks for bringing this to my attention, I'll get a new one made as soon as! Anyway, is there anything I can do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia was about to ask for directions, but stopped herself. After hearing that people walked in here for directions, she would feel guilty for doing just that. Plus, the smile on Monica's face was so hopeful, it was almost like Talia was her first visitor in forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I... I was thinking of getting something done...\" Talia said, shutting the door behind her. \"What would you recommend?\"<br>\r\nMonica clapped happily. <br>\r\n\"You're serious? That's great! Please, have a seat here! I'll have a quick look and see what can be done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica rushed over to a seat, pulling it out for Talia. Hesitantly, Talia headed over to it and sat down. Looking straight ahead, her reflection stared back. Her brow furrowed as she looked at her face. Had it always been that round...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see here...\"<br>\r\nFeeling the chair pushed forwards, Talia felt Monica's gaze drill into her. Her hands ran through Talia's hair, occasionally getting caught on the knots in it. <br>\r\n\"Hmm, hair definitely needs work...\" She heard Monica mutter. \"Should be simple enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica drew back for a moment. In the mirror, Talia saw her grabbing various hair-related utensils, such as brushes, combs and a squirt bottle. As Monica stepped out of view, Talia spotted the portrait of a woman staring down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" Talia asked, spinning the chair around to looked at the woman. <br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh, that's Lady Samantha. Unlike the vast majority of the other rooms, we've only got one painting in here,\" Monica explained as she returned to Talia's side. \"Apparently, she had an absolutely immaculate body. Her hair never knotted and never dried out, her skin never blemished and was always smooth... I suppose if you spent as much time in here as she did, you'd have a perfect body too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at Lady Samantha, Talia agreed with that statement. Her blonde hair looked thick and voluminous, her lashes were long and perfect, her mocha-coloured skin looked to be free of imperfections...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning her chair back around, Monica draped an apron over Talia's body. As she began to spray her hair with water, Talia relaxed. She had never had her hair done by a professional before, always electing to do it herself to save money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a comb being gently dragged through her hair, Talia closed her eyes and let out a sigh...</span></div></div>",

It had been so long since she had somebody in her salon, she worried that she might have forgotten how to do anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, she's fallen asleep!</i> Monica realised, looking at Talia's reflection. Her eyes were closed and she was slowly inhaling through her mouth and exhaling through her nose. <i>Well, whatever helps her relax! I hope I don't wake her while I work...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica went about her work, slowly becoming oblivious to her surroundings as she became more and more focused on undoing all the damage Talia had unknowingly done to her hair through her self-styling. She hummed a quiet tune as she worked, not noticing the frame behind her shimmer slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the frame fell a beautiful ghost clothes in a long flowing dress. She ran her hands through her hand before inhaling deeply. <br>\r\n<i>Ah, it feels sublime to be free of that frame!</i> She thought, looking around. <i>I see that the salon hasn't changed much... However...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha silently floated behind Monica. She watched as Monica went about her work, undoing knots and wrestling with matted patches. <br>\r\n<i>Oh, dear...</i> Samantha tutted quietly. <i>Your technique leaves much to be desired! Of course, it isn't all your fault. I suppose your model never really cared for her hair... Perhaps I could lend a hand?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha slowly floated towards Monica, a grin appearing on her perfect face...<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"<br>\r\nMonica froze as she felt a chill penetrate her body. Her comb fell to the ground with a clatter, causing the slumbering Talia to twitch slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chill slowly receded from her body, Monica looked around. <br>\r\n\"W-What's going... on...\" She mumbled as her eyes slowly shut. A second later, they reopened. However, instead of their usual warm brown, they were a piercing blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>I won't be able to stay in her body for long...</b></i>\" Monica said, her voice monotone. \"<i><b>I should work quickly...</b></i>\"<br>\r\nPicking up her fallen comb, 'Monica' resumed her work. However, her movements were more precise. She dragged the comb through Talia's hair with ease, quickly undoing all the knots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Perfect... Now, a little water...</b></i>\"<br>\r\nSpraying water through her hair, 'Monica' nodded. She hadn't done this for centuries, but it seemed she still had it. Finishing with the water, Samantha considered finishing, but she stopped herself when she spotted a scar running down the back of Talia's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Now, we can't have that, can we?</b></i>\"<br>\r\nHeading over to the area where Monica kept her supplies, Samantha rummaged through them. After a few seconds, she made a face. <br>\r\n\"<i><b>You don't have what I need!</b></i>\" She complained. \"<i><b>Back in my day, we could do literally anything in here! You could barely fix this woman's hair with the stuff you have now!</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a growl, Samantha forced her body to spin.<br>\r\n\"<i><b>I suppose if you want something done correctly, you do it yourself!</b></i>\" <br>\r\nFloating out of Monica's body, who collapsed to the floor unconscious, Samantha floated over to Talia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Now, you had better not ruin what I'm about to do for you...</i>\" She whispered in Talia's ear. \"<i>Otherwise, I'll hunt you down when you inevitably pass onto the next life...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Samantha floated into Talia's resting form and released her power. Letting out her last breath, Samantha slowly faded away, releasing her essence into Talia's body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samantha passed on, Talia's plump body began to change. Her ivory skin slowly darkened, taking on a light mocha hue. The small scar on her neck around the one Samantha hadn't seen running down her leg vanished, leaving behind smooth skin. Her hair, which had only been half done, finished itself. The remaining knots undid themselves, while the ragged parts became silky and full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Talia's changes came to an end, Monica sat up. She rubbed the back of her head, gazing around the room. <br>\r\n\"That was... odd...\" She groaned, getting to her feet. \"I feel really cold...\"<br>\r\nWalking over to Talia, Monica looked down at her with confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember finishing this...\" Monica said, running her hands through Talia's hair. As she did, Talia awoke with a start, causing Monica to jump back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\"<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"<br>\r\nLooking over at Monica, Talia let out a sigh. <br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you... I thought, like, something was crawling through my hair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica smiled nervously.  <br>\r\n\"It was just me... finishing off!\" She made up. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\nTurning to face herself, Talia inspected her reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do something to my skin?\" Talia asked, rubbing her darker arms. <br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah! Thought I'd try out a new spray tan I got!\" Monica lied, forcing a smile onto her face. She didn't have the courage to just say that she had no idea what had happened. What if Talia never came back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Well, it looks great!\" Talia enthused. \"Like, I'll definitely be back!\"<br>\r\nLetting out a relieved sigh, Monica bowed. <br>\r\n\"Then I'll look forward to your next visit!\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the salon, Talia fiddled with her soft hair. <br>\r\n\"So nice...\" She murmured. \"But I didn't find the library... Should I, like, just ask? I don't really want to, just in case she figures me out...\"</span></div></div>",

After a moment's hesitation, she gently rapped the door and walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica had returned to her desk, apparently having just finished cleaning. She looked up as the door opened, a smile appearing on her face as Talia slowly edged in. <br>\r\n\"Back so soon?\" She asked jokingly. \"Was it my charm that brought you back to me, or my excellent work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mix of both, I guess...\" Talia answered sheepishly. For the briefest of moments, she considered asking if Monica could do anything else to her, but she quickly remembered why she had returned in the first place. \"Um, like... I was wondering about something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that be?\" Monica prompted. <br>\r\nClearing her throat, Talia spoke up, confidence filling her voice. <br>\r\n\"I was curious about the rooms in the mansion and was, like, wondering if there was a library somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica leaned back in her chair, her eyes looking up at the ceiling. <br>\r\n\"Library, huh...\" She repeated quietly. \"Before I answer, can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course! Anything you need!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got lost looking for the library, didn't you?\" Monica guessed, a sad smile on her face. \"And you came in here, not because you wanted something done with your hair, but because you wanted directions to the library. And you stayed because my story about everybody ignoring this room made you feel guilty. Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia stared down at her breasts, a nervous look on her face. <br>\r\n<i>Man, she's really good at guessing...</i> She thought. <i>I don't really want to break her heart or anything...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Talia!\" Monica said, a hint of happiness entering her voice. \"Unlike everybody else who immediately left after getting directions, you stayed! You let me, uh... work on your hair! Tan your skin! And, um... Well, what I'm trying to say is, I really appreciate it. So, I'll happily give you directions! As long as you promise to come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair looked at each other for a few seconds, before massive grins adorned their faces.<br>\r\n\"Like, of course I will, Monica!\" Talia promised. \"You did some totally amazing work, and you can bet I'll be back! On one condition, though...\"<br>\r\nMonica raised an eyebrow. <br>\r\n\"Like, get a new sign so I know where you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter receiving directions from Monica, Talia hugged her new best friend and set out. She took one wrong turn, which thankfully led her to a dead end rather than another junction, but aside from that mistake, Talia found herself soon standing outside a door with a plaque reading 'Second Floor Library'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" She exclaimed, pushing open the door. \"I can't wait to see what books-\"<br>\r\n\"QUIET IN THE LIBRARY!\"<br>\r\nTalia let out a squeak as a loud voice cut her off. A few seconds later, a rather small man appeared in front of her, an irritated expression in his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have no noise in my library!\" He grumbled, glaring at Talia. \"I don't care if you're the new owner or not! Silence in my library! Pick your books quietly, then clear off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... Sorry?\" Talia said quietly. His accusatory glare softened slightly as he let out a sigh. <br>\r\n\"Sorry 'bout that... I ain't used to having people in here,\" He explained, walking over to a deal that was about the same height as him. \"I'm William, but everybody just calls me Bill. Pleasure to meet you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, a pleasure to meet you too!\" Talia bowed slightly.<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. Now, a few rules. I want no damage to these books. You'll be charged if there is any. Also, make sure to return them to either this library or the one on the first floor. I don't want to have to go hunting for books, you got me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia nodded. <br>\r\n\"Good. Now, can I help you find something, or are you just browsing?\"<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm just browsing at the moment!\" Talia replied. \"But, like, thanks for the offer, Bill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill grunted before disappearing behind his desk, leaving Talia to stare in amazement at the ceiling high shelves filled with books. <br>\r\n\"Like, where do I even start?\" She wondered, looking around.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Staring down a few of the aisles closest to her, Talia let out a thoughtful sigh. She really ought to find some books pertaining to her college studies, however she really wasn't feeling studying. She wanted to kick back on the balcony with a a nice book, rain gently tapping the wooden roof above her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving towards an aisle that seemed to be marked 'History', Talia quickly stopped. An odd tugging on her gut seemed to be guiding her elsewhere...<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's over here?\"<br>\r\nFollowing her gut feeling, Talia found herself standing in front of a small bookcase, barely tall enough to reach her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the small case, Talia got on her knees, her dress spreading around her. The case held about ten books, the titles of which all involving pregnancy in some way. <br>\r\n\"Hmmm... Pregnancy and your Body... The Mind of a Mother... Like, these don't seem like my kinda books...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she thought this, her arm was reaching out to grab one of the books. Bringing it up to her face, Talia quickly scanned the blurb. <br>\r\n\"Thinking of bringing new life into this world?\" She read quietly. \"Worried about the changes to your body as you do so? Well, worry no more! This book explains all that will happen to you as your child grows within you! From morning sickness to cravings, we'll cover it all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping the book over, Talia stared at the cover. A pregnant woman cradling her pregnant belly with one hand and holding a baby in the other smiled back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite believing herself not pregnant and having no plans for children in her near future, Talia wanted to put the book back. However, something compelled her to keep hold of it and grab another couple. One seemed to be about the foods a pregnant woman could eat that would benefit their child the best, while the other looked like a weird picture book detailing the various stages of pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat confused by her choice of books, Talia stood up. Putting them under her arms, she headed over to the desk where Bill was hidden. <br>\r\n\"Um, Bill?\" She called out, unable to see the small man over the books stacked high around his desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grunt answered her. <br>\r\n\"Do I need to let you know that I'm, like, taking these?\" She asked, holding a book high above her head so Bill could see. <br>\r\n\"Nah. Just bring 'em back when you're done,\" Bill answered shortly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the book back under her arm, Talia left the library. Pausing outside the door, she did her best to recall the way to the balcony. <br>\r\n\"Let's see... Left? No, right!\"<br>\r\nNodding to herself, Talia took off, confident in her choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Talia chose correctly. She found herself standing at the balcony door, rain droplets slowly sliding down the glass. Pushing open the door, she listened to the rain for a few seconds before heading out and taking a seat on the bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the books next to her, Talia grabbed one at random. Looking at it, she found that she had grabbed the pregnancy picture book. <br>\r\n\"Well, let's have a look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping open to the first page, she spotted a neat message written in the corner.<br>\r\n\"Lady Lucy during her first pregnancy...\"<br>\r\nLooking at the next page, Talia got a good look at Lucy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a pretty girl. She didn't have the curves of Lady Amelia, not was her skin and body as immaculate as Lady Samantha's, but she was still good-looking. Her blonde hair was pulled up into an elaborate up-do, while her green eyes stared kindly at Talia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the next page, Talia saw Lucy sitting in the same position. However, her hands were now folded over her belly, which had a noticeable curve to it. Her breasts were slightly rounder, and she almost seemed to have a healthy glow surrounding her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia flipped through the rest of the book, stopping to admire Lucy on every page. With each page that was turned, she looked more and more pregnant. Her belly grew rounder and rounder, her breasts looked heavier and heavier and even her face took on a softer look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the final page, Talia let out a coo of happiness. Lucy had lost all of her former weight, looking almost as she did in the first picture, however she now held a bundle of blankets in her arms. A small face was visible, their eyes wide and curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, they look so happy together!\" Talia commented. \"Oh? What's this?\"<br>\r\nSpotting another message in the same neat hand, Talia leaned in. <br>\r\n\"Lady Lucy and Sir Benjamin. Here's to the first of many!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back, Talia smiled down at the pair. Closing the book, she gently set it to the side and grabbed another book. This one was a lot more dense than the simple picture book, but even so, it didn't take long for Talia to become fully engrossed in it...</span></div></div>",

Must've been my imagination!\"<br>\r\nLooking back down at her book, Talia went back to reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she had taken a proper look around, she would've noticed the picture book next to her was now glowing. In the gentle breeze blowing through the exposed balcony, the light cover fluttered slightly. However, as the wind slowly died down, the cover continued to flutter. It slowly got more and more vigorous until it flipped open, revealing a picture of a heavily pregnant Lady Lucy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow of the book dimmed slightly, focusing in on the page. As the page glowed brighter, a dainty hand pushed out. A slim arm followed, a shoulder slowly forcing its way out of the page. The book shook slightly as a head phased out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Finally!</i> The ghost of Lady Lucy thought as her head looked around. <i>Being confined to this book for centuries was unbearable! Another few years and I think I would've lost it... And who might you be?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at the tubby girl sitting before her, Lucy cocked her head. <br>\r\n<i>An odd dress sense, if I'm honest... And a little on the fat side... Oh, hang on... The way her belly curves like that... You aren't fat at all, are you? No, you're like me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanting her free hand on the bench, Lucy let out a grunt as she forced the rest of her body out of the page. Her other arm came easily enough, however her breasts and belly posed a problem. She wiggled her body, using what little strength she had push herself out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long grunt, Lucy managed to free her upper body from the book. Her lower body slid out with little difficulty, allowing the pregnant ghost to float away from the book. <br>\r\n<i>Finally!</i> She thought. <i>Now I truly am free from that book! Now...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you?!\"<br>\r\nHearing a scream, Lucy looked around. To her left, the pregnant girl sat, staring at her with mouth agape and eyes wide. The book she had been reading had fallen to the ground, where a few raindrops slowly landed on its pages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am... uh...\"</i><br>\r\nHearing the spectral figure speak, Talia jumped to her feet. She scrambled backwards, trying to get away from them. <br>\r\n\"S-Stay right there!\" Talia ordered with a shaky voice. \"Don't come any closer! I'll scream, I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost didn't move. Instead, she watched Talia with curious eyes, her hands folding under her belly. She floated patiently, seemingly obeying Talia's command. Talia took a deep breath, calming herself slightly, before speaking again. <br>\r\n\"W-Who... What... Who are you?\" Talia asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am Lady Lucy Davis. A pleasure to meet you!\" </i><br>\r\nLucy made a clumsy attempt at a curtsy, her belly hindering her attempt. <br>\r\n<i>\"May I ask who you are?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia's mouth moved wordlessly. She attempted to say her name, but found she couldn't. <br>\r\n<i>An actual ghost...</i> She thought. <i>I though mum was making all that up! She doesn't seem to be hostile, thought... Should I try communicating?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am Talia Davis!\" Talia finally answered, somewhat nervously. \"Now, w-what are you? An actual ghost? Or is somebody playing a prank on me? If so, I'd like them to stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy shook her head. <br>\r\n<i>\"I am no prank, as you put it. I used to live in this mansion. However, after my child passed away, I...\"</i><br>\r\nLucy trailed off, tears forming in her translucent eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ghosts can cry? Now I've seen it all...</i> Talia thought. \"Like, I'm sorry to hear that. But why are you here? Why didn't you, you know... move on?\" <br>\r\nLucy wiped her tears away. <br>\r\n<i>\"I didn't want to...\"</i> She whispered. <i>\"I just wanted my child back...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her belly, tracing a finger over the top of it. <br>\r\n\"I see...\" Talia said. \"Well, I don't really know how to help you...\"<br>\r\nLucy looked up, an odd expression on her face. It was sad, happy and wanting, all at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I do...\"</i> She said quietly, floating towards Talia, who shrunk back. <br>\r\n\"S-stay away!\" Talia warned, reaching for the door handle. \"I swear, I'll scream for help!\"<br>\r\nUnfazed by the threat, Lucy refused to stop, drawing ever closer to Talia...</span></div></div>",

She had done a little research into ghosts and whatnot, and while the vast majority of it was oddly fuzzy, one little bit of information floated to the front of her mind. It was not a reassuring one, and did nothing to calm her down. Rather, it only panicked her more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What if she wants to possess me?</i> Talia thought, her eyes wide. <i>I don't want to lose my body to a ghost... I want to keep living!</i><br>\r\nFeeling the door knob behind her, Talia tried to leave the balcony. However, the handle seemed to be stuck, panicking her even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Talia screamed, turning her back to Lucy. \"Let me in! There's a ghost out here! I don't want to be possessed! Please!\"<br>\r\nNobody came. <br>\r\n\"Please... Let me in...\" Talia cried, tears in her eyes. She spun back around, slumping to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerless to stop Lucy, Talia watched as a spectral arm reached for her head. A chill enveloped the back of her head as Lucy pulled her closer and closer. Talia closed her eyes, prepared for the worst...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh?!\"</i><br>\r\nThe chill disappeared. Talia cracked an eye open. Lucy had retracted her hand, and was now staring at her with wide eyes. <br>\r\n<i>\"You... carry him...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy's voice was filled with wonder. Opening both eyes, Talia watched as Lucy crouched down in front of her, one of her hands extending towards her belly. <br>\r\n<i>\"I never thought... I'd see him again...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy's form flickered slightly. She looked at Talia, who reluctantly looked back. <br>\r\n<i>\"I... have a request for you...\"</i> Lucy asked quietly, a few tears rolling down her cheek. <i>\"It's a selfish one, but even so...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite her, Talia's head was a whirlwind of differing thoughts. A part of her wanted to run, while another wanted her to stay to hear out Lucy's request. In the end, she stayed. Reaching out her arms, she tried to pull Lucy into a comforting hug, however her arms phased right through her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy recognized the gesture, and managed a smile. <br>\r\n<i>\"Thank you, Talia...\"</i> She said. <i>\"My request is this. Within you is the ghost of my son, Benjamin... He didn't survive very long, succumbing to the cold winter... I wish to join him within you...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia's eyes widened in shock. She had a ghost in her body?! When had that happened? And Lucy wanted to enter her body as well?<br>\r\n\"Like, what happens to me if you... You know...\" Talia asked. \"Who controls my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You will, of course!\"</i> Lucy answered. <i>\"I'll just be a voice in your head... But you'd be in control. If you want me to be quiet, I'll be quiet. If you want my opinion, I'll give it. And when my son is reborn, I'll join him...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, reborn?\" Talia asked. \"Are you saying I'm pregnant?!\"<br>\r\nLucy didn't answer, giving her a cryptic smile in response. <br>\r\n<i>\"Well, Talia? Will you allow me my request?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnhappy with the change of topic, Talia mulled over the request...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A number of thoughts raced through Talia's head, some positive, some negative and some very, very negative. Agreeing to host Lucy might be beneficial to her. For all she knew, Lucy was incredibly smart and she could potentially help Talia with her studies. Plus, she would probably understand the mansion a lot better than her. With Lucy navigating, she could probably find any room she needed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Lucy could be a hindrance. She had agreed to let Talia retain control of her body, but what if that was a lie to gain her consent? What if Talia agreed, Lucy did whatever she needed to to enter her body and then took control? What would happen to her in that case? Would she become the ghost, destined to float around the manor for all eternity? Or would she just disappear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of it made her shudder. <br>\r\n<i>\"I wouldn't be malicious, if that's what you are thinking\".</i><br>\r\nTalia looked up at Lucy, who smiled back. <br>\r\n<i>\"Like I said, it's your body! I would not dream of taking it away from you! My only wish is to be reunited with my son. By hosting me, you grant me that wish\".</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia nodded slowly. <br>\r\n\"Okay... I guess it would be okay...\" She mumbled, pushing herself to her feet. \"So, like, how do I host you? Do I have to give you permission, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy giggled. <br>\r\n<i>\"No, nothing like that! Just remain still. It is all up to me...\"</i><br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Lucy slowly floated towards Talia. As she drew nearer and nearer, Talia began to shuffle anxiously. Was this such a good idea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could answer that question, Talia felt a chill enter her belly. Looking down, she saw Lucy's pregnant belly pushing into her own. As she floated closer and closer, the rest to of her spectral form slowly merged with Talia's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucy's breasts phased into Talia's, Lucy leaned forward. Talia's face slowly numbed as Lucy completely entered her. Her vision darkened, causing Talia to stumble slightly. She fell against the door behind her, causing it to rattle loudly, and slowly slid to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments, Talia was completely blind. All she could hear was the rain against the wooden roof above her and the sounds of her own breathing. And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All done! You should be able to see now!</i><br>\r\nHearing Lucy's voice inside her head, Talia let out a gasp. She had had her doubts about the whole thing, but now that it had happened, she was pleasantly surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of seconds passed, during which Talia's vision slowly returned to her. She looked down at her own hands, staring at them like she had never seen them before. <br>\r\n<i>Wow, this feels... oddly satisfying! You forget what it is like, having a physical form... Well, being a part of one, in my case!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Talia smoothed out her dress. <br>\r\n\"Like, I actually have a ghost inside me...\" She murmured in disbelief. <br>\r\n<i>That is correct!</i> Lucy answered. <i>Just to inform you, I can hear your thoughts. So if there is a number of people around you...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>I can think to you!</b></i> Talia finished in her head. <br>\r\n<i>Exactly! Now, I will let you go about your day. If you want to chat, just ask!</i><br>\r\n<i><b>Well, I do have a couple of questions</b></i>, Talia admitted. <i><b>How exactly do you know so about hosting? And what time period are you from?</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, I hosted a spectre myself!</i> Lucy explained. It <i>wasn't for very long,</i> but they taught me how the basics. As for time period, early 1900s!<br>\r\nSatisfied, Talia looked towards her bench. <br>\r\n\"Aw, crap!\" She cursed. \"Bill'll kill me if he sees that book like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacing over, Talia grabbed the book she had dropped early and did her best to dry it off. Some of the pages were damp, but that was about the extent of the damage. <br>\r\n\"That was close...\" She exhaled. \"Now...\"</span></div></div>",

What do...\" Talia mumbled, her body feeling incredibly light. <br>\r\n<i>Your body isn't used to having this many spirits living within it. It's trying to adjust, but it can't do that while the owner is awake. So, you'll most likely pass out. But don't worry! When you come to, you'll be completely fine!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come... to...\"<br>\r\nFeeling her eyes slowly shut, Talia fell backwards. She stared at the canopy above her, trying to resist the urge to black out. However, she didn't last too long, and her eyes shut. With a long inhale, Talia blacked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Elsewhere -<br>\r\n\"You say you heard screaming?\"<br>\r\nMonica and another servant rushed down a corridor. <br>\r\n\"That I did. Sounded like somebody was calling for help!\" The servant explained. \"I didn't really want to go alone, in case it was something bad, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica made a face at the servant. <br>\r\n\"What do you think happens in this place?\" She asked, rounding a corner. \"There's a massive fence surrounding the entire complex, along with an updated security system to keep out intruders. Nobody unauthorised gets in here, got me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant nodded uneasily. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what about-\"<br>\r\nMonica held up a hand, interrupting him. <br>\r\n\"Ghosts don't exist. New topic\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair didn't bring up a new topic until they reached a balcony door. <br>\r\n\"There's somebody out there!\"<br>\r\nMonica, who had run past the door, stopped and came back. Peering through the door, she let out a gasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talia!\"<br>\r\nThrowing the door open, Monica sprinted outside. She fell to her knees next to Talia, grabbing her wrist as she did. She was silent for a minute, checking for a pulse. Finding one, she let out a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n\"She's just unconscious...\" She mumbled. \"Help me get her to her room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant joined Monica at Talia's side. Crouching down, he threw one of her arms over his shoulders. Monica did the same with her other arm. <br>\r\n\"One, two...\"<br>\r\nThe pair grunted as they lifted the hefty Talia to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, she's...\" The servant began, but stopped when Monica stomped on his foot. <br>\r\n\"Don't mention a woman's weight!\" She hissed. \"No more talking! Get to her room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Later -<br>\r\nTalia awoke with a start. She sat bolt upright, looking around madly. <br>\r\n\"Who? Where? What?\" She said quickly. <br>\r\nFeeling a hand gently grasp her shoulder, Talia then let out a scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Talia! It's me, Monica!\"<br>\r\nTalia looked over at Monica, her eyes wide. <br>\r\n\"Monica! Thank god... Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonica gently eased Talia back. <br>\r\n\"Your room. You had collapsed outside, so we rushed you back here,\" She explained. \"I've been keeping an eye on you for about an hour now\".<br>\r\n\"An hour...\" Talia repeated quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. So, question for you. What exactly made you collapse?\"<br>\r\nTalia stared at Monica for a second before answering...</span></div></div>",

They fell upon her hefty breasts, which felt incredibly constricted within her outfit. Somewhat hidden by the baggy midsection of her dress was her firm yet slightly soft belly. And while she couldn't see it, she could feel her wide hips and round ass cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Calm yourself... Listen to me...</i><br>\r\nTalia's shock rapidly vanished, leaving her filled with a sense of calm. She returned to her belly, smiling as she continued rubbing it.<br>\r\n<i>That's it... You're going to be a mother... Isn't that exciting?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia let out a coo as visions of her with a baby in her arms flashed through her head. She couldn't wait to be a mother...<br>\r\n<i>You know what a mother needs? A lot of rest... Carrying around that heavy belly all day tires you out...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a yawn, Talia folded her hands under her belly. It seemed to grow heavier and heavier in her hands, causing her hands to slowly unfold themselves until they fell limply to her sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Talia, her belly was indeed growing heavier. It filled out more of her maternity dress, rounding out the soft fabric until it was very visible. Above it, her breasts began to fill with milk, their flesh beginning to bulge out of the cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs another yawn escaped her mouth, Talia heard the voice again. While it was weird in that it didn't sound like her, it sort of did sound like her...<br>\r\n<i>I think sleep would do you good...</i><br>\r\nWalking towards her bed, Talia's eyes slowly dropped. She felt so tired all of a sudden...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollapsing into her bed, she lay on her side for a few minutes before rolling onto her back. She gently rubbed her belly, letting out a happy moan before closing her eyes. She felt her hands fall to the mattress, bouncing slightly before coming to a rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Goodnight</i>, the voice said. <br>\r\n\"Goodnight...\" Talia mumbled back before drifting off to sleep...</span></div></div>",

After a few moments, she managed to make her utter a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Dessert,\" Talia mumbled. <br>\r\nNodding, Serena returned to the kitchen, leaving Talia standing awkwardly in the middle of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sit</i>, Lucy commanded. <i>Rest your weary body. </i><br>\r\nTalia lumbered towards her usual seat, collapsing heavily into it with a long groan. Her head rolled onto her shoulder, where she began to snore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy allowed her to sleep until Serena reappeared, a couple of platters held in her hands. <br>\r\n<i>Sit up straight! Stop snoring!</i><br>\r\nTalia sat bolt upright and fell silent. Serena cast her an odd look as she set down her meal, but made no comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dessert, my Lady... Rhubarb Pie and Custard, as well as some freshly baked doughnuts... Your grandparents stated that you were rather fond of doughnuts... Please, enjoy...\"<br>\r\nBowing, Serena retreated to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy licked her lips in anticipation. She hadn't tasted food in a century...<br>\r\n<i>Dig in!</i><br>\r\nWith that simple command, Talia did just that. Using her bare hands, she reached for a slice of pie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not with your hands!</i> Lucy stopped her. <i>Eat like a proper lady would, not like a savage!</i><br>\r\nPausing, Talia reached for her fork. As she did, she sat up straight. Her elbows lifted off the table and rested on the arms of her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping her fork, she cut off a small bit and delicately placed it in her mouth. Making her chew slowly, Lucy let out an internal moan of happiness. It tasted divine! The pie was soft and crumbly, while the custard was smooth and tasty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia continued to eat, pausing occasionally to grab a doughnut. Lucy occasionally considered allowing her host to devour the meal, but her manners took priority. Plus, she couldn't leave evidence that she was secretly moving Talia around at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a while, but Lucy made Talia finish every single bite. Gently grabbing her mouth with a napkin, Talia got to her feet and, without waiting for Serena to give her usual goodnight, left the dining hall. <br>\r\nWithin minutes, Talia was back in her bed, fast asleep and completely oblivious to any feasting she may have partaken in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Talia let out a long sigh. Cracking an eye open, she gently shoved aside her covers. <br>\r\n\"Man, I didn't, like, change...\" She grumbled, sitting up. \"Though, I guess this dress is super cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping to her feet, Talia caught sight of her reflection in the mirror across the room. Walking towards it, she saw that she looked...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Staring at her reflection, even Talia, who had become somewhat denser and forgetful over her stay at the mansion, could tell that something was off. Stepping closer to the mirror, she squinted her eyes, trying to figure out what was different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Talia tried her best to spot the differences, the spirit of Lucy began to stir within her. While she was a spirit and technically didn't need to sleep, Lucy has missed the sensation of slowly drifting off into a peaceful slumber at night. After Talia had returned to her room, she herself had decided to rest and had quickly drifted off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as she decided to slumber later than Talia, she had hoped to awaken later than her. Sadly, this was not the case as the amount of intense thinking Talia was currently doing had roused her from her comfortable slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a yawn, which caused Talia to let out her own yawn a few seconds later, Lucy found herself staring at Talia's reflection. Two things began to worry her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was the fact that she was looking through her host's eyes. While she had been commanding Talia around last night, the most she could do was sense her surroundings. For example, she could tell that a door existed in front of her, but not see it. Now, however, she could see the world clearly through Talia's eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich led her to her second worry, which were the subtle changes to Talia's appearance. While her host couldn't make them out due to how small they were, Lucy definitely could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, Talia had been around half a foot taller than Lucy. Now, a quick glance at the hem of Talia's dress, which was closer to the floor, told her that she had shrunk slightly during the night, bringing her closer to Lucy's original height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from her height, there were some small changes to her face and hair. Her black hair was a little longer, now reaching down past her shoulders, and had taken on a lighter hue, looking blonde in certain lighting. And her round face had softened even further, making Talia resemble Lucy just that bit more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This isn't good...</i> Lucy worried. <i>She may not remember me, but even so, if further changes to her body occur, she is bound to notice something is going amiss... I suppose, for now anyway, I should convince her to move on, least she figure out the differences in her appearance...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">=====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing a quiet voice in her head urging her to move on, Talia shrugged and smiled at her reflection, skipping happily over to the wardrobe. Pulling the doors open, she stared at the abundance of clothing, wondering what she should wear today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, that looks so totally cute! So does that top! And that skirt... Man, it's so beautiful! Like, there's so many choices!\" Talia commented happily. <br>\r\nPulling various hangers out of the wardrobe, she soon had a pile of potential clothing choices for the day. As she stared at it, the quiet voice piped up, recommending that she should choose a nice dress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A dress, huh...\"<br>\r\nPoking through the pile for a nice dress, Talia paid no mind to the voice. Had she taken the time to think about it, she might've found something amiss with it. After all, in the days before this, there had been no voice urging her to choose this or telling her to choose that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking out a plain white maternity dress with a set of black leggings, Talia quickly changed into her new outfit. Her old dress was draped over the back of a chair, a note attached asking it to be washed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to forgo shoes, Talia left her room, her feet padding lightly on the corridor's wooden floor...</span></div></div>",

The woman wasn't in any way or form ugly however, in fact she was quite beautiful. Long, raven locks cascaded towards her shoulder, piercing eyes that both told of great intelligence and sternness, and a nose that complimented her face. Her lips a deep scarlet and not extensively plush, nor thin. A beautiful amulet covered her neck, a large emerald was wedged in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She was wore a conservative green dress of the period. It wasn't overblown or indulgent, it was quite practical in fact. Though, that wasn't the reason that Talia was drawn to the picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Her hips were <i>ginormous</i>, being wider than her shoulders were! It wouldn't be that weird, many obese people had a body types like that. It was just her hips were attached to a, frankly, model-like  body. It was like a twig attached to an apple, it was that disingenuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Talia could of mistaken her hips to be apart of her dress, but they were signs of modification to the it. The painter painted in the faintness details of stitching at the side. Talia couldn't understand this, why would anyone want to emphasize their abnormality? Especially someone who owned a mansion, although Talia wasn't a good example herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Talia read off the name of the painting, a small plaque read \"Lady Bethany Davis, 1690 to 1745\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>I wonder how she got those things</i>?\" the thought slipping threw her mind.

Slowly, a head and a torso pulled themselves out of the painting, however a brief grunt interrupted the process. A few tugs on the frame, the apparition seeming to struggle from it. Finally, it gave and the ghost briefly tumbled in the air before stopping herself. Her ghostly dressed flying upwards, giving any other ethereal being a brief panty show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"<i>Should of asked for a wider picture.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a smile, Talia left the vast bedroom. A little exercise would be just the thing to work a bit of an appetite before the dinner Godfrey was surely preparing for her. As she wandered through the halls, the thought of actually needing a map began to emerge, first as  playful musings, which began growing into awed whispers in her mind. As large as the mansion looked from outside, it was clearly a lot larger than even her wildest expectations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she walked down the halls, randomly opening doors and venturing into the rooms beyond if they caught her attention. There was just so much to see in the house, all of it decorated in exquisite taste. A vast library. An enormous veranda leading to the immense gardens.  A domed patio overlooking a crystal-clear pool, a pair of inviting hammocks lazily swinging in the breeze. A drawing room. Talia actually giggled at seeing the last one. She'd always thought proper drawing rooms were places only the super-rich actually cared to have in their houses. <i>Well</i>, she thought,<i> I suppose I'm someone like that now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was only the doors she'd managed to open, since around half of the doors she'd tried were locked. She wondered what she'd find behind those tantalizing doors. Mentally adding a reminder to ask Godfrey for the keyring, she reached the great double doors at the end of the hall, opening them with a grand gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw took her breath away. It was a ballroom, a real, brilliant ballroom straight from a Disney movie. Chandeliers, smooth marble floors, a fireplace and immense windows overlooking the mansion's gardens. It was awesome, almost unreal. Talia could imagine the enormous parties the place could hold. She made a note to ask Godfrey or someone else about the place's capacity. Really, there was just too much for her alone. A couple of parties would really liven up the place. A place this big could get really cold and silent, and she'd always been social. Surely she'd find enough people for a nice shindig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was the bright white stone platform at the back. Talia circled it, scratching her head. It was a bit too small to be for dancing, too big to be a table. It was certainly eye-catching, though, neatly decorated with grape vines and images of an ongoing feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? Miss Talia?\" A voice called her from the ballroom's entrance. A girl who couldn't be older than Talia herself, wearing an apron over a black sweater and jeans. \"Sorry. I'm Janna. Mr. Godfrey sends me; dinner's ready to be served. If you'd follow me to the small dining room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia smiled. \"Sure, thanks!\" She began following the taller maid. \"Hey, Tricia? Quick question. Did my grandparents have a lot of parties here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid thought for a moment. \"Not so much in these last years, but Mr. Godfrey sometimes talks about this place's history, and he says that back in the sixties and seventies this place was huge in the social scene. I do know there were a couple of huge New Year's Eve celebrations, some marriage banquets even. The house still has a fairly large wine cellar, even though it must be at around half capacity or less these days. Your grandparents still received people every now and then in the smaller rooms, though it wasn't like the place must have seen in its prime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And... what's that big stone platform in the place of honor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanna frowned. \"I'm not really sure myself. I think it was for some kind of display. Maybe it was the hosts' table or the buffet table or something. Really, I've only been there a couple of times to clean up. Like I said, I've never seen a party big enough to justify opening up and preparing the ballroom with all the bells and whistles. But I'm sure Mr. Godfrey has, so I suppose he'd know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they arrived at the dining room. Talia oohed and aahed at the steak dinner prepared for her, and hurried to take her seat. The smell wafting from the slab of meat was simply divine, and Talia wasted no time in cutting and savoring a piece. She moaned appreciatively as the meat almost melted in her mouth, leaving a thick, strong aftertaste in its wake. It had to be one of the nicest meals she'd been treated to, especially with the array of sides festooning the main course. There was a baked potato, bathed in rich creamy sauce, grilled broccoli, a couple of biscuits slathered in gravy, and of course, the delicious red wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia was in heaven. The meal was a bit like the house: it seemed just way, way too much for her. But it was just so good, all of it. She had to wait a bit every now and then, popping her jeans open and massaging her filling stomach, but the explosions of flavor just kept on coming. Buttery, sweet, salty, creamy. It blended into a feeling of luxury and comfort such as Talia had never known. Sure, she <i>could</i> leave the meal there, but hell, food was best fresh, and a big dinner every now and then was a peccadillo she was guilty of.<i>I'll just ask for lighter meals from now on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalai leaned back in the plush dining chair. <i>Had I lived with Grandpa and Grandma all these years,</i>, Talia mused, <i>I sure wouldn't have ever managed to fit into these pants. Not with this kind of food.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long, long last, she managed to finish the last scraps of steak, down the last drops of wine from her glass, and sink into the softness. \"Oof. Oh, God, Godfrey, that was great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aged manservant nodded. \"And will you have dessert, Miss Talia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl jerked a bit. \"Oh, no. No more, please. I'm sure it would absolutely dellish, Godfrey, but I just can't have another bite. Please tell me not all dinners will be like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGodfrey cocked his head a bit. \"Well. Your grandparents did like to have a large dinner fairly frequently, but I suppose I should have asked how much you eat regularly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Just, please keep to smaller, lighter meals unless I specifically ask for something special, okay? I've got a good metabolism, but I can't handle these feasts everyday.\" The butler nodded. \"Oh, and...\" Suddenly, a wave of warmth Talia had been ignoring washed over her with renewed heat. \"Uff... sorry, I think I need to lie down for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish. I shall leave the keyring in the main lobby's table in the morning, so you can explore the estate at your leisure, though bear in mind most of the closed areas are extra bedrooms, so there's not much to see if you are to stay in the master bedroom. There are several buzzers around, so you can call either miss Janna or myself if you need anything,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, both servants gave a short bow, cleared the table and left, leaving Talia alone to nurse her food baby. Slowly, she made her way back to the master bedroom, and peeled off her clothes. For a moment, she considered taking a long bath in the enormous tub, but she barely had the energy to unpack her toiletries and wash her teeth before the heaviness of her huge meal became almost unbearable. Talia ruefully chuckled. <i>Only once in a while, no matter how good this is...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even get to put on her pajamas before throwing herself on the bed. Talia was out like a light when she hit the pillow, not even bothering to cover herself.</span></div></div>",

Smashing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rainfeld was the first one attacked. The slime devoured it. Dr. Opinhein hit the alarm, and ran, but the slime caught him and ate him too.

I just ate two people!</i><br>\r\n<i><b>I'm not hungry anymore.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime had gained new intellegence and a humanlike conciousness, modelled like Jessica's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>You can have control again.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime reformed into Jessica albeit, quite larger than before.

Sometimes that showed as a distracted grunt, which was a little annoying, other times he was remarkably, wonderfully non-judgemental. Doctor Mayhew was great to unload to at the end of the day. As a scientist he'd tried to explain his role in the research lab, but for Bob it all became incomprehensible mix of nanites, DNA, gene therapy, telomeres and so forth until his eyes glazed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a weird, but functional relationship. Bobby had seen the pay slips of his friend. Accidentally, opening the envelope one day. The difference was staggering, he didn't think of himself as a failure, but -<i>Jesus</i>- Scott earned something like ten times the amount.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd always told Bob that he wasn't interested in money. But for that sum, he could live without needing to share the property. It was a little unsettling, but Scott seemed to take everything in his stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, one day, Bobby had a hell of a day at the office. Accidentally overhearing his bosses, as he snuck a coffee break in. He hadn't meant to be hiding from them, but they'd assumed the break room was free... and so spoke freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob was horrified to hear them discuss selling their shares. Well, insider trading really, with a new merger not yet announced. It was a pump and dump operation, they laughed about the sale of the company. Bob's gasp alerting them to his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a secret.\" His manager warned him, \"Just mentioning it will get you fired.\" David Higgins was not impressed with Bob's work, and made no secret of his contempt for him. Robert however, rose above it, not caring about it. He was happy with his role as a cog in the machine. Less stress, and sufficient money to keep the wolf from the door. In some ways, he shared Scott's values.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others glowered at each other aware that they'd been caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a secret?\" Bob asked in his most innocent tone. Feigning stupidity, the smirk on David's face convincing him that he'd got away with it. The others were quiet, unsure, a gesture from David keeping them from talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have work to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Boss. Sorry, Boss.\" Swallowing the dregs of his mug, he darted for the door. Once outside, he didn't return to his desk. Instead pressing his ear against the door, he wanted. No! Needed to hear the end of the conversation. The break room door was padded, and it was next to impossible to make out what they were saying. The voices were louder, but still indistinct. He struggled to make out more than pieces of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid of getting caught, he walked back to his desk. Still stunned, and not paying attention. He tried to estimate the worth of the company, how much they'd make from their scam. His mind boggled at the figures, and that was before the merger, when the price would spike, and they'd all sell their shares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfiding it all to Scott, he didn't expect any real advice. Hell! He wasn't even sure he'd answer or was even aware he was talking.</span></div></div>",

When Scott returned he brought a glass of cola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The solution to all your problems.\" He said indicating the glass. The weak attempt at punning 'solution', was about his level of humour. Smiling weakly to show you got the joke, you took the offered glass. It felt oddly appropriate that the cola was a little flat, and tasted a little off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much is the company worth?\" Scott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, millions.\" Bob answered, \"Just now, anyway.\" Defeat filling his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't expect Scott's answer, \"$110 million.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confusion must have been clear on Bob's face. \"I have shares, just think of it as me investing in you.\" Swallowing the last of the cola, Scott seemed more interested in Bob than he had been the entire evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than enough to make your life worth taking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks.

Even trying to gasp out questions, it sounded higher, breathier, softer, and feminine.... \"Why...\" was all he could manage, his eyes begging for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet might as well have been nailed to the floor, his arms like lead, beyond his control. Even as his eyes flitted around the room looking for aid that wasn't coming, he noticed his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe backs of his hands looked slimmer, more feminine and the slender fingers vanishing beyond his view were a match. They also seemed to be shrinking retreating up the sleeves of his shirt. The collar too felt looser, and his shoulders narrower. A tickle across those shoulders telling of lengthening hair. It danced at the edge of his vision, taunting him with his inability to even turn his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven how heavy his body felt it was startling how easily Scott lifted him from the chair. Half carrying his body to the bedroom, Bob's heels dragged along the floor. A gurgle slipped out, whether in protest, or just from the way his body was being handled, he couldn't tell himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll save your life.\" Scott explained. \"People who plan on stealing millions of dollars don't leave witnesses around to accuse them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncapable of voicing an opinion, you lie there, as he slips you onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your disguise will be complete and convincing.\" He sounded somewhat proud, \"You can even get pregnant... if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe triumph in his voice, changing to uncertainty, as he read the incomplete expression on Bob's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, with the extra mass of a male body, becoming a woman tends to mean you'll become rather....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice trails off, as he shrugs, that's a problem for another day. Panic hits Bob, as he suspect something is going wrong when breathing becomes difficult. Eyes widening in horror, he tries to pant loudly, do something to attract attention. They hardly calm, as he realises the difficulty is the swelling bust making the simple act of breathing in and out require more effort. The shifting, sloshing sensation coming from his chest tells of a horrifically heavy and significant bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes darting about, you look away from the ceiling, and the dazzling light there. Seeing Scott re-enter the room, you moan as you didn't see him leave. Humiliatingly he's holding a camera up... He's recording your transformation. He's recording your degradation. At your waist, you don't want to think about what's happening there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dull immobility is worse than the sharpest pain, at least then you'd have something to resist. Though you can't move a muscle, you feel your hips twist... With the realisation that you're getting a womanly ass, and it's lifting you higher you can't even wail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looks from the camera to the bed. Checking what's on screen against reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/16/2e/af/162eafbe81fb34a49dd6ba2602012a4c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/16/2e/af/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... Good, the disguise is working fully. Your dormant female DNA is being overwritten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob suspected the commentary was for the camera of just Scott talking to himself. However, the changes continued relentlessly. Bob felt her bust already too big, becoming even more sumptuous was spilling across her chest. Mutely with her eyes, she begged him for mercy. But Scott wasn't reading that particular expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, it was more humiliating that Scott's gaze was so dispassionate, as she lay there, a vulnerable woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bust already too sensitive, those nipples too aware of the chill in the bedroom air were widening far beyond Bob's ability to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fb/41/10/fb41101cdf08ade46892914508b24712.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fb/41/10/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked impatient, his gaze drifting from the camera to Bob, and then his wristwatch. Bob took it as a feeble ray of hope, surely her ordeal was about to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Scott looked over, assessing how much of Bob was left to transform. As Bob felt her bust spill across her arms, pinning the already useless limbs against the bed. She wanted to weep with dread, at the body she'd been dealt by Scott's idea of saving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting something, Scott nodded to himself, \"Almost over now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a weak half-snort of amusement, \"You can keep your name, just call yourself Bobbi, with an 'i'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shudder rippled over Bob's skin, as Scott nodded in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2b/1b/1c/2b1b1c2057bc1ddde711cf8d2bbe216c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2b/1b/1c/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's given you appropriate clothes too.\" Scott announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn extra detail that Bob couldn't care less about, as she felt a degree of response from her fingers. A twitch letting her know control was returning.</span></div></div>",

It was only as Bobbi's back hit the wall, and a squeak of fear burst from her lips that the chase stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for your own good.\" Scott said as calmly, as calmingly as he could manage. He gestured to Bob's transformed body, Bobbi was dumb-struck.... Her mouth opening and closing silently, she too gestured to her body. Her hand flying up and down her torso. Her cheeks burned crimson, as she accidentally brushed against her boob, sending it jiggling into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... This... I... I don't think so.\" she managed in a whispering rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott settled back on his heels. \"They're coming for you.\" he tried patience once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've overheard a plan to steal $110 million, did you think they weren't going to come after you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of confusion on Bobbi's face was the picture of a bimbo asked to count too high. A struggle to answer, and not liking the answer. The frustration clear on her face, a hint of a scowl that came out more like a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I didn't think.... I mean... No... or Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, and huffed \"Yes, I know it's a lot of money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you think they'll see Bobbi, and think you're Bob?\" Scott asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi's lips tightened, but she shook her head no.

NO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it have to be this body... this curvy?\" Again Bobbi was blushing at her voice at her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott simply shrugged, \"Well I do have other forms, stored in the nanite memories.\"</span></div></div>",

But it projected a pouting petulance. Scott swallowed his smile, and hid the start of a laugh with a cough, and a fist rising to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know what it's like. I think <i>they're </i>making me dumber....\" she confided with a nod to her sumptuous bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.

Without a lifetime of experience the mood swings might be quite severe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi's argument wasn't helped as she momentarily tried to cross her arms in determination. As if she was resolute. The sight was too amusing for even Scott to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chuckles interrupted with a raised hand, \"Okay... Okay... I can give you a new body... a less curvy body.\" He mimed a shrinking chest with both hands shrinking back towards his own chest. \"But, it's not a show room, you can't just pick and choose one after another. It's a draining procedure that strains your biology, and I only have a limited sample at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last few words trailed from his tongue more than suggesting he was breaking protocol by having them at home, at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed Scott into the kitchen this time. A row of carefully labelled and barcoded test-tubes were on the table in the middle. A couple of dozen if she quickly estimated. Scott ran his finger along them, as if reading the barcodes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you go to your bedroom, you'll be comfier.\" Scott suggested. The hiss of a fresh can of cola being opened startled her, but she obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on her bed, she awaited Scott, eager to be rid of her rather too flashy, and eye-catching tits. Her hands fidgeted restlessly in her lap. Her body flushed, agitated, and vaguely excited, Bobbi realised she was horny. Those restless hands wanted to ease her tension, the warmth, the itch ached for attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft knock on the door was a formality, it was half open. Besides there wasn't anything Scott hadn't already seen... hadn't already created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" her voice still to feminine, her eagerness sounding vaguely sultry and seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one's not as ... \" The nod of his head, the direction of his gaze, all told of her upcoming breast reduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured as if miming Bobbi's bust, the mime rather less convincing with the can in one hand. Like a junkie, Bobbi's hands scrabbled for the can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed it quickly, gulping and burping, in as unlady-like a manner as possible. But still oddly, the haste suggested something to Scott who tried to hide his growing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost disappointed, as the last drops trickled to her lips. An almighty belch erupted, as she threw her head back. Almost as if she expected the ceiling to shake. But already those tricky little nanites were starting to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fizzing excitement was down to more than the gassy drink. She felt it spread out. The first effects were the ones Bobbi was most happy to see, as she felt her titties shrink. The relentless weight pulling at her shoulders was easing, a thankful smile shot towards Scott.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was undercut, as she felt her face ripple and shift. A new body came with a new face. The sensation was unpleasantly enjoyable, as if her skin were too ticklish, and the feathery prickles weren't stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they did stop, the itching, leaving her face, retreating from her bust and shifting downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3e/94/5c/3e945c7c9d9335c5d1c433eb5edd20d1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3e/94/5c/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door rang, startling them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just get that and send them away.\" Scott left Bobbi alone. The request not to be left alone, almost begging, pleading dying before she could speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did close the door behind him, for her privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crack came from Bobbi's pelvis. Discomfort making her shift from side to side. Even that simple shuffling told her of the extra heft in her rump, the width not merely down to padded flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror on the back of the bedroom door wasn't one he'd ever used, but it was worryingly useful just now, as she took in the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1b/74/61/1b7461070086c5bb30e52702536491d2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1b/74/61/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was the muffled sounds from the front door that were scaring Bobbi. It sounded like more than a conversation. A struggle, a forceful entry.... her mind raced. The heavy footsteps were inside, clearly not Scott, or perhaps more than him alone. The raised voices sounded as if they were trying to justify events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped against hope, that Scott was okay. The sound of various rooms being entered told her there was only a matter of moments until she was discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still readying herself when it was thrown wide. There in the doorway, the figure of one the company's security guards stood. A little dumbstruck, and very awkwardly he looked around Bobbi for anyone else in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry ma'am.\" was all he offered, \"Just looking for a thief.\" His gaze never rising from her ass, to ever reach her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough like Scott he did close the door after himself. The sound of a muted conversation was clear, though the words themselves were too muffled to make out. It sounded like Scott was regaining control, and the company guards were... well, not satisfied, but sure that Bob wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suspected if 'Bob' had still been home, he'd have been kidnapped, or killed on the spot. The na\u00efvit\u00e9 now too clear to her. Scott had saved him... her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith loud threats of calling the police coming from Scott, and insincere apologies coming back, she made out the offer of a business card, and the promise of a reward for further information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Scott was living well within his means, and this home was frankly beneath a man of his wealth. She knew she needed to thank him sincerely, for what he'd done. The slamming of the front door, and the stomping of Scott's feet (alone), was a relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupping and cradling her new bust, Bobbi was relieved. Her best inexperienced guess now placed it about a D-cup, or Double-D, but beyond all question reduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention back towards the door, Bobbi caught sight of herself, in that damned mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0d/17/f3/0d17f3681409322abf9372501913f3a4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0d/17/f3/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swinging open made the humiliating image vanish from her sight, her champion, her defender Scott stood in the doorway, triumphant.</span></div></div>",

But a sense of karma made it feel vaguely right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.\" he confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done it before?\" Bobbi asked his retreating back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the lab.\" Scott's voice sounded unsteady as he closed the door behind himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the test-tubes, he scanned them again wishing there was another option. The stand held a dozen stoppered test-tubes, one with a red rubber stopper. The one containing the nanites that would restore anyone to Scott's body. The others stoppered with blue rubber, each containing an extremely feminine form. He'd never solved the excess mass going from a male body to a female form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing onto his bed, he made himself ready for the coming changes. Picking his new form, he held it cautiously in one tightly clenched fist. Far too sexual, and absolutely not for public consumption, but Selena was about to make her debut, and it would be very public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to draw out his torture further, he flipped the stopper out, with an experienced thumb, and with two quick gulps emptied it down his throat. Hoping the body was the right balance of tits and ass, with neither being outrageous, she started to quake, and tremble as she knelt atop his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his face ripple and shift, blinking away tears Scott felt her breathing shift with her new nose, the lips feeling too full, her eyes too wide. As Scott felt his chest soften and spread, he rocked from side to side. His... No!... Her hips spreading wider and wider, the pillow between her legs confirming that Selena was reborn once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/52/57/18/52571812e26ac9d4456bb6383e4f8845.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/52/57/18/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it vanity to pick such a beautiful woman, Selena wondered. The nanite worked to move the excess tissue to feminine areas of fatty deposits. Again Selena rocked on her heels, as another rippling wave of growth send her hips wider with an accompanying crack from her pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6c/6b/ac/6c6bacd925bdbbfc65f798673c66da3d.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6c/6b/ac/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena wished that her transformation would stop now, that this would be curvaceous enough. The rumble from her stomach, and the warmth of the nanites far from finished with her. Closing her eyes against the worrying sight of her swelling bust, and the weight of the girls mounting. She was glad that she'd boosted the back muscles to at least manage such a figure. The too proud, too firm titties overflowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6f/77/4b/6f774bd284f94ec2116a6e00d7d32b8f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6f/77/4b/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting her teeth, Selena knew that her changes were almost complete. The surge of hormones, again wrecking her calm, scattering her thoughts into incoherence. The thought that she'd settle felt like a distant hope, as a final surge sent her bust rippling to it's final dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/26/ba/22/26ba2297e55ee8824d2576b3518bb9f2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/26/ba/22/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nanites self-destructed, Selena took in the changes. Her hands roaming over her new perfect flesh. The waist that felt too slender for such a figure. She wondered if she'd picked the worst of both worlds, rather than the best.</span></div></div>",

Now, it was in full production. The wealth of the country bringing more wealth. It diversified from an oil-based economy, venturing into tourism. The synthetics it created were of the highest quality. Artificial lives, battling their ways through the courts, were ultimately defined as not real. Lacking rights, they were coded to be subservient, and incapable of harming a living soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were durable, and hard-working. As the production had followed the trend of customer demand. The sheik had found it was producing more gynoids, than androids. Until, the production was now entirely female. The role of wife had now been outsourced, demure, submissive, unquestioning obedience had proven to be a fantastic sales pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven his neighbours were bidding for them. Adding to his fortune. He received many bids from 'more enlightened' countries, who still wanted their thirsts slaked. The dirty secret his research labs couldn't crack was the human element. Beneath the programming, the instincts had to come from an actual human. Naturally, the first subject weren't fully encoded. The resources needed for that were prohibitively expensive, but as the technology advanced, it became possible to record and transfer a whole consciousness into a sythetic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first experiments had been on those destined for hanging. The corpses mounted as the experiments failed, but within six months he'd succeeded in waking one of those criminals in the synth body, to watch his own execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another six months, the Sheik had shifted to picking those who'd volunteer their consciousness for transplanting. Agitators, rivals, and malcontents were found new roles... productive roles in society. Their unfortunate tendencies buried beneath the programming that ensured compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as his last union organiser came off the conveyor belt. His eyes wide with horror, he couldn't help but feel the shimmy and bounce of her new bust. Or the tingling hunger of her new sex. Her too plush lips worked silently as she fought to ask any question, to cope with her reveral. But, she was programmed to be mute, so she stood defiance glittering in her eyes. His heritage ripped from him, she had no trace of her Arabic genes left. She looked like a pneumatic blonde bimbo. A popular model, all around the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one was destined for Tokyo, where she'd be effectively illiterate. There was a certain customer who wanted a more curvaceous bride. Who wanted a foreign bride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/53/91/fc/5391fcf4f5297b8f1b4ce1e4eb77c1c8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/53/91/fc/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheik gave her an amused smile and a patronising wave, as the technician arrived.

His life had been saved, if not his sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching her reflection, she saw a gorgeous face looking back at her with wide, startled eyes.

Nodding firmly to herself, Abdul knew she was truly a man, with a man's soul, and a man's need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, that was cold comfort, as she squirmed in her seat. Feeling the cushiony ass smoosh beneath her, or that sumptuous bust confined and contrained by a lacy bra beneath her decent abaya, and hijab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly, alone, her stomach squirmed, already regretting this choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime dragged, stretching endlessly without any distractions. It was impossible to know how long she sat there, or how long her stomach tossed and turned. The need to pee mounted, but that just made her feel even worse. That was something she didn't want to consider, let alone attempt in this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told herself, she might need to wait hours... until a shift change, and her rescuer was free to pick her up, to restore her to... his rightful position as head of the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbdul tried to dismiss the worries, as womanly, as beneath her. But, it was impossible, she was incredibly vulnerable. Anyone with the right knowledge could put her in doll-mode, with a few words. She'd be stuck, hidden behind an obedient smile, with an all consuming need to serve. But, the factory was also the only place where a proper, a suitable body could be crafted to replace this... this insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands knotted and unknotted in her lap, as she tried not to think on the crawling passage of time. Her eyes roamed around the room, for what felt like the tenth time, hunting for any more details. But, it was a plain changing room, a womans' changing room, and for the menials, by the looks of it. A place where the cooks, cleaners, and other basic staff could.... well, change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbdul Bin Salman found herself musing on trying on those different clothes herself. Seeing if something more modest, more masking could hide her physique. But, a look down told her that those curves would be obvious in any outfit. It truly wasn't the Abaya that made her ass look big, or how tight it felt that made her bust so prominent. She was more than blessed in both those areas whatever she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chided herself for even considering the idea. It was womanly, and beneath her... <i>Him! <b>Him!</b> </i>He chastised himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer patience was paper thin, when the door started to slowly open. The fingers appearing around the frame, were too large to be female. The opening too tentative to be a woman. Abdul found herself drawing a deep breath ready to scream. A response the man beyond seemed to expect. At the continuing silence, a head appeared around it.</span></div></div>",

The pciture of the woman being milked, made her want to protectively cradle her bust, hide those too sensitive nipples she now bore. The picture of a 'Silenced' made her shudder. No longer quite so much fun, she felt her stomach squirm, as she took in the various fates he'd assigned to those who'd fallen foul of his anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who perpetrated this outrage on my esteemed body?\" He bellowed the question.

The Sheik was well aware of the range of options that could be put on her shoulders. She glared at her bust, almost daring it to leak any milk. She twisted to take in her awesome ass.

Even as he fought against the limits of the programming, he knew his defeat was inevitable. He'd watched the suffering on the face of his own harem girls too often to have any real hope. It was a sickening revelation to realise that he'd caused this coup. By delaying his transfer from his former body. Now, they had the evidence to show their father was no more. Their coup would succeed. The board shuffled, and glanced at their feet, accepting this and incapable of meeting Abdul's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the technician seemed more nervous than them... More nervous that Abdul, already guessing his disposal was needed to complete the overthrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Abdul's gaze shifted to his daughter, he hoped for some empathy, for some pity.

Her body defining her limitations, while Samira, was more modestly and properly attired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his humiliation over, and another worry added to her future. Adbul could only dread having to milk herself daily as Samira stepped back. Samir and Mahmoud seeming to take it as permission for them to continue. Surely, that couldn't be the case, Adbul thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her attention snapped back to Mahmoud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could keep you here under a watchful eye, or in your own harem.\" He mused. \"Though we'd have to ensure the other... guests, didn't find out your original name, eh... Nahida!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a switch flip inside her head, She was now Nahida. Her name granted and confirmed, she was bound to answer to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a guarantee of silence and exile, we could allow you to live out your life in Paris.\" Samir offered, as a more palatable alternative. \"Your guarantee would be enforced by the programming, ensuring you could never reclaim your former name, or even visit your homeland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be away from her treacherous, and treasonous family, Nahida would welcome the change in scenery. She wanted to leap on the second option, but a warning finger was raised. It's meaning too clear for her to ignore. She was rendered incapable of answering, and snapping their hands off in acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamir muses about offering Nahida a further choice. An easy life as an exiled woman, pampered and supported in opulence. Or a life as a pauper, but in a male body, a foreign male body.</span></div></div>",

With their core personalities buried.\" Samira continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning in confusion, gave Nahida a cutesy bimbo look, that his daughter quickly hid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with them?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, depending on your perspective, Nahida.\" Samira clearly readying herself for some outrageous story, took her time to look him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The technician didn't just save your mind, and transfer your consciousness into that... body.\" The pause, and the associated contempt was impossible for her to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your memories are now the core personality for all of today's gynoids, fresh off the production line.\" Samira's expression shifted as comprehension slowly dawned on her father. Each one of them, had just as much claim to his wealth as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those vacuous bimbos... are all me?\" Nahida asked in a choked, horrified voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a4/11/2d/a4112d2c1ab2dc15c1258964d4c34a43.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a4/11/2d/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ea/8b/93/ea8b93c0f0cb58b8ebc714debe95f142.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ea/8b/93/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth opened and closed silently, as she looked down on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I say the activation words over the speaker, we'll have a whole host of <i>you</i>, demanding <i>they </i>control the factory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sneering contempt she had for them (for her?) was crystal clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahida n\u00e9 Abdul, looked for some hope. But only varying degrees of degradation looked available. At least some of the gynoids were destined for office work, rather than simply confined to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/2a/6e/e92a6e5e7d1343b41a1d70ff66cade15.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/2a/6e/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5b/d3/46/5bd34656f0bbf831c8183173958e7238.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5b/d3/46/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we activate them?\" Samira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahida didn't answer... couldn't answer, as she spotted her identical duplicate walking around the caged area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3f/a3/23/3fa32330eee0ab85e9480aedd5bf622f.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3f/a3/23/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was spectacular. Those curves, that face, tears started to flow, as she felt Abdul collapse within her body. Whatever remained of her father reduced to babbling insanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I tell <i>your sons</i>?\" she asked. \"My brothers, of them!\" she exchanged a meaningful glance with the technician. It was clear that Samira held all the cards. Glancing to her sons, and even reading the faces of the board members, it was clear they were as in the dark as everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an appalling pride she felt, that her daughter had risen to such subtle power. The machiavellian manipulator behind the throne. The pat on her ass, brought her crashing back to reality. As her daughter treated her like a favourite pet, turning her back to face the rest of the room.</span></div></div>",

I have condensed the most popular, well written, and longest existing storylines into one. I have edited a number of chapters as well as reposted a few, making sure to specify who wrote it in the new version. Several chapters did get deleted. If it was one of yours, I am sorry. The only ones I deleted were ones that were complete dead ends having never been edited or added onto since initial posting, those that have not been added onto for a very long time, poorly written additions, and additions that either disregarded previous entries or ignored continuity. Some were just lost in the overhaul. Again, I am sorry if yours was deleted. Hopefully you can find a place for it here once more. Anyways, I have to decided open this interactive up a bit more from the original one-character storyline. I hope to be adding more to it in the future myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Story</font></b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story you take on the role of one or more characters as they live their lives and go on adventures with weight gain and expansion themes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Things that are ok:</b><br>\r\n\u2022\tFemale weight gain<br>\r\n\u2022\tFemale expansion (breast, butty, bell, hip, etc.)<br>\r\n\u2022\tMale to female transformations. <b>Bonus</b> if it becomes M2BBW or they experience expansion.<br>\r\n\u2022\tBimbo transformations are <b>encouraged</b> (especially if you mix in things like male to female, weight gain, and expansion)<br>\r\n\u2022\tGiantess, shrinking, and muscle are ok so long as it is nothing extreme (ie. No 100 ft or 2 in tall character, etc.)<br>\r\n\u2022\tPregnancy is ok but I\u2019d rather it not be the main focus. <br>\r\n\u2022\tLactation is ok<br>\r\n\u2022\tAge progression and regression are <b>ok</b> in small bits <b>as long as it\u2019s not the main focus.</b> I don\u2019t want old people or children being involved in most scenes so it shouldn\u2019t last more than two or three chapters. <br>\r\n\u2022\tFuta is ok<br>\r\n\u2022\tSex and graphic scenes are <b>welcome</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Things that are not ok:</b><br>\r\n\u2022\t<b>No</b> blood/gore or killing characters unless absolutely. <br>\r\n\u2022\t<b>Nothing underaged. I will be very strict about this. </b><br>\r\n\u2022\t<b>No </b>antrhos/furries please. There are plenty of stories in this site where you can find those. <br>\r\n\u2022\t<b>No</b> scat/gas/toilet/etc. stuff. <br>\r\n\u2022\t<b>No</b> male expansion. It\u2019s fine if it becomes or is during a male to female transformation, but otherwise please no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Finally</font></b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease add at least one paragraph and use good grammar. I will edit chapters with poor grammar, wording, and layout if necessary. I will edit and/or delete chapters that do not make sense (ie. <i>Really</i> bad grammar or if they ignore story continuity) or if they break the rules. Feel free to email about anything! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Add and have fun! <br>\r\n</font></b></span></td>",
