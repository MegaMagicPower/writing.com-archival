We've been arranged to stay at a nice hotel in Tokyo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden thought occurred to Blake, replacing his excitement with nervousness. \"W-wait...I don't think I know the Japanese language!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire patted her son on the head. \"Don't worry. I've been provided several copies of a Japanese/English dictionary. No language barrier can hinder the Heart family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Saturday, the family arrived at New Opal Airport, their suitcases packed with a week's worth of toiletries, clothes, and...snacks. Lots of snacks. Security was a breeze for the three, and in little time at all, every bit of luggage was accounted for. Blake, Jade, and Claire soon boarded the plane, looking forward to seven whole days in Japan.</span></div></div>",

Claire smiled, glad that her son and niece were catching up on lost time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how have you been?\" Blake asked. \"It's been forever since I've seen you.\" Sapphire nodded in agreement, \"It has. It's been...honestly tiring.\" She then explained how her latest missions have been exhausting, both physically and mentally. It had become a rough time for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you decided to take some personal time?\" Blake asked. His cousin nodded, \"Yep, which is why I'm here now.\" She was thankful that her mother rubbed her back reassuringly. \"So, how have you been, kiddo?\" The military officer asked. \"Good. I've finally confessed to Aria.\" \"And?\" Jessica asked, receiving a smile from the mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're now dating.\" He said, earning a hug from his cousin. \"Finally! I'm so happy for you!\" She said.

Jessica chuckled, \"Could've fooled me. Now, get some sleep. Okay, gem?\" Sapphire sighed and nodded, feeling her cousin rest his head on her shoulder, before they both went to sleep. Jessica smiled and looked over at Claire and Jade, seeing the latter of the two asleep as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked at Jessica and just smiled as the two mothers shared a quiet laugh. Even though they have been up this early multiple times, the kids still loved their beauty sleep. The two women would wake them up later. After about three to four hours into the flight, Sapphire woke up and decided to read as she waited for Blake to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be until the last couple hours of the flight that Blake finally woke up to the voices of his family. \"Blake?

After about 10 minutes, the plane came to a halt, successfully landing on the runway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being allowed to leave the plane, the family immediately began to discuss what they should do first after they got to the hotel. \"I think we should get something to eat.\" Jessica said. There were no objections, so the family got their luggage and headed for the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting to the building, it was decided that Claire and Jessica would sleep in one room, while their kids slept in the room next to theirs. The group put their luggage bags down and made sure they had keys to the rooms, before leaving to go to a restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to a hibachi, which was \"god-tier\" if you asked Blake, Sapphire, and Claire. By the time they got back to the hotel, it was close to 8:30. \"We should get ready for bed soon.\" Claire said. \"We have a lot of places to go tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodnight, the group went to their respective rooms. Sapphire immediately began getting ready for bed, saying, \"Getting ready first, because I know I'll fall asleep before either of you two get done.\" \"Hey, we are NOT that bad.\" Blake said, earning a chuckle from the military officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that?\" Jade smirked. \"I can see me not being bad, but you take quite a while.\" \"You are no better than me and you know that.\" B<br>\r\nThe mage argued. Sapphire sighed, \"I think BOTH of you are bad.\", stopping the argument right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of the bathroom, saying, \"I hope there's a hotspring nearby, because I need it.\" Blake nodded, knowing that she needed some rest after her busy time in the military. Jade was the next to get ready, allowing the mage and his cousin to have a private conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it's wrong of me to think about leaving the military?\" The military officer asked. \"If you think that it will be good for you, I don't think it's wrong.\" The mage replied. \"I just want you to have a stable life.\" Sapphire nodded, \"I haven't talked to Mom about leaving yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should.\" Blake said. \"She might understand where you're coming from.\" Sapphire smirked, \"Since when did you become so wise?\" The mage chuckled, \"I learned from the best.\" Jade came out, yawning, \"Okay, I'm...done.\" Blake nodded, before saying goodnight to the two and went to get ready as his roommates went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got in, the mage began getting ready, only to be interrupted when he felt a stinging feeling in his head. He decided to get ready as fast as possible, getting out sooner than expected. 'Maybe some sleep will help.' He thought. He didn't want to be sick on vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting into bed....</span></div></div>",

Knocking on the closest door a couple times, Blake waited a few moments before the door finally opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ye must be new here, laddie!\" a redhead wearing a green shirt and matching skirt answered the door. \"Welcome ta Scotland!

This could just be some sort of greeting for people out of the country. Blake closes his eyes and puts his hands behind his back. He hears the couple giggle then hush themselves. He hears Bonnie slip out of the bed and Anne whispering, Blake squints and tries to block it out, not wanting to intrude but relents after a half a minute. Blake shifts from side to side and decides to listen in for just a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">...steal his size, be my prize. Make him fine, forever mine.

His vision becomes blurry and starts to dim as the world around him seems to grow and grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi thought you 'ad him handled?\" Bonnie asks sharply, a small tussle of clothing moved as a result of a shove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi did!

It had been nearly five years since he shrunk professed his love to Aria. Since then the two began happily dating. Blake and Aria graduated high school and are on their own adventures in college. Aria went to a university and shares a dorm/apartment. Blake goes to community college to get his general education out of the way. The two visit each other frequently and Aria still often teases Blake for shrinking. Most of Blake and Aria\u2019s close friends know the story by now and have generally either accepted it word for word or think it\u2019s some elaborate metaphor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake steps out of the shower and gets dressed. Once he does, he goes down stairs, making himself some breakfast. Blake has just finished his finals and was glad to be through them. Suddenly he hears thuds racing above him. Soon his younger sister Jade emerges from the staircase and quickly makes breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey shortstuff~\u201d Jade had seen Blake tiny firsthand and never truly got over the feeling of being the \u201cbig sister\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sis.\u201d Blake replies. \u201cSomeone is dressed for fun.\u201d Truly Jade was. She wore a short t shirt that showed off her midriff  and preppy short shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh, I\u2019m hanging out with some friends for a graduation party. A goodbye to boring high school and a lovely hello to college life~\u201d Jade smiles as she poured some cereal and milk, eating rather quickly. \u201cBut yeah,\u201d she said with her mouth full. \u201cI\u2019m going out all night after finals today. Told ma I\u2019ll be home tomorrow afternoon... ish.\u201d Jade smiles and chugs the rest of her cereal down and finishes with a heafty sigh then a loud belch. \u201cOops~ \u2018scuse me. Alright, I\u2019m out. Later squirt.\u201d Blake chuckled, she had grown and changed  so fast these past few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, whatever. Stay safe, \u201cbig sis\u201d,\u201d Blake said with a smirk. His comment earned a smile from Jade as she waved goodbye. She exits the house and gets into her friend\u2019s car. Blake hears the familiar car of x speed away. Blake sighs with a smile, \u201cteenagers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was planning something special for his 5 year anniversary. Aria and Blake has begun talking about moving in together. It was scary at first to Blake but he auickly came around. He was thinking of taking Aria of a tour of a place he picked out. A small two bedroom house that was close to both of those colleges and was close to downtown should they eventually get a job there. Blake couldn\u2019t wait to tell Aria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly as Blake is preparing to head out a spirit appears before him. It\u2019s the timid spirit that helped him along his journey. Blake is surprised but welcomes her eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-spirit! It\u2019s you! I ... I didn\u2019t expect to see you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNor I you Blake. However... there is a matter of grave importance that requires your skills.\u201d The ethereal figure gestures towards Blake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy skills? You mean? My magic? I... I haven\u2019t practiced in years. I... I couldn\u2019t even summon a breeze.\u201d The spirit\u2019s figure starts to get twitchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... oh dear. This... this isn\u2019t good at all. Please Blake. You have to remember. There is an issue that\u2019s coming. I feel as if you\u2019re the one to help us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait.... us? What are you talking about?\u201d The spirit shifts in two before coming together, whispers seeping out from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTellHim.\u201d\u201dHeneedstoknow\u201d\u201dthisisouronlyhope?\u201d\u201dhecouldnthurtafl y\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d The spirit says to herself. She regains her composure. \u201cYes... I house many spirits whithin me... even the two spirits who spoke with you before. There is a great evil that threatens all walks off life. From spirits, to mages, and even the mage hunters as well. We need you to help us.\u201d Blake was taken back by this. He truly had rarely ever casted after he started dating Aria, even swearing that he\u2019d hardly take the dark arts again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... but I haven\u2019t practiced in ages! And I can hardly practice combat spells. Especially indoors.\u201d The spirit nods and bows her head when a few whispers speak to her. Her face lights up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes... yes yes! Of course! Blake! We shall shrink you again! You can try and do no damage to your world! No noticeable damage anyway! And we\u2019d be able to grant you much more strength and mana as well! Allowing to cast multiple spells on yourself at a time!\u201d Blake was even more shocked than finding out he would be facing off a \u201cgreat evil\u201d. Now they wanted him tiny as well?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! What if this great evil finds me when I\u2019m tiny?\u201d The spirits whisper amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a good point. The evil is humanoid, that much we know... you should be able to hide from it, so long as you don\u2019t use too much mana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it detect a magically shrunken person?\u201d Blake retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, to the evil it was sense you as alive and in magical like a mouse or... more accurately a bug.\u201d Blake grimaced. \u201cOur apologies. So Blake? Will you help us?\u201d The spirit extends her hand forward and looks to Blake expectantly. Blake thinks it over, pondering if this was truly the right way to go about things. He sighed as hesitantly extended his hand forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright I guess.... let\u2019s... save the world.\u201d The spirit smiles and giggled. She shook the two hands and Blake felt a great power surge within him. He felt himself becoming stronger than he had in ages. Eventually he starts to feel the power well into him. He felt himself slipping, which was normal he remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Blake! Thank you so much! Please. Save us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later Blake groggily holds his head. He feels the strong magic coursing through his veins and sits up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh... and I was having such a good day too.\u201d Blake stands and stumbles a bit, getting familiar with his surroundings. Once things started to clear he realized just where he was. The giant furniture, the decorations. He was.</span></div></div>",

In the distance massive pictures of some of Aria's favorite bands and a massive clock. In fact, the posters were the same ones she had. Blake looked around once more and understood that the plastic slab was actually Aria's laptop, the structure around him was Aria's overhang wooden desk and the plain of cloth was her bed and that he was shrunk on her desk. <i>I\u2019ll never get used to this feeling\u2026</i> Blake thought to himself. He looked around and saw a few littered pens and pencils. He walks over to them and feels them. Their slick plastic coverings felt the same, just larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm in Aria's room,\" Blake says to himself. He looks around a bit more and his gaze falls back onto her clock and he observes the time. 4:35. That's usually when she gets here so she should be here any-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looks to his right to the door. It sounds like someone unlocking her door. Blake, nervous, hides behind the collapsed laptop. After a few moments, the door to the dorm opens and a few moments later the door to Aria\u2019s room opens and Aria steps in. Blake blushes as he sees her. He fawns over his girlfriend\u2019s long brown hair and her large emerald green eyes. Her skin was fair and smooth and she was wearing her lovely smooth yellow shirt and flowy orange skirt. She strides easily across the room and sets down her backpack. She sighs and smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally home. Hopefully, I aced that exam. Ugh, now I get to rest~\u201d Aria turns around and falls into her bed. When she makes contact it causes Blake to be thrown up a little from the shock. Aria sighs and lays her back as she appears to start to get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rubbed his face as once he was thrown he landed on his face and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 so much for being durable\u2026 ugh\u2026\u201d Blake props himself up and looks at the sight of his resting girlfriend before him and blushes. He hadn\u2019t seen her from this perspective for a long time. He had to be honest with himself that he loved what he saw. How is this small like last time really brought out some desires he forgot he had. He shook his head, he needs to get her attention. He looks around and walks to the edge of Aria\u2019s desk and sees there is a small gap between her bed and the desk. Blake ponders on what to do as he looks over his resting girlfriend. He needed to get her attention, absolutely. But how would he get it? He could go to her face but if she swallowed him or anything else that would set him back. He could go to her chest, but she could probably roll over and pin him under her. He didn\u2019t even want to think about getting her attention on her lower-middle, but it certainly would get her attention. Though he could go lower to her feet, that would take the longest time and he could be kicked off her bed or even stepped on. Choices choices...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everything that he had been thinking had melted away as he saw the size of Aria's beautiful sleeping peaceful face. The sheer difference in scale brought him back to his memories of meeting his giant crush in the halls of Highschool. All the bad feelings and thoughts of worry and fear left him as he felt a gentle warmth radiating off of her body. He took in all of her monumental features. Her short brown hair, her big resting eyes, her soft plush lips... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it! Blake was going to get Aria's attention from her lips! Blake smiled and walked over to his gigantic girlfriend's cheek and put his hand on it. He felt Aria's soft skin give way under his touch. Aria didn't move or flinch, seemingly not feeling his touch. Blake smiled and rubbed it gently. He leaned his face into her and kissed her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Aria... So, sorry about this...\" Blake said as he starts climbing up along the side of his girlfriend's face. He gently placed his palms on her face and hoisted himself up and onto her, blushing as he had never crawled on Aria like this before. Not being used to needing to climb, Blake panted as he pulled himself on top of Aria's face and crawled onto her chin. Once on top he sprawled himself out onto her chin and sighed as he softly breathed in Aria's sweet perfume, her skin soft and allowing him to sink into her slightly. Suddenly a slight vibration comes from under him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm....\" Blake's world shook as Aria stirred in her sleep. The vibrations of her voice shook the plane that Blake was on and he held himself fast to Aria's chin as she moaned. Blake's eyes went wide, remembering the true scale difference again, remembering how dangerous even simple actions can be and why he had to get Aria's attention fast. He did have to admit though, it did feel kind of humbling to be this small with someone he loved and who loved him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rolls onto his side and crawls up to Aria's lips, blushing brightly as he puts both his hands on her bottom lip. Her mouth was so huge compared to him. She could swallow him whole right now and not even notice... kind of like how he confessed to her before. Blake blushed and chuckled as he rubbed the back of his head, hoping he wouldn't have to go through his girlfriend again to get her attention. Blake looks down at his girlfriend's plush lips again and smiles. he just loved Aria so much, one kiss wouldn't hurt anyone before he got her attention ... right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake leans his head between Aria's lips and kisses them. After a second he pulls back before Aria's mouth starts opening as if his kiss were some kind of curse or spell. Aria tiredly yawns, breathing in deeply, threatening to pull Blake's tiny body into her warm maw!</span></div></div>",

He knows Indigo is in an apartment near the New Opal University, perhaps he could enlist the help of his science inclined friend to help with his newest challenge. Perhaps she could help develop a potion to help him in his eventual battle or at the very least, something to help bring him back to size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake takes in his surroundings and sees he is in Indigo's main foyer.

Blake braces himself to the floor to see what would happen next. He hears the door handle shake and rattle then hears the jingle of keys and hushed muttering. A few seconds pass and the latch far above Blake on the monolithic door turns and unlocks. The handle turns and the massive wall of a door opens to reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo opens her door with a sigh and walks in. She heads into her living room and sets down her backpack but picks it up resigning to just put it in her room. She instead slips her shoes off and pushes them where she set her pack down. In her novel anime socks, Indigo walks into her room and sits on her desk chair and puts her backpack next to her bed and the desk itself. She leans back and the chair creaks, the cheap metal and plastic holding her weight as she holds her face. She pulls her hands down her face then interlocks her fingers. She then raises her arms up, hands still connected raising them above her head as well and yawn, cracking her knuckles elaborately. She crosses her feet at the ankles and shuts her eyes. She has just gotten back from a pop exam and is confident in her score, <i>I got at least a 95</i> She thinks to herself. She takes another deep breath and sighs, going over the questions in her head just to make sure. Her mental review easily an enjoyable pastime to improve her skills and memory retention. Though this hobby helps Indigo, it will seldom help Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake witnesses first hand Indigo stepping into her home, completely oblivious to his presence. Blake hasn't felt his low in quite a long time. In two simple steps, Indigo completely eclipses Blake and steps over him. Blake is able to see the threads of her jeans, the fibers in the socks, the canvas for her shoes and their devastating rubber treads. He sees the giantess set her pack down, a small tremor rippling through the floor from the force. He then sees her hesitate then lift up the massive pack, the idea alone of Indigo picking up something that could shock the world suddenly dawns on Blake shakes him to his core. He sees Indigo slip out of her shoe. Then with amazing grace she gently slides them against the wall before walking behind another hallway, that he knows leads to her bedroom. In only a few seconds, Blake has beholden the terror and magnitude of being shrunken. Before he dwells on it too much, he shakes his head and reaffirms himself of his goal. Get Indigo's attention. With that in mind, he immediately takes off after her. He bolts down the hall and just as he gets to the corner and sees Indigo resting in her chair. Blake groans and curses just how far he has to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of jogging, Blake arrives out of breath at the foot, er feet of Indigo. Blake pants and as he nears Indigo he immediately feels the warmth radiating off of her large peds. The giant fabric clad monoliths incredibly warm, most likely from a stressful day from classes. Blake looks up and sees that Indigo is still resting with her eyes closed. He looks back down at the giant feet and contemplates on how to get the attention of his colossal friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Indigo\u2019s socks are light blue and have two anime characters on them from the movie \u201cYour Name\u201d. Her right foot is under her left as she rests them on the floor. Her body rises high into the chair above him. He senses just how fresh Indigo took her feet out of her shoes. He coughs once but makes his way to her heel. It doesn't seem like she is moving too much if at all so Blake decides to climb her before that changes. He grabs the fabric and starts climbing his unaware friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake is able to climb up past her ankle and up the outside of her jeans towards her lap. Blake figures he'll have a few better ideas about how to get her attention. He can try to get her attention at her lap and hopefully save himself a further climb. If not he can climb to her face or ear to reach her attention there. It will be harder as well since Indigo appears to be napping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rolls onto Indigo's knee as he pants, out of breath. He sighs then stands up as he travels from the top of her knee to her lap then stares up at his giantess friend. He blushes slightly at the sight of Indigo's breasts lightly covering her face. That might prove troublesome. Blake cups his hands around his mouth and shouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INDIGO!\" ...  Nothing. The sleeping student remains motionless as her closed eyes dart around, most likely dreaming. Blake attempts again, shouting again.</span></div></div>",

He saw that Jade was some way away from where he currently was. Blake took in his surroundings and saw a few plastic cups towering above him and the punch bowl to his right. Blake got as close to the edge without putting himself in the open and looked around some more from behind a cup. Jade was pretty far and his spells could only take him so far. If he could even remember them! Blake figures he could use his glide spell but the height of the table would never make him reach his sister. The distance he'd have to cover on foot would be even more dangerous. Blake looks around again for an alternative and he sees the punch bowl. It has a ladle that hangs high above the table and the bowl. Perhaps it would give him enough room to glide safely to Jade! Blake leaves his hiding spot and makes his way to the bowl. The wet ladle cup rests on the plastic table cover still pools a bit of the red liquid. Blake steps into it and hugs the handle. Once he does, Blake begins his climb up to the top. He hears the idle conversations around him but focuses mainly on getting to the top. Once he gets near the top a distant conversation catches his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm gonna get some punch. You want any?\" Blake's eyes widen as he looks at who is approaching. It doesn't seem like anyone right now but Blake can't risk getting found. Above the punch, he turns himself upside down to avoid detection. As soon as he does he feels the table and bowl shake slightly then feels someone grab the area just above him. As soon as he does the ladle lifts and moves to scoop up some punch to fill a cup. Blake clings tightly to the handle but gets dizzy as he is constantly shaken, lifted, and lowered. Soon though the party patron sets the ladle down having finished their filling, but Blake finds he is no longer able to hold on and falls into the fruit punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake splashes into the fruit punch and has to swim to the surface. Blake breaches from under the sugary drink and he coughs and sputters the strange tasting fruit punch out of his mouth. Does ... this have alcohol?! Blake coughs as he looks around and sees he's trapped in the punch. Suddenly a new shadow of another person is cast over him. Blake looks up and sees who it is. His jaw drops as he sees...</span></div></div>",
