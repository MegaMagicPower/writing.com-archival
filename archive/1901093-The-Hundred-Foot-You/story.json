Neither of you have actually been good at the sport (nor do you like the thought of being tackled from behind) but you still enjoy it. Occasionally you pull out an actual play, but they rarely work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sweaty and tired after playing for half an hour and went to get a drink of water. That's when you remembered; your mother went to get some more ice for the icebox. Water without ice isn't going to cut it when you're this sweaty. In fact the only thing that you think you would be able to drink is a small bottle of pink liquid near the back of the fridge. You had no idea what it is, but you were so thirsty that you decide to drink it, whatever it was. Pink lemonade or milk mixed with blood, you wouldn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after consuming the drink you notice change. Everything seemed to shrink and the floor seemed farther and farther away. Before you knew it your head hit the ceiling and your growth didn't want to stop. You head into the backyard, hoping no one would notice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad luck. You were still growing, probably at least 15 feet tall right now. Even if you laid on your belly you would either be seen over the fence or smash it. You get on your hands and knees and hope for the best. Suddenly your friend walks in. You couldn't tell if his expression was from excitement, fear, or hopefulness. Immediately you say to him...</span></div></div>",

Oh well, that was life in the business. The last items on your daily agenda: Make dinner, do nightly hygiene, and go to bed. Even those three seemed hard after those long hours. Still, that increases chances of a raise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou later hit the hay, waiting for the rest well deserved...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THE NEXT DAY</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake to a sharp pain in your legs. After a moment of recovery, you analyze your new predicament. Either the room went smaller, or you grew bigger. Both weren't good news. You assumed it was the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went on your hands and knees and headed for the door, tried to squeeze through... no luck, you were too huge. Roughly 20 feet tall and still growing. Even your suit, which you stupidly wore to bed, grew to XXXXXXXXXL size. Give or take a few X's. You can't decide between whether to jump out the window, which won't be a pleasant landing, or push through the roof, which may not work. Quickly decide; you're 25 feet tall and may be too big for the window.</span></div></div>",

Perfect for your kind, dazzling and entertaining. You couldn't wait to try it on, but it was 30 minutes to curfew. Time for nightly hygiene, maybe tomorrow you'll bring that special smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THE NEXT DAY</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally. The alarm goes off and you smash the clock, as usual. Not a morning person. This day was different. You someone felt drawn to the perfume, almost as if it was calling you to try it on. You spray the odor, the tangy smell filling your nose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you exit the bathroom, the stairs seemed smaller than usual. One of those days? You didn't think so when you opened the door to the kitchen, you smacked your head against the frame when you least expected it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute, you didn't remember being this tall. You were only 5'2\", not a head over the door frame. Unfortunately, you were, and still growing. If you don't get out this minute you'd fill the room, just as Alice did when she foolishly drank the bottle inside the White Rabbit's house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were still hungry. It would be hard to grab something to eat if you go outside, unless you reach your enormous hand inside and blindly grab something from the pantry, which was far from the front door. Then again, you were 10 feet tall and counting. Decide now.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't find a job, so you've been spending most of your time just being lazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a knock at the door, and with an annoyed grunt, you get to your feet and walk over to the door. Lying there is a small package, with your name on it. You bring it in and open it up. Inside is a small wrapped present, with HAPPY BIRTHDAY written on a tag attached to it. Your birthday was months ago, but whatever. You shrug, and open the present. Inside, you find a single unwrapped cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a little annoyed by this, since you can't even fathom why someone would go to the trouble of wrapping up a single cookie and sending it to someone as a late birthday present. You eat the cookie as you stew, and you're only broken out of your reverie by your head hitting the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you realize you're quite a bit bigger than you were before.</span></div></div>",
