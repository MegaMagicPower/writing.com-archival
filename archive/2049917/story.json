I'm excited to get started, so let's not waste any time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I start, if you don't like kiddy stuff, or fetish stuff, leave now. This isn't for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story are 20 girls between the ages of 5 and 12. 10 cartoon characters, 10 regular, original characters, 10 humans, and 10 furries, all waiting for you to join them in their adventures into their foray with fetishes of many kinds. You may join then either as their friend, their cousin, their babysitter, or you can play as them if you wish. Just be sure that if you play as one of the girls, you must write the story in 1st person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must warn you, that the contents of the following story aren't guaranteed to be graphic, but have the potential to be graphic, should you make that choice. And I will make sure you have that choice to begin with. For example, you have a girl, and you're going to inflate her. Now, either you can choose the graphic route, filling her up in a rapey kind of way up the bum or crotch, or you can choose the SFW route and put a tube in her mouth, blowing her up like a balloon for fun! That choice is yours to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, some fetishes are unavailable to some characters. For example, pregnancy or unbirth is unavailable for Pistol Pete, as she's just that young, or Vanessa can't be dominated as she is in no way submissive. Things like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, what are you waiting for? The girls are waiting for you inside!</td>",
