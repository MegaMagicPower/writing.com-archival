I know how this goes, you switch bodies with me, I say ' Change us back.

With this problem Kakashi as the sqaud leader had to ensure that he was okay so he would keep and eye on Sasuke while he was healing. Kakashi ordered that Naruto and Sakura go on the last mission for the day. Naruto and Sakura were looking foward to their last mission but with a mission free weekend ahead of them they had to finish this last one and it was an important one too. The mission was to recapture a stolen artifact that had a hidden power on it and it was said that when two people touched it at the same time somthing strange would happen. </span></div></div>",

Naruto was angry because Sauske had managed to put on more mission on for Sakura and him but out of his rage he was sort of happy to get a break from seeing Sasuke take all the credit. \"Ah his lost, finally I get to make the most of my ninja skills with out him getting in the way!\". Naurto had just finished packing his gear and headed down the street to Sakura's house to see if she was ready for the mission. When Naruto finally arrived he knocked on the door to see if Sakura was home. \"Hey Sakura we need to go get that last mission done, hurry up and get out here so we can get a weekend free of no missions.\" \"Hold on Naruto I was just calling the hospital and checked in on Sasuke.\" (\"Why does she always think of Sasuke?\") As Naruto and Sakura moved out they headed towards the village gates to recapture the stolen artifact. \" Hey Sakura.\" \" Yes Naruto.\" \" What if what they say about this artifact is true? What if it does have strange powers and causes people to feel like not themselves as Kakashi sensi told us?\" \"I don't know Naruto but it cannot be that bad.\" \"Hey maybe it grants wishes!\" \" Naruto don't be an idiot it cannot work like that Kakashi sensi said it was cursed as in bad.\" \"Oh nevermind.\" With that Naruto and Sakura left the village hidden in the leaves and would track down the theif in the near by woods.</span></div></div>",

As Naruto and Sakura came to a split path they had to decide which way to go. \"Sakura which way could the theif have gone?\" \"Look on the ground you Naruto.\" Naruto looked to the ground to see a whole trail of stolen artifacts and scrolls. \"Oh I geuss Kakashi sensi forgot to tell us that this guy stole many artifacts.\" As Naruto and Sakura followed the path though the forest, they came upon a clearing where they saw a fire and someone by the fire. \"Naruto that must be the theif.\" \"I will jump out and surpise him!\" \"Naruto! don't be so stupid we need touse stealth!\" Just then the Theif herad them. \"Hey who is there? Get out here you genin punks!\" With that Naruto and Sakura jumped out and started to attack the theif. Sakura armed herself with her kunei kinfe and shurikens. Naruto just unleashed his shadow clones to surround the theif. \"Hah so punks like you think you can get me off guard?\" \"We are here to take that stolen artifact away from you! \"Yeah Sakura I believe we can take this guy no problem.\" \"Just what I was thinking Naruto.\" As Naruto and Sakura started to attack they were pushed back by the sound ninja. The sound ninja used a sound blast jutsu on them and pushed them back far. Naruto got up and charged again at the theif but this time from all sides. The theif could not move and Naruto got hold of the artifact, \"Sakura take the artifact!\" Naruto tossed the artifact to Sakura and as she caught it the Theif dove for it but one of Naruto's shadow clones hit him back. \"Naruto lets run1\" With that Naruto and Sakura both ran away with the Sound Ninja theif after them as they were running Sakura was to make sure that only she was touching the artifact. They soon got away from the sound ninja and got back into the villege hidden in the leaves. As they were back in their own villege they wondered what the artifact was. \"So what do you think it does Sakura?\" \"I do not know Naruto but I should keep it at my house for safekeeping until morning. \"Why you?\" \"Because unlike you Naruto I can keep track of things.\" \"What does that mean! Are you saying I am stupid?\" \"Well to a degree yes because most of our missions are messed up because of you.\" Hey I at least made it though the Cunin exams and you got taken out when you fought Ino!\" \" I said that was because we were evenly matched\" \"Yeah but you still lost Sakura, besides usully spend most of your time worring about Sasuke and he does not even like you can you not even tell? He would like you more if you kept track on your ninja skills, that is why he treats me more like a good rival.\" \"Naruto if you say one more thing I swear I will kill you.\" \"Ok then this would not have happend if you just gave me the artifact!\" You are not getting it! go away Naruto!\" Just give it to me.\" With that as naruto and Sakura were both fighting over it they did not see that both of them had touched it at the same time. \"Naruto look what you did now!\" \"I feel really strange right now Sakura.\" As they both touched the artifact a huge light encaseed their bodies and a strange sensation went though both of them as the feeling got hevier the light got so bright there was a huge flash and both of them blacked out.</span></div></div>",

All of them had in one way or another teased the blonde boy, and she grew up thinking it was ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could that be ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshamed of her actions, Sakura did some soul searching and shocked herself when she realised just how much of an asshole the brooding Uchiha actually was. He liked... no one! He never said anything nice to anyone, no matter what they did for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke may have lived a hard life after his brother slaughtered his clan before his eyes and forced him to relive it through the might of the Mangekyo Sharingan, but he had never been truely alone. If he needed anything, the villagers would all run over eachother to be the one to help him. The villagers would die for him. The village council would bend over and take a bat up their ass if it would please Sasuke... he had so much to be thankful for, yet he chose to be an ass and live a life of hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould she love a boy like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould she see herself LIVING with a guy like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might be cute, but he's not that special. If not for his name, he would just be another prettyboy in the pack of good looking shinobi. Nothing special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Sakura didn't take long to decide Sasuke wasn't worth her effort anymore. After all, if you think about it, she had someone who loved her enough to take deadly attacks to save her. Someone who showed his worth in a fight with an A-rank missing nin who caught their sensei and rendered the Uchiha useless with killing intent alone. Strong, kind, loving, generous... she had blown off the chance to be with someone who would treat her like a queen, and for what? The prince of emo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura turned on her heel and ran into a clothing store. She was going to do something for Naruto, and somehow make it up to him. She needed him in her life, and this ties the two together more than anything before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later, she finds herself on her ass outside the shop after the owner himself threw her out claiming they didn't sell their goods to \"demons\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking away tears, Sakura did a quick henge into Uchiha Sasuke and went back in. This time the owner couldn't be sweeter, and she walked back out with a whole new outfit completely free of charge. The owner was just happy the last Uchiha honored him with a visit to his humble shop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura thought back to the time she spent in the dressing room trying on various articles of clothing. A bright blush covered her whiskered cheeks as she remembered just how good looking Naruto actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How the hell could I have missed out on this hot piece of ass for so long? No matter, I'll make him mine... SHANNARO'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thought, the smartly dressed blonde ran towards where she felt her own chakra signature. She had traded the orange pants for black pants with black bandages tied tightly from her ancles and half way up to her knee. Her standard shinobi sandals were traded in for thin black boots in dragon's hide. Sturdy and tough, yet insanely comfortable, and not to forget flame resistant. On her upper body she wore a blood red singlet with nine black stripes on her back, and a black jacket covering it. Her forehead protector was now fit around her waist, leaving the yellow strands of hair framing the boyishly handsome face perfectly, bringing out the blue in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did notice girls taking second looks at the hot guy running past them, and couldn't help but smirk as she remembered that the guy they all lusted for was hers and hers alone!</span></div></div>",

And dragged Hinata\u2019s boyfriend away to the Hyuga family estate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's story do you want to fallow?</span></div></div>",

She was kneeling down. \u2018Where am I? And how did I get here?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOOOOO\u201d A sound emanated from somewhere down the hall. Hinata stood up and followed the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This feeling... what is it..?.\u2019 When she went through a passage, she looked up and saw a barred gate. On the gate was a piece of paper with the word \u2018Seal\u2019 written on it, that must be the gate Yondaime told her to avoid. Slowly, a pair of red eyes opened, they looked unfocused, as if their owner had been asleep at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Huge... What is it...?\u2019 Hinata thought. But the beast inside the gates thought differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKid... Come... Closer...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hinata, letting curiosity get the better of her, slowly approached the gates, the gates that kept the beast from breaking free and escaping. Suddenly, several large claws went through openings between the gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHOAAA!!!\u201d Hinata quickly backed away, intent on keeping herself from getting slashed into pieces, no wonder Yondaime told her to stay away from the gate. The beast growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to eat you for walking me up, but... this damn seal...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature looked at Hinata closely and its eyes shot open, they weren\u2019t unfocused anymore either. The thing grinned at her, to be honest, it knew Hinata very well, and spent most of it's freetime (and you can imagen how much that is) tring to think up a plot to get Naruto to date Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Hinata Hyuga. How did you to come here?\u201d the thing asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked stunned, this\u2026this\u2026whatever-it-was knew her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence. Silence so quiet it was unnerving. Then the booming voice of the thing behind the bars shattered the fragile silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you well enough, heiress to the Hyuga clan.\u201d The creature gave off a foxy grin. \u201cI also noticed how you always watch Naruto Uzumaki.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata looked ready to die of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why? Most of these papers are noise complaints or complaints about a certain clan head throwing rocks and kunai at her husband through the streets this morning. Oh, and her husband is also a clan head. Do you want to guess the name of the clan head responsible for all this paperwork?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata answered, \"The name is Hinata Hyuuga-Inuzaka.

I need to keep my strength up for my baby! If Kiba takes away my sweet ramen, then I won't be strong enough to deliver this baby! And I'm gonna deliver this baby! Plus he left our child alone! Believe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gulped, Naruto only said 'believe it' when she was really emotional about something. Hinata knew he had to tread lightly, yet firmly, to protect the village from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gathered his courage, \"Naruto, you made me the godfather to your child. If Kiba ever eats your ramen again, just come to me, I'll stop whatever work I'm doing, and we'll go out to buy you some more. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned, \"Thank you, Hinata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata let out a quiet sigh of relief, before saying, \"Now, I think you should go find your husband, and let him know he doesn't have to hide from his scary wife anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sheepishly rubbed the back of her head, before stopping as a thought came to her, \"Hey, Hinata? Are you ever going to get married?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smiled forlornly, \"I'll be honest, probably not. Being Hokage takes up a lot of time. Even if I did get married, I wouldn't get to spend a lot of time with my lover or any children we might have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could respond, Hinata waved his hand, \"Better get going, your husband is probably hiding under the bed from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled and a little bit of drool came out of her mouth as she licked her lips, \"Oh, he only does that when I'm feeling...creative at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto walked off with an evil, perverted chuckle.</span></div></div>",

Hinata became bolder, and slightly perverted when it came to Naruto, while Naruto became a bit more self-conscious and shy, especially when her boyfriend is bragging about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir swap was labeled an S-class secret, since an enemy could kidnap one of them shortly after they were first swapped since Hinata could no longer use her family techniques without the byakugan, and Naruto couldn't use his shadow clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, they were told to stay close to each other and make up whatever excuse they had to in order to do that. Only the Homage and their teachers knew about this. Eventually, puberty set in, and Hinata's hormones refused to let the former girl not think about Naruto and her current body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, they started dating, and ignoring Hiashi and Neji trying to kill Hinata at first, their relationship was perfect and they were due to marry in a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed, \"H-How long have you been sitting there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's grin grew wider, \"Oh, long enough for these to land on my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up Naruto's panties, and before the dark-haired girl could even think of a reply, the whiskered-faced boy put them against his nose and loudly inhaled, \"Ahh, that smells delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed even more, \"C-can you please not smell my panties? My...my va-va...my special spot touched that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after three years as a female, Naruto still could not say vagina. This was due to the embarrassment of discovering what one was a few years after everyone else in his age group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata snickered, and raised a blond eyebrow, \"Three years ago, that was my vagina. Besides...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata grinned, \"It's not like you have any problem showing it to me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's face became completely red as she covered her vagina with her hands, \"What do you want, Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata jumped over to Naruto, and whispered, \"Naruto, I want you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Hinata kissed Naruto.</span></div></div>",

Besides, 'Hinata''s a big girl now, she can do what she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeji only got angrier at this statement, and rushed at 'Naruto' with the intent to harm. Nothing too bad, just hurt the nerves that connect to a special place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could reach 'Naruto,' 'Hinata' jumped in between them and blocked Neji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked back at Hinata and said, \"Maybe you should leave now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata pouted, \"All right, I'll go now.

But...Naruto...don't tell him I said this, but he is a good person, and I know he will care for you. I've seen the way he looks at you. At the very least, he's not the worst choice.

She loved Tsunade as any boy would love his own mother, and he didn't want to make her look bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a woman now... and a beautiful one at that. I should at least dress the part, so no one would think I'm a boy trapped in a woman's body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, the feminine hands ruffled through the lingerie drawer until it found something it agreed on. She pulled out a pair of black see-trough satin thong panties with the Konoha emblem sowen onto the front to at least offer some cover. In her other hand she held a black size 48 DD push-up bra, also with the same motive over where her nipples would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sauntered over to the bed she had just woken up in, her hips adopting a seductive and decidedly feminine sway before she stopped in front of the side of the bed, and she sat her shapely behind down on the soft mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the panty around in her hand, she aimed her right leg through the right leg hole and did the same with the left, and for the first time in her life she pulled a pair of womans panties up her smooth womanly legs. They fit snuggly around her hips, and Naruto was only mildly irritated by the thongs behind fitting snuggly between her cheeks. She put her hands on her breasts and separated them so she could look how it fitted, but she caught a sight of her pose in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I'm smoking hot\" she thought, and she was right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi and Jiraiya would have given their right arm to be able to see this sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn speed she didn't know she possessed, and in all honesty she really shouldn't, she fastened the bra straps on her back and fitted her mammaries into the cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this over, she went over to the closet and opened it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, Tsunade's wardrobe consisted of ten pairs of black pants, ten gray shirts with ten black obi's hanging on the hanger, and five pairs of her trademark green jacked with the \"Legendary Sucker\" insigna on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five more minutes, the legendary slug sannin Tsunade stood in front of her mirror. She looked at her face and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had the outfit and hairstyle down perfectly, but she still didn't look right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't wear any makeup yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the woman sat down in the chair, and stared at the makeup in front of her. But suddenly, her hands started to move by themselves. She looked passively as her hands worked on her face as if possessed, and she could see she was looking more and more Tsunade-ish by the second. After five minutes, she regained control of her new and shapely body, and she was a perfect copy of Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell just happ... wait! I can feel the Kyuubi inside me, but there's something else inside me as well. I can feel its chakra and it feels kind of like... Tsunade obaa-chan! HOLY SHIT... Now I know why this body doesn't feel weird and why I know how to walk in heels and put on my makeup, and why I insist on thinking of myself like I really am Tsunade... It's because I AM Tsunade, but with Naruto's mind behind the wheel. I remember starting a new jutsu, but I also remember finding myself... I mean Tsunade training that very same jutsu. I'm not Naruto, but I'm not Tsunade either... I'm both! Naruto's mind, Tsunade's body... I need to find Shizune!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the woman ran out of her bedroom in search of her friend/student to see if she could help her. She had to do something, before she didn't want to since the power brought by Naruto and Kyuubi... it felt sooooo good, and it made her youth genjutsu real! What if she stayed like this? No, she had to fix it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, where is that woman!</span></div></div>",

It is really weird, and even worse, I can\u2019t really remember much about myself either.\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: \u201cIs that really truth Naruta, that is horribly\u201d Sakura stats to sound concerned. <br>\r\nSaskuke: \u201cAh pleas, she is just freaking it, you now how much she likes it when she is the center of attention.\u201d<br>\r\nSakura:\u201d Shot up Saskuke, I think she may be telling the truth.<br>\r\nSaskuke: \u201cwaste your time whit her if you want, I\u2019m going now anyway.\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: \u201cSaskuke wait I didn\u2019t mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nSaskuke: \u201cJust forget it, you just pretend to be best friend whit her if you want, I got better things to do.\u201d<br>\r\nSaskuke exit the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto: \u201cWhat did he mean Sakura? Don\u2019t we get along, I thought we were friends?\u201d <br>\r\nSakura: \u201cWow you really aren\u2019t kidding are you?\u201d<br>\r\nNaruto: \u201cNo I don\u2019t really know who I am anymore.\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: Okay, Your name is Naruta Uzumaki, you were one of the most hopeless students at the academy, you actually failed three times. You only interest seems to be boys and your dream is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nNaruto: \u201cDon\u2019t say it\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: \u2026to be the next hokage<br>\r\nNaruto <i> man I was really scared for a moment there, wait did she say boys. </i><br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a tramp\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: \u201cNo you are a tease. Probably the biggest tease the hidden leaf village has ever seen. You go around in your sexy clothing trying to get every man to fall in love whit you, but then you don\u2019t give them anything. The wildest thing I have ever seen you doing is kissing them on the cheek.\u201d<br>\r\nNaruto: \u201cThen what about Saskuke?\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: \u201cAh Saskuke, he is the most wonderful boy in the entire village, me and Ino have been in love whit him for years, that was what ruined our friendship.\u201d<br>\r\nNaruto: \u201cAnd me\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: \u201cFrankly I don\u2019t think you love anyone except for yourself, the only reason you go after Saskuke is because he, unlike the practically every other guy in the village, isn\u2019t interested in you.<br>\r\nNaruto: \u201cAnd the Hokage?\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: \u201cYou want to be hokage, for the same reason as you flirt whit all the boys I think, you want to be respected, you want people to look up to you, notice you, you simply can\u2019t get enough attention; and I also think it is because you like the idea of having control over others, but that is not what it means to be hokage.\u201d<br>\r\nNaruto: \u201cI\u2019m I that horrible?\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: \u201cI don\u2019t really know what goes on inside your head, I can only judge you by your actions, and we really don\u2019t know each other so well yet, it\u2019s only a few weeks since we graduated from the academy.\u201d<br>\r\nNaruto: \u201cI can remember that, didn\u2019t it bother all of us that we only get these stupid chores?\u201d <br>\r\nSakura: \u201cYes and especially you, you want to try your jutsus in a real battle. We have heard you complain about that more then once.<br>\r\nTell me, are you still planning to use your seduction jutsu on the hokage to get us a real mission tomorrow Naruta?\u201d<br>\r\nNaruto: Seduction Jutsu?\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: Yea, it is your specialty, you aren\u2019t just a pretty face, you have mastered a powerful genjutsu that works on almost every man, whit the exception of Saskuke, Kakashi and that weird Neji kid. Its only downside is that it doesn\u2019t work on other females.<br>\r\nNaruto: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that it all I can do.\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: \u201cWell the only time I have really seen you in action was doing Kakashis genin exam. Can you remember that, the idea was to get one of his bells?\u201d<br>\r\nNaruto: \u201cWell I can remember some of it, but you better tell me anyway.\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: \u201cWell first you simply tried to walk up to Kakashi and ask him to give you one of the bells, you was so confident that he would comply; but you should have seen your face when he simply looked at you and said no.<br>\r\nMe and Saskuke had made a bet that you would then simply have given up, but I got to handle it to you, that was when you actually started to show some promise. You used your shadow clones to attack him from almost every angle at ones, with your thousand needle hail; it actually looked pretty impressive, but of course in the end\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nNaruto: \u201cI ended up tied to a stump.\u201d<br>\r\nSakura: \u201cYea, but that was before after you had tried to still a lunchbox.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had been eating while Sakura had told her tale and had now almost finessed.<br>\r\nSakura: \u201cIt\u2019s impressive that you can keep your figure whit the amount of food that you eat. I think that it is almost time for me to go home now, I just need to finish this but I will see you tomorrow, maybe now we will get a real mission.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girl came closer and closer and then grabbed Kakashi's hand and pulled him with her. Kakashi was still in shock and reacted, he pulled his hand back and sent Ino flying towards a tree. He immediately run after Ino and intercepted just before Ino hit the tree. He caught Ino with both arms and landed on his feet. 'Looks like Sakura's training with Tsaunade is beginning to pay off, she have gained some of her strength and I underestimated her speed. ', Kakashi thought to himself.

Naruto had saved Kin from being sacrificed by Orochimaru, and she fell madly in love with him, so she decided to become a leaf ninja to be closer to him, she told him that she was in love with him, and it suddenly made him figure out a few things, like the fact that he didn't truly love Sakura, it was just a crush, and he had gotten over her. In a couple of hours Jiraiya was coming to get Naruto so that they could look for Tsunade. At first he only intended to bring Naruto, but Kin refused to let him go without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to do better than that Kin-chan!\" Naruto said as he dodged a kick, and then threw a punch. Kin blocked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't be defeated that easily Naruto-kun!\" Kin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Shadow Clone Jutsu!\" Naruto shouted, but Kin didn't intend to let him create his clones, she went after him and managed to land a punch, it threw Naruto off balance, and caused him to mess up the sign, a single shadow clone appeared. \"What the heck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even one Shadow Clone should have appeared.\" Kin said in surprise. \"Well it won't be here for long!\" She kicked the clone while it and Naruto were still in shock. The clone poofed out of existence, but the smoke from it went into Kin's mouth and down her throat. \"What the-\" Kin began before her body started shaking and she fell down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kin-chan!\" Naruto shouted. He ran to her and started shaking her. Kin's body groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was amazing.\" She said as she sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was amazing Kin-chan?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Kin, I'm your Shadow Clone, I'm in Kin's body, Shadow Clones have the same minds as the originals, but Kin caused you messed up the jutsu, and that made it so that when I was destroyed, my soul went into her body, since I have your mind, that makes it so that you are in both bodies.\" The Naruto in Kin's body explained. \"My spirit merged with her spirit, and mine was dominant since I was the one that entered her, but I'm still technically your Shadow Clone, so you can control me. I also gained Kin-chan's memories. and you might not have noticed, but it boosted both of our knowledge to make up for most of the teachers trying to make things harder for us and not helping us understand, because only Iruka sensei tried to help us, but it was too late by then. We also have knowledge of the technique, but it is in the back of our minds. If you try hard enough, you can access the knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Ok, I'll try.\" Naruto replied. He did, and he learned that only he can use it for some reason, and it only works on girls. If the girl loves him, then he can let the girl have control, but she will be completely obedient to him, so she can't get angry at him, she also can't fall in love with anyone else, will always love him, and can't get angry at him. As for the clones, normally they could sometimes have a attitude and argue with the original, now they wouldn't be able to be angry or argue with him, so since the shadow clones had his mind, his mind was the new mind for them, unless they loved him, then he just controlled them until he let them have control. Naruto was their new master and could make them be anyway he wants, whether it was to be in love with him, and if they hadn't loved them, he could give them a new mind under his command, so he could choose to give them a new personality.  Also, if the girl has more than a one year age difference to him, she will brought to either a year younger to him if she is younger, or a year older if they are older than him. The technique won't work on family, but he didn't know of any family anyway. He could also get rid of the clones on his own and have them take over a girl. \"Awsome! I'm glad that Kin-chan is okay. I wonder what I should do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: His teenage hormones get the better of him, along with being at least a little bit of a pervert, not much, but a little, and he, along with the new Kin, go to his apartment, and he plays with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: He goes looking for more girls to take over.</span></div></div>",

While Naruto was out, the new Kin was getting increasingly interested in \"her\" new body and started to run a hand through his now silky black hair. Kin slipped a wandering hand up her halter top, getting a feel for her breasts. Oh my, how soft and plush they were! Incredible foreign sensations of extreme pleasure came from her newly discovered areas. \"If this feels so good,\" she thought, \"Imagine what kind of sensations I can get from my 'other' area!\" Kin relaxed her body, and ran her fingers all over her body. By now she was felling a little bit sexy and hot. She began to massage her gorgeous breasts and play with her erect nipples.

One such person was Sasuke Uchiha who went to bed in his own dreaming of revenge but when he awoke and looked in a mirror the reflection was not that of a dar haired teenage boy but was that of a blonde haired middle aged woman with  breast that seemed to capture the gaze of men and women alike with there magnitude. The young Uchiha was shocked at his appearance and had to take a moment for his developing mind to comprehend the change that had occurred. He realised that he was no longer the young strong Uchiha with the sharingan , now he was a middle aged lady who instead of possessing the sharingan with the power to control and predict the future now had two giant \"boobies\" whose sway would allow him to control horny teens. It was at that moment he would come to the realization that one of his two dreams was now impossible that being repopulating the Uchiha clan. A scarier tough entered his head that he was a woman and it was still possible and images of Tsunade being fucked by his body and then impregnated and him carrying the child in Tsunades womb having the stomach expand and then giving birth too it and having it suckling milk from her tender nipples this was spliced together with Tsunades memories of assisting women in labour.

Acting quickly Tsunade performed the jutsu before he even had time to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke was taken a back by this and everything went black. Sasuke later woke up in a chair he was confused when he looked around and saw his own shirtless body doing poses in front of the mirror. Getting up off the chair he collapsed face forward but instead of hitting the ground two large fleshy cushion protected his face from landing on the floor. Picking himself up again he went over to the  mirror and saw that he was now trapped in the body of the big boobed beautiful queen of Konoha Tsunade Senju. He then collapsed under the weight of his problems and Tsunades giant boobs and great ass. While this was going on Tsunade in Sasukes body could not stop laughing.</span></div></div>",

He immediately jumped up and fell down again shouting, ' Who are you and why do you look like me?!' . ' it's me ten-ten , we switched bodies. ' ten-ten replied. He looked down and saw he was wearing a pink sleeveless qipao-style blouse with red sleeve trimmings and yellow fastening buttons and dark green pants.' This is a nightmare. ' ten-ten said sad. ' We do not know how this happened but we will solve it !! ' Might Guy shouted. Ten-ten found it annoying that her old body is acting so energetic and screaming . She then responded, ' it was a jutsu gone wrong and don't make so much noise in my body, it is embarrassing. ' Might Guy looked at his new hands and slowly got back up to his feet. He then pointed a finger at ten-ten and said, ' The power of youth is not embarrassing. ' . Ten-ten just grit her teeth and started to walk away and said, ' I am going to solve this dreaded curse. ' . Might Guy then responded, ' this is not a curse but a gift, I noticed your taijutsu being a bit week, now I have the opportunity to improve it.' Ten-ten gave a slight grin knowing her strength would increase dramatically. ' Sensei you are so awesome. ' rock-lee added with admiration. Might Guy shouted , ' let's start training, with the power of youth!'</span></div></div>",
