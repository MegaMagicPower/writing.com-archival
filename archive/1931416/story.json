That is so humiliating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you get straight A's.\" Mandy reminds you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding you go on and quickly finish your ice cream until it is gone and you lick your hands clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like a kitten.\" Mandy says and wipe your hands clean.<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow you can make some friends, baby. I have classes too and you will have more lessons, like all the other students. It will be easier if you don't wear a thick diaper while you are around them.\" She grins and pinch your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nods your head and the two of you walk on, but only a few meters further your stomach makes a terrible sound and your eyes goes wide.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The other side wants to be adopted into a new family.  You\u2019ve never gotten high grades, and this is a really critical year.  Also, letting go of panties and having a sister to change your diapers sounded pretty cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just can\u2019t decide until Mandy says, \u201cIf you want to stay with us, you can come home at the end of the school day.\u201d  \u201cWe have an extra bedroom you could sleep in, and we could have fun as soon as the schoolday ended.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made up your mind.  These tiny rooms and bad food you get here were bad enough.  Having home cooking by your teacher would be incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d, you say, and Mandy looks thrilled.  \u201cOnly for the rest of the school year, though.\u201d, you say before she can get too excited.  \u201cI still have biological parents that care for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.\u201d, says Mandy, hugging you.  \u201cBut you can be my temporary little sister!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Mandy...\u201d, you say, trailing off, thinking about all the great things you could do together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, after Mandy has schooled you for the day, and Ms. Richardson is done teaching, the three of you meet up in your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d, Ms. Richardson asks to Mandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said yes!\u201d, Mandy says, looking more joyful than you have ever seen her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut just for the school year.\u201d, you interject, and Ms. Richardson nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is what I expected, Danielle.\u201d  \u201cEven if you do like it here, you have to go back during the summer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d, you say, and Ms. Richardson picks you up and carries you out of your room as if you were a baby.  Mandy scurries to pack her stuff as well as yours and follow her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you are in the backseat of a small white car, heading to your new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, I told your other that I was going to take over their jobs for them.\u201d, she says, looking back at you.  \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but you are going to have to be my assistant all day now, and that is going to really mess with your bodily functions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK.\u201d, you say.  \u201cDiapers are fine, as long as I can control myself when I\u2019m not helping out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d, Ms. Richardson says.  \u201cSo, here is how it is all going to work out:  There are six periods during the day.\u201d  \u201cThere are one hour classes, and then a fifteen minute break between them.\u201d  \u201cThen, there is also lunch.\u201d  \u201cI teach all the periods except for number three, and Mandy helps out in periods one, five and six.\u201d  \u201cI can teach you during my time off, and Mandy can help you study when we get home in the afternoon.\u201d  \u201cThat way, even if you go to a different school next year, you\u2019ll have a foundation from this year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk...\u201d, you say, trying to absorb all the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve drawn up a list of a normal school day for you\u201d, she says and hands it to you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7:00 Wake up and get ready<br>\r\n7:30 Drive to school<br>\r\n8:00-9:00 Period 1 (Mandy)<br>\r\n9:15-10:15 Period 2<br>\r\n10:30-11:30 Class time<br>\r\n11:30-12:30 Lunch break<br>\r\n12:30-1:30 Period 4<br>\r\n1:45-2:45 Period 5 (Mandy)<br>\r\n3:00-4:00 Period 6 (Mandy)<br>\r\n4:15 Drive home<br>\r\n4:30-5:00 Class time<br>\r\n5:00-9:00 Free time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand.\u201d, you say as Ms. Richardson pulls into a garage and stops the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are, girls!\u201d, she says, and opens your door.  You hop out and head inside beside Mandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house is huge compared to your apartment back home!  Mandy leads you from the hallway to the stairs and shows you your room.  It has a simple wood bed with white sheets.  You lay down exhausted, and Mandy sits down next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you like it?\u201d, she asks, rubbing your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome!\u201d, you say, relaxing into the softest bed you have ever been on.  \u201cI never expected to have a sister at boarding school who would do this for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as long as you are here, we might as well get you into a diaper to protect against accidents.\u201d, she says, taking off your clothes and taking a diaper from a drawer.\u201d  Even I wear diapers sometimes when I\u2019m doing something that won\u2019t allow me to move around too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d, you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, like when our cousins come over and I have to put their two year old baby to sleep.\u201d  \u201cIt takes forever, and a single movement could result in her waking up and screaming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle, and Mandy smiles.  \u201cLet\u2019s go down for dinner.\u201d, she says, getting up.  \u201cI hear we are having stew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk to the table, your bowels rumble.  You can see a bathroom down the hall, but do you abandon your toilet training, and just go in your diaper?</span></div></div>",

It's not funny!\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever you... hee hee... whatever you say.\" Tanya said, fighting the urge to giggle.<br>\r\nYou sat down in the back of the car and pouted the whole way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole moving thing was so stressful, but now you had to wear a diaper too? Your little 8-year-old body and mind could barely handle this. It was too much. You didn't cry, but you fell into a sadness as you sat there in the car. You fell asleep staring out the window as the scenery flashed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n\"Sarah, wake up! We're here!\" Mom called out.<br>\r\nYou were finally at your new home. For a moment you were happy to be there, but then you remembered you were in a diaper... and you had wet yourself in your sleep. You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got out of the car, Mom slipped a finger down the front of your diaper to check for wetness. She frowned.<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Sarah you wet yourself again. Come on, let's get you changed into a fresh diaper.\" Mom said.<br>\r\n\"But Mom! I was sleeping!\" You said.<br>\r\nMom sighed.<br>\r\n\"Sarah, you're really having some trouble with your bladder control, and I don't want you ruining the new house by getting your pee-pee everywhere. You're wearing diapers for the rest of the day and all of tomorrow. if you can pass a diaper check, I'll let you wear your panties again, okay?\" Mom said.<br>\r\nYou frowned. Again, you knew there was no arguing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom took you inside to one of the new bathrooms. Quickly, she wiped you down and changed you into a fresh diaper.<br>\r\n\"Mom, can I take a nap?\" You asked. you just wanted this terrible day to end.<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Sarah. Your bedsheets are in a box in your room.\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unpacked your bedsheets, made your bed, and curled up in a little ball to go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

That is keep the point of view 2nd person (The main character of the story (Daniel) is refered to as \"You\" - the reader) and limit options to choices Daniel can make, not events outside his control. Eg \"Which door will you open? 1) The red door 2) The green door\" is good but \"What do you find behind the red door? 1) An over-sized nursery 2) The girls' locker room.\" is not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Chapters must be between 1000 and 3000 characters long and have exactly 2 choices (unless it is the end of the story).
