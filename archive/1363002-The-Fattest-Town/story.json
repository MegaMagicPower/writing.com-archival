Any job would have sufficed....a string of recent duds has led Lisa\u2019s reporting career to lacking any uniqueness. Her akward inexperience didn't sit well with her boss but he was always in the mood to give her a second chance. Could this really could be a break-through for her job?  Will Lisa find more there than just a few fat folks? We\u2019ll have to find out\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Lisa\u2019s very first day in the town of South Barkalow and even before she arrived she noticed the trends and differences of this town. For one, the bus she arrived on was very different from that of the ones you would normally see, the seats were widened to about twice the length and width, their was a scooter ramp up, and a miniature vending machine in every booth. Sort of how dinners used to have jukeboxes in the booths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus driver was a man who easily sported over 500 pounds of weight atop his near 6 foot frame. The man smelled heavily of bread and cheese, Lisa cringed as she boarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><b>1. Start the reporting now and interview the bus driver!<br>\r\n2. Silently board the bus and wait to be dropped off at your apartment.<br>\r\n3. Speak with one of the passenger.<br>\r\n4. Decide not to board and call a cab.</b></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa interviewed Gus Harlem, the bus driver, after his shift was over. Gus was a tall, fat African American man who had been living in South Barkalow since he was a child, born and raised, now massively obese and near retirement he simply tends to the buses and tourists. His grey hairs curled out from under his mandatory blue bus-driver cap. His uniform was wrinkled and faded from the many washing it had endured; he had a weathered look to his eyes and face and his lips seemed to be frowning quite often, but when he did smile it invited anyone to talk with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and Gus were at the employees-only section of the bus depot when their interview started. Gus was at his lunch break too; leaving this poor man vulnerable to Lisa\u2019s novice and shoddy interviewing techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Gus, how long have you been driving the Barkalow Town Transportation Bus?\u201d Lisa inquired with her pen and pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGus lumbered over to the vending machine and put in 75 cents. A turkey sub erupted from the huge mechanism and he took it back to his table, he sat across from Lisa. \u201cWell,\u201d He started off in a slow voice, a croaky voice. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this ever since the Tourist Busing Plan was put into effect. I knew the Mayor\u2019s brother, Ralph, and I was offered the job right away. I never really understood why we needed this though, makes us fat folks seems like we\u2019re in some glass box in a zoo or something.\u201d His words were shameless. \u201cWish those skinnies would get off their butts and do some walking themselves instead of talking about how lazy we are\u2026\u201d Lisa was a little embarrassed; obviously she was someone who would be, in Gus\u2019s terms, a \u201cskinny\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell anyone can ride the busses, residents and tourists alike, it\u2019s not just for tourists.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but the only people you see riding them are people with cameras and crap. We shouldn\u2019t even have tourists, we ain\u2019t nothing special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I suppose you don\u2019t feel very positively towards the Tourist Busing?\u201d Lisa was dutifully noting down every thing he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefiantly not! Don\u2019t know why ol\u2019 Tom even started this junk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour referring to Tom Blank, the mayor I presume?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Tom used to be such a smart guy, but with all those tourists waving money in his face I don\u2019t blame him for snatching some\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t support the Tourist Busing then why do you drive one? Wouldn\u2019t you be better off doing something else?\u201d Lisa was curious as to why he was staying here if he hated the tourists so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s really a long story, best not told now.\u201d Gus reached into his skin-tight pockets for another 75 cents. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m doing Ralph a favor...\u201d And with that Gus tucked  his hands in his pockets and closed his eyes. Did he just fall asleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><b>1. Be persistent and find out exactly what Gus's relationship with Ralph is.<br>\r\n2. Don't bug the poor guy, let the interview end. Besides you have to get home.<br>\r\n3. Look for another bus employee to talk to.<br>\r\n4. Explore the bus depot.<br>\r\n5. Leave and get accustomed to the town.<br>\r\n</b></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The interview ended soon after that and Lisa left the bus depot to see the apartment she was going to stay in. It was around 1 o\u2019clock and before Lisa arrived at the apartment she had to grab a bite to eat, Gus wasn\u2019t the only one who was hungry for a lunch time snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large town was bright and bustling with the residences roaming about. Each one fatter than the next, she planned to interview many of them, including that 2% of residence that wasn\u2019t overweight, but for now it was lunch time. Every street was packed with a multitude of different places to stuff your face. The extra wide sidewalks and streets housed every type of restaurant you could imagine. It seemed that there were no other stores, only restaurants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFormal restaurants, Italian bistros, Chinese, Korean, cafes, diners, and of course an absolute overload of fast food places. No wonder this town got so fat, but where these built before or after the residences started fattening up? That was a question the mayor would certainly have an answer for. Lisa traveled through a couple of blocks, just looking at all the people and places but soon enough she wandered into a small 24 hour diner called simply \u201cThe Regular\u201d, it was just 2 blocks from her hotel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe diner was a small, square blue building that stood between a huge supermarket that looked like a warehouse and a custom car dealership, defiantly out of place and dwarfed by the two buildings at its side. Lisa walked in casually, but before she even sat at a table she was attracting quite a few frowns from the customers. It seems as if anyone skinny was thought to be a tourist, and no one seemed to like tourists here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was seated at a table far from any windows, or booths, the waitress led her to a two seat table in the center of everything. Most of the other heavy-set customers were in extra-wide booths on the sides of the diner. Lisa\u2019s chair was thin and non-reinforced, like usual, it was as if this town was segregated between the fats and thins. Lisa could only imagine arriving at a fancy restaurant and the waiter asking you for fat or non-fat as opposed to smoking or non-smoking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the customers unified displeasure the waitress was very pleasant with Lisa. The waitress was a huge middle-aged woman, who was not only fat but also very tall. She looked to be about 6 foot and over 450 pounds, she carried a lot in her thighs but the rows of tables were extra wide, posing no obstacle. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Sally and I\u2019ll be your server today.\u201d Lisa continued to look at the menu. \u201cSo dear, what can I get you to drink?\u201d Her voice was quite and soft despite her largely daunting size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\"><b>1. \"I'll have a milkshake please!\"<br>\r\n2. Lisa curiously looked at the drinks on the Specialty Page. \"Why do they call this drink 'A Meal in a Mug'?\" <br>\r\n3. \"I'm fine, just a glass of water will do.\"</b></span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The menu was huge novel compared to the ones people normally see at \u201cconventional\u201d restaurants. The beverage section alone encompassed three back to back pages. Needless to say most, if not all, of the drinks seemed to have a high calorie count to them. The most numerous and varied drinks on the menu were milkshakes and other high-calorie concoctions. The drinks were reasonably priced but it didn\u2019t matter, Lisa\u2019s entire trip was being paid for by the company and so all of her expenses, including food, was going to be charged on their credits cards, not hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a banana milkshake for now.\u201d Lisa replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much whipped cream would you like? Extra or double extra?\u201d Sally dutifully asked, it was probably second nature for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa laughed a little to herself. \u201cI guess just extra.\u201d Lisa replied with a smile. \u201cCan I have a few more minutes to run by my order? I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally wrote down the order, \u201cOf course dear, might I suggest our Filler Special, it\u2019s on the 7th page, have a look!\u201d Sally advised as she tucked away her pencil and walked back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile flipping through the menu\u2019s pages she pulled out her glasses and stumbled on page 7. To her surprise The Filler Special took up the entirety of page seven! The whole page was covered in choices of toast, drink, syrup and other things. The Special consisted of 15 buttermilk pancakes, a loaf of French toast, a five egg omelet with your choice of cheese and filling. And with that mega-meal came complimentary sausage, potatoes, and hash browns. \u201cOh my goodness!\u201d Lisa thought as she read the list again. \u201cHow can anyone eat all of this? There is just so much food! It\u2019s impossible!\u201d Lisa thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colorful pictures of the meal seemed to come to life and dance around, taunting Lisa\u2019s reluctant attitude. \u201cTry me! Eat me!\u201d The voices chimed, Lisa though, ignored her hunger and she refocused on her journalism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out her journalism notebook and jotted down another name. So far in her notebook were a list people she wanted to interview, so far she had written:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\tThe Mayor<br>\r\n\u2022\tThin Residences<br>\r\n\u2022\tTourists<br>\r\n\u2022\tMore fat Residences<br>\r\nAnd now she proceeded to add another important name, \u201cSomeone who has eaten an entire Filler Special\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meal Lisa ultimately ordered was a simple but hearty plate of silver dollar pancakes and two eggs on the side with buttered toast. For her it was defiantly a lot of food but when you\u2019re getting your picture taken you might as well smile, and although she didn\u2019t finish her plate completely she felt much more than satisfied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Belly aching somewhat from her large meal, Lisa payed and left, resolving to walk to her apartment to plan her next move. She had a lot to do, and if there was a scoop here she definitely wanted to get at it before any other journalist snatched it from under her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weather had turned hotter than ever, making Lisa feel distinctly overheated as she walked briskly along the sidewalk; if it was this warm for her, she shuddered to think how many incidences of heatstroke this town saw yearly. Carrying around a five hundred pound body was a struggle at the best of times - under the summer sun it must be exhausting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer route back to her apartment led her through a small park, and as she walked along one of the extra-wide paths through the trees she was interested to spot what seemed  to be a children's playground. It wasn't a playground like she used to play on though - a dozen low benches were scattered around aimlessly, upon which the children were lounging. Not a single one was running around playing tag or skipping, and the solitary piece of equipment was an old slide that looked like it was falling apart - all the kids were just sitting around and talking, occasionally reaching down to grab a snack from the many bags of junk food that littered the ground around the benches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa glanced around; none of the parents were anywhere to be seen. Weren't they worried about their kids being unescorted? Then she thought about it, and realised that in this town, abductions probably just didn't happen. Perhaps there were some benefits to this obesity thing after all, she considered wryly.<br>\r\nActually, if none of the parents were around, this might be a great time to get an interview with one of the kids without their mom or dad interfering with the results. After checking her surroundings once more, she hurried up to the gate of the playground and slipped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nearest bench to the gate had one girl on it who looked perhaps seven or eight - it was hard to tell though. Her form was absolutely smothered in fat, rolls upon rolls sagging from everywhere on her body. Thighs as thick as Lisa's waist were forced wide apart to allow her vast belly room to sit, barely covered by a stretched 'Frozen' T-shirt - her massive rear spread out voluminously on the bench, buttocks spilling off the back even as her legs dangled over the front. She blinked through thick glasses at the approaching Lisa, face buried by chubby cheeks and a double chin which almost seemed to merge into each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, what's your name?\" Lisa asked, smiling her most friendly smile as reached the bench. She hadn't even realised children could get so big before.<br>\r\n\"Um, Clara.\"<br>\r\n\"Clara! That's a nice name. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about your lovely town, Clara,\" she asked, still smiling widely.<br>\r\n\"I, um, I guess so,\" Clara mumbled, scratching her belly with a hand almost buried by her own forearms.<br>\r\n\"Great! Well first off...\"</span></div></div>",

And some poptarts, about three or four. Sometimes five. Some sausages and bacon too. And some chocolate milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa blinked slowly as she jotted down the list. It was no wonder the girl was so big. \"What about lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For lunch I sometimes get pizza, or some burgers,\" the girthy girl explained, \"or chicken nuggets. Sometimes all three. I always get them with fries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa bit her lip ever so slightly. \"I see, and what's dinner like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We usually order takeout for dinner,\" the girl answered, \"Chinese, pizza, McDonald's...sometimes a couple of places, if we have the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's finger nervously tapped as she typed. \"And dessert...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin crossed Clara's fat face, squishing up her cheeks. \"Chocolate cake and ice cream! It's the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa saw that coming. \"Right...do you have snacks throughout the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chips, chocolate bars, burgers, fries, pizza...\" she listed, counting on her sausage-like fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa couldn't be surprised - that kind of diet would leave anyone looking like a human blimp. She looked up from her phone to see Clara scratching her titanic tummy while smacking her lips. Perhaps all that thinking about food was working up her appetite, Lisa thought wryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you a lucky girl Clara,\" she managed to keep up the happy facade, \"okay, next question...\"</span></div></div>",

As she waited for Lisa's reply she reached down beside her, pulling a couple of candy bars from a paper bag Lisa hadn't spotted before. She unwrapped one and ate half in a single bite, barely even chewing before she swallowed it down.<br>\r\n\"Well, walking around, running, sports... that kind of thing,\" Lisa said, watching in genuine dismay as Clara quickly polished off both candy bars as she seemed to consider her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really do a lot of walking,\" she admitted eventually, \"Makes my legs hurt. Mommy teaches me at home so I don't have to go anywhere for that,\" she bit her lip, seemingly doing some serious mental athletics. God knew she couldn't do physical breed, so perhaps she was some kind of intellectual savant to compensate \"I think I walk maybe... two hundred steps.\"<br>\r\nLisa raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"When do you walk two hundred steps, Clara? To get to the park?\"<br>\r\nClara shook her head, looking amused.<br>\r\n\"No, like... every week. I walk two hundred steps a week. With mommy's help.\"<br>\r\nLisa's eyes widened.<br>\r\n\"Oh. Right. That's alright,\" she managed to say, more than a little horrified, \"How did you get to that number, can I ask?\"<br>\r\nClara rolled her eyes, apparently growing irritated by Lisa's questioning.<br>\r\n\"It's like... 10 steps to go to the bathroom, and mommy takes me there two times a day... and then it's like... another 30 to this bench from the car... then 30 back again... and that's it.\"<br>\r\nShe was beginning to get out of breath from all the talking, having to take breaks even within each sentence to grab some wheezing gasps. She was a surprisingly good interviewee though, so Lisa carried on with her questioning regardless.<br>\r\n\"And would you say you do more or less activity than most children your age?\" Lisa asked. There was a shifting in Clara's form, one that might perhaps be interpreted as a shrug.<br>\r\n\"I guess about the same,\" she managed to say, eventually. She scratched idly under one of her fat rolls, her thick hand disappearing altogether as she rubbed at the inflamed, buried skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa bit her lip. She had plenty more questions, but she wasn't entirely sure how many Clara could manage.<br>\r\n\"This might be a sensitive question, Clara, so don't answer if you don't feel comfortable. I have to ask though - do you know how much you weigh?\"<br>\r\nThere was another shifting that might have been a shrug.<br>\r\n\"Weigh? I dunno. Like, pounds and kilos and stuff? Mommy said I'm not learning that 'till the year after next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wasn't going to find any useful leads there.

Eventually, she slowly shook her head, causing her massive slab of a double chin to wobble.<br>\r\n\"No, never heard of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa figured as much - it seemed no one in this town had any idea what the word meant.

Wrapped in all that insulating fat, Lisa wasn't surprised she was overheating, but she did feel it was a tad neglectful of her mom to leave such a vulnerable child out in the sun like this. She was sweating more heavily than ever now, great dark patches appearing across her stretched Frozen t-shirt to stain the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Clara, if you only walk two hundred steps a week, what sort of hobbies do you have? What sort of activities do you do to pass the time between meals?\"<br>\r\nClara looked thoughtful. <br>\r\n\"I snack... watch tv... play games... snack... mommy teaches me... sometimes...\"<br>\r\nShe was having to take longer and longer breaks between sentence fragments to gasp for breath, wheezing so loudly some of the other kids in the playground looked over in concern. Lisa smiled at them nervously.<br>\r\n\"Well, ah, what sort of games do you play?\" she asked hopefully, \"Board games? Word games?\"<br>\r\n\"Video... video games,\" Clara gasped, making Lisa's heart sink once again. It seemed this poor girl didn't do anything intellectual at all, besides her homeschooling - and if she still hadn't learned about weights at the age of seven or eight, she was rather skeptical that that was anything more than an excuse not to send her to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tapped down the answers on her phone, but before she could pose another question, Clara spoke unprompted.<br>\r\n\"Can... can I ask a question?\" she puffed, blinking rapidly as sweat dripped into her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course,\" Lisa said, looked up in surprise, \"What do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n\"Can you... scratch my thigh... under my tummy... it's itchy... can't reach...\" she gestured vaguely to where the flabby mass of her belly rested on her legs, and Lisa was horrified to realise that her arms weren't long enough to reach. The reporter gaped for a second, then bit her lip. She supposed that the girl had answered all her questions fairly well - on the other hand, she'd always had a weak stomach, and she wasn't at all sure she could deal with what she might find.</span></div></div>",

She had to remind herself that she could just wash her hands later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to think of how to do this, but it seemed the only way was to...lift up her tummy. The thought made her heart skip a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another deep breath, she reached a hand under the massive expanse of soft, sweaty flesh and raised it. Thankfully Clara was at least wearing shorts, even if they were badly strained and the legs were pinching so badly her thighs were practically bursting out of them.<br>\r\nShe felt a little nauseous, her stomach already in knots. But she had to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly scratched on the massive slab of thigh, causing Clara to breathe a heavy sigh of relief. \"Ahh, that's better...thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too quickly but still rather hastily, she removed her hand and gently lowered Clara's tummy before looking at her.

She and a few other waitresses were off on break chatting in the back, employee-only room. Lisa was nearby listening as best as she could, she could only make out a few words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the people among the discussion was Rod Crewn, a middle aged bum who at 30 was cut off from his parent\u2019s credit cards and money stream. He was a late bloomer of sorts who was working at the dinner for some much needed spare cash. He was only semi-portly despite being born and raised in South Barkalow, but his appetite was something many citizens yearned for. He\u2019s claimed to have eaten out entire menus, and despite his constant bragging nobody doubts him. \u201cI say tie her down and feed her till she pops!\u201d He roared loudly with a grand, toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha was a young, new employee who was far from being called the \u201cnew kid\u201d. She was loud, lovable and a definite porker. She was a boisterous young girl who flirted with customers and she was somebody who didn\u2019t mind going doing \u201cover time\u201d with employers to get a promotion. Everybody thought she was sleeping with the boss but she was so loud and friendly that she had no real enemies. \u201cOh don\u2019t be so harsh Rod! She looks like a very sweet girl.\u201d Martha seemed strangely passionate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRod recoiled back to the kitchen to pick up another round of food. \u201cI was only joking\u2026\u201d He muttered knowing he should just shut up; since Martha knew almost everybody in town no one wanted to offend her. She was kind of like the popular girl in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha cleared her throat and continued. \u201cI think we should be nice. Just coax her into it, I mean I was just like her when I came here, don\u2019t you remember?\u201d Everyone nodded. \u201cI was skin and bones too\u2026\u201d Martha smiled. \u201cUntil you showed me that Filler Special!\u201d She said smiling widely at Sally. \u201cOffer her that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did!\u201d Sally offered. \u201cBut she said no, I\u2019m sure I can nudge her into it though.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment a tall bald man tapped Lisa\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNeed some help miss?\u201d Lisa was scared half to death as she quickly turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, yes I was just checking to see if my food was ready.\u201d Lisa lied as she crept slowly back to the seating area.

A fresh breeze danced by as she entered the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a large room with a lounge area and a receptionist desk, much like any other hotel. Lisa carried her luggage up to the receptionist desk were she was greeted by a young teen, no older than 20 but she looked to be at over 250 pounds, Lisa couldn't see her whole body but wasn't hard to tell that her bosom held much of the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has baby blue eyes and her blond hair pulled back into a long ponytail, she smelt of chocolates and mints, Lisa looked over to the courtesy candy bowl. Like most hotels at the desk was a candy bowl, but here it was more of a pit. The bowl was recessed into the desk itself and rather than tiny mints there were whole sized candy bars. Lisa's guess was that the receptionist had been treating herself to it all morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, welcome to Summit Hills Hotel.\" The receptionist greeted vibrantly, her massive chest shook with each syllable under her red tight office uniform. Lisa noticed her name tag read Marie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, yes I reserved a room here, I was told it was...\" Lisa searched her snug pockets for the slip of paper her boss gave her - on it was her room number and password to get it. \"Aah, here it is, I'm room number 12A.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, do you have the password for the keys?\" Marie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Lisa showed her the paper and Marie input it, her computer showed confirmation. Marie handed her the card key to her room and explained the simple directions to get there. Lisa thanked her and grabbed a candy bar for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw a rack of brochures near the desk and opted to browse through a few. They were advertising different estuarine and tourist attractions to see, she grabbed one of each hoping some may be of importance and perhaps hold some valuable information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the elevator she heard a voice across the lobby calling her name.

There were full-size, not travel-size, bottles of lotions, shampoo and conditioner, as well as bars of soap. The towels were big enough to eat a picnic on. Lisa unfurled one experimentally - it was as light and convenient as a regular-sized towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's weird, she thought. A towel this big should feel clumsy... I have enough trouble spreading out one when I go to the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the bedroom door next. The bed was huge. Not just extra large for a very full-bodied guest, but big enough so that even two very obese people could have plenty of room. She hopped on the bed experimentally, surprised to find a layer of soft comfort on top of some firm support.

She turns her head over to face the digital clock on the nightstand and reads 9:47 PM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange, who can that be?\" Lisa gets up and walks over to the door to have a look through the peephole. She sees what seems to be a rather a bottom heavy brunette wearing a red uniform coat and black slacks, standing next to a tray. Still not very trustful of everyone here, she leaves the door closed and says in a confused voice, \"Ummm, how may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette then replies in a cheerful voice, \"Good evening Ms. Boytise. Sorry to bother you at this hour, but on behalf of The Summit Hills Hotel we would like to welcome you with a complementary dish form our restaurant.\" More calm and focused now, Lisa decides that this would be the perfect opportunity to start researching this town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on a smile and open the door. \"Well thank you very much.\"  Lisa says to the brunette as she rolls in the tray. \"Do you guys offer everyone that stays here this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we do.\" The brunette then began rolling the tray over to the kitchen. Lisa then saw how the slacks squeezed the brunette's chubby bottom half tightly, as she pushed the cart. \"We want every guest here to feel like they would at there own house. If we can, we would like you to feel even more comfortable here than your house.\" She then reach over to the dish on top of the tray which let Lisa see some fleshy white fat ooze from the sides of the brunette's slacks as she placed it on the table. Lisa noticed the brunette's face turn red as the fat stuck out making a small muffin top. Lisa turned away a little so the brunette can hide the embarrassing fat that stuck out on each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa than began to think to herself 'Odd, everyone in the town so far was used to their weight and didn't struggle with clothes, she must be new here. She seems to be barely reaching the 200 mark or just passed it. What keeps bringing people to this town? The service this town provides is great, but I doubt that is the only reason why everyone is drawn here' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of pasta soon interrupted her thoughts and Lisa's stomach growled ready to eat. Being since she hasn't eaten anything since this morning, many would expect that reaction from her stomach. But Lisa on the other hand, didn't think she would still be hungry after being so full from the thick milkshake and hearty breakfast from this morning. In fact, she never remembered being hungry a second ago in bed. Before she could put more thought into what was happening, her thoughts were interrupted yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else you would be needing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O yes..\" Lisa than began to focus on her assignment and started to do some investigating. \"I'm still new here, so I was wondering if you can you tell me a little bit about this town and how you like it here?\"                   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette then introduced herself as Jasmine and spoke a little about herself.They both sat down at the table. Lisa with her big bowl of pasta and Jasmine snacking on a king size Snickers she saved. Jasmine rambled on for about a good twenty minutes, all while Lisa began nibbling on the pasta. Lisa started to get a little frustrated and bored when everything Jasmine said she already knew. When Jasmine started to talk about how she ended up in this town Lisa got interested again. Jasmine was telling Lisa how she wanted to be a model at first. Lisa could tell by Jasmine's face how she could have been a model before she was fatten up here. Jasmine also said it was funny she never even heard of this town before, until she got something in the mail from here six months ago. Before Jasmine could tell her more, she was stopped by the sound of Lisa's fork scratching against an empty bowl. Lisa was shocked to see she had finished the whole blow, and how she failed to notice the fullness in her stomach. Before she had time to collect her thoughts Jasmine was already up from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is almost time for my shift to be over so I better get going. If you need anything else feel free to ask me. I'm usually working here or downtown somewhere.\" Not wanting to blow her cover as a reporter she just nodded and let her leave. As soon as Jasmine left with the tray and dirty dishes, Lisa walk over to the bed with both hands on her stomach, and dug her head into the pillow.          <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great, not only did I embarrassed myself by stuffing my face, but I blew a great chance to get a lead from Jasmine.' She laid in bed for a little bit trying to think of anything she could have miss from before that Jasmine said. But all that she talked about before, was common things she already knew about the town and all the new restaurants they had here. Lisa just buried her head in the pillow again and decide to call it a night.</span></div></div>",

Few years ago Hobs, the owner, decided to do something different with Thanksgiving leftovers and put turkey scraps, mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce into a blender and liquefied it. It grew to be very popular around here, so now we make it with turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie filling. Good choice to start with, miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Lisa exclaimed. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually want to order it\u2026\u201d But the waitress had already walked away, out of earshot. Amazing! Lisa thought. How could the fattest town in the world have a concept like leftovers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lisa could get over her initial shock a woman walked in and sat across from her. At first, Lisa thought the woman was skinny, but then she realized that the woman had a belly on her that flared out from her thin frame so ridiculously that she looked pregnant. But a pregnant woman, Lisa thought, wouldn\u2019t be wearing things like a restrictive belt, a short miniskirt and thick soled combat boots. The woman appeared to be Lisa\u2019s age or a year younger, and had shoulder length orange hair and the creepiest makeup Lisa had ever seen. She wouldn\u2019t describe the woman as being goth, but she was disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShh\u2026\u201d whispered the mystery lady. \u201cYou\u2019re the journalist that\u2019s trying to figure out why everyone in this town is so fat, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprise on Lisa\u2019s face gave her away. She had only gotten into town today, and she was sure her assignment hadn\u2019t leaked out of the company. The woman continued. \u201cYou can call me Tilly. And you are defiantly going to need my help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Tilly.\u201d Sally the waitress walked past. \u201cThe usual?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Make it cranberry juice this time.\u201d Sally walked to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa tried to regain her composure. \u201cSo, Tilly, you want to help me. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say both you and I have an interest in\u2026secrets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you even know that I\u2019m an investigative reporter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s just one secret you\u2019ll have to figure out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally came back with a tray laden with drinks. \u201cHere you are, miss. One \u2018Meal in a Mug.\u2019 Anything else to order?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll just finish this first.\u201d Lisa looked at the glass. It was taller than any other glass she had ever seen in a restaurant, and it was filled with what looked like a brownish-yellow milkshake. Sally put the rest of the glasses on Tilly\u2019s side of the table. Lisa counted one chocolate milkshake, three glasses of cranberry juice, a glass of milk, a glass of beer, and a glass of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThirsty?\u201d She smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly glanced at her. \u201cI\u2019m a bloater; someone who likes to bloat and distend their stomach with liquids. I can handle the big meals here when I have too, because of my large stomach capacity. Better leave this to the professionals.\u201d She reached over and grabbed Lisa\u2019s meal in a cup. Lisa stared in amazement as Tilly guzzled the drink and emptied it in about ten seconds. She reached for her pen and paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly licked froth off her lips and shook a finger. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that. You might scare the locals. Just be patient.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few minutes Tilly took deep, long drafts from her various beverages, mixing them up so she avoided the odd aftertaste that comes from mixing juice and milk. Finally she stifled a belch and patted a bloated gut. \u201cSo, do we have a deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I\u2019m really going to get to the bottom of this, Lisa thought, it\u2019ll help to have a local with me who knows the history. <i>But how exactly did she figure out who I was so quickly? If I stay with her, perhaps I could solve more than one mystery.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want to know the secrets come with me,\u201d Tilly said. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa and her new acquaintance Tilly were now sitting in a park a few blocks away from the restaurant. Although the park was situated in the fattest town in the world, the overweight citizens still partook in activity. However, it was food related activity. People were having picnics, barbeques, and ice cream socials. Lisa was surprised so many fat men, women, boys and girls could fit in one place. Even the babies were fat. A chubby bundle of lard was being pushed in a stroller built for twins. Lisa couldn\u2019t figure out if the mother was pregnant again or if she was just fat like the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly and Lisa sat in an alcove created by pine trees. Being more normally sized the girls could hide in this place were other people couldn\u2019t get to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Tilly, tell me what it\u2019s like living in the fattest town in the world\u2014ah, dang it! Excuse me.\u201d Lisa had been fiddling with a tape recorder without very much success. Then ribbons tape scribbled out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are horrible at this journalism stuff,\u201d Tilly commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know much about me anyways. I\u2019m just the girl that bloats herself up with water weight in the basement. People talk about doing kinkier stuff on the internet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not that kind of reporter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. But if you really want to interview someone noteworthy, I can take you to them. Scratch that; I can take you to where they should be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a ten minute walk Tilly led Lisa to the outskirts of a shopping district. It didn\u2019t look particularly out of place to Lisa. It had shops, restaurants, out-let malls and other buildings generally associated with such complexes. \u201cWhat\u2019s so special about this?\u201d she asked Tilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one thing before I tell you:  Do you believe in magic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis place is magical, because it tends to distort space and time around itself. Stare hard, but not too hard, and the answer will come to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was tired of riddles. All right, she thought, I\u2019ll play your stupid little game. She gazed ahead. A Green Mill. Nothing surprising there. Right next to it was an IHOP. Still nothing surprising. She continued looking down the businesses in the block building, checking off the list of franchised eateries in her head, until she realized that she had yet to see a single clothing, electronics or bookstore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing but restaurants here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDing ding ding!\u201d Tilly replied with mock enthusiasm. \u201cTwo points for the reporter. This area is called \u2018The Eats\u2019 by the locals. It\u2019s infamously known around the world for containing a branch from every operating commercialized food chain in the country. Although the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 is nothing to write home about; all the pins are just fat guys playing guitars.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing!\u201d Lisa said. \u201cBut why would so many competing restaurants be built here so close together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly pointed to another building. \u201cHave you ever seen one of those before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa squinted up at the sign. \u201c \u2018La Grub Shack?\u2019 What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe latest corporation to jump on the pita sandwiches bandwagon. No other building of it exists in the entire US of A. It is still in its testing phase.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gasped in surprise again. It was very easy for her. \u201cIs South Barkalow some kind of testing ground for soon-to-be chain restaurants?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt very well could be. Rumor has it the mayor accepts big offers from food corporations to test their new eateries in South Barkalow. That is how all this cropped up. As you might have guessed, most of South Barkalow\u2019s economy is controlled by food business. Isn\u2019t this lovely? Over four square miles nothing but restaurants. Let us go in deeper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly led Lisa through the urban labyrinth of places to eat. Just like the park, this was probably the only place in South Barkalow where the citizens were dynamically active. Families of human walruses walked to and fro. They could have their choice of any cuisine: Mexican from Acapulco; Italian from Olive Garden; Chinese from PF Chang\u2019s; or ice cream from Cold Stone Creamery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the healthier food chains, like Subway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly shrugged. \u201cThose places are not as \u2018shiny\u2019 or \u2018clean\u2019 as their counter parts back in the real world. I dare say the Subways here would not help Jared keep off those two hundred pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was the most physically fit of all the citizens of South Barkalow, even Lisa was getting tired from all the walking she had done that day. \u201cYou haven\u2019t mentioned much about this person we are going to meet. Is it some important official, like the guy who develops this place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope; just another of the many consumers of The Eats. However, this one is a bit more interesting than the common fare here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was dying to know who she was about to meet. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even told me what gender this person is. Who are we meeting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly, as usual, did not give a direct answer. \u201cIt is not too much farther. In fact\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cRight on time,\u201d Tilly mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old fashioned lime green Volkswagen drove up into an empty stall in front of them. Lisa thought it seemed a tad out of place in a town of fatties. It looked too small for the average obese citizen. However, a tall young woman did come out of it. While she looked to be about Tilly\u2019s age, her appearance was even more bizarre, if that was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a cute, chubby face covered in long brown hair. Her body type was pear shape, comically exaggerated. Not much fat seemed to grace her upper body, but below her chest line everything was big. A massive belly jutted out just above her hips, like a larger version of Tilly\u2019s distended stomach. This was flanked by thick thighs, huge hips, and immense rear end. She also shared Tilly\u2019s unique fashion sense:  a yellow top was tied off just where her belly began. It was covered in ketchup and other food stains. Her wide lower torso oozed out of red hip hugging jeans. Jeans like these could only be found in the fattest town in America. Lisa had to stifle a laugh. The combination of clothes and body did make this girl look like bruised but nonetheless juicy pear. Lisa wondered how this stranger even managed to sit in her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved a handful of French fries down her throat. Once her hands were free she crumpled the fast food bag she had eaten from in her hands. The pear girl shot Tilly a look that was both friendly and annoying. \u201cOh great, it\u2019s you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowdy, Jumper. Lisa, this is Jumper, and Jumper, this is Lisa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gaped in amazement. \u201cJumper?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper sighed. \u201cYou tell her. I\u2019ve got to stop here to pick up a pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJumper has a hobby that rivals mine,\u201d Tilly explained. She walked over and opened the back door of Jumper\u2019s Volkswagen. The back seat was littered with wrappers, take-out cartons, pizza boxes, bags, and similar trash. \u201cNow pay attention, journalist. This could be important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Jumper yelled. She stomped over from the Pizza Hut she was about to enter. \u201cI didn\u2019t give you permission to touch my car!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLock your doors, then.\u201d Tilly lifted up a garbage can filled with burger wrappers. She spread them out on the lime green roof. \u201cCall this the burger list. We have McDonalds, we have Burger King, we have Wendy\u2019s, Hardee\u2019s, Sonic, Jack in the Box, DQ, A&amp;W, White Castle, Steak \u2018n\u2019 Shake, Checkers, The Original Burger Stand, In-N-Out\u2026\u201d She paused, and then spread out the last wrapper. \u201cYou actually went to Whataburger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper shrugged. \u201cI needed a change of pace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s pencil had almost snapped as she frantically tried to list all the burger joints. \u201cHave you actually eaten from all of those places today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jumper yawned, as if that was nothing unusual. \u201cYou know what clubbing or barhopping is, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do the something similar: restaurant jumping. Hence the nickname \u2018Jumper.\u2019 \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing your trademark jumper, by the way?\u201d Tilly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper grinned wickedly. \u201cI\u2019ll wear that at dinner time, when I <i>really</i> want to show things off. It\u2019s not a true jumper anyways. I just wear a small sweater and a tight skirt.\u201d She slapped her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly reached into the garbage can. \u201cOops! Almost forgot one: Big Boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys still have a Big Boy here?\u201d Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jumper replied. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to make a comeback.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa went back to the original subject. \u201cSo, you actually spend all your time going from one restaurant to another?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much,\u201d Jumper answered. \u201cBreakfast for me lasts from 8 am to 11am. Then I take an hour break. Lunch lasts from noon until 4, then I take another hour break. Dinner lasts from 5 until 10, unless I\u2019m working. It\u2019s nothing but a nonstop marathon of me eating or going somewhere to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa glanced down at Jumper\u2019s figure again. The girl\u2019s enormous lower torso did look like the results from such massive binges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you spend so much time here, why don\u2019t you move in?\u201d Tilly joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do live here! My house is just one block away from the southwest corner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly returned the garbage can to Jumper\u2019s car. She turned back to Lisa. \u201cAs you can see, Jumper here is quite the catch. It is a wonder she\u2019s still single.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper laughed. \u201cYeah! Many a date has failed to keep up with me during a night on the town! Now can we flippin\u2019 go somewhere to eat already? I\u2019m only halfway through lunch and I\u2019m nowhere close to feeling full yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio walked along the sidewalk, passing fast food places in favor of casual sit-down dinning. Lisa gaped a nearby building. \u201cOh my gawd! You actually have a Hooter\u2019s here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot the place to go,\u201d Tilly warned. \u201cThe Hooter\u2019s girls of South Barkalow are selected for a more different taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper mumbled something unintelligible.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A groan from her lower figure agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShall we take her to Fridley\u2019s?\u201d Tilly asked, pretending that Lisa wasn\u2019t there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper shrugged. \u201cWhatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly led the way into an isolated as possible yellow building. \u201cYou\u2019re going to like this, journalist. If they ever get big enough Fridley\u2019s will become the alternative to KFC. Welcome to the spot where you can order chicken 125 different ways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were sat at a booth very quickly. Tilly and Lisa sat on one side: Jumper\u2019s wide frame kept anyone else from sitting by her. A waitress bigger than Tilly but smaller than Jumper came to take their order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just have water, a coffee, tea, and a Sprite,\u201d Tilly said, not even looking at the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress looked at Tilly as if she was some sort of freak, which wasn\u2019t too hard to do. \u201cWe carry Sierra Mist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa glanced at the five page menu, trying to find something small enough for her to finish. \u201cJust the grilled chicken sandwich.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress looked at her as if she was a freak too. Lisa did stand out, being the only skinny person present and ordering the healthiest thing she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper removed her sunglasses. She held up the menu. \u201cSee this box I\u2019m pointing at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa asked Jumper a few questions as they waited for their food. The pear shaped woman grunted out answers that contained the very words possible. Tilly remained silent throughout the conversation. Lisa was growing frustrated. What was so special about this woman, besides her extravagant manner of eating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the food came. Lisa groaned at the size of her sandwich, which was a good four inches thick and covered the whole plate. All the other plates were put in front of Jumper. Fried chicken, chicken legs, chicken wings, baked chicken, teriyaki chicken, chicken strips\u2026 There were so many plates that the waitress had to leave the tray stand at the table. Jumper nonchalantly tucked into her dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gasped at the speed of which Jumper swallowed the dozen different chicken recipes she had ordered. She wondered how a woman could stomach this much food and still have room to eat at several other establishments after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while Jumper\u2019s eating antics were amusing, Lisa still felt frustrated. This whole lunch seemed pointless. There was no way she could finish this massive sandwich before her. And there didn\u2019t seem to be a point for Tilly to introduce her to Jumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe coughed. \u201cTilly, is there a reason why we\u2019re here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for the wait, journalist, but you don\u2019t bother Jumper in the middle of a food run.\u201d She swirled her coffee. \u201cJumper\u2019s habit of eating out like chain mail also helps her part time career. You could say Jumper is the closest thing SB has to a private investigator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper belched. \u201cHush it. You know there are people around who want things to stay hidden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Tilly smiled her creepy smile. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the greatest piece of evidence, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper snorted. \u201cIf you desperately wanted to see that you should have said so sooner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what?\u201d Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper smiled her wicked smile. Lisa felt a little uneasy between the two grins. \u201cLet\u2019s just say it would drive some of the people at power absolutely insane.\u201d She reached into her bag and pulled out\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jumper spread some glossy prints in the space between dishes on the table. Lisa looked at the one thrust into her hand. It showed three men standing at the back alley of a restaurant. One tall guy in a black suit had his back turned away from the camera, but the other two were shaking hands. One looked like the chef of the restaurant. The other man was stout and dressed in a white suit which had the front partially open, showing a swamp of chest hair. The man had greased back black hair, a thin mustache, a golden medallion around his neck, and the biggest most ridiculous dark glasses ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho am I supposed to be looking at?\u201d Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bald chef is just Louie Lasagna,\u201d Jumper said with her mouth full, pointing with a chicken bone. She almost left a grease stain on the photo. \u201cThis guy is Emilio Gluttanos, Columbian smuggler and dealer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs in drug dealer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tell me.\u201d Jumper placed another photo in Lisa\u2019s hands. In this one, Emilio was watching Louie and the tall guy unload crates from the back of a black van. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is in those crates, but I do know what Emilio smuggles around. Typically it\u2019s minor contraband items like illegal cigarettes, bootleg, or rare and endangered plants and animals that he sells to the restaurants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly reached out across the table. \u201cOoo, I like this picture.\u201d The three figures were blocked out by a red, shadowy form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper snatched it out of her hands. \u201cShut-up! So what if in the heat of excitement I dropped my camera into my takeout pasta?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlthough he is a criminal, he doesn\u2019t seem to be that bad,\u201d Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. He maintains the persona of a small time criminal to hide his major trafficking.\u201d Jumper showed them a stack of documents. \u201cThese are building permits for many of the new franchises in the eats. For a man who only lives in South Barkalow two weeks out of the month, Mr. Gluttanos contributes a lot of money to the building of these fine establishments. Because of this, he has been able to set up a system so he can smuggle his big ticket items to through SB to the other parts of the US. He also launders mob money with these area restaurants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe presented another photo in front of them. This was a zoom in of one of the crates sitting by a truck. Although the word on the crate was upside-down it was still easy to read. \u2018Explosivo\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may have already guessed, but that is Portuguese for \u2018Explosives.\u2019 I think it was a crate of hand grenades that he was transporting somewhere. And then we have this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed a vial from her bag and taped out a few crumbs of tan powder onto a napkin. Lisa craned her neck to see. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is but this is the closest Emilio gets to actual drug trafficking. I call it \u2018Emilio\u2019s Fat Powder.\u2019 It\u2019s an unknown seasoning made by traditional mumbo-jumbo means from wherever he gets the stuff that predates all weight gain powder. It\u2019s very potent and highly addictive. One pound of this stuff can lead to a weight gain of tenfold. The higher ups in this town can\u2019t get enough of it. It\u2019s also used in many of the restaurants in \u2018The Eats\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked down at her sandwich with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, this place doesn\u2019t use it\u2026yet. I know all the joints that distribute this stuff. My only question is why he would bring something so valuable into the country and then just scatter it like bread crumbs to the birds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you told any of this to the police?\u201d Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper crumbled up the napkin and then hid it in her pile of chicken bones and other garbage. \u201cThe SBPD is too fat and incompetent to do anything about it,\u201d she snickered. \u201cI just need to get this info out to a third party outside of this town and let them deal with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly elbowed Lisa in the ribs. \u201cI-I\u2019m a reporter,\u201d Lisa stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so. Tilly said that a reporter was coming through town anyways. If you help me with my investigation, I\u2019ll give you the story of your dreams. How about it?\u201d She stuck out a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shook it, then winced when she realized that Jumper\u2019s hand was covered in grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper stood up from the remains from her dinner. \u201cWe\u2019ll, we can start first thing in the morning. Now if you excuse me, I have a hankering for BBQ, Thai, and pasta to fulfill.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa, having finished showering, styled her hair for the day in the bathroom mirror. She glanced down to the page open on her day planner. Monday: Investigation w/ Tilly &amp; Jumper. She had written this down last night. She hoped the pear shaped private investigator would get here soon. Yesterday, the three had split up after lunch: Jumper, to continue her massive restaurant binge; while Tilly went home to \u2018keep up her bloat\u2019 whatever that meant. Lisa had spent the rest of Sunday trying to investigate and interview on her own, but she wasn\u2019t successful. Although she hadn\u2019t to admit it she truly needed the help of her South Barkalow guides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock came from the apartment\u2019s front door. It was Tilly. \u201cRise and shine, sleepy head. Just because this is the fattest town in the world doesn\u2019t mean everyone sleeps \u2018til 11 am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a minute.\u201d Lisa finished her hair and then made sure that she had all of her journalistic gear. She stepped outside<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday Tilly had her hair pulled back into a fire-ball bun, showing evidence that her orange hair was dyed as she sported black roots. Her clothes seemed skimpier than yesterday, but she hid that fact with a large baggy jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the parking lot sat Jumper\u2019s lime green Volkswagen. The owner was leaning against it, trying to scrape gum off of one of her sandals. She was also wearing the exact same clothes as yesterday. Lisa had the disturbing notion that the venus had slept in them. Jumper\u2019s sunglasses glanced in their direction as the two approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing the nice, caring person that I am,\u201d Jumper remarked, as she snorted back some snot dribbling from her nose, \u201cI took the liberty of getting us breakfast.\u201d \u2018Breakfast\u2019 was a lose term in the restaurant jumper\u2019s opinion, as it consisted of two bags stuffed with nothing but breakfast burritos and a jug of orange juice for Tilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloater thanked Jumper for the juice before she settled into the back seat clearing a spot for herself in the junkyard of wrappers and cartons. Lisa winced as she entered the passenger side. The interior of the car and absorbed the stale aroma of meat and grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a noticeable sinking sensation as Jumper sat in the driver\u2019s seat. Ol\u2019 herbie was really too small for her, as her right hip took up part of the passenger seat, leaving Lisa squished between the door and plump skin. Luckily, the old model had its gearshift controls mounted on the steering column. Jumper adjusted the column to make sure that the wheel sat above her lap, and then they were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you drive a car that\u2019s too small for your\u2026physique?\u201d Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask questions you don\u2019t want the answer to.\u201d Amazingly, Jumper had managed to unwrap a burrito with one hand and bite half of it off with one bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she had already gotten them breakfast, for the next three miles Jumper drove through every drive-thru they passed. After twenty minutes of these shenanigans she finally parallel-parked at the end of a block. Lisa was forced to hold all the fast-food bags in her lap while Tilly balanced and guzzled jumbo sized sodas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper placed her sunglasses on her head. She attempted to recline in the cramped interior. \u201cYou, as part of your shotgun riding privileges, get to be secondary lookout and food-pilot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, that\u2019s the funfest job,\u201d Tilly cooed from the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFood-pilot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper nodded, tearing into her last burrito. She had eaten all of the breakfast she was supposed to have shared with Lisa. \u201cI say sandwich, you say which kind. This could be a long stakeout so I wanted to be prepared. And be quick when I ask for the food. I could\u2019ve crammed more in here if I didn\u2019t have to carry you deadweights around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to be looking for?\u201d Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper pointed to the end of the street. \u201cPart of Emilio\u2019s operation uses that brick building on the corner. Given the day of the week, Emilio will probably stop by before he goes to the X place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cX place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother building he uses. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a safe house, hideout, or lair as I\u2019ve never been able to follow him to it, but I think it resides someplace outside of South Barkalow proper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly spoke up from the backseat. \u201cYou know, all those words mean the same thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper threw her wrapper at her. \u201cDuh! They\u2019re all the same because I have no idea what the place is used for.\u201d She licked sauce off of her fingers. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s only a 66% chance he\u2019ll be here today. I\u2019ll give us two hours, maybe two-n-a-half, before I call it quits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t they notice us sitting in here for that long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper rapped the windshield. \u201cDidn\u2019t you notice the tinted windows? It\u2019s the only new thing about this car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, it seems like a long time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObstacle of the trade. I\u2019ve been on longer stakeouts before where it\u2019s just me sitting in the car for hours on end..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No wonder your fat goes right to your hips</i>, Lisa thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bag from Noodles &amp; Co, please,\u201d Jumper demanded. \u201cAnd I do hope you don\u2019t have to go to the bathroom\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty minutes passed like sheer agony for Lisa. The Volkswagen was incredibly stuffy and warm. Surprisingly, Jumper didn\u2019t seem to sweat, until the plumper reached for a fallen french fry and Lisa caught the state of her pits. Tilly was perfectly fine as she killed the time by drinking beverages. All Lisa could do was stare at the building and eat. Jumper didn\u2019t mind Lisa eating some for the fast-food. The journalist ate only from pure boredom. Together, the two added thirty sacks to the wrapper trash heap before something finally happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt a rumbling vibration from Jumper\u2019s flabby thigh before the raspberry blared out like a suppressed foghorn. She held he nose. \u201cGrosss!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper shrugged it off. \u201cSorry. It happens whenever I eat chili.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why did you go and swallow three quarts of it?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I like chili.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGawds, it reeks in here! At least open the window some more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch it\u2026\u201d Jumper trailed off. The sandwich she was holding slipped from her hand as she grabbed the wheel, leaving a fresh stain on her top. \u201cThere he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the street Emilio Gluttanos emerged from the building and crossed to a black GM. After a moment he drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, aren\u2019t we going to follow him?\u201d Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHush it, greenhorn. When trailing someone you leave them at least two blocks on strait ways.\u201d Jumper drove out of the parking spot and accelerated after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmilio liked to drive over the speed limit, as the stuffed Volkswagen had difficulty catching up to him. Three blocks ahead he turned right. Jumper followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they rounded the corner Lisa saw the back of the GM head down another street. \u201cThere he goes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumper turned onto the side street, and then slammed on the brakes. Lisa and several foodstuffs were thrown forward. \u201cWhat was that for?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Volkswagen was already in reverse. \u201cDifferent license plate,\u201d Jumper replied. \u201cEmilio went the other way. I don\u2019t know if that was typical or if he realizes that we\u2019re following him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould he recognize the car?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly?!\u201d Lisa shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I know this is an old car, but I admit that it\u2019s probably the only one of its kind in the area!\u201d Jumper snapped. \u201cTilly, I\u2019m going to drive lateral. Tell me if you see his car on any streets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d The words had just left the girl\u2019s mouth she pointed. \u201cBogey at nine o\u2019clock!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car lurched into a tight turn, causing horns to blare from traffic in the intersection. Jumper muttered something to keep herself focused. They had lost considerable ground as the GM now raced several blocks ahead. By sheer luck they managed to keep it in their sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheese balls,\u201d Jumper swore as the GM made a faraway left turn. \u201cThere are exits to two different highways after that turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow will we know which on he took\u2014\u201d Lisa started before Jumper cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me while I\u2019m busy concentrating!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa was following Tilly up the side of a bluff that sat at the southwest of South Barkalow. At some point in the town\u2019s history, it seemed, the bluff had been covered with nature trails. Because all the citizens were so fat now and didn\u2019t hike at all, the trail had become almost obscured by dilapidated undergrowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Lisa asked, trying to avoid clumps of nettles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t tell you now: that would spoil the surprise.\u201d Tilly reached into her immense book bag and pulled out a 2-liter bottle of Mountain Dew. She chugged some and continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how long have you lived here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeveral years ago, when I was about thirteen, my dad moved us here after my mom died. A friend of his said hundreds of job opportunities were being created here. Naturally, he was a beefy guy when we came here and he quickly got accepted. I was a skinny rail of a girl then, and it was the craziest experience. Everyone in town kept trying to get me to eat something, every minute of every day Even my dad started doing it.\u201d She paused to loosen her belt, which was digging in to her bloated stomach. \u201cLuckily, or ironically, you could say, I was able to make my bloating habit more public since the locals liked it when I drank in large quantities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey paused by some trees. Lisa leaned on one. \u201cHow\u2019s your dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly giggled. \u201cHe\u2019s beefier than ever, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. He manages a contracting company. Just about every month some new house or eatery needs to be built and my dad oversees the projects. Upon my return from college I\u2019ve lived by myself in my own apartment. In fact, it\u2019s the same apartment complex where this investigative reporter recently checked in\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flippin\u2019 \u2013Lisa thought. Of course. She probably snooped around and noticed that I was coming, and then followed me to the diner. Her frustration subsided for a moment when she thought of something. \u201cWho are the builders in a town of obese people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood eyes, journalist.\u201d Tilly took another swig that finished her Mountain Dew bottle. \u201cThat\u2019s where the 2% skinny people of the population comes from. Most of them are builders that the town constantly hires from other places. Just about any physical labor here is done be people of a healthier weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path was getting more and more overgrown, and Lisa was forced to stumble through the dent in the weeds left by Tilly. \u201cAre you the only one that comes up here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m more active and energetic than many of the people here.\u201d She patted her swollen gut. \u201cMost of the time this is just a pouch of air. I\u2019ve gained a few pounds of fat during my life here, when I fill this great stomach of mine with food, but my weight is usually fluctuated by beverages. So yes, I\u2019m probably the only one that comes up this way. This bluff is the perfect place to hide something in a population that would never think of walking this far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiding what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the big question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reached the top of the bluff, where there were fewer trees. Behind them sat the town of South Barkalow, with its population of fatties that would never think of climbing a bluff. Because behind the bluff, under Tilly and Lisa\u2019s feet, stood a large, imposing building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gasped. \u201cIt looks like a\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lisa saw some yellow buses sitting in the meager parking lot. \u201cIs it a school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Institution, if you\u2019re into those kinds of conspiracy theories.\u201d Tilly unscrewed the cap of a 1-gallon water jug and took a long swig. \u201cDid you have a camera with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang-it, I knew I forgot something! It\u2019s sitting in my suitcase at the apartment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are new at this investigative journalism stuff, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Tilly started down the slope. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to come back sometime so you can get pictures. Or you could borrow some of mine\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later they were sneaking behind the utility buildings that housed the Institution\u2019s electricity, gas and water. Tilly paused to look out across the gravel road that separated them from one wall of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there guards or something?\u201d Lisa asked, readjusting her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite guards, but sometimes the Nurses come out to have a smoke.\u201d She strode across to some bushes up against the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNurses?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I call them.\u201d Tilly crouched and hobbled over to a basement window. \u201cThe moment of truth has arrived, journalist. What you are about to see is not for the faint of heart. Viewer digression is advised.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, it can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Tilly smirked. \u201cBut it might answer your question. \u2018Why is everyone in South Barkalow so fat?\u2019 My answer: they start them out young.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gasped as they peered through the window. Through the distorted glass, she could just make out a room filled with desks. Little girls sat in this classroom, but they were not really \u2018little.\u2019 Every girl was a mound of fat that spilled over the sides of their desks. They all wore the same style of jumper, which was a pink and silver uniform that deliberately left their massive, flabby bellies exposed. They all seemed to be eating sandwiches. One lone man, in a white coat, walked up and down the rows over super obese girls, checking their progress with the sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be a Nurse, as I call them,\u201d Tilly whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s always men teaching the girls and women teaching the boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy gosh! Just what are they doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProper Chewing Techniques, I would guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this some school built to make fat children?\u201d Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it?\u201d Tilly winked conspiratorially. \u201cThe \u2018specially gifted\u2019 of South Barkalow\u2019s youth come here as an alternative to grade school. Not everyone makes the cut, though. I had this one girl who was a neighbor of mine. At six she was quite the plumper. Was picked up by the bus that goes to the Institution and continued to do that her whole childhood. There\u2019s a screening process where they determine which kids can handle gaining the most weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t their parents know where their children are going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the top academy here. It\u2019s a privilege to have your children come here. Just don't dress them up and then wonder why their clothes don\u2019t fit when they come back home. But that\u2019s not a worry in the fattest town in the world, right? It\u2019s not like they can make it out for parent teacher night, because they\u2019re too fat.\u201d Lisa had a confused look on her face, so Tilly continued. \u201cThe kids only change into their uniforms when they get here. I think the uniforms are kept so small is to keep track of their progress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProgress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly ignored Lisa as she chugged some more on her gallon of water. She shivered as she capped the rest of it. She patted her bloated belly. \u201cOh, yeah, you\u2019re really hard now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Tilly whispered to herself and her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello! Can we try to focus here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon me.\u201d Tilly got up, rather laboriously. \u201cHaven\u2019t gotten it this hard in ages. Maybe you\u2019re good luck or something, journalist. And to answer your inquiries, they track the children\u2019s progress in order to start them on the experiments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExperiments?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly ignored her again. \u201cDear me, how are we going to get in here?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Make sure no one sees us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa peered around the gravel lot outside of the Institute. Except for a few cars owned by the staff and the utility buildings the area was empty. She quickly shimmied up the ladder until her head it something hard:  Tilly\u2019s boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d She rubbed her head with a few hand. Her glasses had been knocked askew. \u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is going to take longer than expected,\u201d Tilly replied in her characteristic deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up! You\u2019re the one who said this place is top secret and it\u2019s dangerous for us to be here and everything. Move it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry for the delay, journalist. I just usually don\u2019t go around climbing ladders when I am at maximum bloat.\u201d True, the distended belly of the young woman filled the space between the rungs of the ladder. Tilly was forced to lean back her arm\u2019s length away for the ladder so she could actually climb without any obstructions. And don\u2019t forget, combat boots with two inch thick soles were never made for ladder climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the duo made it to the roof. Lisa had spent the whole climb resisting the urge to look up and check Tilly\u2019s progress. If she had looked up, she would\u2019ve seen what was under Tilly\u2019s skirt. However, she wasn\u2019t in the best shape to quickly scale a two story ladder either. She panted as she reached the top. Tilly had passed her time waiting by emptying a can of root beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wanted to slap the can out of her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should wait for yourself to\u2026yah know, settle a bit before you continue drinking? That water balloon gut of yours could get us into more trouble.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m perfectly well aware of the risks. But I\u2019ve snuck into this place loads of times so I know how to stay hidden.\u201d She opened up a panel on the roof which dropped down to a dark metal corridor. Tilly led Lisa down the metal catwalk, soft clangings following their footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is just a service corridor,\u201d Tilly explained. \u201cThey only come up here to check the power lines for the main labs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLab? As in laboratory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. You remember the kids downstairs? This is what they fatten them up for.\u201d They peeked through a large window into another room bellow. A room that was completely different from the one they had seen earlier. A few Nurses stood monitoring a trio of children. A fat blubber ball of a boy was running on a treadmill, covered in wires attached to a heart monitor. Nearby an immense girl of unknown youth sat on an operation table. The obese schoolgirl nearly occupied the whole table with her girth. A nurse was giving her a shot. Right next to her another girl of almost equal size was being measured on a scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa surveyed the eerie scene. \u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly shrugged. \u201cNothing too horrible, they think. First they stuff the donkey with carrots and then bring down the stick. It seems when the students here grow to a certain size they start them on the regimen and test the new drugs on them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stood for a moment as her mind put the puzzle pieces together. Her jaw dropped down in shock as she realized the picture they formed. \u201cYou mean to tell me the reason South Barkalow is so fat is because they test weight loss drugs on the kids?!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly nodded. \u201cHow ironically counter-intuitive. I found this part out by accident. I noticed some of the fattest kids that I had been chronicling suddenly disappeared. They\u2019re actually transferred to the old wing of the school where they become enrolled in the Institute\u2019s Boarding School program. There all of them undergo the same diet and exercise regimen. Each student is relegated to a different experimental drug and their weight loss is closely recorded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what happens to the students after that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDepends. They successful ones return to their family as skinny children but that doesn\u2019t last long in this neighborhood. The students on unsuccessful drugs or those that rebel are sent away quietly. Dumped into foster care or state mental houses or family members if the risk of discovery is low. They have a hat filled with hundreds of excuses as to why parents may never see their children again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gasped. \u201cBut that\u2019s so horrible and it sounds illegal! Don\u2019t the parents notice that their children are missing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a small percentage of children that actually make it this far in the program. Usually the regular students have in-school physicals twice a month. Their weight is also tracked, because they also have test chemicals put into the students\u2019 food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese,\u201d Tilly tapped the window, \u201care deemed the best guinea pigs of the bunch. If my counting is right there are never more than twelve students on the program at one time. A dozen may have one or two sour apples and that is when they are dealt with. Most of the time they students are just back to regular schooling like South Barkalow Elementary. Who\u2019s going to believe a bunch of kids that claim they were \u2018abducted by aliens\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gazed down at the children. The girl being weighed was now undergoing the pinch-caliber test. She winced as the metal tongs griped her flab. \u201cIt\u2019s still a horrible thing to do to children\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but this is only the operation at the elementary school level. There are quite a few more answers as to why South Barkalow is so fat, hiding behind the trees. First, we have to get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Standing on tiptoe, she tried to budge it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly gave her a funny look. \u201cYou do know that is a ceiling tile, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew that.\u201d Lisa, embarrassed, tried to hide her blushing face. Tilly walked over to where the roof panel was and pushed up. It wouldn\u2019t move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigures it decides to stay shut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean we\u2019re stuck in here?!\u201d Lisa yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly motioned her to be quiet, as they were still sneaking around a dangerous place. \u201cHold your horses, journalist. I\u2019ll just give it a few more shoves to make sure\u2014oh dear\u2026\u201d Tilly was frozen in mid-shove, her back arched and squishy middle throbbing. Lisa could swear that her guide\u2019s middle was pulsating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing, I just got the shakes. We won\u2019t be able to leave the way we came, however. Now if you excuse me, I have to pee like it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.\u201d Tilly strode off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Lisa shrieked, before she remembered where she was and dropped to a whisper. \u201cYou can not be serious. I told you something like this would happen if you kept up your guzzling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool your jets, Boeing.\u201d Tilly entered a bathroom down the hall and Lisa followed. \u201cSo it is an occupational hazard of mine. I\u2019ll be done in just a few minutes. Now, are you going to join me or are you going to keep watch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below in a remote security station, a guard lifted his legs from their resting place. \u201cHey George, you want to take a look at this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis superior walked over. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got a spike on Toilet 15 up on the roof access hallway.\u201d He pointed to a flashing light on a screen. \u201cIt measured urinary waste of almost two liters on its last flush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, again? That\u2019s the fifth time this month we\u2019ve had that occurred in one of the toilets. What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed me to send someone up to look at it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa leaned against the door to the hall and peeked again, down the hall a very large woman in a grey uniform came out of a room holding a clip board  and slowly waddled down the hall towards Lisa while reading from her board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up Tilly! There's someone coming down the hall!\" Lisa panicked as Tilly washed her hands<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, journalist girl\" Tilly mocked \"If you're going to make a living as an investigative journalist you're going to get a hold of your nerves, just because there is someone in the Hall doesn't mean they are coming in here. Now let me fill up a couple bottles of water, I need to keep maximum bloat for at least another hour if I want to keep my progress\" Tilly patted her still swollen belly \"One day I'll have this baby so big people with think I have a real baby in here!\" Tilly laughed as she filled her bottles in the sink \"maybe even twins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sighed in frustration, she was really uneasy being here and just wanted to get back to town. \"Fine, grow your stupid swollen gut, I'm going to try to force that hatch again\" Lisa growled pushing past Tilly and climbing back up on the toilet's plumbing and then the stall walls to reach the loosened ceiling tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may not be possible\" Tilly called after her \"it doesn't matter though, I know 50 ways out of here, worst case scenario we'll just have to wait till the institute closes and sneak out when they cl-\" Tilly stopped cold<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa finished climbing into the ceiling and turned to look at Tilly who left her thought unfinished. Lisa's heart stopped as she looked back into the restroom to see Tilly frozen in place as an equally stunned guard woman stood in the door looking back at Tilly as a moment of awkward silence passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey who are you?!\" The woman suddenly demanded of Tilly moving towards her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly dropped her bottle and sprinted for the stall she and Lisa were using as a ladder with the guard in pursuit. Tilly scrambled onto the toilet but her massive gut betrayed her by preventing her from pressing herself against the stall wall enough to kick her way ontop. Lisa  freaked out, to afraid to offer Tilly a hand for fear the guard would see her. Tilly was yanked from the toilet by the large woman with ease using her bulk to weigh Tilly down and counter balance her by easily twice her weight. Tilly looked up through the crack in the tiles at Lisa with hurt eyes  as Lisa still stood by watching Tilly get wrestled to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Guard rolled on top of Tilly and pinned her down as she radioed for back up \"Control, control this is Fitzgerald, we got an intruder up on the roof access hallway in the womans bathroom. Send back up ASAP\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa remained frozen in her perch and watched as Tilly struggled in vein against the woman's size until two more guards showed up both close to the same size as the first. \"She was trying to escape through that tile\" The first guard said and pointed towards the tile Lisa hid above as Tilly was bound by cable ties and hauled out by one of the extra guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa almost screamed when she saw the smaller of the two guard reluctantly take on the task of climbing onto the toilet to check the ceiling for anyone else.  As the Guard's head poked up through the tile just barely enough to see Lisa has already clamored down the cat walk far enough into the dark shadows to avoid being seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\" The Guard said coming down off the toilet breathing heavily \"I don't think she was trying to smuggle any of the kids out, or at least she must not have gotten to any yet\" He gasped needing to sit down on the toilet to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa crawled through the ceiling as quickly as she could her mind racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I going to go?\"<br>\r\n\"How am I going to get out?\"<br>\r\n\"What will happen to Tilly?\"<br>\r\n\"What will happen to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was on the verge of crying, she was way in over her head. Till now she had been getting by from Tilly's bravery and bravado in the face of danger, now without it she felt so vunerable. What's more her source of courage was pulled kicking and screaming out of the room by a guard, this crushed any hope she had of finding a backbone seeing how much good Tilly's nerves of steel had done her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa bit her lip and pounded her hand on the catwalk \"Damnit Tilly! This is all your fault! Why did you bring me here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked around, in anycase her only way out may rest in Tilly's hands.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa had no choice she had to keep up with Tilly and bust her loose. Lisa leaned over the catwalk and removed a ceiling tile and looked down into the space below. She was above the hall and at the far end she could see Tilly being drug on her heels by the guard around the corner. Tilly's body looked limp and she didn't seem to be putting up any resistance anymore. Along side the two a large woman in a lab coat followed the escort with an empty needle in her hand, presumably the reason Tilly was now so docile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was in luck, A staff of overweight workers and test subjects most of which were as wide as they were tall meant stairs were a waste of space and elevators would strain if they were over used or moved to many people at once. To this end the building had been designed to keep most of the labs for child testing on the bottom floor with most of the research labs on the second and basic utility's housed roof access floor. In order to move personnel about the building's design has somewhat of a screw design where the building slowly wrapped around a central point in order to reach the second floor with a minimal effort. This meant Lisa could remain in the ceiling along the sloping hall as she moved down to the second floor following Tilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rushing along the cat walk for a short burst to catch up Lisa mustered her courage and peered down into the floor below once more. To her dismay there was no one to be seen in the hall. Returning to the cat walk Lisa looked around her at the various ceiling tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must be in one of these rooms...\" Lisa thought<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa balanced herself on a support beam and crawled out above the tiles on one side of the cat walk. Lisa leaned to one side and looked in, Nothing more than an empty Lab. Lisa hauled herself back up on the beam and leaned over the other side and lifted a tile to look in the room next door. Inside a young girl of no more than 10 was sitting on a table nearly pinned by her own weight. No more than maybe 4 feet tall she was easily tipping the 200 pound mark. A large man in a lab coat was standing over her making notes on a pad as she drank from a tube with a thick yellow liquid. Periodically the man would pull the tube from the girls mouth causing her to momentarily whine and beg for it back before returning to her eerie zombie like state, once the girl had calmed down the man would offer he an eye dropper of liquid to taste then present her with the tube from before along side a new tube filled with the liquid she tasted. Each time the girl would look them both over before passing up the new tube in favor of her previous one and return to her content state of sucking on the liquid as the man scribbled down more notes. Lisa was a little unsettled by the liquid's resembling color to that of fat cells but didn't have time to wonder, she had to find Tilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa slid back onto the beam and crawled back to the catwalk and moved out to the support beam on the other side. Lisa crept along the beam and looked into another room. In here she could see a boy and a girl both close to the same size but not quite as fat as the girl in the previous lab. The two were eating from a metal tray covered with various fattening goodies such as fudge or pastries aside a tray cover ins healthy fruits, both were practicaly inhaling the sweets despite the fact that each time they went for another the metal table they sat one would deliver a mild shock. Eventually the two emptied the tray and a man in a lab coat came to swap it for a new one, as they waited the girl dared to try one of the fruits and was surprised to find she received no shock for trying one the boy joined in and tried one as well. The man in the lab coat returned with a new tray of sweets. The two looked at the two trays considering which to eat. The girl picked up a fruit and looked at it, the boy picked up a sweet and also considered it but was given a mild shock for touching the tray of sweets. The two sat thinking for another minuet before both made their choice, the boy ate his sweet and the girl dropped her fruit and started taking food from the sweets tray despite the shocks, meanwhile the men in lab coats wrote down a storm of notes regarding the situation. Lisa shook her head in disappointment and got back onto the beam and looked into the room on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was relived to see Tilly sitting in the room but deeply worried by her condition. Tilly's eyes were half shut and stared into the distance, her head slowly swayed from side to side as two men stood over her asking her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked one sternly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'm.... showing that... Woman around....\" Tilly replied in a far off detached tone to drugged up to think for herself, all she could do was answer their questions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woman? That reporter? Are you saying that reporter is here?!\" The second man asked sounding agitated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeeeessss...\" Tilly slowly told them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does everyone know about me already?!\" Lisa yelled inside her head upset she barely got here and was already so well known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about you??\" The men went back to questioning \"Our records show you live in town! Are you trying to help her bring us down?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....\" Tilly explained plainly \"She... was curious... I was just showing her... this place...I... don't care... what she does....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so...\" The second man started in before holding up Tilly's hand bag full of liquids  \"So what's all this then? Are they part of some plan to ruin all our tests? Why are you carrying this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... those are for me.... I drink to bloat.... I enjoy swelling up with the fluids....\" Tilly answered in a dreamy voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloat...? You can't be lying... show me...\" The man ordered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMethodically Tilly leaned forward and took the bag taking a 2 liter bottle of grape soda and began to suck it down in one long chug. The men watched in shocked awe as she took a second bottle out of ginger ale and repeated the process her belly swelling out giving her the look of having a chubby pot belly. Tilly placed the bottles on the floor and began to remove a third jug of root beer but the man stopped her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok we get it, don't pop yourself...\" He told her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought hard, how was she going to get her out now? \"They know about me... they know she knows about them enough to bring me here... they'll never let her go now... and they'll be looking for me... even if I return to town they may come looking for me...\" Lisa shut her eyes and tried her hardest to come up with a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the room below the two men left Tilly alone to enter as second room with ah one way mirror observing the first. Inside a middle aged man of considerable size sat in a scooter watching Tilly. The guards approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do sir? She knows about us, we can't let her go.\" The first guard stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we test the psychoactive drugs on her Dr. Wemble? If the preliminary tests are right we could theoretically brain wash her to do whatever we want, maybe even have her bring the reporter to us. Possibly even make her join the rest of the town, she is one of the few lone hold outs when it comes to the average weight after all...\" Suggested a third man in a green lab coat standing beside the larger middle aged man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be rash Dr. Gregs\" Dr. Wemble said in a heavy breath \"We must be careful if we do, if she changes to much the reporter could notice, maybe even towns folk who know her, I want you to be very careful and take it slow with her. In the mean time her \"bloating\" is very interesting... I want to run a few tests on her full limits. If her stomach can hold that much there's no telling how hungry she must feel when empty, I imagine she remains at least partly full at al times to avoid the full impact of hunger pangs. Let her empty out... I think we found the perfect test subject for the hunger augmentation drugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you want to see if we can make her ignore all hunger despite having a stomach capable of holding many times the normal amount before getting full sir?\" Dr. Gregs assumed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Dr. Wemble said \"I want to use the appetite boosters first\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sir?\" Dr. Gregs asked surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to drive her hunger to the extreme, feed her well so she gets as big a sweet tooth as you can while on the appetite stimulants, then we'll switch to the hunger augmentation drug B-35, I want to see if it's strong enough to make her stop abruptly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the first room Lisa was looking down at Tilly in a panic, She was alone, did she dare drop down and grab Tilly to make a run for it?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa rapped the support beam lightly with her fist in dire need of a plan of action. Tilly was her only friend in this town, as far as she was concerned anyone over 120 pounds could be in on this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tilly.. what would you do...\" Lisa sighed softly looking down at the tipsy girl rubbing her gut as it finished swelling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa look to the door the guards left through, no way the mirror beside it was for looks, they had to be behind it. Lisa could jump down and just grab Tilly and run, no way they'd be able to keep up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they'd just radio everyone on the first floor and order the doors and windows locked\" Lisa surmised \"then they'll use me for experiments to... probably end up just some fat slob only concerned with food...\" Lisa started to sob<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door below swung open startling Lisa, Tilly barely took notice. A very large man bound in a motorized scooter emerged. He had long grey hair handing down from the sides of his head running down his back with a bald spot on the top of his head. He examined Tilly more closely from only a few feet away through his oval frameless glasses seated atop a pair of puffy cheeks. The Man lifted a heavy arm up and pulled down on his small grey goatee as he pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll do just fine\" He said at last \"Give her the first does of the Theaortazine, that will dull her thought processes and more or less turn her mind to mush, she'll be obedient until the treat me is finished which at her age should only require two or three treatments. By this time tomorrow she should be ready for her new ideals, I'll meet with you tomorrow before we begin to hammer out what we'll make her into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn her in to?!\" Lisa flipped \"What are they going to do to her?? Are they going to fatten her up or does that mean something else?!?\" Lisa's mind screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Dr. Wemble\" A younger doctor in a Light green lab coat replied \"I'll go get the vile for two treatments and we'll see what that does\" The man commented before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large doctor began to wheel himself to the door and snapped his finger at the two men who had been questioning Tilly who followed the large man out leaving the room empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this my chance...?\" Lisa wondered \"Everyone left.. this could be my only chance to get her out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa slid the tile open more to make room to lower herself in. Lisa began to shift her weight over the beam when the door reopened. Lisa quickly hopped back onto the beam and looked down. The two men from the questioning had returned pushing a large tank on a cart with a long hose coming out of it. One of the men picked up the hose and brought it to Tilly's mouth and smiled wickedly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're gonna see just how much you really bloat honey\" The chuckled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok....\" Tilly blankly said and opened her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She makes it to easy...\" The man sighed and placed the hose in her mouth and secured the strap, turning her flipped a switch and the tank began to pump the contents into her mouth as she chugged down the fluid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"30 gallons of our finest\" the second guard chimed in moving towards Tilly and lifting her shirt to rub her swollen gut and make grinned \"Oh yeah baby this stuff is concentrated enough to make you one fine fat lady, you'll be a bombshell in no time.\" The guard drools as his inappropriate contact moved to stroking her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa recoiled disgusted at the sight. The was no way she could save her now, and even if she might have a shot it sickened her to think these guys would do that to her if she was caught. She tried to lean back down to replace the tile, she knew if either man looked back toward the door they would see the opening. As Lisa moved the tile back however bits of the spongy material flaked off and drifted to the room below. Lisa's heart stopped when the flakes landed on the shoulder of on of the guard and he curiously looked at them then began to look up towards the ceiling. Lisa bolted along the bean and lept onto the catwalk practicaly slamming her head into the low handing ceiling of the maintenance path she ran along. Lisa didn't look back sure the men had seen her and would be after her any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the room however the guard was beginning to wonder if the tile had always been askew when the young Dr. Gregs re-entered the room and broke his train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello doctor\" He smiled trying to distract the doctor long enough for his partner to replace Tilly's shirt and remove his hand from her inner thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"doctor if I may be so bold this girl is very pretty\" The Guard next to Tilly began trying to make this sound as entertaining as possible \"We will have full control over her once we give her this drug.... what if.... what if when she is ready for reprogramming we were to make her... somewhat more... friendly... you know what I mean?\" The guard asked with a broad smile as his partner closer to Dr. Gregs just smiled weakly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor shut his eyes and took a deep breath letting it out as a long sigh before giving the guards a stern look. \"If I understand you correctly you are suggesting we turn this girl into some sort of company slut for you to play with am I correct?\" He asked glaring at the guards<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um... not maybe in that way... you see...\" The guard stammered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then...\" The doctor began slowly \"I think I'll be relieving you two of this post and having a female guard take charge of this young woman...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" The guard began<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\" He nearly shouted pointing at the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard rushed from the room followed by his partner who was somewhat embarrassed by his partner's suggestion, however he still couldn't shake the feeling that tile looked different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor just shook his head and approached Tilly who still had a blank expression on her face as she sucked mindlessly on the tube. The doctor leaned down and injected the drug into her arm and stood back up to watch her face. Tilly's gaze softened as the last few scraps of humanity in her eyes slowly faded away. Tilly's feeding began to slow until her head feel limply forward as she slumped over, she appeared to be falling asleep but she was still very much awake. The doctor pulled a knob on the chair and leaned it back so Tilly could relax more comfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Continue eating\" He ordered and Tilly began a slow more mechanical feeding cycle on the tube. \"Faster\" He spoke again \"Eat until you're to full to eat anymore and then you may take a nap\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly gave no response but just started to pick up her pace. The doctor shut her eyes to prevent them from drying out incase she forgot how to blink as the drug ran it's course. He hooked her up to some equipment to monitor her for signs of any medical distress and dimmed the lights as he left to find a guard to watch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Lisa hurried for the hatch again, her only hope lay in forcing it open again. Far behind her the two guards climbed up to the catwalk and stopped to catch their breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good *pant* idea\" one of the guards said through labored breath \"We'll be able *pant* to watch that girl *pant* fatten up...*wheeze*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Jack! geez you have a one track mind you know that?\" The other guard scolded \"I'm sure someone was messing with that tile above the lab...\"</span></div></div>",

This is the article she sent back to her editor..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving Large in South Barkalow<br>\r\nby Lisa Boytise, Staff Reporter<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it comes to this town, there's certainly a lot to love! I myself was rather skeptical - as a weight conscious woman, even visiting a town with a 98% obesity rate seemed risky. But after just a short stay here, I quickly learned why the town's population just keeps on growing with both newcomers and extra pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat up, hon, you're looking better every day!\" Sally, a wide waitress at the local diner The Regular greets a gaining customer. Everyone here is super-friendly, brought together by the superb food served up nearly everywhere - it's hard to imagine how any city can keep its residents well-fed without bringing to the table as many fine eateries as South Barkalow does! Even a short walk will tempt you with pastries, burgers, pasta, even exotic fare such as Indian food and seaweed ice cream! To be out and about here is to be reminded of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile my slim frame initially got many strange reactions from the locals, which I first took as disapproval, I was relieved to find out that they were, in fact, concerned for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially on a newcomer - it seems like a cry for help to us,\" says Bubba \"Blubber\" Boysie, city councilman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all that changed once I first bit into some of the local fare. The Regular's Fill'er Special was so good, I wished my stomach was super-sized just so I could finish it all and have a dessert! Even though I was stuffed, I couldn't help but nibble on some of it as I waddled back to my hotel room. The number of eateries isn't just for show - they all compete to put out only the best food for the ravenous population, meaning only the highest qualitiy and most generous restaurants stay in business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our caring community is what makes us an ideal location for families - especially large ones,\" declares Blubber, before discussing plans for new housing, daycare, schools, and of course, eateries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I became about twice my original weight after I had my first child,\" says stay-at-home mom Debbie Doubledecker as she bakes some cakes as after-school snacks for her three daughters. \"And I wasn't skinny to start. But after my husband got transferred here, I realized nobody cared as long as I was happy! So we just went ahead and finally had the big, happy family we always wanted! I'm thrilled that I can give my little girls the joyful, well-fed childhood I never had, growing up in some fatphobic town. In fact, though I never thought I'd say this, I'm proud that the reason I've gotten even bigger lately is because I'm expecting twins any day now,\" she proudly pats her considerable mother's belly. Though her body looks like that of any other local large lady, her motherly glow is obvious, and lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the children of the town are given the best education in the state. \"90% of high school graduates get into top-level universities, and lemme tell you - they don't even have to worry about the freshman 15 when they've already gained it here!\" jokes portly principal Guy Lovehandle. \"We've even attracted some of the biggest names in education for our top school, South Barkalow Academy, where only the most gifted students attend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no friends at my old school,\" says 5th grader August Bukkit. \"But since I came here, I've made lots of friends, I'm getting good grades, and I'm trying out for the junior sumo team next year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been about a week now, and I don't know if it's the five or six pumpkin pies in my stomach talking, but this town has grown on me as I've grown in it. So there you have it. I have no more stomach for the scrawny life. I'm going to start living to the fullest and fattest in the fastest growing town in the USA!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa got a lot of work writing columns for the town's paper, Chewin' The Fat. Though it was mostly propaganda about how wonderful it was to live in such a tubby town, she was paid very well and her work was so popular she soon became one of the town's minor celebrities. Her salary, the hypnosis, and the free food from the grateful citizens quickly allowed her to become even larger than most townspeople. Her fame, combined with her size, made her one of the most eligible bachelorettes in the city! And after she was married, she continued to write even as married life and having several large children grew her body even more, and her gain shows no signs of stopping yet. Not surprisingly, the article sparked a huge interest in the town, and the population seemed to double overnight. Though there were a few people here and there who felt that something was wrong with this place... too good to be true, really. But most ignored that as paranoia. The few who decided to give in to curiosity found that they actually loved living in that town. In fact, more than ever before!</span></div></div>",

Remember, Dr. Gregs, we wanted to test this charming young lady\u2019s stomach capacity that had resulted from her \u2018bloating\u2019 activities. This intruder\u2026\u201d The doctor rotated his cart until he faced Lisa, \u201cappears to have a similar build to our first subject. By viewing this subject\u2019s response to the same treatment, we can better understand the unique traits possessed by our \u2018bloating beauty\u2019 over there. Prepare the chemicals, Dr. Gregs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d Both doctors left the room but the younger doctor returned a minute later. He wheeled in a device similar to the one Tilly was attached to. Picking up a green vial, he inserted a syringe into it. Lisa winced as he held it up to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScared?\u201d the man chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll start you on the gallon treatment first then.\u201d He held back Lisa\u2019s head so it couldn\u2019t move and applied a tube into her mouth. Lisa wanted to gag at the taste of the goopy substance that flowed down her throat. Once he made sure the restraints were secure, Dr Gregs picked up the syringe again. He was just about to insert the needle into Lisa\u2019s skin when\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoctor!\u201d A red-faced thick woman dressed like a teacher slammed into the door frame. She was puffing heavily. \u201cIt\u2019s *huff* Stacy\u2026 she *huff* escaped again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat rouge girl that we removed from the program? She\u2019s only six years old and weighs 130 pounds, how could she possibly escape?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe *huff* ventilation grill in her *huff* room was removed. She must have *huff* through it\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll probably get stuck. Still, alert the security. I want to see exactly how she was able to remove the grill in her room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was left in relative silence. Tilly was unresponsive in the chair next to her. The only sounds were the pumps at work, filling the pair with the disgusting liquid. Lisa would have groaned but she might choke on the infernal stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she heard the dull thud. It sounded metallic but muted, as if someone had dropped a cymbal out in the hallway. Lisa strained her head to see. Then there was a sharp creaking noise right by her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lisa\u2019s utter amazement a girl was wriggling her way out of the confinement of a ventilation shaft. Was this that escapee, Stacy, they had mentioned earlier? The young girl did appear to be 130 pounds as she struggled to budge her way through the grate, inch by inch. Finally the girl popped out with a splurch noise, the air finally making its way back through the vent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa tried to talk with her eyes. <i>Please, untie us! Can you be a good girl and untie us? We have to get out of here!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe escapee, Stacy, seemed to understand Lisa\u2019s silent pleas. The girl waddled over and unbuckled the strap restraining Lisa\u2019s hand. Lisa pulled the tube off of her and together the two unclasped all of the ties. Lisa rushed over to Tilly\u2019s side and freed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTilly? Tilly? Wake up, we need to get out of here!\u201d The bloated girl was still unconscious. Lisa turned back to Stacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy had a blond pony tail and strawberry pink skin. The six year old was doing the strangest thing. She had both of the pump tubes in her mouth and was sucking on the fattening juice with contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle girl? Stacy? You\u2019ve got to stop doing that. If you keep drinking that they\u2019ll come back and capture you.\u201d Lisa tugged at the youngster but the blubber belly remained routed right where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa risked a glance out to the hallway. Nobody was coming. She lifted Tilly up out of the chair. The woman wasn\u2019t too heavy but she was waterlogged like a walrus. Lisa grunted as she shuffled over to the pumps. After a hysteric foray of button pushing she managed to turn off the machines. This got Stacy\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStacy,\u201d Lisa said, trying to keep her voice calm. \u201cThe bad people are going to be back soon. We have to get away from here. Do you know a hiding spot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis registered with the tubby youth. She waddled out of the room like a penguin on steroids. Lisa draggled Tilly and the bloater\u2019s book bag after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maintenance hallway ended with a dead end. A variety of chutes aligned the wall. Laundry, Garbage, Waste Water\u2026Stacy squirmed into the Waste Water chute. Soon only her feet stuck out of the chute door. For a moment Lisa thought the portly female was stuck but then she slowly slide down, due to the slime that had built up in the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa frowned at the chute. It didn\u2019t seem like a reliable means of escape. She could hear the quiet slush sound as Stacy slid down at tortoise pace. If a 130-pound six year old could fit through it, it darn well better manage two adult women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting a minute to allow Stacy to travel enough distance, Lisa struggled to stuff Tilly into the chute. The bloated twenty year old also filled up the cavity with her swelled gut but she slide down just faster than Stacy. Last, and truly the \u2018least\u2019 of the trio, Lisa climbed into the cute and slid into the darkness...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa sat at the entrance to a cave, watching the sun set. She must have walked five miles dragging Tilly along before Stacy, the obese youngster, had stopped at the entrance to a shallow cave. She had instinctively led them to that spot. Had the young girl been here before? It was hard to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly stirred, emerging from her sleep. Lisa crawled over to where she had laid the unconscious woman. \u201cTilly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot any maple syrup?\u201d The orange haired girl whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? No!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about some ice tea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa rummaged through Tilly\u2019s bag of drinks. She handed a bottle of Brisk to her tired friend. \u201cFigures you would need something like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilly quaffed the tea as if she had survived through a drought. After a minute she spoke. \u201cSo, what did I miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got captured by that security guard and the school\u2019s doctors were going to run tests on you because you\u2019re a bloater. Then I get caught and we would have shared the same fate if this little girl hadn\u2019t shown up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle girl?\u201d Tilly asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess none of the students at the institution are \u2018little,\u2019 but we were rescued by their resident 130-pound-six-year-old-escape-artist.\u201d Lisa pointed to where Stacy sat a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area around the cave was littered with apple trees. Stacy had spent the past few hours eating all the apples she could reach. A sizable pile of cores sat beside her. She ate an entire apple in seconds before chucking it to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t said a single word this whole time,\u201d Lisa explained. \u201cAll she has done is eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you blame her?\u201d Tilly groaned, rising to a sitting position. \u201cThey\u2019ve conditioned her to stuff her face as much as she wants, hence why she tips the scales at 130. She\u2019s probably experiencing mixed goals of eating and escaping. All this running around has made her hungry and apples are not the most filling things in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy finished the last of her apples although Lisa was sure that the tot still wasn\u2019t satisfied. She waddled over and sat next to them, viewing them as protective figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do with her?\u201d Lisa asked. \u201cDo you think that the Institute will try to look for her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. If this girl has a previous track record of being mute they might just forget about her. If they had wanted to find her, they would have presumed that she could only walk a few miles and they would have found us by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squishy, queasy sound like the rumble of the train tracks erupted from Stacy\u2019s exposed stomach. The kid hopped up and down on her rear in a fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey do condition them well,\u201d Tilly commented, rising. She unscrewed the lid from one of her liters of soda and passed it to the chubby girl. She sucked on it like a newborn pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA girl after my own heart,\u201d Tilly mused. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to hide her. It would also be a good idea if we lay low for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere can we go?\u201d Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBest and worst case scenario we hide up in my apartment, though I am going to need more food if we bring this blubber munchkin in to live with us.

Noticing that the woman was still waiting, Lisa looked back down at the menu, flipping though the pages. \"I'm not sure,\" she stammered, trying to pick an item that didn't look like a heart attack on a platter. \"There's a lot of food here, and I have no idea what's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress's expression softened slightly, and then broke into a large, meaty smile. \"Aw, that's fine,\" she cooed. \"I'll tell you the best of what we have, but I'll need to know your tastes first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled. The woman was nice, and trying to do her best with a new customer, Lisa realized. \"I don't mean to sound pretentious, but I'd like something small-ish to just nibble on,\" Lisa said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can certainly do that!\" The waitress exclaimed, bringing her pad of paper out quickly, her fat arms slightly flapping. \"Would you like breakfast, lunch, or dessert?\"</span></div></div>",

Lisa shrugged, examining the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the place was fat. Scratch that, Lisa thought, everyone in the place was massive. Although some were nibbling on food, and others were shoving it in their faces, crumbs flying, not a single person didn't have food in front of them. Patron after patron was covered in pudge, or double chins, or just a thick, soft layer of skin. Lisa was almost disgusted, but was careful not to let it show. The idea was to keep a low profile, not to seem like a judgmental and obvious observer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the return of the waitress, who sat a large mug in front of Lisa, the ceramic announcing it's self with a loud 'plunk!' on the table, liquid sloshing over the top. Lisa looked up, startled, hoping her cover wasn't blown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, sorry to scare you cutie pie,\" the waitress said, her cheeks widening as she grinned. \"Just bringing you a beverage.\" With that, she waddled away once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa peered into the mug, seeing a dark, creamy substance bubble inside. The container just by it's self was massive, a gallon at least. \"These people aren't a story,\" she muttered to herself. \"They just don't know when enough is enough...\"</span></div></div>",

She lowered the drink briefly to take a breath, then tilted the mug again, gulping furiously. 'This tastes sooo good,' she though, oblivious to the black stains working their way into her top, 'the perfect drink after a long trip...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my...it seems skinny found something that she likes!\" A soft voice made Lisa's eyes snap open, she she peered over the mug to see the obese waitress standing by the booth, holding a tray.

'I drank it all?' she thought, flustered. 'There was practically a gallon of chocolate in there...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress leaned over, and slapped another item down, this time a large chocolate cake. Not a slice, but a whole cake, almost 5 hands high and dripping in a gooey topping. \"You look like a girl that likes her chocolate,\" the waitress giggled, her blubber quaking. \"I figured you would LOVE this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa frowned. She came in here for a scoop on a story, not to stuff her face. Quickly, she changed her expression. \"My, I do love chocolate,\" she said, gazing into the fleshy face of the waitress. \"Do you have some time? Maybe we can talk about the different menu items?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress smiled. \"Of course hun, just let me get you a refill on your drink.\" She reached over and picked up Lisa's empty mug, setting it on her tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No way I'm drinking another one of those,' Lisa thought, and opened her mouth to protest. She would have said something, a pressure had built its self up in her stomach, and stopped her words as she let out a loud and deep 'BUUUURRRRP!\" that seemed to last forever, her mouth pulled wide with the sound. Lisa's hands slapped over her mouth quickly, now the most embarrassed she had ever felt, as the waitress waddled away, slightly chuckling.</span></div></div>",

'The drink didn't take this long the first time...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout really thinking about it Lisa's fingers drifting toward the huge cake on the table, and she dipped two fingers into the gooey brownie frosting.

Where a couple of minutes ago there was a desert that could have fed a small wedding, there was now only about a piece worth about 3 slices. Both of her hands were covered in cake, her utensils lying on a napkin, untouched. Lisa looked up dazed, her mouth covered with the brownie frosting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at the waitress, confused, and burped again, this time a little softer. \"I brought you a straw this time so you wouldn't ruin your pretty blouse anymore, but I guess it doesn't matter now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Lisa said, a little bit of cake falling from her mouth. Looking down, she saw that there were many stains now, dotting her shirt from top to bottom. Looking back up she tried to smile, feeling frazzled. \"Sorry,\" she said, apologetically. \"I guess I made a pig of myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress giggled. \"Aw, don't worry about that hun. I do that daily!\" She sat another drink on the table, the gallon sloshing over the brim, adding to the mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her huge bulk in the opposite booth, the waitress sat and met Lisa's eyes. \"I'm Gina, by the way, but everyone calls me Cookie.

She couldn't believe how good it tasted, how easy and delicious it was to drink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa suddenly noticed that Cookie's eyebrows were raised up, waiting. Lisa had been concentrating on the drink, and had forgotten her question, focusing on the taste and the flavor engulfing her tongue. She quickly gulped down a couple of more mouthfuls, and tore the straw from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...why do they call you Cookie?\" Lisa asked, mentally gasping at what a lame question it was. Her left hand edged at the cake, and she began to feed the remainder of what was left into her mouth as the obese woman answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The town is big on nicknames,\" Cookie said, watching Lisa alternate between shoveling cake into her mouth and sip at the massive jug. \"When I first came here, all I really ate was cookies; cookies for breakfast, cookies for snacks, cookies for dinner. Not just one kind, but lots,\" The woman explained. \"If you stay here long enough, you'll pick up a nickname too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled through chocolate-covered teeth. \"I doubt I'll be staying that long, Cookie,\" She said through a full mouth. \"I'm only going to be in town a short while...\" Her words trailed off as she slipped the straw back into her mouth, gulping hungrily at the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, well that's a cryin' shame, girl. We'd be happy to have you.\" Cookie stood, placing her big, fat hands on the table for support. \"Now I have other customers to get to, but it's been a nice chat. And don't worry about the bill...first meal is free!\" With that, Cookie waddled back off to the kitchen, her thunder thighs rubbing together as she moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa frowned. 'Well, that was a wasted interview,' she thought, sipping slowly on her straw.

There wasn't a single bookstore, toy store, or any other store that would fit in on a nice, normal town's main street. There were only candy stores, ice cream parlors, restaurants, and various clothing stores with the names, \"Big and Beautiful,\" or \"Fat stylin'\" tacked on the facades. Obese children waddled around being looked after by equally fat parents, fat cats lounged on widow sills, and couples walked hand in portly hand, eating whole pizzas or massive sandwiches. In any other town Lisa's huge stains on her blouse would seem odd, but here it was almost a fashion statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa saw an ice cream trucked parked by the sidewalk, the driver's massive bulked leaning against the hood. He was licking at the largest ice cream cone she had ever seen; a waffle cone as big as a purse topped by 3 softball-sized scoops. 'What a pig,' she thought, slightly disgusted a how a grown man could indulge in such a huge meal of sugar. She then blushed, remembering the wedding cake and two gallons of chocolate she just had shoved down her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a big ice cream cone,\" She remarked, trying to strike up a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled, the cream dribbling down his chin, and again down his second chin. \"You're not from around here, huh?\" He asked happily.</span></div></div>",

'I need to get to the hotel...it's getting late,' She though, eating another twinkie. The sun was setting, and the streets were mostly empty now. The residents must be home, or eating somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate the twinkies as she walked, trying to work out her thoughts in a cohesive manner, but finding it hard with the wonderful taste each one gave her. \"These are soooo good,\" She muttered, slowly emptying the bag. She burped again, not noticing, and placed yet another treat into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the hotel, Lisa stood outside, eating the last twinkie thoughtfully. 'Tomorrow I'll really start,\" she thought, chewing. 'At least I know the lay of the land now; I'll be able to make my way around a lot quicker. I'll get breakfast, then start on my story.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrumpling up the greasy paper bag, Lisa huffed, tired from the walk. She threw it in the garbage can outside the hotel, practically filled to the brim already with other food wrappers. 'That's another thing I'll consider,' She thought, licking the grease from her palms. 'This town must generate a ton of waste in packaging with all the food these people eat. That will fit into the story nicely'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step toward the hotel and grimaced as her belt bit into her tummy. \"Ouch,\" she squealed, her hands reaching down to the buckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belt was tight, too tight, constricting the edge of her pants, giving her pains. She ran her finger over the top, and suddenly noticed a tiny roll of pudge pushing over the top. Lisa stood there, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never had pudge in her life. Always staying fit, Lisa was a varsity cheerleader in high school, and went on to be a semi-track star in college. She stood there, pinching the roll with two fingers, trying to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fat,\" she rationalized out loud. \"No, it's not fat. I've just had a lot to eat today, I'm stressed, and my tummy just kind of expanded.\" She sighed. \"It'll go away tomorrow, it's not fat, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loosened her belt a notch, and made her way into the hotel.</span></div></div>",

It was a smear of food; a mix of chili, potatoes, gravy, fried chicken and ice cream. She had pulled her jeans off in the middle of the night, and her body was beginning to show the result of all the food from the previous day. Her stomach was no longer toned and flat, but had sagged down into a pudgy roll around her panties. Her thighs were wide and spread around the bone loosely. Slim ankles had disappeared turning into cankles; her thigh meeting her foot broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround her armpits was a roll of fat, pushing up around the bra strap. Her arms were thicker and soft, splayed out on the bed. Even her face looked a little chubby; her cheeks bigger and soft, jiggling slightly as she breathed. She didn't quite have a double chin, but there was a bit of chub on the top part of her neck, showing the signs of being a blossoming into another chin soon. She was snoring, loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud knock at the door awoke her, and Lisa sat up slowly, her larger breasts pushing against the edge of her bra. Slightly dazed, she looked around the room. \"Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room service!\" Came a voice from outside, knocking again. \"You're breakfast is here Miss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Food bits were all over, and the tv was still on. Plates laid on the floor, staining the carpet, evidence of her late-night binge. The knock came again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast! Come on, do you want this or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's stomach rumbled at the thought of breakfast and her eyes darted wildly around the room. She couldn't open the door in here underwear. \"Um, wait a minute please!\" She yelled, looking for something to wear. Cookie still had all her bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned over and picked up her pants, not noticing how her belly sagged down as she bent. Picking up her pants she felt the grease on them, and saw stain after stain on the thighs. She grimaced and threw them in the corner with her ruined blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just going to leave it outside then Miss!\" The voice yelled again through the door, and Lisa began frantically opening drawers, trying to find something, anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said just wait!\" She yelled hoarsely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran over to the room's closet, her butt jiggling behind her, little pocket marks of cellulite beginning to show on the backs of her thighs. Tearing the door open she yanked out an oversized robe and pulled in on, the blue fabric hanging loosely on her. It was meant for someone much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm ready!\" She yelled, reaching for the doorknob. Her fingers grabbed the handle, and even they were a little pudgey, no longer slim and elegant. </span></div></div>",

The bellhop had left a cart though, the top covered by a large, silver buffet dome. She looked up and down the empty hallway, and pulled the cart inside carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down in front of the tv with the cart in a reinforced chair, more proof of how fat most people were in the town. Pulling the dome off the plate, she stared in awe at what the hotel had provided for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large stack of pancakes, smothered in butter and topped with mounds of whip cream sagged to one side of the plate. 10 pieces of bacon sat by 5 large sausages, edged by biscuts covered in gravy. Another stack of strawberry and chocolate chip waffles were piled on the other side of the plate, covered in whip cream as well. A large bowl of maple syrup sat on the second level of the cart, steaming slightly. Lisa smiled, breathing in the scent of the fresh food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dipped a small, stubby finger into the whip cream of the pancakes, and sank it into her mouth. \"Mmmm,\" she grinned, enjoying the sweetness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning suddenly, she remember Cookie's note. \"I need my bags,\" she muttered, staring at the food. Her bags had her clothes, notes, cell phone, laptop...everything she would need to start her story. \"I only have 6 days left...\"</span></div></div>",

It was still on from the previous night, but no longer showed images of desserts, instead it showed pictures of breakfast dishes; many like the one in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl has to eat,\" she said, smiling. She placed some sausage and bacon in the middle of a pancake, then rolled it up like a burrito. Dipping in in the syrup, she started to eat her breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing quickly that the bacon and sausage wouldn't last just one pancake at a time, Lisa started using two for the burritos, drenching the space between the two pancake with the hot syrup first. There was a lot of syrup and it tasted fantastic, so she figured she could use it excessively. It dripped onto the plate as she ate, only pulling the food away occasionally to burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took only ten minutes for Lisa to finish the food, shoving one last waffle in her mouth whole, dripping with syrup and butter. She burped again, very loudly, and giggled. \"God that was goooood,\" She moaned, slumping in her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSluggish standing up, Lisa adjusted her robe, realizing that she'd have to wear that to meet Cookie. Walking towards the door, she suddenly turned back around, noticing the half-full bowl of syrup still left over. \"It'd be a shame to waste, I guess...\" She said, then reached back and grabbed the bowl, sticking it in her mouth and gulping the rest down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmacking her lips, satisfied, Lisa turned off the TV and left the hotel room barefoot, in her robe.</span></div></div>",

Her cheeks were bigger, softer, and jiggling slightly as she walked. The small bit of skin under her neck had grown plump, and Lisa now had a slight double chin that pressed up around her first chin. The robe ended mid-calf, showing her thick legs. In the back of her mind she registered her thighs jiggling, and her belly hanging over the top of her panties, but still didn't notice. In fact her panties were tight, too tight, and under the robe her large, soft butt was jiggling, stretching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally made it to the 'Big and Beautiful' store where Cookie had said to meet, and stopped outside, out of breath.

She wore a halter top that rode up on her belly, showing at least 3 rolls of fat pooling over the top of her skirt. She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Chrissy, I own the shop,\" She said, reaching out with a stubby hand to shake Lisa's. \"And the little snag is that our stuck-up, good for nothing model isn't showing for our photoshoot!\" She waved her hands in frustration. \"Now I have no one to picture, and my advertising scheme will be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled, disgruntled. \"I'm sorry, that's a shame.\" She said. 'A shame that it's a crappy story,' she thought.

Genius!\" She exclaimed, very proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCookie had stopped fiddling with the camera, and had her eyes locked on Lisa. The skinny little woman that had come into her diner yesterday had changed, gotten more plump, and that was obvious just by looking at her face. Cookie smiled, gazing at the girl's small double chin, fat cheeks, and large calfs peeking from under her robe. Lisa had been 120 pounds yesterday, today she easily looked around 180. She had an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could always take pictures of you, Lisa,\" Cookie said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked up sharply, diverting her gaze from Chrissy. \"Me?!\" She said, surprised. \"Cookie, I don't think I'm at all what-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrissy cut her off, waving her hands in dismissal. \"Nonsense girl!\" She said. \"Cookie's right, we have to work with it, you're very pretty, and we don't have anyone to shoot but you!

She noticed it now; the effect of eating massive amounts of the town's fatty food; how much she had changed in just a short and tasty 24 hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks were full and plump, pushing out and up around her eyes. Below that was a small double chin, accentuating a thick neck. Lower, a pair of chubby shoulders pushed up around tight bra straps, her breasts straining and jiggling in her b-cup bra. Her meaty arms hung at her sides, ending in a pair of small pudgy hands with tiny stubby fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach had grown from a roll to a sag, and it dropped around the waistband of her panties, stretch marks showing on her belly. Her thighs were thick, soft, and wiggling, touching in the middle. She turned and looked at her butt, noticing the sag of fat on her back, and how her plump and pillowly bottom pushed her panties out, sagging as well. Cellulite showed on her thighs, moving down further to thick jiggling calfs, ending in tiny, fat, feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm fat.\" Lisa whispered. </span></div></div>",

I don't have all day for you to stand there admiring yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt incredibly insecure and odd. Dazed, she let the small woman help her out of her underwear, which was quickly replaced by a pair of plus size woman's  lingerie, which fit perfectly. Lisa had gone from a b-cup to a c-cup, and the underwear felt comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day started moving quickly. Lisa would wear a new item from Chrissy's shop, then strike different poses as she ate food to help capture a certain look and create a certain scene. Cookie took many pictures, encouraging Lisa to finish the different dishes. In one scene, Lisa wore a pink baby-doll dress as she ate nachos at a beach like setting in the hot sun, trying her best to look sexy with her stubby fingers feeding cheese-drenched chips seductively in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another series, Lisa wore tight jean pants as she ate different cheeseburgers, trying to look like a girl having fun on a date. Her legs were thick and the jeans were tight around them, the halter top she wore showing her rolls of chub under her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she was eating pancakes in pajamas, portraying a fun loving girl having a midnight gorge at a sleepover. The top slightly unbuttoned to show her sagging belly, the capri sweat pants showing off her fat ankles, her butt making the backs of them swell and jiggle as she struck poses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another, and another. She ate ribs in a labor day outfit, she nibbled on cake in an office-style pantsuit to celebrate a co-workers birthday. She straddled a chair as she stuffed herself with ice cream in an outfit for yardwork. She ate fried chicken in skirts, cheesecake in dresses, cherry pie in jeans, pizza in lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the middle Lisa started enjoying the food again, and was eager to change into a different outfit just so she could feed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the photoshoot was over. Lisa sat on the floor in a black cocktail dress with a red bow for a belt, her chubby legs in front of her, fat feet stuffed into tiny pink heels. She ate chicken wings, looking at where rolls of fat were bunching up around her waist, sitting on an ass that felt like a pillow. Sucking the sauce off a stubby finger, her double chin jiggled as she ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCookie pulled the camera off the tripod, and smiled down at her friend. \"I think we're done for the day, kiddo,\" She giggled. By the looks of Lisa, she was easily over 200 pounds now, but to Cookie, Lisa was still the most beautiful girl in the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to my diner to get your bags, we can get lunch while we're there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She marched around the studio looking for cookie and answers to her gain but she was no where to be found. A note was on the front desk <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hope picking an outfit and getting dressed wasn't to much of a hassle, you were taking a while in the dressing room and I didn't want to disturb you so I left for the dinner, you can keep all the outfits too.

In this case, we were selling to a private collector, but usually we have deals with magazines and specialty sites that pay a lot more, and do I mean a lot more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt her mind whirl into action. More money than reporting? She enjoyed reporting, yes, but what if she got a job working for this town's newspaper on the side? She could still report and be a model, so what was the big deal? She could multitask, and she could certainly enjoy this added bonus of a job! She had had more fun modeling than she had in years! She had just been herself, unleashed the true Lisa within her, and now she wished to unleash this new plumped up woman as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another question is does it matter how big I am?\" Lisa asked, tensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no. In some circles, it doesn't matter, while others request models of a certain size. The only problem is we're running short of models. We really need to get more around, and our snotty last model was one of the last good ones we had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did she leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, who knows? I think it was an ego thing,\" Cookie replied, shrugging, \"I think she felt entitled to being payed $300,000 per shoot, which is illogical!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Additionally, you won't exactly have a shoot every day. You'll have a lot of time off,\" Chrissy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So would I be able to get a career as, say, a reporter, for the town newspaper and also be your model?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in, but I have one question I just thought of, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you don't have a lot of models left.

Why not use people in town?\" Cookie asked, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they wanted to model, they would've done it by now, you know?\" Chrissy replied. It was a good reason.

Perhaps they were secure in their position, or something to that effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how would you attract a new model?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen: our next photoshot asks us to have multiple girls, some in semi-explicit positions for artistic nudity.

We recruit them, and they come to model here. That sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I don't know. What do you think, Lisa?

She looked down at her stomach and saw that it was stretched to the limit and was overflowing her clothes. It started to go underneath the table and she looked at James with the eyes that longed for attention.<br>\r\n\u201cMy stomach is starting to hurt. Do you think you could rub it?\u201d she asked with a sexy smile.<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d he said, beginning to get aroused. He started to rub Lisa\u2019s belly, when he decided that it was time to tell Lisa the truth. \u201cHey, can I tell you something kind of personal?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d Lisa said, cherishing the belly rub and happy to find out that James was opening up to her and that her stomach was felling less full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell. I have a certain\u2026 very interesting\u2026 condition,\u201d he started, \u201cWhenever I eat any amount of food\u2026 my\u2026 thing makes itself more skin to grow bigger and longer\u2026\u201d He looked at her, confident that she would be fine with this, and still rubbed Lisa\u2019s stomach. She looked at him, awe in her eyes as she whispered in his ear, smiling, \u201cAll I\u2019ve wanted my entire life was a man whose manhood could grow to unimaginable sizes.\u201d He looked up at her, surprised but very relieved. He smiled, a deep love in his eyes. \u201cDo you want to finish that cake?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah\u2026\u201d Lisa said as she felt something long and hard in between her legs. She closed her eyes and started to smile and giggle as her pleasure senses went into overdrive. She began to shovel the chocolate cake into her mouth and felt her stomach began to grow bigger and rounder. But this time it didn\u2019t hurt to feel full, it actually started to make her laugh with pleasure. James called the big waitress over to their table and asked to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will you have?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have the biggest meal you have here, and could you please triple the size of it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I can do that,\u201d she said, writing down notes on her pad.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d the waitress asked, looking at Lisa who had chocolate stains on her face but didn\u2019t care at all.<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 I\u2019ll have triple whatever heee\u2019s having,\u201d She giggled, looking seductively at James. She felt the skin in between her legs grow harder and longer. She laughed.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, wait, triple my order size, and then double it again.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNO, wait, double the order <i>again</i>.\u201d James said quickly after the waitress wrote that down.<br>\r\nLisa looked at James, a challenging smile on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cJust bring out as much food as possible for one free night!\u201d they both said in unison.<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d the waitress said after she finished writing down the notes on her pad, \u201cthe food should be served to you shortly.\u201d She left the table to give the order to the many fat chefs in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoooo\u2026\u201d Lisa said, looking deeply into James\u2019 eyes. They looked at each other for a second, admiring each other, then they began kissing very passionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*30 minutes later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food comes\u2026</span></div></div>",

How much harm could eating one burger do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 15 minutes later, Cookie parked her car in front of Burger Blasters. Lisa got out of the car with Cookie and looked the place over. The place was obviously a restaurant. The building had a huge model of a burger on the roof with a neon sign under it that said Burger Blasters. Lisa also saw another sign that read, Ask About The Belly Buster Challenge. Judging by the large number of cars parked around the restaurant the place must be very popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Lisa!\" Cookie called out from near the door to the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stopped examining the outside of the building and ran to catch up with Cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Lisa stepped inside her nose was assailed with the strong smell of cooked hamburger meat. Lisa took a few moments to look around her as the two of them waited to be shown to a table. The place was full of overweight people greedily stuffing their faces with a variety of burgers. The scene reminded Lisa of an old memory from 13 years ago. She was visiting her grandfather on his farm and she had helped him feed his pigs. What was going on in this restaurant looked very similar to watching pigs eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, my name is Steve. Can I help you?\" A Waiter asked as he came up to Lisa and Cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was overweight like everyone else and his shirt barely covered even half of his bulging gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Cookie replied before she gestured at Lisa and said, \"My friend and I want to try the Belly Buster Challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Steve smiled before he turned and shouted loud enough for the people in the restaurant to hear, \"We have two Challengers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa blushed a little as the people in the restaurant let out a loud cheer before they went back to eating their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me please.\" Steve said before he led Lisa and Cookie to an empty table, \"The rules are simple. If you manage to finish your Belly Buster Burger your meal is free and we will put your picture up on our Hall of Fame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked where he gestured and saw a wall lined with pictures. Each picture was of an overweight person's face with ketchup and mustard smeared around their mouth. Beneath each picture was a small plaque with the person's name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your burgers will be ready in a few minutes.\" Steve said before he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa spent the next few minutes idly chatting with Cookie about the town until a large plate was set on the table in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, enjoy.\" Steve said before he walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at what was on the plate with shock. On top of the plate was the biggest burger she had ever seen. The burger was almost a foot in diameter and nearly six inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are suppose to split this burger right?\" Lisa asked Cookie hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" Cookie chuckled, \"The waiter is bringing mine right now. That one is all yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Steve returned a moment later and set down another huge burger in front of Cookie. Cookie licked her lips and started to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gulped nervously as she looked down at her own burger. Lisa had a sudden mental picture of herself, fat and obese gobbling down burgers like the other customers in the restaurant. The idea sends a shiver of fear down her spine.</span></div></div>",

She stuffed a handful of fries past her lips and washed them down with a swing of drink. Eating like a queen, that was how Cookie put it. She gazed over to see Cookie smiling at her through mayonnaise-smeared lips. She grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa leaned back in her chair, letting the slight pressure building in her middle have more room. She pushed down the waistband of her outfit, and crammed another rough mouthful in. After this, I'll stop, she told herself. I'll just put this last burger into my belly, and then, diets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing great, Miss, keep it up!\" Steve walked by, patting her middle as he refilled both ladies' drinks. She just nodded, too engrossed in her meal to wonder why she was getting such encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't think you could keep up with me, to be honest,\" laughed Cookie, finishing off the last of her fries. There were several big bites of burger left on her side. \"But now it looks like a little inspiration is just what your stomach needed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm inspired to be a piggy,\" Lisa joked, cramming the last of her burger into her mouth. Her lips barely closed and she realized she couldn't chew without a great deal of difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, not without me,\" gasped Cookie, copying Lisa's technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everyone, we got a couple of contenders, here!\" Steve shouted out, quieting everyone in the place.

She felt her final morsel grow softer in her mouth. She gulped it all down, feeling it hit her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two big winners, everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place went wild. Cookie swept Lisa up in her thick, squishy arms. She smiled like a proud parent. Lisa smiled like she didn't know where she was. Then there was a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shook her head, thinking back to all those portraits on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe must've taken hers. She suddenly realized it felt like she had swallowed a bowling ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, anything else you ladies want is on me,\" winked a handsome male customer who sported a gut that Lisa could have rested one of Cookie's milkshakes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what just happened?\" she whispered to Cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it, hon!\" She gushed, clapping Lisa's shoulder again. \"We're famous now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...

After the the two girls gave each other a friendly hug and Cookie gave a quick glance back at Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops where are my manners, Rachel this is my new friend Lisa.\" Cookie said. \"She's from out of town and she's working to become a plus size model at Big and beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please to meet you and I'm kind of jealous that your modeling over there.\" Rachel said while shaking Lisa's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too, by the way do you work at Pizza Heaven?\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I've been a waitress her for about six years and its been a lot of fun.\" Rachel stated.\"By the way you two wouldn't by chance come here to take on the the glutton's challenge are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it Rachel.\" Cookie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, come on in.\" Rachel said happily. Then the three entered the building, it looked similar to burger blasters with a bunch of overweight and obese people hanging around and eating except the smell in the air was pizza and not burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everyone we got two challengers right here.\" Rachel yelled. Then everyone was looking at Lisa and cookie then a round of cheering was fallowed. \"Why don't you two grab a seat over there the pizza will be here in a little bit.\" Then Lisa and Cookie went to the empty table like they were told and were waiting for their pizza to arrive.</span></div></div>",

This was getting ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCookie's house was on the outskirts of town.

People tend not to notice things when theyre being glutted all hours of the day, you didn't notice how big you were until you looked in the mirror right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat down on another smaller chair. Noting she was taking up more than she should. She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCookie nodded. Grunting and getting up again she headed for the kitchen. \"Well theyre you go. We fed everyone so much so often with barely a moments pause that they don't have time to notice how huge theyre getting. And by the time they do theyre to big and in love with the towns food to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took that all in, while her nose began to twitch as smells began emanating from the kitchen \"I take it thats why the towns tourism is thriving. Your trying to make everyone who visits a resident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Cookie said without hesitation. The wonderful smells in the kitchen began to intensify. \"More than 10 percent of our annual visitors never leave town. Not a lot it might seem but it's a number we can handle without the town suffering from a rapid population rise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't explain why people can't stop eating the food. I mean I've been stuffed like a turkey since I got here but I still want more!? Is theyre a chemical in the food, the water?! Or is this thing air born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCookie gave a hearty laugh. Sending her massive form giggling. \"Nothing like that. It's just that near everyone in town is about as good as a michelin star chef. You'll never find a bigger collection of 5 star chefs anywhere else in the world. It's practically a mandatory thing for everyone in town who cooks. Making stuff so good that people won't even notice how big it's making them, while making sure that it goes straight to our thighs, and stomachs and bingo wings so we don't have to stop cause were full.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCookie came back out wheeling a cart. It was stacked with baked goods of every desription, scones, cakes, doughnuts and pies of all desriptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I mean?! I bought these from one of my favourite bakerys yesterday, the pastry chef Pierre who owns it is a genius. A day old and it's like they were just made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had to agree with that. The smells of fruit scented icing and chocolate were overpowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't eat this, I can't eat this, I can't eat this.' She repeated in her head even as she reached for a white white chocolate filled doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCookie chuckled at her freind while digging into a pie as wide as her shoulders. \"Go on, eat. You can't resist anymore than I could when I first came here.\" She licked the tin and reached for a doughnut. \"You don't have to worry about people making fun of you,  you can eat as much as you'd like without restraint, guys round here all like girls with meat on their bones and you'll make way more than you did reporting. Besides if your gonna be 'my' room mate you won't exactly have an easy time resisiting all the treats I keep here at all times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stared at her huge freind, happily gulping down cake and cookies without a care or what it did for her waistline. She couldn't really become like that. No! Reporting wasn't just a job, it was her dream job. She wasn't going to rop it for better money and the ability to indulge endlessly with no worrys about social stigma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even notice that she was on her third filled cake and reaching for a fourth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lacking any clothing except what she was wearing, she simply removed her jeans and prepared to work out in her panties and shirt.  She wriggled her jeans over her bigger bottom, they finally fell to the floor, and she kicked them aside.  She looked down and noticed that her thighs touched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\"  She said to herself, and went to the mirror.  She took off her shirt to survey the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body she had maintained so faithfully over the years was gone.  Her cheeks were chunky, her jawline had softened.  Her arms and torso had accumulated a layer of soft fat.  Her breasts had really pumped up, evidenced by her squished cleavage, side boob, and under boob.  Her belly bulged over her panty line, and her rounder butt hung beneath.  Her thighs did touch, and her calves had filled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I look like Beth...\"  She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth was her younger sister.  Beth had always been more relaxed than Lisa, and it showed in their figures.  While Lisa was the classic Type A control freak, Beth was laid back and indulgent.  A day of indiscretion had leveled the playing field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I have boobs now.\"  Sighed Lisa.  She had always thought that the tendency for the women in her family to be very large-busted had passed her over.  It turns out that she had just been starving them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where to begin?\"  Lisa wondered as she pinched her belly fat.  \"Some crunches are probably the place to start.\"</span></div></div>",

A fat blonde anchorwoman was saying, \"Now we'll head out to the food fair, where Jason is busy sampling the goodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Claire.\"  The morbidly obese young man said.  \"There's plenty for everyone here, and I'm going to spend the next hour showing you each and every booth.  Every delicious burger, every decadent dessert, every...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa clicked the remote.  The next channel was a group of fat men in suits arguing with one another.  It looked like a political forum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm saying is that it's better with caramel sauce.\"  One said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be out of your mind.\"  Another replied.  \"Drowning it in thick, gooey chocolate sauce makes it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa clicked again.

Didn't these people think about anything else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next channel had a picture of a cake, but a song played in the background, and it was one that Lisa liked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid on the floor facing the television.  The channel seemed to be nothing but pictures of food being displayed and then fading to show another.  She tried to focus on the music as she bent her knees and prepared for the first crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cheeseburger appeared in the screen.  It looked like the one in her room.  She bent forward at the waist, but not to do a crunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the best-looking burger I've ever seen.\"  She thought.  \"So juicy, with that dripping cheese and that thick bacon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore pictures of food appeared and disappeared.  Creamy mashed potatoes with gravy, crispy egg rolls, on and on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus, Lisa!\"  She thought as she sat forward on the couch.  She had cheese, ketchup, and gravy on her chest, and the food that had been on the table was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"  She said, putting her hand on her distended belly.  Unclear as to when her workout plans had gone astray, she decided that sleep was probably the best option.

He replaced them with plate after plate of food and pitchers of liquid from the top two levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy, Miss!\"  He said, exiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa didn't reply because she was still taking in the display in front of her.  There were plates stacked high with eggs, bacon, sausage, a stack of pancakes, donuts, pastries, and potatoes.  There were pitchers of milk, chocolate milk, and pancake syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\"  Lisa said.  \"Surely they don't expect someone to eat all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa remembered that she was going to meet with Cookie, and that she needed to get ready.  A chocolate croissant on the pastry dish beckoned as a potential breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just grab this, and then I'll get ready to go.\"  She thought as she picked it up.  The croissant was flaky and light with a buttery flavor.  The chocolate was as smooth as silk and melted in her mouth, swirling together with the pastry, resulting in sheer taste perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could anything taste so good?\"  She contemplated.  \"Could any of the rest of this food taste as good as this?  Those pancakes with butter and syrup, that bacon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the meal was gone, leaving Lisa slumped back on the couch, wondering again where it had all gone.  With a loud belch, it became clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cookie!\"  She thought.  She had to buddy up with her to find out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and went to the bathroom.  Her robe had bits of egg, syrup, and pastry crumbs on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I've been such a pig!\"  She thought as she washed her face.  She took off her robe to change back into yesterday's clothing, and caught a glance of herself in the mirror.  She stopped to take a better look, because she couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe no longer thought she looked like her sister.  Beth was a little plump, with big knockers.  Lisa was fat.  With enormous knockers.  She had a double chin.  Her bra straps dug into a fleshy back, and Lisa had no idea how the bra was surviving, because the B cup brassiere was attempting to contain bloated breasts that couldn't have been smaller than M cups.  The side boob now squished against her soft arms, and the underboobs perched atop a smooth, round belly that hung over panties that now looked like a thong, wedged between her round butt cheeks.  Her thighs no longer simply touched, they forced each other apart with their girth.  Lisa estimated that she weighed 240 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is impossible!\"  She thought with panic.  \"How could I get so fat, so fast?  I've got to get some answers, and Cookie is the only real lead I have.  I've got to meet up with her.  Now, to get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up her jeans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe these will still fit...\"  She thought hopefully.  They started to get tight around her calves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These will stretch some.\"  She grunted as she slid them up her legs.  They really began to hang up as her knees expanded upward to her thighs.  She began to jump up and down in an attempt to pull them higher.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\"  She pleaded as she bounced and jiggled.  Her bust bounded wildly, and suddenly the miracle bra busted with a pop at the back clasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa realized that the jeans were a lost cause.  It took some effort, but she was able to work them off.  She tried in vain to resecure her bra, but it had no hope of containing her boobs, and if it had, Lisa never could have stretched it around her chest.  She realized at this point that none of her current clothes would fit, even if she had them, but she needed to meet with Cookie, so she put on her bathrobe and the slippers in the room and headed out to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can keep any of it you like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was good news for Lisa, who had no functional clothing at this point, and so she gladly put on the frilly set.  The bra was a push up, although Lisa could only wonder why.  Any bra would have given her deep cleavage in her current state; no enhancement was needed.  The panties sat at the base of her round, stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had the same reaction to her reflection in lingerie that she had regarding her makeup: overall, she wasn't happy with what she saw, but the clothing made her look as good as could be expected, kind of cute even, for a fat chick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a vision.\"  Cookie said sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are.\"  Brenda echoed.  \"I can't wait to see you in action.

She delicately took a bite, looking in the direction of the camera.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, why did everything taste so good in this place?!\"  She thought as she focused on the rich dark chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\"  Brenda exclaimed.  \"That's it for this set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Set?\"  Lisa asked.  \"We just got started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are just getting started, but we're going to change things up a little.\"  Brenda said.  \"Back to the dressing room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa lay prone on the chaise, face just above her massive breasts.  She sat up and looked around.  The candies were gone, the Sno Balls were gone, the only evidence if their existence being a few tiny bits of chocolate and scattered pink-dyed coconut littering the set.  What had happened here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brenda?\"  Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"  She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see some of those photos?\"  Lisa queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"  Brenda said.  \"They're beautiful!  Have a look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa watched as Brenda clicked through the images.  Here was photographic evidence of her gluttony.  She had eaten every chocolate and every Sno Ball.  What's more, she looked as though she had enjoyed it, posing flirtatiously for the camera in a variety of poses while she ate.</span></div></div>",

She approached the chocolate city like a fat, busty Godzilla set to destroy it.

That oughta teach him a lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike, this is Lisa,\" his girlfriend replied, gesturing to the reporter. \"She's doing research on the town and I said I'd show her around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has your family been here long?\" asked Lisa, scribbling down notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, since the place was first settled.\" His massive stomach gave an audible growl. \"Hey, listen, I don't mind answering some questions, but if I don't get some grub after all that tossing, I'm going to faint dead away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't want that,\" smirked Flash, something akin to excitement on her tiny face. \"Burger Factory is right next door, Lisa. We could go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa blinked. What an odd name for a restaurant. \"Sure, we could do that.\" She merely wanted to know what was behind this odd town.</span></div></div>",

Apparently the establishment was a big favourite of his. \"I should bulk up for that zine photo shoot, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager's own narrow face flushed red. \"Some of the others, girls mostly for good reason, want to start a zine on the hottest things in town. Hottest restaurants, hottest clubs... And hottest boys,\" she muttered, eying Mike warningly. \"Personally, I don't see why I should have to share him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe merely smiled at her jealousy. \"You know yours is the only camera lens I pose for. Come on, Lisa, was it? You'll love this place. It's great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge building was right next door to the school, and it looked more like a warehouse than a restaurant, being stark and metallic. Once they entered, however, the interior was more like a typical place like TGIF, despite the fact that all the chairs and booths looked massive and were crammed with people, mostly young people, who were many times the size of normal restaurant patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also something else; like a modern informal Japanese sushi restaurant, there was a broad conveyor belt encircling the restaurant, passing all the seats. Instead of delicate sushi, however, there were multi-pattied burgers, hot dogs smothered in cheese and chili, calzones that must have been several pounds each, and steak sandwiches and greasy fries dripping with gravy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why they call it the burger factory,\" put in Flash as she pulled out her debit card to pay for the three of them. \"My treat, I just got paid for my last project. It's cheap, anyway, and all you can eat. They save a ton of money by buying food in such great bulk. \" They went to seat themselves, Mike nearly drooling at the sight of food. \"Every once in a while a plain salad comes around, and it's not like anyone else here takes them, so I can usually get an okay dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when we come here, it's all about me,\" smiled her boyfriend, sliding into a booth that was plenty wide even for him, waving at some people he obviously knew. He grabbed the first three burgers that passed him, setting in ravenously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's also a soda and milkshake fountain at every table,\" Flash continued, taking one of the huge glasses and filling it up with a thick chocolate milkshake, pushing it towards Michael. \"Luckily, no one likes plain water so it's always full for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\" was all Lisa could come up with as she tentatively snagged a massive steak sandwich to at least eat something. Mike was already halfway into his second burger. Another thing very unique to this town, apparently...</span></div></div>",

Music was playing dimly in the background, and based on the numerous nodding heads it was a popular tune in the town. The place was reasonably full with mostly young people, high school or university students, all of them what a normal person would consider massively obese. Besides the tiny Flash, Lisa was sure she was the lightest person in the building. \"They sure know how to draw the crowds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darla Smithson-Travis-Andrews-Reynolds,\" Mona parroted off with a slight chuckle. \"Or, for short, Darla Star. I think she married her three husbands just to get that name, you know. She owns quite a few spots in town; the Burger Factory, Wide Wheel Pizza, Club XXXL, and Close East sportswear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa raised an eyebrow. \"Sportswear? In this town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Specifically sumo gear,\" mumbled Mike through the thick calzone he was nearly finished. It was his second, having practically inhaled the burgers. \"She sponsors the high school's sumo team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His new team jacket is still being made, he grew out of the last one.\" Here the girl giggled slightly, filling up a fourth milkshake for her gorging beau and selecting two triple-patty bacon burgers for him to dive into once the calzone was devoured. \"Like I said, she's had three husbands over the ten years she's been in town. All younger than her, she's got to be around forty-five now. First one was a buff guy that she had when she came here, I guess he left her after she 'settled in' to the town's standards. Second one lost a bunch of weight so she kicked him to the curb and he left town. The third... Well, supposedly they're still married, but no one's actually seen him in a long time... Of course, this is all things I've heard, I'm a fairly newcomer to the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been here all my life,\" put in the sumo hurriedly, gulping down more milkshake. \"I've heard the same.\" His large stomach was expanding further with the onslaught of greasy food, pushing his once loose t-shirt out and making it fit tighter and tighter with each massive bite. He showed no signs of slowing down, however, and downed four thick milkshakes in a row before setting in ravenously on the food once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash watched all this adoringly, reaching over to rub his swelling middle lovingly. \"Eat up, you've got the championships coming soon and more schools than ever are competing this year.\" Glancing at the reporter, she continued with \"With the growing obesity numbers everywhere in the country, sumo's becoming more and more popular. And Mike here has to work extra hard to keep his reputation! I saw how hard you were hitting the weights, you at least need to gain back all those lost calories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding eagerly, the young man increased his pace, his girlfriend handing him fresh food and refilling his glasses as needed, leaving his hands entirely free to cart food from plate to mouth, a trip they made frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe there's another person to try and interview,\" mused Lisa. And perhaps someone who was involved with a sumo team. Was it a professional sport here? And Flash had mentioned a club, what was the nightlife? There was so much she had to learn about this town, but on the bright side she had struck a journalism goldmine!</span></div></div>",

You mentioned you were born here...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, South Barkalow General Hospital,\" he nodded, actually taking a break from eating to answer her. He was polite in that way, even if he was practically drooling to get back to his feasting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are children here born bigger than usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, I was only seven pounds when I was born, my little sister, she's seven now, she was about the same. But...! Flash has done some research, this information is usually blocked from the town, there doesn't seem to be any more than the usual pregnancy difficulties even though obesity is supposed to be bad on pregnancies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScribbling this down, Lisa paused. \"What do you mean by blocked information?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There mayor's office controls the media,\" sighed Mona, all of a sudden looking very downcast, not her chipper self. Mike patted her shoulder before she continued. \"They decide which magazines and books come through. A lot of them are heavily edited to only put thin people in the roles of villains. Same with TV shows, and national news doesn't come in. The Internet in the town is loaded with proxies, it's the same stuff China uses, it blocks out a lot and people don't even realize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around her, the girl lowered her voice. \"Look... I do like this town, but... Weird stuff goes on, and it gets overwhelming. There's a group of people, I can't introduce you for an interview, sorry, but we can get around stuff, but it doesn't really do much good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try watching some television later,\" suggested Mike with a heavy shrug. \"Flash tells me a lot of popular TV shows have actually been reshot with obese actors and rebroadcast here. She thinks they shoot here in town. And an awful lot of original programing does come out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the bright side, there is a great indie movie scene,\" Flash added. \"And I've got to admit, 'Fat Friends' does cut all most of the corny jokes out of 'Friends'. ' Big as a House MD' sucks, though; the patient's diagnosis is always that they need to gain more weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get her started on CSI: Chubby Science Investigators,\" warned her boyfriend. \"... 'Wading Pool Watch' is great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, yeah, the actors are sexy,\" she was forced to admit, noticing Lisa's stunned look. \"See what I mean? It's like a big fat conspiracy, no offense meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken,\" Mike acknowledged, scarfing down some nachos before continuing. \"But parenting magazines and shows encourage parents to feed their kids as much as they'll eat. Elementary and middle schools promote it, we're fed there three times a day and we got detention if we didn't eat it all. I mean, I like my size, but it's not really fair to people like Flash who would get really sick if she gained weight, or people who just don't want to be fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was nothing short of stunned! She had known the town was largely self-contained, but she had no idea it was to this extent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She couldn't help but look over her shoulder - this talk had made her paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, there's too much to relate at one time... but we'll have to be careful. Us skinny people are already looked on with suspicion,\" said Flash, lifting another burger to Mike's mouth. The pair waved goodbye as Lisa made her exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis can't be real, she thought to herself. Though the couple did seem quite sincere, it was all so hard to believe... maybe some television would help her sort this out. It must be an exaggeration, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sought out the comfort of her hotel room... well, it wasn't all that comforting, really. She got suspicious, knowing looks from the obese desk clerk and the other staff milling about, and her room, though luxurious, was a reminder of how much she stood out - a person as big and hungry as Mike would fit right in perfectly here, since everything was larger, wider, and there was even an extra-big fridge for snacks and drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt like there were judging eyes on her all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is silly,\" she sighed. \"It's just a hotel room for larger people. I've heard about these things, it's nothing I couldn't find in any town with a lot of tourists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the bed, taking deep breaths. She kicked off her shoes and laid back, propping herself up to watch the big-screen TV. She felt a little better already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waggled the remote in front of her face and hit the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a news show. \"Rachael Fatcow\". A very large, lesbian-looking woman who was actually quite pretty, was delivering the news. She had the sensibility of a comedienne, though, and smirked her way through a few stories about how things weren't as great in other places as they were in South Barkalow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was so stunned she forgot to copy down some notes. It was almost never that you saw a large person on television, and even more rare if their weight hardly came up at all (though, of course, Ms. Fatcow commented on the weight of others).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa just jotted down a few things she noticed. It was all too bizarre to try and get the sheer shock across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few commercials came up. One was for the Burger Factory, showing a whole group of teens about Mike's size, chowing down and having fun. There were funny moments of them bumping bellies and making funny faces before they stuffed enormous burgers into their mouths. There was a plus-sized women's clothing store that... well, made it clear it was meant for a strictly adult clientele. And one commercial selling men's deodorant spray. It smelled like bacon and was supposed to attract the most obese of women to the wearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, now even I want to put on a few pounds,\" Lisa rolled her eyes and hit the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next show was The Biggest Winner Couples. Ten teams of couples - some married, some just dating - were competing to see who could become the largest. Lisa thought it was crazy how one couple was already quite big - probably 700 pounds combined! \"We just want to look better for each other, and be good role models for our kids,\" explained one Mom who would be considered pleasantly plump anywhere but South Barkalow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next show was \"How I Fed Your Mother\", a sitcom where a guy was embarrassed by his too-thin girlfriend, but kept taking her out to decadent restaurants and cooking at home, trying to get her to put on a few pounds. Then \"True Chub\", a vampire romance. Only here, the vampires drank fat instead of blood, and most characters seemed more horrified about the involuntary liposuction instead of dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned off the TV and threw her notes across the room. \"I get it, I get it - fat is good!\" She threw a pillow over her face and laid back in a huff. \"I'll never figure out this town on my own, I need leads!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about Flash and her Fat Resistance group. But people already didn't trust her, it was obvious... maybe she could catch more flies with honey, as the saying went.</span></div></div>",

She saw that she was wearing nothing but her panties and a T-shirt. She then took a look around herself, and saw her nightmare. She saw wrappers for chocolate bars, danishes, donuts, brownies, ice-cream sandwich, several tube of ice-cream emptied and even a box with crums of what she suspected was a chocolate cake. She then looked at herself. She immediatly noticed she had taken five or so pounds. Those had gone so far to her belly and hips; for the first time in her life, her underwear was digging in her side; not much mind you. But enough to have her panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took a moment to calm down, then proceded to try and find out when she had stopped. She was unable to find any clues, but calling the reception desk revealed that she had ordered the massive amount of food at around 11, an hour or so after she blacked out. After much deliberation, she realized that her online credit card bill would probably give her the precise amount of the food she had taken. She also noticed that the fridge and the mini-bars had been emptied completely. After assessing the damages, she took the phone to call Flash and try to find out what had happened, if it happened to her or other people or why wasn't anyone saying anything... in short her job as her journalist. But she felt ashamed at herself; she realized she'd lose the trust of someone she was starting to consider a friend. Which didn't make sense. Room service knocked, she opened. To her surprise, the maid wasn't shocked to see the client in a minimal outfit, covered in stains from head to tails. The maid then proceded to remove all the wrappers. She opened the fridge, turned to Lisa who was still weighing the pros and con of calling Flash, and said \"Someone had a little fun here last night?\" and filled the fridge and the minibar again saying that the first three nights were free of charges. When Lisa put the phone away, and tried to explain herself, the maid quickly answered \"no need to worry... I also enjoy doing this as you can plainly see\". It is true that the maid in a french maid uniform was easily over 400 pounds. Lisa blushed before mumbering a reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe urge to watch TV was there again; Lisa immediatly said \"not again!\" but started to struggle. She immediately tried to go to the bathroom; she still had her T-shirt and underwears that were covered with all sorts of stains, as well as her legs, arms and face. But she felt tense in the bathroom, and before she could get cleaned up she decided she forgot her make-up in her suitcase. She knew it was a sorry excuse, but as she approached the TV, her head turned to see Fat to the Bones, a remake of her favourite show. She sat down, unable to resist. To make things worse, she started to munch on chips and cookies without realizing what she was doing. When she did, she was unable to focus on the TV and started to be obsessed by the cookies, so she grabbed another box full of them, a compliment of the hotel. What was worse that after a while, she thought that it wasn't a bad thing, that it wouldn't hurt. But Lisa's will to resist food was seriously lowered, as well as her inhibition, her sense of moderation and her want to stay fit and beautiful (by non South Barkalow standards, that is).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a 6 hours, our journalist found herself in the same spot as the day before, watching TV and feeling her eyes glazing. Only this time it was worse; she had been exposed to more TV shows, more commercials. They were new products and she had overheard customers talk about a new delivery company. It delivered food primarely, no matter where in town in less than five minutes, but only in bulk. However, those were very cheap and there were no delivery fees. She also thought that if she dozed off again, her willpower against food would be crushed completely, at least for a while, living her extremely vulnerable in this town.</span></div></div>",

So she went into her bathroom, applied the make-up, came out, turned off the TV, and then went to find some clothes to put on.  After enough snooping around, she found some slacks for her bigger figure.

Scrolling around, she found out all sorts of information, including how, predictably, the company was stationed at South Barkalow. \"Would it KIL PEOPLE TO MAKE THIS STORY MORE SUBTLE?!\" Lisa cried to the heavens.  Sighing, she searched up where the shipping company was.  As it turned out, it was a few blocks away. \"Okay, I'll be fine now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also remembered that she had to call her credit card company to see how much money she spent, and what exactly it was that she bought. \"Okay, I'm feeling confident with those two options.

Normally, it'd be enough to feed someone for several days, but she didn't care. Why should she? She had lost for the time being all notion of restraint. Its not that she wasn't thinking straight, its that she wasn't thinking. But right now, for her, stuffing herself seemed the only normal thing to do; like somebody making their bed doesn't think about the effect on the long term, just how to do right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she realized that the maid had filled up the fridge again. She decided to take all the food, cookies, brownies, danishes, the cake, the chocolate bars, the donuts, the fries she had cooked, the candies, the pots of ice-cream, the ice-cream sandwiches and lay them carefully around her. Then, just as she was about to start stuffing her brains out, she black out. The reporter came back to herself several hours later. She was again laying on the floor. She felt a huge pleasurable sensation thoughout her body; she attempted to get up, but only could lift her head barely. But enough to see that her belly was huge and distended, spread all around. That sight made her giggle for awhile. She realized she had a chocolate bar in her hand; she brought it to her mouth. But she hadn;t the energy to swallow it, or even chew that much. She just closed her eyes to savour the food and the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa woke up the next day, she had an half-eaten chocolate bar in her mouth that had melted and was literally all over her face. She struggled a bit to get up, and saw the disaster. She didn't freak out as much, mostly because it wasn't a surprise; she remembered most of the 'meal', though the actual eating was mostly a blur. Again, she that she wore the same panties and T-shirt and went to the bathroom to assess the damages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was a bit frightened, though far less than the day before. She had taken a good 15 pounds; and those went all over her body; boobs, belly, hips, thighs and butt. But a little more in her ass; which was now jiggling; furthermore, her thighs were now beginning to touch each other when she walked. She actually was able to get changed, get cleaned and sort out a bit the mess before the maid arrived, though all the stains everywhere were going to earn her another comment.  Neredless to say, her red bluse and her black skirt felt tight on her; she was going to need a change in cloths soon. Lisa decided to go out and have lunch someplace, to 'continue' her investigation. When she got out of the bathroom, she noticed the TV was still on</span></div></div>",

Though they both could walk fine, nobody seemed to pay any attention, and in fact any of the studio workers who seemed to be in a hurry were also on scooters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approached the set of The Big Butt Theory, a show about geeky guys trying to court a woman far, far out of their weight class - and therefore, their league. It was actually rather popular, despite most of the cast being under the 300-pound range. \"Being smart is back in style, am I right?\" the mayor chuckled. \"You're certainly on the cutting edge, giving those slimmer actors a chance to shine,\" Lisa nodded, trying not to have too much fun on her scooter. If it wasn't for the fat suit making her feel like a lazy pig, she might have wanted to buy one of these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally arrived at a dressing room marked Whaley Coco, who played Poundy on the show, the love interest of the nerdy boys. The door was open, and Lisa could already hear what sounded like an army of starving people chowing down.

With her bright blonde hair, perfect teeth, and pretty eyes, she certainly looked like a TV star. Her massive size, twice as big as Lisa herself in the fat suit, actually did little to offset that image - or maybe Lisa was just getting used to this town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you two get acquainted,\" the mayor excused himself and buzzed off down the hall. Lisa gazed around the room - just like everything in this town, it was luxurious, but made her decadent hotel room look cheap by comparison. Naturally, they were surrounded by food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt your lunch -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm just on a quick break between shoots, but I'm sure we can chat more later,\" Whaley said, helping herself to some ice cream. \"Please, have a few nibbles - they want me up another 50 pounds before next month, but I'm sure you won't put much of a dent in my food supply, Skinny,\" she said jokingly.</span></div></div>",

As is body image in the media, I understand that you portray people on your shows that wouldn\u2019t even get a pilot in LA.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis doughy face wrinkled into a frown. \u201cHow exactly do people so far away know about South Barkalow\u2019s shows? None of them have been released on DVD yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 A lot of them have been uploaded onto the Internet. It\u2019s illegal, so they take them down as soon as they\u2019re up, but they still get around.\u201d Hopefully he\u2019d buy that, and wouldn\u2019t look too hard for any online torrents of the programs. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotten people excited.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Hopefully that will stop when we do release DVDs\u2026 Don\u2019t want people just stealing them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure people will buy them once they\u2019re available,\u201d Lisa encouraged. \u201cI\u2019m here to write an article on their production, hype them up a bit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 It would be great publicity\u2026\u201d muttered the super obese mayor, drumming his spherical belly as he considered it.</span></div></div>",

He moved quickly, but Lisa didn't feel rushed - maybe a bit intimidated by his size, though. He opened the door on a Hummer limo for her, and Lisa thanked him as she hopped in and, true to the Mayor's word, sampled some snacks. Which to him, seemed to mean sub sandwiches with lots of toppings and sauce. She picked a simple turkey sub. The man - bodyguard, butler, chauffeur? Drove her off.</span></div></div>",

It was so bizarre, seeing pieces of a fat body lying in front of her, waiting for someone to step inside and give it a large life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stripped down herself, taking a look in the mirror. She was slim, though not as toned as she'd like to be. She sighed, running a hand down her belly. This suit would make it look like her belly rested on her thighs - such a weird thought she had to giggle at it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, thin self - see you soon,\" she chuckled, shaking her head as she grabbed the first part of the suit - the legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled them on just like a pair of sweat pants, though they were heavy. She felt the insides hug her skin, while the padding sagged off just like real flesh, giving her a modest amount of heft and jiggle. She fastened them on, marveling at her own tiny body with just two big, fat legs, that touched from her crotch to her padded ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh right, she realized - the scale scrambler Mike gave her. She didn't want to put on those legs a second time, so with a little huffing and puffing, she bent down, grabbed the device, and tucked it under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping sweat from her forehead, she moved on to the hips and butt of the suit. Rap lyrics running through her head, she slipped it over her head, feeling it whump! into place right above her fat legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never did want a bigger butt, but she took a peek in the mirror anyway. Didn't look too bad, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belly now, would be a tough struggle. And then the breasts - she couldn't imagine how any woman could carry around such large, ponderous assets - maybe her belly would help her carry them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was wearing her plus-sized clothes, she had worked up a huge sweat. \"Ugh, being fat is work... never realized,\" she chuckled, beginning to sympathize with the townspeople a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, she couldn't even recognize herself. Looking in the mirror was like watching her fat twin mimic her every move. She jumped, gasping as the padding fell back onto her body, then laughing at herself. This was why she became a journalist - to learn about other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's it... took me long enough, but now I am ready to go amongst the well-fed folk as one of them.\"</span></div></div>",

His loose green shirt was starting to look a lot less loose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing great,\" praised Flash, patting his growing stomach, prompting a wide smile through a mouthful of hot dog.

Lisa actually panicked, being stuck under his huge arm - easily bigger around than any part of her body! But soon they were safely loaded into a van-sized cab, sized for people around Mike's girth. Lisa was almost getting used to feeling so tiny. Lisa herself would have walked to the house they stopped at, but with Mike preoccupied with digestion and Lisa trying to blend in, the cab ride made a lot of sense.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa grunted as she lifted the heaviest piece of her luggage onto the bed. She unzipped it. Inside was a specially made body suit the company had given her for the investigation. It could be suspicious if a skinny woman was going around town asking people why they were so fat, so the company had provided her with a fat suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unfurled the top and wriggled into it. The skin was amazingly realistic. It was basically made out of rubber and covered by a thing layer of latex. The thick padding had a blouse sewed into it. After arranging the top in the right way, she buttoned the blouse over her fake \u2018saddlebags\u2019 and \u2018love handles.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legs of the fat suit were equally thick and jiggly. Instead of skin, the legs were covered by a pair of stretch jeans which had been fitted onto the suit. There were snaps on the waist that had to be secured to ones bellow her new fat stomach, or else the legs might fall down. That would blow Lisa\u2019s identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter anchoring her legs to her gut, Lisa put on a blue sweater. It had to be a large, thick sweater that would cover the snaps and velcro of the suit. It covered her all the way from breast to waist. She pulled the collar of the blouse out so it hung over the collar of the sweater. To complete the ensemble, she adjusted a blond wig on her head and secured it with hairpins. She put on some thick framed glasses. Lastly, Lisa had to retie her shoes. This was a real struggle, as she was unused to the fat middle that prevented her from reaching her feet. Even sitting on the floor didn\u2019t help the process but finally she tied her sneakers and her disguise was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at herself in a mirror. Great. They sent her undercover as a fat librarian. They should have gone all out and included a checkered sweater. She didn\u2019t look super fat but she did look thicker. No part of her new body was too large. Lisa\u2019s old skinny figure could equate to a flagpole. This fat suit made her look much thicker, like a tree trunk. A really big tree trunk like an old pine or redwood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fiddled with her blouse under the sweater. Located by the left fake breast was a small microphone. The microphone was attached to a bulky recorder in a pouch under her new belly. It could hold up to eight hours of recorded audio. The activation button rested right by the tag of her sweater. Her other suitcase had more blank tapes in them. She was fully wired. Lisa grabbed her pen and pad and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had only walked as far as a block before she realized this was a big mistake. The fat suit was made out of material that also made excellent insulation and it was a hot summer\u2019s day. Why did they make me wear a sweater, she moaned to herself. Her face was sweating profusely and she could feel the slimy layer of perspiration where her skin touched the inside of the suit. She spotted a nearby ice cream parlor. I have got to cool down, she thought as she hurriedly waddled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, every building in the fattest town in the world had fully operational air conditioning. Lisa sighed with relief as the cool air hit her. A soda jerk looked at her from behind the counter. \u201cDo you want something, miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I\u2014\u201d Lisa started, then she stopped. You\u2019re going overheat in this dumb thing if you don\u2019t do something about it. \u201cI\u2019ll have a small vanilla milkshake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill do. $1.75.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paid him and then sat down at a booth. Although Lisa was glad to be sitting she was unaccustomed to her new, well padded behind. She struggled to make herself more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soda jerk gave her the milkshake. Despite her discomfort she giggled. A \u2018small\u2019 milkshake in South Barkalow was the same size as a \u2018large\u2019 anywhere else. She took a swig and immediately felt cooler. She was surprised at how quickly she guzzled the milkshake until there was a quarter of it left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that her sweat had dried the inside of her suit had gotten itchy. <i>Screw this</i>, she thought. I don\u2019t care if people look at me funny for being skinny. <i>After I\u2019m done with the shake I\u2019m going to go back to the apartment and take this dumb thing off\u2014</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang, girl, you look mighty fine!\u201d Lisa would\u2019ve jumped from her seat if she could. A young black man had suddenly appeared in the seat in front of her. He looked like Fat Albert, almost out of high school. He couldn\u2019t have been more than nineteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh-h,\u201d Lisa stammered. \u201cUh-h, who\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, pardon me for not introducing myself. The name is Deric, with an \u2018ic\u2019 at the end instead of an \u2018ek.\u2019 I just had to come by and say that you had a dang fine figure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thank you?\u201d Lisa replied. This fat suit was supposed to make her blend in, and suddenly it had drawn all the fat Casanovas out of the woodwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, uh\u2026Miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa.\u201d She kicked herself for not using a fake name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Lisa\u2026Can I have your number? Can I have it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-my number? I don\u2019t have a number; I\u2019m just passing through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooooohhhhhhhhhhh\u2026\u201d The \u2018oh\u2019 lasted for almost ten seconds. \u201cYou\u2019re new around here, huh? Then I really got to take you out and show you the town. Does it sound like a date, girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was mortified. How did this happen? Even if she was desperate for a story she wouldn\u2019t go out with him. Deric was incredibly annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait, her inner thoughts reminded her. <i>You are trying to see why South Barkalow is the fattest town ever. Why not sneak into the dating scene and see how they do things around here?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

During the ride in his \u2018pimped-out car\u2019 which was nothing more than a Saturn with rims, Deric had talked like a nonstop chatterbox. Lisa could not understand a word he was saying. She hoped that she had nodded her head at the right moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hostess showed them to a couple\u2019s booth. The booths were built to accommodate large frames. Lisa wiggled in, still not used to moving around in the fat suit. Deric shooched in with remarkable speed and put his arm around her shoulder. \u201cHope you like BBQ, baby. This place is famous for it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to smile, although it was more of a cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA waiter came by. \u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoot beer, man!\u201d said Deric. \u201cNothing better! What you want, baby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll just have some water\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, she ain\u2019t thirsty for just water! Bring the lady some lemonade.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later the waiter returned with the beverages. He placed a pitcher of root beer by Deric and one of lemonade by Lisa. Interesting, Lisa thought. Restaurants her give a pitcher of beverage per person. She wished that she could reach for her pad of paper, but Deric had her griped to tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to make the best of it. \u201cS-so\u2026do you ever wonder why everyone in this town is so\u2026big?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean fat?\u201d He smiled his goofy, irritating smile. \u201cYou can say fat, girl.\u201d He suddenly stood up, raising a glass of root beer that he had just poured for himself. He shouted so all the other patrons could hear him. \u201cSouth Barkalow fat is the way to be at! Ain\u2019t that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few other diners returned his cheer. Lisa blushed with embarrassment under the gaze of so many jolly fat folk. The waiter came back. \u201cWhat would you like to order?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can split the Lovers\u2019 Dinner 4 Two,\u201d Deric replied before Lisa could open her mouth. \u201cThink you can handle that, baby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeric wasn\u2019t really listening for her answer. \u201cChop! Chop, man! The girl\u2019s dying for some food over here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa groaned as she sat through another of Deric\u2019s endless tirades, unable to get her own word in. Luckily her mike was turned on. Maybe she could review the tape later in hopes that Deric had actually said something newsworthy. She could only sit there with worry. She wasn\u2019t a fat girl, another one of South Barkalow\u2019s plump prime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are an insensitive girl,\u201d Deric remarked with his goofy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-what?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pinching your fine junk in the trunk for the past five minutes and you haven\u2019t budged a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped, more from the shock of Deric pinching her but than his actual action of doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ve got slow reflexes,\u201d she replied. This was enough to cause Deric to laugh for five minutes. Of course she couldn\u2019t feel anything under the suit. Sooner or later Deric was going to realize that she was wearing a fat suit. What would happen then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the waiter came with the food. Lisa\u2019s eyes bulged from behind her glasses. The manhole sized plate was covered with two whole racks of BBQ ribs, a mountain of fries and three ears of corn. The waiter sat it down in front of Deric, who was licking his lips. Her heart sank to her stomach when another waiter came by\u2026and gave her a plate identical to Deric\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the Lovers\u2019 Dinner 4 Two?! Deric sure acted like it was. His big jaws had already bitten off one bone from his ribs. He talked with his mouth full. \u201cEat up girl, there\u2019s plenty to go around! I\u2019ll even give you some of my fries if you want them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not going to happen. Back home Lisa had barely managed to finish one of the rib dinners at Applebee's. She had never contemplated eating this much food in her life. It seemed impossible to do but she had created a persona she had to upkeep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that Lisa was a slow eater by South Barkalow standards. She was getting full from one rack of ribs and two ears of corn just as Deric finished his entire meal. His goofy grin slipped a few notches as he noticed her pace. \u201cYou sure eat slow, baby. Is everything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ve just been on the road for so long, so I\u2019ve had to skip meals\u2026\u201d she stammered, trying to swallow the BBQ meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know just what\u2019s wrong with you then.\u201d Deric somehow managed to scoot in closer when they had previously been separated by inches of fat and blubber suit. Lisa felt the suit becoming too hot again. He broke off some of her ribs and held them up to her mouth. \u201cYou just haven\u2019t been able to do upkeep, so your body is not used to your regular meal sizes. Don\u2019t worry, Deric will feed you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth to decline but Deric shoved the ribs into her mouth. She was forced to chew the meat off or choke. He moved the corn cob across her lips so she could chew. He inserted the rest of her fries, one by one, into her mouth. Then he cut the remaining pig off the bones and forked bites into her mouth. The last bit of BBQ pork entered her mouth. \u201cThere, isn\u2019t that better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wanted to puke. Her stomach was stretched beyond full, and the fat suit felt too restrictive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter came back to clear the plates. \u201cWhat would you like for dessert?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA slice of the Quintuple Chocolate Cake apiece. Nothin\u2019 better!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gagged at the prospect of more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby? Ooohhh, that\u2019s right, you haven\u2019t been able to eat this much in a while. Deric will fix you right up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze. Deric had started massaging her middle!

She squirmed out of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Deric but I have to\u2026to\u2026\u201d she stammered. Unable to say any more she rushed off towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeric was right behind her, a fat man surprisingly quick on his feet. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby? Is the food? My shirt? My B.O.? I can take shower if I have to, baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed through the door to the woman\u2019s bathroom. Backdoor, she thought. Please let there be a back door\u2026There was another entrance to the bathroom that led from the bar side of the restaurant. She hurtled towards the nearest door to the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the sunlight hit her face she ran even faster, afraid that Deric would have noticed her exit and chase after her. This was the incorrect thing to do. Lisa was in good shape, but she wasn\u2019t used to running while her body carried an extra forty or so pounds of rubber. Her skin became slick with sweat and she was forced to lean against a wall and wheeze. Luckily, the restaurant wasn\u2019t too far from her apartment. She speed walked the rest of the way in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she managed to unlock the door to the apartment. When she had the privacy she ripped off the suit much faster than she had put in on. She crammed it under the bed, out of sight. The strain made her sweat even more. She wanted to take a shower, to get all of the sweat off of her. And all the Deric germs\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost shrieked when the sound of knocking came from her door. Quaking in fear, she sneaked over and looked in the peep hole. An immense policeman stood on the other side, comically spherical because of the lens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa opened the door slowly. \u201cH-hello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to bother you, miss.\u201d The cop touched his cap. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a woman with a large blue sweater and glasses that was seen running away from a restaurant. She was seen entering this apartment complex. Have you seen her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the cops would be looking for a fat woman. \u201cN-no. I\u2019ve had the door closed all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop grabbed a doughnut from the bag he was carrying. He chewed it, crumbs spewing everywhere. \u201cNot to worry, miss. Just give us a call if you notice her. It\u2019s quite the crime to run away without paying for your food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gulped. \u201cI-is it a bad crime?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, the punishment is nothing major. But it\u2019s a still a horrible crime in these parts. Good day, miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa closed the door and then collapsed against it. Well, she definably wasn\u2019t going to wear that fat suit again. If she ran into Deric hopefully he wouldn\u2019t recognize her. Still, it would be safe to hide out for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced around the meager apartment. She should do what research should could from here. She needed to find some interesting lead to go on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For more on the story we take you live with our field reporter Bernice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa almost fainted at the anchorman\u2019s words. The scene shifted to a sidewalk where two people were standing. Lisa recognized the police man who had just knocked on her door. The female reporter, Bernice, was simultaneously top heavy and bottom heavy. Her bright pink pantsuit looked a little small in some places. Bernice was eating something. When she realized the camera was pointed in her direction, she frantically wiped some powder from her mouth. It seemed the cop had offered her some of his doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed the doughnut. \u201cB-Bernice VanSteenbergen, 10X News. I\u2019m standing here with Chief Borden of the SBPD. Chief, you now believe that the diner-ditcher was someone in a fat suit. What brought you to this conclusion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorden talked as he finished eating, spraying crumbs all over Bernice\u2019s microphone. \u201cWell, the major tip-off was that the suspect ran away from the scene. In this town, nobody runs away from any crimes. Usually, diner-ditching is an involved set-up where one member of the criminal party waits outside with a getaway vehicle. We all know the average citizen isn\u2019t built for running. And seeing how this thick woman wasn\u2019t a part of the police department, fire brigade, or high school track team, it\u2019s obvious that she isn\u2019t as fat as she appears to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould the suspect be someone from out of town?\u201d Bernice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly. I can\u2019t think of too many town citizens that masquerade in fat suits, unless they wear them out of self pity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is your investigation coming along so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made quick progress, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. We were told that the suspect had just finished consuming the Lovers\u2019 Dinner 4 Two at the local Bubba Que\u2019s barbeque restaurant. Now, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re fat, skinny, or athletic, but nobody can run too far after eating one of those dinners.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa let out a moan. Chief Borden was right. A meal that size should have left Lisa immobile. Only adrenalin and fear had managed to keep her moving, and now the pain in her gut had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know which direction the suspect ran,\u201d Chief Borden continued, \u201cso we\u2019ve approximated the distance she could\u2019ve gone. Men on foot are now searching the homes, apartments, and businesses in the area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBernice cut in. \u201cThat\u2019s right, folks. Behind us is an apartment complex the chief himself has just finished checking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hard mass of dinner in Lisa\u2019s stomach froze. This live news footage was being filmed right in front of her apartment complex. The policeman had only knocked on her door a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny ideas as to the identity of the suspect? Could it be male or female?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose anyone could pretend to be a woman with a fat suit,\u201d Chief Borden answered. \u201cBut I suspect a female. The Facial Reconstruction Unit is now working with witnesses to draw the suspect\u2019s face. We hope to match that to any skinny people or out-of-towners that are taking residence in the grid we are searching.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic surged through Lisa\u2019s body. She jumped to her feet, even though she was technically too stuffed to move. Her thought were frantic. <i>No! Now they know what I look like in a fat suit and soon they\u2019ll know what I look like skinny! How am I going to continue my work? I will I get out of here without being noticed?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at her bed, which had the infernal fat suit under it. <i>It\u2019s really a question of whether I want to wear that thing again or not\u2026there must be something I can do\u2026</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the fat suit had been designed to have only one outfit. The police report had described her blue sweater, so that was out. She fumed. That didn\u2019t leave her with many options. Unless\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, Lisa needed a new hairdo. The wig wasn\u2019t going to work. The only useful thing she had in her luggage was a bottle of hair dye. She spent the next fifteen minutes turning her hair a vivid midnight black. Unlike the wig, she could pattern her hair into a different style. It had to obscure her face, because it was the most telling part of her body as she had no way of adding chubby cheeks. After the dye settled in, she straightened her normally frizzy hair. She let it hang over her face, but to be different she clumped some hair from the back of her head into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she had to struggle into the stupid suit again. She pulled the fat legs up to her waist. The jeans were fused to the suit, so she couldn\u2019t take them off. Lisa rummaged through her clothes until she found one of her favorite purple skirts. It was a birthday present from a cousin, who had accidentally purchased it in a larger size. There was plenty of stretch-room in its waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa brought it up around her hips. It just managed to fit around the top of the jeans. The skirt on pants look wasn\u2019t too fashionable these days, but Lisa was more worried about alteration than practicality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa changed so that she was wearing a light t-shirt. She stuffed a few pillows into the shirt and then put on the top of the fat suit. It felt extremely awkward, but it did make her look bigger. The police would ignore a woman fatter than they suspected, right? The blouse, like the pants, was inseparable so she had to cover it with something. At the bottom of her suitcase was a hooded sweatshirt she had packed for days when it could be cold. It was baggy, and managed to cover the ensemble better that the blue sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at herself in the mirror. The extra padding made her look bigger, which was the most desired effect. Surprisingly she looked younger, as if she was still in college. Still, something was lacking. She put on a large pair of sunglasses. She found a light jacket, which trailed down the small of her back but obviously she wouldn\u2019t be able to close it. At least it could be used for show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa hoped that she wasn\u2019t overdoing things. But maybe by drawing attention to herself in this ridiculous getup, people would notice that she didn\u2019t look a thing like the dinner-ditcher plaguing the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when she got outside that she remembered how warm the day was. All the layers she was wearing only tripled the stifling heat that she felt inside her costume. <i>You\u2019re going to have to take things slow</i>, Lisa thought to herself, <i>or you could overheat in this thing.</i> She walked slowly, but still sweat formed on her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Lisa had been anywhere else, people surely would have gawked at her size and manner of dress but in the fattest town in the world that was not the case. She became another unremarkable face in the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped as she saw to uniformed officers up ahead at the corner. They were still canvassing the neighborhood, looking for her in a fat suit. <i>Courage, Lisa, you can do this.</i> She walked within an arm's reach of them to push the crosswalk button on the traffic light. The light changed six seconds later. She walked across, and then risked a glance behind her. The cops didn\u2019t even give her a second glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed with relief but that only reminded her how hot she was. Luckily, she stood just outside the entrance to a coffee shop. Like the ice cream parlor she had been in an hour or so earlier, the cool air of the coffee shop was instantly refreshing. Few people sat at tables or couches. Just like everywhere else in the US, the coffee shop hosted college age clientele. Was there really a college in South Barkalow? She would have to check that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh lord.\u201d The stout, brown skinned barista eyed Lisa\u2019s outfit. She spoke with a thick accent that was hard to place. \u201cGirl, you\u2019re going to bake in those clothes if you aren\u2019t careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in Lisa snapped. She was tired of all the negative attention and awkward situations she was getting in today. \u201cYeah, but if it takes eleven minutes per pound I think I have a long wait until that happens!\u201d As the words left her mouth Lisa wanted to slap herself. Where had that attitude come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barista actually laughed. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem too familiar. Did you transfer to SBU?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Lisa grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSouth Barkalow University. It\u2019s a great place to go, if you\u2019re searching for colleges.\u201d The barista did look like a part-time student. Lisa felt a little unnerved that her new disguise was attracting the overweight of the college age. Still, it was better than attracting Deric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The barista asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIced Mocha, large.\u201d Given the concept of \u2018large\u2019 drinks in South Barkalow, the slushy concoction better cool her off. Lisa paid for it a minute later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa carefully perched herself on a stool, sucking the frozen drink as if it were life water. At least the disguise was working but it was still too hot and she still didn\u2019t have any idea where to start her investigation. Maybe the local college could hold something\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDing! The coffee shop bell jingled. A young woman shorter and stouter than the barista entered. In her hand was a stack of orange flyers that she passed out to the customers drinking coffee. She handed one to Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I like you outfit,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks.\u201d As the girl left Lisa glanced at the piece of paper. The letters SBU dominated the top half. It advertised some meeting that was going to take place in the college. <i>This looks interesting. Maybe I</i> can <i>use this. Lisa read the flyer.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Four o\u2019clock, don\u2019t miss the greatest thing ever to grace SBU\u2019s MacDonald Hall!

Lisa watched as he shoved the rest of it into his mouth and swallowed. \"Now, let me help you.\" he smiled. \"No, I can eat it myself.\" Lisa said quickly, not wanting his greasy, fat fingers touching her food again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***30 minutes later***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa swallowed the last bite of the cake and fell back, panting. Her stomach felt as though it would burst and the fat suit fell as though it would rip off at any minute. \"You okay there?\" Deric asked. \"I'm fine.\" Lisa gasped. \"Well, how 'bout coming back to my place?\" Deric asked sleazily. \"NO!\" Lisa said. \"I mean.. I don't feel well. I think I'll go home.\" \"Okay...\" said Deric sadly. \"I already paid, but before you leave, what's your number?\" \"Uh...\" Lisa stammered. She didn't want to give him her number! Lisa randomly said a fake number and he wrote it down. \"Thanks, bye.\" he said leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa tried to get up, but she couldn't. every time she moved, her stomach would hurt. Finally she succeeded in getting up. By time she had walked to the door of the restaurant, she was already panting for breath. And her apartment was 2 blocks away! LIsa painfully walked there, and as soon as she unlocked the door, she pulled of the fat suit and flopped on the bed. She looked down at her stomach. It was distended and red, and about the size of a basketball. Lisa rubbed it painfully.</span></div></div>",

She was the one who would spot small chocolate stores and bakeries from afar, walking into them purposefully, if only just to let the fragrant buttery smell waft over and lift her spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes. Her job was important, she was definitely not a glutton, but for now, she would savour the perks of her assignment. She would take stock of every single edible thing in the kitchen in a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was filled with an amazing sensation the instant she bit into the rich, crumbly confection. Her eyes widened in unbelievable pleasure. She had never tasted anything as luscious in her entire life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cookie still melting in her mouth, Lisa turned her gaze towards the cookie packet. \"Barkalow's Best Bonbon\" was printed in beautiful cursive underneath the picture of a giant cookie mold with drops of tantalizing batter in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa frowned.

The massive blob of a belly was so heavy that it pushed both of her enormously fat legs aside. The woman wore a pretty pink blouse which was stretched to its utter limit.

At any second, it looked like one of those buttons was going to pop off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting on top of that giant, soft and impossible belly were two breasts of sizes that Lisa had never even thought possible without expensive augmentaiton surgery. An ocean of cleavage formed where the woman's gigantic breasts met and despite being a hot blooded heterosexual woman Lisa could only just keep herself from staring and gawking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand, the hugely obese woman fed the last of a supersized super fattening fast food sandwich into her mouth while the other extended in a friendly handshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman had  a firm handshake despite her fat fingers being the size of sausages. \"Nice to meet you,\" chirped the woman in a surpirsingly high pitched voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa managed to regain her voice. \"Likewise, I'm Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled. \"My name is Allison and welcome to town.\" Suddenly, her hand went to her mouth just in time to cover up a masive belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a long belch but it was so deep that Lisa could actually feel it. the sudden vent of air Allison's gut shook her entire frame. Lisa could only watch with fascination as the woman's entire obese body shook; from her fat legs as thick as Lisa's waist to her third and fourth chins and especially her progidious belly. The belly shook expecially hard and for a second Lisa was hoping to see all of the giant belly just spill everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the buttons held and Lisa was just goin to have to get a look some other time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked her eyes when she realized that Allison was still talking to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just heading now to Arno's Diner and you're more than welcome to come with me.

When she tasted it, her eyes widened. \"Th-This is amazing, it's so rich and smooth, and it's so chocolaty.\"<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it,\" Allison said. \"Almost all cooks here are trained to be three star and higher, and are graduates of the best and great culinary colleges there are.\"<br>\r\n\"W-Wow,\" Lisa said, putting putting her shack down and writing this down. \"So that's another reason everyone is so fat. Great food at low prices, no wonder.\" She then took the Root Beer and drank some. She could tell it was freshly made, like it was just made. \"I'm guessing some people make their own sodas?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep,\"Allison answered. \"Some make their own sodas fresh, you can also get some sodas here where you can never get anywhere else. Some also make their own Ice Cream, like this place.\"<br>\r\nLisa wrote this down, drinking some more of her drink. \"I'm getting so much information already just from being here with you,\" she said. Just then, Melissa came back with their orders, pulling them along on two gaint food trolleys.<br>\r\n\"Here's your orders girls,\" Melissa said, placing their food in front of them. Lisa saw how big the food was, a bit scared at eating all of it, but when she smelled the food, she started to salivate.<br>\r\n\"I see that you're starting to drool,\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n\"I-It smells sooooo good,\" Lisa said. \"I-I'm scared at what it might taste like and loose control.\"<br>\r\n\"It happens to everyone hun,\" Melissa stated, putting the last plate down. \"Just enjoy yourself. We have care-out boxes if you cannot finish.\" She then walked away with the trolley carts.<br>\r\n\"You can add more to your research later,\" Allison said, taking one of the <i>Gut Buster Bacon Cheese Burgers</i> she ordered for herself and bit into it.<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Lisa started, taking one of her plate that had the <i>Fully Loaded Chili Dogs</i> and a fork. \"Here goes.\" She cut the hot dog and took a bite of it with the chili and cheese. When she did, she was in food bliss, she held her cheeks with a bliss look. \"This is the best thing I've ever eaten~\" She then started to eat with more gusto and enjoying herself and the food. 'I can now tell why this is the fattest town, great tasting food that is very cheep to by made by master cooks.' Lisa kept eating until she finished. When she did, she was...</span></div></div>",

Lisa smirked; that was clearly an ironic name and this woman seemed to know it full well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lisa,\" came her reply as she shook hands with the large Ant, her slender fingers engulfed by the plump digits of the other woman's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what brings you to city hall, Lisa?

Best I've been to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded, pondering her next question. This restaurant near the edge of South Barkalow sounded interesting for Ant to single out. Could this restaurant be a factor in the town's weight gain? The idea sounded preposterous, but she had learned over her journalistic history to consider every possibility, even the ludicrous ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Lisa seemed friendly enough to discuss the town's history and the reasons for her being here. It may not be wise to reveal her objective so prematurely, but there was every chance she could be pointed in the right direction.

Lisa was a bit taken back by the lack of an answer, what was her problem? She wanted to keep a low profile until she could nail down a good interview so she thought it best not to annoy the woman and wait to be dropped off at the town hall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride seemed a bit long but it was still enjoyable, a good site seeing trip as a matter of fact. The town hall was in the dead center of the richest, most opulent part of South Barkalow. Towering mansions and five star restaurants clad the sidewalks of this well-groomed section of town. Huge and happy citizens populated the clean sidewalks and waddled about. A very rich part of town indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight-seeing tour was cut short as the buss driver called from the front over the bus's loud speakers, \"City Hall, passengers awaiting City Hall step out now please.\" The bus halted and Lisa stood to get out of her seat, a few others did as well. Among them two business men seated in the back and the rude woman in front of Lisa who ignored her at the start of the bus ride. Lisa waited a few extra seconds waiting for the woman to get to her feet, waddle down the bus and to the door, then a few more as she stepped down the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa figured she better get used to waiting behind people if she planned to stay long in this town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two business men parted going separate ways as they departed the bus but the woman walked straight through side by side with Lisa up to the steps of city hall. They didn't make eye contact and the woman still seemed a bit upset, distant from Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lady grunted loudly as she pulled her self up the long stairs muttering something under her breath. They walked in at the same time, bumping hips, Lisa was squished up against the door briefly getting the wind knocked out of her.</span></div></div>",

She dragged her over to a chair in the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Lisa replied, trying to breathe normally. \u201cI should have not tried to cut you off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m really sorry,\u201d the woman of girth said as she sat in the next chair. \u201cI was trying to get away from you because I thought you were dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa\u2019s eyes grew big with shock. \u201cYou thought I was dangerous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not disrespecting for figure or anything, but are you in fact\u2026skinny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked down at her frame. She wasn\u2019t athleticly thin, but she was lean by South Barkalow standards. Then she looked at the woman, whose body type was a juicy apple shape that contained what looked like double the amount of Lisa\u2019s weight. \u201cI\u2019m thin, if that\u2019s what you mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, not that kind of skinny. Two words: Skin Knee. It\u2019s a criminal gang comprised of citizens from the town\u2019s 2% underweight population. I thought you might have been one of them. They\u2019ve been plaguing the city for quite some time now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe criminals are skinny people?\u201d Lisa asked with amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt makes sense, when you think about it. South Barkalow\u2019s economy is dominated by food sales. The Skin Knees are most noted for their timed robberies of local restaurants when the registers are full. Unfortunately, the Skin Knees are faster and nimbler than many town residents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa instinctively reached into her purse for a notepad. \u201cInteresting\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so sorry, where are my manners?\u201d The plump woman grasped Lisa\u2019s hand in a quick handshake. \u201cI\u2019m Lisa, Lisa Lugolia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I\u2019m Lisa Boytise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out! I guess Lisa is a common name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Really common</i>, Lisa thought. She glanced at Lisa Lugolia\u2019s waist again. <i>It figures that my South Barkalow counterpart would be twice my size.</i> She glanced up, realizing that Miss Lugolia recognized what she was looking at. \u201cSorry! I didn\u2019t mean to stare\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Lot\u2019s of newcomers and tourists usually stare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill, it\u2019s not the right thing to do Lisa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCall me Lugolia. Given our homophonic fist names it will make things easier.\u201d Lugolia grunted again as she adjusted the hem of her skirt. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I\u2019m not really used to it either.

Last year I was below average at 175 pounds. But when I got the promotion to work with the mayor I had to gain weight. The board sort of pressures you into meeting a certain weight requirement.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou work with the mayor?\u201d Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugolia nodded. \u201cRecently elected to the City Council.

The mayor thinks that they\u2019re just radicals but I know better. Part organized crime, part street crew, the Skin Knees work to make life miserable for the overweight residents. They have been classified as extremists in their thinking: Skin Knee is behind the advancement of many controversial topics, such as exercise and healthier lunches in schools. Various gang members have been charged with crimes like grand theft auto, grand larceny, counterfeiting, terrorist activities, and general disturbance of the peace. What makes them difficult to track is the fact that they plan their crimes to occur infrequently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey sound like a problem,\u201d Lisa said. While it wasn\u2019t exactly a led as to why South Barkalow was so fat, it was a different story than the norm. Perhaps she could deviate a bit and tackle this new, exciting story?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile some Skin Knee members are well known, the rest are a mystery. Any skinny person in this town falls into one of three categories: gang member, nonmember but supporter, or unaffiliated with the gang. It\u2019s hard to tell where they side, so many citizens are weary of any thin people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa groaned inwardly. That could make her investigation hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nearby clock struck out the hour. \u201cWell, I have a council meeting to attend.\u201d She handed Lisa a business card. <i>Lisa Lugolia, Councilwoman. Finance &amp; Economics Committee.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust give me a call if you have any more questions. Maybe could chat over dinner.\u201d Lugolia strode off to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa headed for the front doors and then stopped. As a skinny outsider, she could possibly go undercover in the Skin Knee gang. But they were still a criminal gang and it could be dangerous. Maybe she could do some snooping around here at City Hall.

They see themselves as representatives of the South Barkalow image. The requirements are never set in stone but the men need to be at least 250, which I\u2019m at now. The women should be 300 lbs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa almost screamed. \u201cYou have to gain another fifty pounds?! That\u2019s terrible! Why should the councilwomen weigh more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the whim of the current mayor as to how huge he wants his council members. He selected me because of my past leadership experience but I was quickly shunned from the board. My voice of opinion among the council members will probably not get the power it deserves until I at least weigh 275.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the runt of the litter what are the other council members like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugolia counted off here coworkers on her fingers. \u201cThere\u2019s Ramford Stibbins, the biggest of our group. He heads the Building &amp; Zoning Committee. Marcilla Hampton is the real witch of the board. She heads Human Resources. Ethan Fronan is the friendliest and thus heads the Tourism Board.

I have to eat one every hour in a half day period. They\u2019re supposed to fill you with calories and stimulate your appetite while slowing the metabolism.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt sounds like the opposite of a granola bar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugolia actually laughed at that. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d She grunted again then patted her growing middle. \u201cEver since the second week they\u2019ve given me stomach pains. I\u2019m sure that I don\u2019t want to know exactly how these things work. Thank the almighty that council members get free attire. I\u2019ve gone up five dress sizes in the past month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I look at that?\u201d Lisa asked, reaching for the wrapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa read the label on the back. [Produced by the Sack-Wedge Snack Food Company, 800 Forward St.] <i>If the councilors have to gain weight with these, what other jobs would require these things?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugolia seemed to agree with Lisa\u2019s thoughts. \u201cIf you get a job in this town, your employer will probably want you to get bigger with these.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa added it to her list of places to visit.

There was no colonial architecture here--no Corinthian columns or red bricks, nothing faux-Gothic or faux-Renaissance.  In fact, Lisa would have walked right past the building, assuming it to be a massive restaurant or department store, if it hadn't said \"South Barkalow Town Hall\" in great, crimson block letters across its plastic facade.  There was a working clock above the letters, but it was digital.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, Lisa thought, this town's buildings were as massive and tacky as its residents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, the great, boxy building was impressive in its own way--as a testimony to the cultural black hole that was former Small-Town America.  It had, she supposed, been built--or renovated--sometime in the 1990s, when the town had split off from North Barkalow due to a dispute over regulatory measures of some kind that the state government had implemented.  She'd never been too great at understanding this bureaucratic small-town stuff--Need-To-Know News was hardly The Economist, and she wasn't, truth be told, the best reporter--so after a certain amount of time scouring the Web to learn about the background of the town, she decided that a man-on-the-street perspective would be more interesting to her readers, and it sure as hell would to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Lisa,\" she muttered to herself.  \"You know what to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Lisa noted, with mingled awe and consternation, there was a very well-dressed woman striding toward her.  Her auburn hair hung down over her shoulder (as was the style) in one lustrous pleat, and was complemented by amber jewelry.  She wore the most feminine-looking business jacket Lisa had ever seen, and under it bloomed a dark-brown skirt that was pulled up over the woman's generous middle.  Her rather full lips were pursed, and she glowered at Lisa, not so much due to Lisa's staring as to the fact that the suddenly mild-mannered reporter was in her path.  Lisa had never seen a woman so large and fast before--the businesswoman must have been 250 pounds, but she walked faster than Lisa could have, scowling all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Lisa do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The words, \"Pardon me, ma'am, can I talk to you about South Barkalow,\" rose and died on Lisa's lips.  This Amazon did not want to be bothered, and how was Lisa even to broach the subject of obesity with her?  Rather than speak to the woman, she dove out of her way, watching her loose dress flap around her beefy legs from behind.  \"Careful, Skinny,\" called the woman without turning her head.  In a surprisingly short amount of time, she was out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had, in fact, never seen anyone so large before until she had boarded the bus that morning.  The so-called \"Obesity Epidemic\" in America had run its course in the 20-teens--thanks in large part to the efforts of the FDA and CDC.  People, everyone said, were healthier than ever, thanks to controlled diets and government-mandated exercise programs.  South Barkalow, of course, was the big exception--and it seemed that as the rest of the country got thinner, this strange little town, along with a few others, had increased in girth.  There was a kind of morbid fascination with South Barkalow because of this, though oddly enough, she had never seen any serious news agency do a piece on the town.  The official line was that the government had cured obesity everywhere, despite silly, wild rumors of towns full of obese throwbacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumors that were, apparently, true.  Yet it was difficult to interview obese people about their disease, she thought.  How do you ask someone how they feel about being fat?  And was it her, or did everyone in this town seem distinctly unfriendly, as if they disliked her on sight?  Perhaps she could find someone who wasn't fat to interview first?  She could have, she supposed, begin with City Hall...but the mayor and public officials would be sure to spin the story to make the town look as good as possible, and she wanted something real, something candid.  She scanned the buildings that made up the downtown skyline...in addition to offices, there were a ton of restaurants.  As she began to move toward these, it slowly registered that she had not heard of any one of them before.  They had strange names like \"IHOP,\" \"Bob's Big Boy,\" \"Cinnabon,\" \"Country Cookin'\" and \"Dairy Queen.\"  They all, strangely enough, looked like chain restaurants--but the more popular chains she'd grown up with--such as \"Leafy Greens,\" or \"Fit and Well\" were nowhere to be seen.  That could be a story as well, she thought.  She continued to walk down the Main Street, which was empty of people, aside from the occasional businessman leaving work early and hefting his bulk into one of the cars that lined the street (she smiled, imagining them on their way to secret rendezvous with zaftig mistresses in seedy, big-bedded motels).  The strangest thing about it was that when she did see someone, they never so much as made eye contact with her.  She thought that, as the only thin person in a town, she would at least attract some stares.  Not a bit of it.  It was either as though her 24-inch waist made her instantly invisible--or else as though they'd been instructed not to look at her.  Either theory was crazy, though.  She turned the corner--and immediately laughed in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Lisa see?</span></div></div>",

The company--she'd always thought--had been shut down by the government in the late teens as a chief contributor to the obesity epidemic.  Perhaps all the other restaurants she'd seen as well--perhaps this was where they went to die?  Geez, she thought--between the fat people, the fast food restaurants, and all the corporate kitsch, South Barkalow was feeling more and more like a trip back in time.  She wondered if McDonald's had \"Happy Meals\" for adults, and she was about to go inside and find out, when she noticed another establishment next door that was familiar, although not for nostalgia's sake.  She went to \"Yogafit\" every week to satisfy her federal workout requirement.  She was a bit surprised to find one in South Barkalow, but then, in the wake of the changes brought on by Affordable Care, working out had quickly become a government mandate.  There were several fitness joints--from yoga studios to old-fashioned gyms--in every town, borough and suburb.

She could get the story from them, first, then talk to some of these fatties in order to \"flesh\" it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Lisa's experience, normally, someone greeted you as soon as you walked in the door of Yogafit with \"Namaste,\" but when she entered this establishment, she was a bit taken aback to find it as empty as the streets she'd just walked down.  \"Hello?\" she called.  She heard footsteps in the back office, which was behind the reception desk.  At length, a man in a Yogafit uniform opened the door and walked to the desk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lisa's relief, there wasn't an inch of fat on him--though he certainly wasn't very attractive, either, being mostly bald.  At least, he wasn't attractive by her usual standards, though in South Barkalow, she supposed, he must be something of an Adonis. \"Hey, sorry to keep you waiting,\" he said.  \"My name's Cody, and I'll be your--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stopped short, taking in Lisa's figure.  \"I---wow--uh, sorry, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled.  To an extent, she was used to this kind of treatment.  While she wasn't a great reporter, she could often rely on her charms to get access to information that other reporters just didn't seem to be able to get.  Of course, to this poor little personal trainer, her charms were multiplied, as she was, as far as he was concerned, the only eligible woman in South Barkalow.  \"You'll be my what, Cody?\" she laughed.  Go on--you were doing well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody looked flustered.  Sitting for days on end in an empty yoga studio had obviously had an impact on the poor guy's professionalism.  She could take advantage of that.  \"Are, uh, you from around here?\" asked poor Cody, almost rubbing his eyes after taking in her form again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was JUST about to ask you the same question, Cody,\" said Lisa.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't have been more than thirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Cody continued, \"my boss didn't like how motivated I was.  You know how it is with government programs.  Don't rock the boat.  I called him out on that--biggest mistake of my life.  The next day, he told me that since I was so anxious to get people in shape, he'd transfer me down to S.B.  I'd never actually been here before--the roads from North B. don't run directly the South--the ones that did got blocked off in the nineteen-nineties--and if you can believe it, I was actually excited.  I'd heard rumors about the place's reputation, of course--but I had no idea it was like this.  My first month here, a handful of people signed up.  Only one or two actually worked out with me.  Nobody lost weight.  And that's pretty much the way it's been for the past two years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God,\" said Lisa, absentmindedly plaiting her dark brown ringlets.  \"How frustrating for you.  Do you have any idea what's made people in this town so...odd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not sure,\" said Cody.  \"I've tried to find a straightforward history of this place.  Why it split from North Barkalow, and everything else.  All I can figure out, though, is that in the teens, when the government drove all the fast food joints out of business...it didn't drive them out of South Barkalow, and the Obesity Epidemic continued to spread here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't make sense,\" Lisa protested.  \"Why would the government shut down these restaurants everywhere else?  And how would these chains continue to function after being limited to one or two stores?\"  She took his hand, as if by impulse.  \"You must have heard more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N--not really,\" said Cody.  Great, she thought.  He was lying.  She must be losing her touch, she thought--or else he was really scared of something.

He showed her a picture of a stunning girl with straw-colored hair, posing with him on a mountaintop.  Cody was surprised and impressed that Cody had ever been able to bag a girl of this caliber, even if he did have hair at the time.  Originally, he said, when he had moved to South Barkalow, she'd moved with him.  \"I'd met her when she was in one of my yoga classes up North.  But this place changed her.\"  Cody went on to explain that he was a very strict vegan--he only ever went to one supermarket, and prepared all his meals at home.  Grace had always been health-conscious, but once she got a job with a local law firm, it had been very difficult to continue eating exactly as Cody did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She started having lunches out,\" he said, quietly.  \"Her coworkers would all go out for lunch, and she didn't want to be the only one in the office, eating lunch all by herself.\"  I made it a policy never to eat anywhere that serves animals.  Just a personal choice, I guess,\" he said, in a tone that betrayed that he felt quite superior to most people.  \"Anyway, after a few weeks at work, she started to change.  That food worked on her like a drug.  Before I knew it, she wasn't even eating dinner at home.  'I can afford to eat out,' she'd say, before joining her new girlfriends.  'I have a real job.'  After a few months...she wasn't Grace anymore.  She was...unrecog-unrecognizable.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dumped her for getting fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody sniffled.  \"No, not really...we just grew apart.  All she wanted to do anymore was eat.  All my hobbies had involved yoga, meditation and keeping fit.  We had nothing to talk about anymore.  And no, I wasn't all that attracted to her anymore, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa tried not to sound annoyed.  \"So that just confirms the simplest theory, then--that the unregulated fast food joints are making people here fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not--not exactly,\" Cody whispered.  \"The first two weeks she ate out with the girls, she said she only had the salad.  No dressing, even.  I know she was telling the truth, because they all gave her a hard time about it.  She'd come home upset that she didn't fit in.  I'd always ask her why she wanted to fit in, then she would laugh with me and we'd make fun of the other women's weight and stuff.  I know that sounds mean, but you don't know what it's like to feel like an outsider where you live.  Laughing at the people here was a way for us to cope.  Anyway, yeah, she made it a policy to only eat the salads.  But all the same, every night she would want to go out to eat more and more.  She'd try lines like, \"We never go anyplace nice,\" but I could tell that it was eating at a restaurant that she wanted--not a date.  It was almost as if--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa leant in.  \"Almost as if what, Cody?\" she whispered, doing her best to sound impressed and shocked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost as if,\" Cody whispered back, \"they were putting something in those salads, in all the food...some chemical, like nicotine or something, to get people to crave anything at all at those restaurants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa leaned back and laughed.  \"But that sounds crazy.  And she could have just kept having the salad, then, to get her fix.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Cody whispered, harshly--evidently afraid.  \"Sorry,\" he whispered again, \"but I've seen too many weird things around here.  It all really started to affect Grace after her company retreat.  They went out to the South Barkalow harbor together, as a team-building exercise.  I'd never heard of a law firm doing that, but she'd told me it was mandatory.  When she came back, she had changed.  There was this new, hungry look in her eyes all the time.  That's when she started going \"out with the girls\" in the evenings, too.  I'd come home and find pizzas and barbecue ribs and apple pies in the fridge.\"  Cody shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Initially, she realized what she was doing to herself, and asked me to help her get back on track.  We did yoga together, daily--she was my only customer at the time.  But it wasn't taking.  The weight just started to pile on, despite everything we were doing.  Two pounds, one week.  Five, the next.  Then seven.  Then ten.  Finally, she had me hypnotize her to get to the bottom of it--yes, alternative preventative medicine does include a few classes in hypnotherapy, believe it or not--but nothing that she said made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I'd gotten her into a trance state, I asked her why she felt she was eating so much.  She started saying really strange things, then, like, 'To join my sisters.'  I asked her who her sisters were, and she said something about the seaside, and needing to go there--I could only assume she was referring to the harbor.  Then she said something that gave me the chills.  She said--she said--\"I need to make him happy.  To swim out to him.  He is waiting.\"  She wouldn't explain who he was.  I never told her what she had said to me while she was under.  After a while, she stopped working out.  Then we stopped talking.  Eventually, she just moved out.  She didn't give me a reason, and I didn't ask her for one.  There was no explosive fight.  It was just like she...she forgot about me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was trippy, thought Lisa.  Of course, more than likely, this poor little man was a crazy health nut who had smoked a few too many joints in college.  She could understand why the bombshell in the picture would have forgotten about him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might think I'm crazy,\" whispered Cody.  \"But ask yourself this...why is everyone in this town so unfriendly--why do they act so weird?  If there's nothing more going on than unregulated, dried up old fast food chains, why are we pretty much invisible to them?  Before you dismiss me, also, there's another thing you should see.  Go to the beach.  But I'd wait until night to do that.  You don't want to let anyone see that you're there.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That night, Lisa was surprised at how little time it took to get to the beach.  She had also been surprised, that day, at how little traffic there actually was at rush hour, despite the fact that South Barkalow was the size of a small city.  \"Where are they all?\" she'd asked herself.  During the day, she'd tried to talk to a few of the corpulent residents, but--just as Cody had said--they seemed not to even see her.  She decided she'd just make her way to the bay after the sun set.  She wasn't about to wait longer, as she didn't have any particular desire to stay the night in this town.  Anyway, it wasn't like the people here even seemed to see her when she talked to them--she had a pretty good feeling that no one would notice her at the beach.  She was ridiculously hungry, not having dared to eat at any of the restaurants after Cody's story.  She walked East, away from the setting sun.  Within a few blocks, the lawns began to get sandier, the blocks flatter.  She could hear seagulls.  At length, the skyline stopped, and she began to hear the sound of surf and smell salt.  Weird as South Barkalow was, she thought, at least their beaches were like every other.  She suppressed the urge to run over the wide wooden bridge that rose over the dunes, seeming to lead to the sky itself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she mounted the bridge, and looked out at the bay, her jaw dropped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had seen, at various times in her life, nature documentaries examining the habits of manatees and walruses--how they tended to lay themselves on rocky beaches during the day, sunning themselves, and filling the whole rocky beach with their blubbery, ungainly bodies that remained awkward and vulnerable until they dragged themselves to the shore and plunged into the brine.  So it was here, but with people.  She had never seen a beach so full of people.  And she had never seen such enormous, manatee-like people on any beach.  Many of them had fallen asleep while tanning before the sunset.  Others simply lounged, on blankets, or on sand, apparently too tired to haul their fleshy selves out of the sand and go home.  There were so many of them that their bodies were almost touching.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then...if it was due to laziness that they were still out here...why were none of them talking?  Indeed, the beach, here, despite being full of people was as silent as the town had been.  She also noticed, with a shock, that those who were awake were gazing out to sea.  She followed their eyes, and saw that there were even more of them floating in the ocean.  And unless her eyes misled her (completely possible in the half-light), the floating ones were far, far bigger than any of those on the shore--who were in turn bigger than anyone she had seen in the town.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she heard voices behind her.  On a crazy whim, she jumped under the bridge and into the scratchy weeds that grew beneath it--and just in the nick of time.  The bridge began to groan under new footsteps, and by and by she saw a stream of people slowly and ceremoniously marching from over it, down to the beach.  These people were also rather hefty, but not nearly so big as the men and women whose corpulent bodies littered the sand--many of whom, she now saw, were not even wearing swimsuits.  Nevertheless, the bridge over her creaked so terribly that she ground her teeth, worried that it wouldn't hold.  Lisa took out the binoculars she'd purchased that day for exactly this purpose.  It was a full moon, thank God, with a clear sky, or else she would not have been able to make out much at all of the following scene.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newcomers were all wearing uniforms of various kinds, and wheeling concession carts.  With a start, she realized they must have been the workers at the fast food places, for the carts were decorated with the logos.  They began to distribute the boxes once they reached the beach, putting them in the plump hands of the half- or fully-naked loungers, who now surged toward them--exactly as hungry animals would.  Her she imagined them barking like seals, but if they spoke, they must have been whispering.  Each of them was given a few boxes--two or three--before the carts moved down the beach toward harder sand.  At length, most of the feeders came to the sea itself, where the fattest of the group continued to bob up and down in the water.  There was a strange, unearthly cry, as of singing, and the uniformed men and women took even more boxes out of their carts, and began throwing them at the singers.  They were eerily accurate, despite being so clearly out of shape, and when each of the naked, enormous singers received their supper, they stopped, taking burgers, chicken or fries in their soggy, swollen hands, and wolfing them down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was lost for words.  What was this?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the bathers, her mouth packed full of food as her face was packed full of chins, was moving a good deal more than the others.  She seemed to be having a bit of trouble floating, despite the fact that she had even more buoyant flab on her frame than most of the other bathers.  Lisa felt a sense of deja vu.  Had she seen her before that day?  Her mostly-wet hair was straw-colored, and hung past her enormous and plump shoulders.  She had no trace of a neck.  No, Lisa was sure she had seen her before, maybe in a picture...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly, horribly dawned on Lisa that this was Grace, Cody's ex-girlfriend.  At the same time she realized this, she saw that the water around Grace was being stirred up, as if with a school of fish, a dolphin or a shark.  At once, Grace began to have even more difficulty staying above the water, as if something besides her weight was pulling her down.  This seemed to surprise the otherwise oblivious eater at first, and she came, momentarily, out of her trance.  Lisa saw her look down at herself, then look back up, a glimmer of horror in her eyes at what she had become (Lisa's binoculars were really quite good).  The blubbery former beauty splashed half-heartedly, as if to stay afloat.  Then, as quickly as the moment of lucidity came, it vanished, and Grace stopped struggling--reaching instead for a piece of pie that floated next to her, and shoving as much of it as possible into her mouth, almost as a last meal.  Chewing it, she was at peace again, and she seemed to look directly at Lisa, across the intervening beach, as a contented smile spread across her fat, full face.  Then, with a sudden scream of--unmistakably, of delight, Lisa thought--the girl who had been Grace was pulled down beneath the waves.  Suddenly, Lisa heard other screams of the same kind, and lowered her binoculars to see some of the hugest bathers, who were furthest out, disappearing beneath the waves as well.  Once all the screams had ceased, the others in the water began to swim further out, in order to get to the food, Lisa supposed, that the ones who had been taken hadn't managed to finish.  Meanwhile, the moon-bathers who were closest to the shore, got in the water and began to float.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all a bit too much for Lisa.  \"What the fu--\" she began, but was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might ask you the same question,\" came a deep and feminine voice above Lisa.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa recognized the well-dressed and important-looking woman who had walked past her earlier that day.  She also recognized that she was in a world of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Lisa do?</span></div></div>",

The young man was wearing a brown open jacket and a fine shirt along with a loose pair of khaki\u2019s. On top of his head was a grey flat cap hat.

There was an obese woman named Rebecca Park who weighed more then 500 lbs. Most of the residents bullied her constantly which usually happens when a slim person sees an obese woman. A lot of people thought she was a circus woman or something. Anyway one day there was a strange visitor to the town. According to the story she was a witch. When she found out what was happening to the woman she cursed the town. Everybody who lived there at the time immediately gained weight, many of them wound up larger then Rebecca. The witch then told the mayor of the time that if a person were to have a baby, that baby would be born overweight, gain weight easily and have a large appetite. This meant that to this day, the town has remained fat. There was also one other factor to the curse. People who visit the town will be unaffected if they do not think badly of people who are fat but if they do they will find themselves as fat as the residents of the town. They will also find that their metabolism has lowered and their appetite has grown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa listened to the story, noting down key points in her notebook. She looked up back at the cab driver when he finished speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said there are people who believe this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver laughed before he answered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there are some fat people who have come here and have claimed to have been effected by the curse, probably to stir up trouble. I know one of these people and I am witness to the fact that they were fat when they got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds pretty strange. So some people believe them?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well naturally in a town as large as this, excuse the pun, there are always going to be a few people who believe the stirrers.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cab started to slow as it approached a large building to the side of the road. A nearby sign confirmed that the building was the Hotel that Lisa was staying in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that visitor you mentioned still in town?\" Lisa asked, gathering her stuff around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he decided to get a house here, so I would say yes. I can give you his name and address if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be perfect!\" Lisa stated.

Now listen up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa just nods, eyes wide open in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since you were younger you have thought bad of anybody with a little bit more weight then you. Now you have come to this town, ready to make a story for a newspaper that will belittle this town and everybody in it. I think it is time you were taught a lesson and a permanent one at that. This might seem like a harsh punishment but I'm sure you will learn that it isn't as bad as it seems. You know the details of the curse, I made sure that cab driver would tell you even if he didn't realise he was being so specific. Your going to be fat my dear, you won't start off as obese as the current residents of the town but it isn't going to be hard to catch up with your new eating habits and your new metabolism. You might even end up bigger, now wouldn't that be ironic? People will think you have always been fat and that the way you gain weight is completely natural. So dear, are you ready?\" The witch say's calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? No! Your crazy! This is just a dream, I'm not really stuck to the bench, I can wake up. This isn't really happening!\" Lisa protests once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but I'm afraid it is. Kiss goodbye to your nice slim body there. You are not going to see it again!

I thought it would be fitting to use something you would call disgusting after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the woman pushes it towards Lisa's mouth.

A delicious one with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought triggered her hunger and a desire for donuts. She never had some for breakfast before, not even a bagle; she decided to call the receptionist and ask for some breakfast. Luckily, she saw that the menu was offering donuts. She ordered two boxes of them; she was stunned when she hang up that she had ordered so many; she blurted out two dozen without realizing it. However, she was starting to have hunger pains and that chased away those thoughts. She was now eager to eat, even if she resoleved to not eat everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist is eager to bring her donuts; she hadn't realized what had happened (she didn't believe in the curse), but she felt satisfied bringing two boxes full of donuts to that snobby strangers, whose glance had made her feel so ashamed at herself.

She then had the pie slices; when she realized how much she had eaten, she felt horribly embarassed. \"If I continue like this, I'll end up like those... animals!!\" she exclaimed herself.

She can't quite figure out why. She slowly sits up then yawns and stretches. After that, she goes to take a shower. She still can't figure out why her body feels different though. She still looks just as trim and sexy as ever so she forces herself to put it out of her mind. Like some people, Lisa always has trouble remembering her dreams and that strange one was no exception. The details were already starting to become hazy. Lisa finishes her shower then gets dressed. By the time she's done, the dream is almost entirely forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mourning routine over with, Lisa decides that she needs to plan out her approach to this investigation. An experienced journalist like her knows that she'll never find the real story if she doesn't come up with a plan first. She pulls out a pencil and a pad of paper to scribble down ideas. She chews on the end of the pencil for a moment as she thinks. Lisa's thoughts are soon interrupted by a very loud gurgling grumble from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Lisa moans in discomfort, \"When did I last get something to eat? I've never felt so hungry before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa leaves her hotel room and spots a vending machine in the hallway. She practically drools as she shoves dollar after dollar into the machine. When she's done she has 15 candy bars. She gathers them all up and brings them back into her hotel room. She removes the wrapper on one of the bars and starts to eat as she goes back to planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes later Lisa tosses the last empty candy bar wrapper into the trash. Oddly enough she doesn't even seem to fully realize that she just ate 15 fattening candy bars. Lisa wipes the gooey chocolate stains off her mouth then licks her fingers clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time wasn't completely wasted though. Lisa has come up with several ideas. Since she's investigating why everyone in this town is so big she should start her investigation either at one of the many nearby restaurants or at the local grocery store.

Looking at the menu, she was perplexed by what was known only as a QBCB.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that...?\", she wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl next to Lisa answered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ol' QBCBG.

Here, I'll order ya one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4 QBCBGs, 5 XL chocolate shakes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, the food crime was set between Lisa and the girl. \"Name's Jenna,\" she said, wolfing down on her gargantuan meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nice to meet you, Jenna.\" Lisa was really hungry, so she ate her meal too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna had just finished her first two orders of QBCBGs, and Lisa was still unbelievably hungry, so she reached for the last plate as soon as Jenna did. Their hands met, in what could be described as the least romantic way possibly conceivable. Lisa quickly retracted her hand in disgust, then snatched the plate and started gobbling her food. Lisa then ordered dessert- 5 large deep-fried chocolate fudge cakes. Jenna was surprised that Lisa suddenly was eating so much, but she took 2 of the cakes anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a competitive eater.

He was tentivly wolfing down food as well, but doing so with a nervous face and looking as at his date every few second who looked back at him seductivly as though to encourage him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed the burger she was eating whole then went over to interview the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Excuse me, I'm a reporter from out of town and I'd like to interview you two.

From Ohio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh!\" The girl tells her partner, lifting up more food on a spoon and forcing it into his mouth, she turns to Lisa and looks apologetic \"You'll have to forgive him, he was talking when he should be eating!\" The girl grabs his arm and stretches it out for Lisa to see. \"See this? Nothing!  But don't worry by the time I'm done fattening himup I'll be the skinny one next to him, just like iy should be. Here, honey, have another 3 burgers, and then we can orger up a few dozen cakes.

His girlfriend smiles and rubs his strangly unbloated stomach despite all the food gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you do for entertainment?\" Asked Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat,\" said the girl as though it was obvious. feeding her man a spoonful of what looks to be chocolate pudding. \"24 hours a day, seven days a week without rest. How else are we supposed to maintain such amazing figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa notices that the boy doesn't look like he wants the pudding, and appears to be about to say he doesn't want it, but a pained look passes over him and he rubs his stomach slightly before opening his mouth to let the food in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well theyre are other things, we hae a pretty active theatre group for example.\" He said between bites of force fed pudding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shows are on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy is about to speak, but a particularly big spoon of pudding silences him. \"Shush dear. Just you focus on eating while I talk to her. You'll never get fat enough if you don't keep eating.\" She says while stuffing him like a goose. \"He keeps trying to cheat on his diet for some reason.\" She sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's got to eat at least 8000 calories a day. A little more than the average around here, but I, and my parents both agree that we won't take the next step until he's at least fat enough to fit into my dads old tux. This diet will fatten him up in no time\" The boy is silent, as she feeds him more and more. \"Come on dear, my parents already don't like you. Don't make this worse by resisting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's mouth is filled with gooey chocolate, he swallows but his girlfriend fills it back up before he can get a word out. He swallows again and avoids more so he can speak \"Well, they basiically recast all the shows your familiar with, only *gulp, enough*, they're recast with obese actors. I guess this is to make the population feel *mph, you shoved the spoon to far back* better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Interesting.

It was the first compliment she could think of at that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, it used to be my dad's, but he ditched it and got a new one.\" At the mention of her father, the boyfriend quickly looks uncomfortable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive to her house, though, is short- Lisa was sure that the proximity to restaurants couldn't have been a coincidence, and, through a brief, if Maria- dominated conversation, she found out that the closeness actually increased property value. An interesting piece of information, she thought. Well, a relatively boring piece of information actually. But, hey, I'm hardly writing this report for quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived, Lisa noticed that the house was impressive, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do your parents do for a living?\", asked Lisa, when they got into what was probably the family room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was already walking to the kitchen. \"My dad's a big-time employee at the bank here,\" she said, opening what looked like an oversized bag of chips, and pouring them into a bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those?\" Lisa hadn't seen any bag that size for snacks before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cookies. Want some?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked in the bowl, and she saw that the bag was indeed full of chocolate chip cookies. Not mini-size ones, either. It was a snack bag of maybe 40 normal-sized ones! Something about that disgusted her- not least because of the calorie content of such a meal. But, disgust aside, she was still starving. \"Hell yeah!\" Lisa took a handful and greedily wolfed it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were delicious, especially for store-bought eats. Rich, and chocolatey goodness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter realizing what she'd done, she wasn't sure whether to be more ashamed of her gluttony or her manners. But looking up, Maria didn't seem too fazed. This was, of course, normal for this town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, not so fast\", Maria said gingerly. \"They're mostly for my boyfriend, so don't eat too many, ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa suddenly realized part of the reason that she was so creeped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your boyfriend's name? I don't think he's said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy opened his mouth to speak, but Maria shoved a cookie down his throat. \"Now now, sweetie, you know you're meant to be eating, right? Sorry. His name's Chip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was a little relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you people read? Like is there a town newspaper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" said Maria, looking at Chip, silently demanding him to eat more. \"it's called 'Chewing the Fat'. All the latest gossip and stuff. Here, there's a copy on the table if you want to read it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked where Maria had pointed, and found a colourful magazine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm. So, Chip. Why did you come here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip was about to put down his next cookie, but Maria stopped him. \"How many times to I have to tell you this?\" She looked at Lisa.<br>\r\n\"He never seems to learn. Now darling, just keep stuffing your little face. If you want to talk, just talk with your mouth full, like normal people. Like, say, my brother. How else are you going to keep putting on weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip showed visible disgust at the prospect, but he caved into Maria's pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wall, my barends mobed here, ash I shed, cubblob monfs 'go, an'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa listened with pity as the boy could hardly stop. She only wrote in her notebook what she could hear, and even then just so that he would feel less bad about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" An obvious lie. \"Listen, I'd love to continue the interview, but I'm famished, and Chip over here's eaten all of the cookies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's no problem! You can have supper with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa considered. \"I'm not sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You can think about it, I'm off to do something. Shouldn't take too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Maria left the room, motioning for Chip to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took a look at that magazine she'd been curious to check out. She looked at some of the headlines, to write them down later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buses- the new way to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's hot and who's not- the large, lovely ladies of fashion\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you might be losing money right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tips on padding your waistline over the Summer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best and worst beach bodies\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa found that many of the bodies did look in fact quite impressive, and some were actually disgusting. Flipping through the magazine to the article, she noticed that, as she should have suspected, the huge bodies were \"best\" and the slender girls \"worst\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, she spurned the shallowness of the magazine. \"Only in this crazy town\", she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she stay for dinner?</span></div></div>",

As in three plates!?\" These plates were positivly loaded with food. Whole roast duck, candied yams. Ribs. Cheese soups. Three tier cakes amd whole bowls of buttercream pudding just to start with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dear. Three carts. All for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Cart's!' Thats when she got a good look. Each cart had a specific kind of dish on it. Sides, main and desserts. Each one enough to fill up a regular person on one plate. Yet a total of 12 plates where put down in front of each person for their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the sound of plates being set down stopped the sounds of cutlery and consumption started. Al around the table the family with politly demolishing the meal put in fron of them. Maria ate a lasagne for two in minutes, Patty all but upended a plate of swedish meatballs into her mouth, Mac stripped a chicken to the bone before moving onto a pot roast while Kurt who she could hardly take her eyes off worked through a huge rack of ribs all without getting a drop of sauce anywhere but his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winked at her. She blushed a little and looked away in the direction of Chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor guy. She couldn actually see tear tracks run down his face while he was spooning butter yellow mashed potatoes into his mouth beforewolfing down a sausage as thick as a fist. Maria saw this and pulled another plate in fron of him and then snapped her fingers. The empty plate was pulled away and actually replaced by a huge plate of omlettes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to eat more than us if you want to catch up with the boys. Right daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Mumbled Mac between mouthfuls of t-bone. \"No runt who can see his feet is going to marry my big girl unless he can fill out these!\" He snapped his pants waistline for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Dad. Were already looking at mobility scooters for later on. I'll have him fattened up into a real Cobbler in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw that's my girl, thinking about her mans well being so much.\" Patty cooed. \"Moorworth another plate of Cumberlands for Chip if you would, extra sauce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob in a tux complied and left, no one caring in the least about the tear strwaked face of the boy they were refering to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa watched the entire exchange carefully. Unaware of anything else until attention was focused on her. \"Thats what I like to see! An out of towner with a real appitite.\" Said atty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was confused until she looked at her own plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd eaten half.....but that couldn't be right......she was still so hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started on the duck. Slowly cutting off meat and eating waiting for herself to fill up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate the whole thing in ten minutes and felt barely any fuller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could learn a thing or two from this girl boy. You don't see her fighting fate and cutting back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting fate....she'd file that away for after dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....\" She said between bites. \"...About my interview.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutly.\" Piped up Kurt for the first time. \"I'd tell a girl like you anything you want to know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa found herself heating up, and her hunger slowly growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but after dinner ok gorgeous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded quickly and ate with new gusto, both to bring the interview that much closer and to fill her increasing hunger.</span></div></div>",

Not a lot for a Barlow girl. But I'm guessing your new.

Piled high onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa tried to look dignified, but she was still stuffing her face. Chip had more self control, although his willpower was apparently being sapped as the enormous pile in front of him shrank. Maria ate slowly but surely. Naturally, she finished first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, honey, let me help you. Open wide!\", she said, taking a large handful after handful of fries and shoving it down his mouth. She was clearly having fun, and trying to get him to enjoy it as well. However, he was uneasy as ever. \"And chew, and have some shake. Good boy!\" Lisa watched with a bizarre morbid fascination as she fed him the monsterously huge meal meal, looking up between big bites of cheeseburger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lisa, where are you from exactly?\" asked Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleveland.\" Lisa started eating her second sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you like it there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anybody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip snickered as Maria fed him more meat covered fries. The joke seemed to pass over her head. Probably because this is an isolated culture, Lisa thought. Or maybe the joke was just lame. She didn't really care. She finished her second sundae and sat back. Unbelieving that she had ate more in one sitting than she would throughout a day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Maria finished stuffing Chip the fattiest food she'd ever seen food they lay back in their seats to digest it, Chip got up, she noticed Chips stomach was clearly distended, he took a few steps with the clear signs of a slight waddle before Maria pulled him back into his seat. As wiped away any food from their faces the waitress came over again,\"I take it you enjoyed my mans food,\" she said, with a giggle. Lisa nodded, face turning red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good, wasn't it?\" Maria asked, rubbing Chip's bloated belly. \"You did good, finishing all that. I'm proud.\" She kissed him on the cheek. \"Now then.....what do you want for seconds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip moaned, partially in stomach pains, and partially in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo did Lisa, Though not as loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later and three more lots after seconds you could have rolled Lisa and Chip out. It was a miracle they hadn't exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria loaded the two moaning out of towners onto her van and drove off.....</span></div></div>",

About the same weight but significantly less round, though only because instead of her belly her excess weight seemed to focus in her rear and chest. \"I'll handle Ms Maria just to see if theres been any small changes. While you bring out the suit. I loath to say this but he shouldn't need to change ut of his current outfit yet to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I bring out the petit four cart ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you even need to ask?\" Diane turned to look quizically at Lisa \"And this rail thin young thing is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A reporter doing a piece on the town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A reporter?!\" Diana nearly squaked, before collecting herself \"Well then why didn't you say so? Have you eaten dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa didn't even get a chance to decline before Maria butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like twenty minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana nodded \"ASo no then. Your in for a treat dear. Feel free to snack at your leisure while we take these two away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded as a cart loaded up with cakes that could only be considered 'petit fours' in a town like this. Eclairs as big as fully loaded hot dogs. French fancies the size of pies. Napoleons as big as BLT's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw one of the attendants look at her oddly, she picked up one of the cream cakes and slowly started nibbling on an edge to get her to look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's managed to work ehr way through the cake at a sedae pace before the two came back out.....and suddenly she had a clear view of the kind of future that awaited Chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's dress was gorgeous. White with lots of trim and lace. No diamonds but pearls woven into intircate patterns dotted the cuffs and formed patterns around her huge round stomach like a globe of the constellations. Maria was obese, yet the dress drew out the fact that if it wasn't for her massive weight she could have been a supermodel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip by contrast looked terrible in his suit. However it wasn't because of his appearance. Chip was quite handsome despite his slow weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked terrible in it because it hung off him like a kid wearing his fathers suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just baggy. It was like he was wearing a parachute. He could easily fit both legs into one. The jacket hung off his shoulders so much that even fully done up they needed to hold it up for him as they took measurements and tutted. His eyes full of pain, and his mouth full of cake from one of the girls pressing an eclair up against his mouth with a firm expression silently telling him that him eating was not an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria frowned. Diana tutted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear what going on with you two. I mean I don't expect miracles but he shouldbe at least big enough that it won't slip off him by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria shook her head \"I just don't know whats going on.I did everything mom said to do. He doesn't excercise. I make sure he's full up all day. Mom said dad had a problem holding weight in the begining until his metabolism adjusted, but my Chip's body just refuses to bulk up the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say.\" Diana nodded her head \"By the point in their relationship your mother had your father almost bulging out of a suit of similiar size. He was a hundred pounds heavier than her by the time they got married.\" She sniffed the air \"You know tradition. He doesn't have to be that much heavier than you. But no wedding until the boy is fatter than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at the guy who nobody but her paid any mind to how miserable he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep at it dear. Soon he'll start fattening up properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gave her a sad look and nodded. Pulling her husband to be out of his suit and heading through the door. Lisa following soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember to put a word in for us when your writing up the article miss.\" Diana said sweetly \"And if you ever manage to find your special someone in town we do fabulous rates for out of towners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded slowly and backed out. Heading for the van were she found Maria already buckled up and Chip already snacking from a pile of candy in the glove box....</span></div></div>",

I LOVE that place!\" Maria had a huge smile on her face. \"Plus, plenty of calories to fill up Chip\", she said, throwing a large arm around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went in, the smell of fried food overwhelmed Lisa. \"Oh my goodness that smells good\", she muttered, in a single breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and Maria took their orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa went first.<br>\r\n\"I'd like some fries and a cheeseburger. Wait, no, 2 cheeseburgers. No, 3. 5. Yeah, 5, and supersize those fries please!. Also 2 hot fudge sundaes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" The lady at the counter was a tall, pear-shaped girl with dark hair down to her huge hips. Lisa reckoned that she was maybe 300 pounds, but that didn't seem so huge after a few days being in this town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're Tracy?\" Lisa asked, reading her nametag. \"I thought that that was, just, you know, the name of a chain or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy snickered. \"Um, no. Most restaurants in this town are personally or family owned. You're not from around here, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...\" Lisa was feeling more than a bit embarrassed. She looked out of place here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right!\" Tracy said, getting to work on the first few cheeseburgers. \"Every newcomer gets a little awkward here. Most of us don't trust tourists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria tapped on the counter, impatiently waiting to order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'd like 12 double bacon cheeseburgers, 9 supersize fries, and 6 chocolate milkshakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a lot. You trying to put on weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, no. Most of it's for my boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean that scrawny shrimp beside you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip blushed, a little incensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy, kid. You got yourself a real lady you know.\" She smiled sweetly. \"I'm sure she'll have you fattened up in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, shucks, don't flatter!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, don't be modest. You're doing him a huge favour. As a matter of fact, I'll let you eat for half price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet! Thanks, fry cook lady!\" Lisa was pretty happy about not having to pay so much for the huge meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pay for yours, too,\" said Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa tried to look dignified, but she was still stuffing her face. Chip had more self control, although his willpower was apparently being sapped. Maria ate slowly but surely. Naturally, she finished first.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Here, honey, let me help you. Open wide!\", she said, taking a large handful  after handful of fries and shoving it down his mouth. She was clearly having fun, and trying to get him to enjoy it as well. However, he was uneasy as ever. \"And chew, and have some shake. Good boy!\" Lisa watched with a bizarre morbid fascination as she fed him the entire meal, looking up between big bites of cheeseburger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lisa, where are you from exactly?\" asked Maria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cleveland.\" Lisa started eating her second sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you like it there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anybody?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip snickered as Maria fed him more fries. The joke seemed to pass over her head. Probably because this is an isolated culture, Lisa thought. Or maybe the joke was just lame. She didn't really care. She finished her second sundae and sat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt pressure building up inside her. Everything she'd been taught about being ladylike back home told her to hold back, but she couldn't resist letting out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately she was ashamed of herself, although only Chip looked at her strangely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Maria finished stuffing Chip full of fast food, everyone got up, even if Chip was walking a little funny. As they were walking out, Tracy called to Lisa. \"I take it you appreciate my food,\" she said, with a giggle. Lisa nodded, face turning red. \"Come here again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably the most embarrassing lunch she ever had, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good, wasn't it?\" Maria asked, rubbing Chip's bloated belly. \"You did good, finishing all that. I'm proud.\" She kissed him on the cheek. \"Next week we up your calorie intake by 1000 calories per day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip moaned, partially in stomach pains, and partially in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext stop was the pool. Lisa was excited about it, even if Maria was a little reluctant. Chip pressured her to give in, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa went in though, she noticed:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, are you coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Chip, calling from outside the changeroom. Lisa was putting on a one-piece number she'd found shopping in South Barkalow. It was the smallest she could find, but it was extremely loose on her. She decided to buy it, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was <b>tight</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa let out a gasp. \"Yeah, just wait a minute!\" It was cool, she was just eating a lot. She just needed to cut back on the eating and she'd be fine. She pulled it against her until it fit well enough. \"Ok, I'm out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa jumped into the water, splashing water everywhere. It was the first exercise she'd gotten in a while. She'd be needing it, she reasoned. As she swam towards Chip, who was waving his hands and grinning, water made the swimsuit cling to her body, showing off every curve, contour, and bulge. Normally, she wouldn't mind the effect, she had a certain pride about showing off her body. However, her once-flat, toned waist had softened and , while she was still thin, slight bulges were visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople gave her funny looks. She worried for a second that they were seeing her new fat. But overhearing murmurs, she found that the few people looking were remarking on how skinny she was. She felt some relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed something floating in the water. Upon inspection, it was...some kind of tray...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear no. It couldn't be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was indeed, a flotation device for snacks. Lisa sighed in shame for the sheer gluttony of it all. Almost all the swimmers were carrying one. Around Maria floated three. After Chip had dived and swam around for a while, Maria pointed him to his tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dear, you know you shouldn't be exercising that hard. Relax....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she put a large arm around him, stroking his back and shoulders until he loosened up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now, just float....good. Remember, don't lose too many calories. Why don't you have some of this to make up for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floated the tray over to Chip. He looked at it hungrily, then took a handful of french fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor guy. Can hardly resist, and that girl's sapping at what willpower he has. While Lisa treaded water, trying to be as active as possible, she found herself drawn to the junk food too. She grabbed a tray, and found some chicken fingers. She munched on them , hunger overtaking her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her 6th, she suddenly recoiled. What the hell was she doing? She needed to lose weight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately started racing around the pool, swimming with all her energy before quickly cramping up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChip was still eating away at the french fries, and Maria scarfed down some kind of pizza, only pausing every few seconds to encourage Chip to eat more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recovering, Lisa swam around more, to find people to interview. She found out that the trays had been in use since 13 years ago, and that this was the only major pool in South Barkalow. In addition, she found that swimming, asides from sumo wrestling, was the only major sport of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of the pool, wrote down in her water-proof notebook what she had learned, and rested for a short while in a plastic white chair. After thinking for a while, she looked around, and grinned. All these people were built like blobs....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHO HERE IS THE BEST SWIMMER IN THE POOL?\" she yelled. Everyone was staring. Not only was she out of place physically, she'd brought even more attention to herself with the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man who appeared to be in his thirties, with a relatively buff (Veeery relatively) physique, raised his hand, and then got out of the water. \"I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you're better than me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man paused. Everyone was looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\" Lisa was going to show off how fit she was, and get some good exercise too. \"Race from one end of the pool to the other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa jumped in the pool, and the man slid in next to her, making sure they were at roughly the same spot. An enormous old man rose up and offered to be the referee, as he ran to the end of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Set...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wasn't sure if she could win this. He seemed very confident given his size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO!\"</span></div></div>",

Lisa managed to outswim him easily enough, her lean body and practice at swimming allowing her to swim faster and more gracefully than the old man's clunky, slow strokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, she touched the end of the pool. Her challenger lay roughly 12 metres behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we have a winner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe referee held Lisa's arm up from the water. There were cheers, although perhaps not so enthusiastic given that sports weren't big here. Lisa smiled. It felt good to be the thinnest person here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss goodbye to your nice slim body there. You're not going to see it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about her body reminded Lisa of that nightmare. She shuddered at the thought of getting anywhere near as fat as these people. Looking around, she noticed that Maria and Chip weren't in the pool. She put on a towel and went looking for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching for a few minutes, her stomach growled. It felt like she hadn't eaten in days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went over to the almost mandatory snack bar. When it was her turn in line (which took some time), she gazed up at the menu, and fished some bills out of her wallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like 2 chili cheese hotdogs, and a large poutine, with a large coke. Oh, and a mini-pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be $7.95 please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh the bargains this place had. Lisa put her bills back and dropped some coins down on the counter. She then sat down at a table, waiting for food, and got out her notebook. \"Food is a fraction of the price- cheap to make, and in such high demand that it's profitable at almost any price, as long as it's affordable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are. Hiya!\" Maria's singsong voice came from another table, stacked with food. Chip walked with Maria to Lisa's table, and patted her on the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great! Nice swimming there!\"  <br>\r\n\"It was pretty good. A little unladylike, but still impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wasn't sure whether to take Maria's words as a compliment or insults, but she assumed they were at least positive. \"Thanks. I, uh, practiced a lot when I was a kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria stared at her, as if to disbelieve the idea. \"Ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you're so skinny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa blushed. It was flattering, even if she was looking at her strangely.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's part of the reason. That and limiting what I eat.\"<br>\r\nMaria narrowed her eyes and smirked. \"Limiting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's meal arrived. The hotdogs were enormous, over half a foot long each. The poutine was smothered in cheese and gravy. Even the mini pizza was only slightly half the size of a normal one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, mostly. I figured I'd treat myself for winning.\"<br>\r\n\"As far as I can tell, you hardly stop eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was halfway done her first hot dog, fast eater that she was. Maria was right. But she was hungry enough that it didn't matter. Besides, she had a high metabolism, and she could diet anything she gained off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, no need to get defensive. In fact, I admire your appetite. As a matter of fact...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He treated the women like secretaries and the men like furniture. Whenever he walked into the room any and all conversation turned to being all about him. She being a rather attractive women had bared a brunt of his advances and even after repeated and very blunt refusals he couldn't get it through his fat head that she wouldn't go out with him, even if he really did ask her to go out instead of straight to third base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew the idiot would be fired anywhere else, but his rich relatives owned a fair share of the business ensured him employment. Which she suspected was so he wouldn't be around them so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe actually hadn't been seen for quite some time to which many an un-pinched ass in the office was grateful for. He was just sent assignments via phone and e-mail, everyone was happier for it and no one bothered to ask about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now though her mind had hiccuped a little, thoughts of nearly all of Larry misdeeds were temporarily forgotten. Due to one of the biggest asses she knew now having one of the the biggest asses she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away she knew that 'this' was what Maria was aiming for with Chip. He sat in what looked more like a solid column of steel rather than a typical barstool. He was easily 500 pounds with no signs of stopping judging from the large stack of empty wrappers and plates next to him. His huge gut flopping out over a pair of industrial strength swim shorts that looked like sausage casing over his thick legs. His prominent double chin was just starting to rest on his developed man rack all of which wobbled and jiggled every time he opened his mouth for more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa? LISA!!! Babe! I didn't recognise your tight little ass for a second. Guess because ya ain't got such a tight little ass any more ay?\u201d He laughed in between bites. Several people around him edged away unconsciously, appreciation for fat was one thing but that was just crude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLarry.\u201d She said icely and deliberately. He flinched, hating people using the common nickname rather than his full title. \u201cWhat are you doing here? I find it very unlikely that the chief would assign his 'biggest' star reporter to help cover an interest story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it ain't about you.\u201d He wolfed down a chilli dog in three bites. \u201cI've been staying here for the past couple of months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Months?!' He looked like he shoved a haystack under his skin and all that in a few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was funny really. Car broke down on my way back from the last celebrity scandal I did. You know....that really skinny girl....doing..who cares. Anyway I was driving back when my car broke down here in South Barlow. Guy said it would be four days before it was fixed......\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd by the time it was fixed you didn't want to leave.\u201d She fixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELL NO!!!\u201d He cheered while ordering more. \u201cYou seen this place. Food flows like water! And if you look right it can start raining bitches! Watch. This, hey Amy, Tyra get your luscious backsides over here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo women came up to the snack bar that were far from what she'd last seen Larry with. The last female she'd seen him with had breast the size of bowling balls, the IQ of a sandwich and a waist small enough that you could wrap your hands around it and have your fingers lock together. These two looked like they could eat that girl and still have room for thirds and fourths. The two four hundred pounders swayed (in more ways than one) up to either side of the whale of a man, giggling as they did so. The Coco skinned girl in the purple bikini playing with his cavernous bellybutton while drawing another dog up to his waiting maw while Amy rubbed his shoulders whispering things to him that Lisa could vaguely make out as encouragement to get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know I know. Not what I had on my arm last time right. But I didn't think I'd be into big girls either till these babes showed me the light. And the buffet.\u201d The two laughed with him while continuing their ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's nice Larry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLawrence.\u201d Amy corrected in a French accent. Glaring daggers at Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know it.\u201d He said dreamily. \u201cThough if you want I'm always game for a foursome. Just put some more meat on that skinny ass like you\u2019ve been doing and maybe you can be lucky lady number three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered. \u201cThanks.....I'll.....think about it.\u201d You said back your way back to Maria and Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn right you will.\u201d He said before turning back to his lady friends just as the next his next massive order was planted down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa made it back to the table and sat down processing what she'd seen. Larry Desmond, who'd once caused a girl to quit after endless teasing over gain a few pounds was now a beached whale, surrounded by girls who he would have denied the existence of and lavishing in their attention while they made him an even bigger pain than he already was, and all this in a few short months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at your two new friends for a moment to see Maria talking to a paling Chip. With her stealing obvious glances at Larry  several times and even pointing at him once before looking back at Chip. Her intentions clear while she mimicked Tyra and continued feeding her man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Chip. If Larry\u2019s story really did check out then she could practically hear the wedding bells already.</span></div></div>",

So, how goes finding a new girlfriend? Work out well for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you live here now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Moved here last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa lowered her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how goes the diet? Didn't go too well, I see? Did you get this fat, then come here because you would fit in? Or was all the food around here just too much for you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so sweet. Remind me why we broke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let me jog your memory. You decided to completely let yourself go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And proud of it,\" Kat said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at her in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"You used to be skinny, athletic, and hot. Then you didn't work out as hard, you stopped dieting, and got chunky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got less shallow. Apparently you didn't. I'm happy with my body. I was happy with you, but apparently looks are just that important to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a shame that you let your figure go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waste? Hey everyone, is this figure a waste?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and stood up in the light. She was just a little less than medium height, with short dark hair. She was dressed casually, in a sweatshirt and sweatpants that were big even on her. As she got out of her seat, her legs moved differently than normal. Her thighs were thicker and she now had a huge prodigious belly. While she used to be flat-chested, she was considerably more buxom, although her clothes made it hard to initially tell. Her arms were thick and doughy. Not a trace of muscle was visible. Lisa thought that her face actually looked even younger than before. She now sported a double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYells of \"No!\" and the like echoed through the room, and there were even a few wolf-whistles. Lisa was slightly pissed. She didn't like that her ex getting more attention than her, and she definitely didn't like that people were looking at her like that, even if Lisa didn't find her attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? In this town, you have dignity! You can be happy at any size, and no one's going to look down on you for it! Besides, most people here don't mind a few pounds on someone.\" She looked at Lisa, head turned slightly. \"Say, you know, you got awfully mad when I gained just a little weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to keep getting fatter and fatter until you look like a pig, fine! But I don't want to be in a relationship with someone who cares less about her looks than her gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. You know what I saw you eating? A huge tray of junk food. With a large cup of soda. And, well, let me tell you. That's not the type of meal a slim spartan girl would eat. That's not the type of meal a normal girl would eat. I think that's more than I've ever eaten after lunch.\" She paused, thinking. \"I have friends here who are, like, 500 pounds. Most of them wouldn't eat that much regularly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa froze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And believe me, it's starting to show.\" She poked Lisa's gut. \"But you eat as much as you like. You're a growing girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stormed off, red as a tomato, back to her table. Chip was just finishing up a snack. \"Are you finishing that?\" Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, split it between yourself and Chip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Did that girl spoil your appetite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, after some idle chat between Lisa and Maria, the couple had finished Lisa's food. Chip groaned as Maria happily rubbed Chip's belly, which was quite bloated. Maria did some mental math. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you know, you're really helping with Chip's diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, today, with you around, he's already 600 calories over his daily amount, and he hasn't even had supper yet. I guess you're a really positive influence. See Chip, at the rate your going, 1000 more calories a day is gonna be easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa didn't know how to respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was lots of fun, going out like this. We should do this again sometime!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa walked down the road, looking for somebody who might not be eating and thus would have some time to talk. It was an inordinately long search, but she did manage to find somebody. He wore a baseball cap and sunglasses, and only part of his face was visible. He was tall, wearing a red jacket, and most of his weight was carried in his paunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the library's on 1355 Davidson. You just take two rights from here, and then it's near Frank's Furters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wrote this information down hurriedly. \"Thank you for your time.\" She then ran to the library to see if it was still open. Fortunately, closing time was 2 hours from now. She entered, wondering what was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library had a green floor and cream-coloured wallpaper. Bookshelves were relatively few. A father read some book to his three kids, something about a fox. Nothing she'd ever heard of. A small group of teens dressed in black clothes sat reading comics. Lisa furtively took a glance. The artwork wasn't conventional western style, nor was it manga or the like. It was some distinct style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took a look at some books on the shelves. After a while of idle browsing, she found a book that she liked when she was younger. She flipped through it. As she was reading, she noticed something peculiar. At one point in the book, when the protagonist puts on clothes, she's described as a size 36. Lisa wondered how well she had actually read the book in the first place. She looked for another mention of weight. Again, she found that the protagonist was 328 pounds. This was definitely off. Lisa was sure that she was thinner. But....the book was the same! It looked the same, same title, same cover....she put it down and scribbled in her notebook to check up on the books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to the librarian. He was quite young. He wore a grey, smooth shirt and sported reading glasses. His skin was soft and pale, and his hair was very dark, but reasonably well-kept. He was a blob of a boy, easily 500 pounds. He looked at Lisa intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? How can I help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'd like to know if there are any books on this town's history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a tourist.\" His initial interest in this newcomer faded. \"Go to non-fiction, section 517.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLIsa felt a bit brushed off, but went there anyway. She selected the largest, most comprehensive work in the section, and opened it up. She read quickly, skipping over what seemed unimportant, for there was a lot to cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouth Barkalow...founded near the end of the 19th century. Lisa read with shock. Slavery, public hangings, a long list of hate crimes. The incriminating list resonated with dissonance to what she saw: a friendly, folksy, town that was almost progressive, in spite of its traditions and attitudes towards food. She saw a photograph of a witch trial (did they even do those then? Lisa was unsure whether this was normal for the day or specific to South Barkalow, and jotted down to look that up). A middle aged woman, falsely accused of cursing the populace. The people in the photo were thin- all of them. They wore expressions mean as wolves. Lisa thought that the convicted witch looked vaguely like the woman she dreamed of. But it seemed too old- they were thin, and for them to have noticed any curse, they would have to be larger. Assuming this person actually existed, perhaps she was a relative of the hanged witch. A mother or aunt, perhaps. But then, the question was not whether she was a witch, but what she did to the townsfolk.. it was all a puzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa read on. Thanks to a mix of activism and general changes to attitudes, the town gradually became more liberal. It abolished slavery and later quit using the death penalty, eventually rising up to similar standards as the rest of the \"developed world\". She flipped through photos. Thin, thin, thin....then, in the mid-60's, Lisa suddenly saw large amounts of obese citizens. The photo was dated 1966.  Lisa jotted down the date and its significance. Fascinating! Perhaps the curse had something to it. Either way, now she knew when it started getting so fat. Definitely good to write about. She flipped to the index, looking for Rebecca Park.. She eventually  found a picture of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was of no modest size. She wore long brown hair (or at least it looked brown, it was a black and white photo), and had a jowly, puffed-up face. Her neck was almost nonexistent, engulfed by fat. All her features were engorged, her body a massive pear-shape. There was something dainty, almost pretty about her. Whatever it was, it wasn't complimented by her having to wear a large potato sack, which even then was stretched. Lisa looked at her in pity. She clearly was holding back sadness. She seemed young. Perhaps as young as 14 even, but she couldn't tell. A caption told that she was from a lower-class family. Lisa immediately wondered how she got so fat when she was so poor, but her wonder was dispelled just as quickly after reading that she had Prader-Willi syndrome,  causing her to gain weight easily, and her family ate mostly beef and corn. She was bullied relentlessly, and mocked publicly for a long time in the town, gaining a sort of infamy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa read more about 1966. The weight gain was at least acknowledged, and the curse cited as a possible reason, noting the name of the mayor, Mack Harding, who was the first to be told. However, it was dismissed as a rumour. A few years later, a gradual event occurred- the public, more and more, became not just accepting of fat, but embracing it. By the 70s, slim people were stigmatized. It figured. They learned as much of a lesson as one could expect them to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter jotting down the last of the details, Lisa put down the book. She'd spent a little more than an hour reading, and she had other things to find out. This library provided plenty of new topics, but which one to pick?</span></div></div>",

What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I read some of these books back in Pennsylvania. I think the characters were, ah, thinner. Did you notice that at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe librarian looked at her like she'd told him the moon was made out of cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't say I do...I was born and raised here, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo not much progress from the librarian. Lisa took a look at other nonfiction books. Most of these were cookbooks, although there was a selection, it wasn't huge. She flipped through a cookbook that was uniquely South Barkalow's. Most of these recipes made her jaw drop. Deep-fried jumbo hot dogs covered in bacon wrapped inside a pancake, covered in chocolate? Quadruple cream cheese chocolate fudge cake? Fried banana marshmallow pie? Lisa wasn't sure whether they made her more disgusted or hungry. After all, given her appetite, she could eat any of these. She put it away. Such temptation couldn't be good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paced around the library, looking for someone to talk to about the books. She asked children and adults alike, but no one had any clue what she was talking about. She was about to give up on that topic when she heard a faint and covered sneeze. She looked around, unsure where it had came from. It sounded close. She checked around a bookshelf, and noticed a girl sitting up behind it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had red hair in a ponytail, and wore thin reading glasses. She loosely wore a blue jacket around a white shirt, and was wearing faded jeans. She glanced up at Lisa with wide green eyes. She had a very slight frame, with little fat at all showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. Just looking around, trying to figure out something.\"<br>\r\nLisa was bothered by the silence. \"So, uh, what are you reading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl flipped the cover of the book to show Lisa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How to Gain Weight</i><br>\r\n<i>By Dr. Maurice Cheswick</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Uh, I see. You're not from around here, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came here last spring, from South Dakota.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"South Dakota? That's pretty far off, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. My father moved here as part of his business. He works in catering, and he's found good job opportunities here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. You like it here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not really.  I mean, most of the people are nice, and it's fine to live in, but...a lot of the girls at school pick on me for being skinny. Some of the boys too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What grade are you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYikes. Body image problems that young...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. I wouldn't worry. A lot of people are jerks in the junior years of high school.\" Lisa looked at her. \"Are you gaining weight because of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partially.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partially?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get a boyfriend or anything unless I gain weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and how's that going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, um, single.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was more curious about the weight stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good, as you can see. I can hardly gain a pound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Lisa was becoming increasingly intrigued. \"Even with all the junk food around for cheap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Honestly, I don't have a very big appetite. Most of the food here makes me kind of sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa paused, thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the people around here, what do you think of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're nice, generous, mostly, some are kind of good-looking...why do you need to know all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm a reporter, doing an article on this town. That, and, I kind of want to help out. I'm not from here either, as you can see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, thanks.\" The girl evidently wasn't sure what else to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you don't have to listen to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned her head upwards, curious. \"What?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You don't need to gain weight. Look at you, you're young, pretty, you have lots going for you. Why'd you want to get fat just so that people will like you?\" Lisa stood up straight and cleared her throat. \"And, besides which, any friends worth having wouldn't want to mess with your health! Same for any boyfriend. Sooner or later, you'll meet a gentleman and he won't try to fatten you up like a pig just so he'll love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blushed and smiled. It was a professionally done speech, Lisa thought, as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned her head back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to figure out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look like a big reader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever noticed that the books here are...different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl paused. \"Oh yes, I think I know what you're talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there isn't much time, and I don't totally understand, but... do you have a sheet of paper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Lisa, taking a page from her notebook, and a pen from her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl scribbled down something. \"Here, go to this address. Talk to the guy there, he'll know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The library is closing in 5 minutes.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, got to go. Thanks a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Hope you do well with your article.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa walked out of the library, a confident smile on her lips. She went back to her hotel room. When she got there, she moaned as her belly rumbled loudly. Suddenly, she had an idea. She took out her wallet, and removed all the money except for $8. Now, she couldn't afford to overeat even if she wanted to! She fixed herself a large salad with low calorie vinaigrette, and a glass of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took a taxi, which she realized was the same one as before when the cabby recognized her. \"Hey, young lady. How goes your little investigation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thanks. I need you to get me to here.\" She pulled out the address. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I can do that. So, how's life treating you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't believe my luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather not talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine. Say, you look healthier. Have you put on weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as a matter of fact. 12 pounds to be precise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't even been here a week. That's like more than 2 pounds a day! You must like the food here, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't really the reason per se, but she found it to be a large factor. \"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most people who come here do. Mind you, if they're not too busy gawking that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours, cab stopped in a lonely, narrow road, away from most of the town. It was quiet here, and there were only a couple buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are. Paradise lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa fished out the $6 fee. \"Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" The cab sped off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, wouldn't it be very odd if I mentioned in my article that books were being edited without the editions being cleared with the publishers? Or without notes that the books weren't originals? People might start worrying about the odd censorship. And other journalists might just investigate. Publishers might be interested to know, too.\" Lisa smiled. \"I think that it might be breaking a few laws.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wasn't sure exactly how big a deal that it was, or even if she was influential enough to warrant such a story getting out, but nonetheless, she didn't expect anything too suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is ridiculous! There's nothing illegal about what goes on here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Well, then, I suppose you might just show me. You know, just to avoid unnecessary trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man showed her into the building. It was poorly lit, and a humming noise could be easily heard. He opened a door, and motioned for Lisa to come inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a large computer. \"Wow, where'd you get this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Provided by the mayor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've programmed it to look through a database of all books that this town owns. We never use the actual books, just the text, which we keep on files. Anyway, this computer will look through all books containing at any point \"thin\" \"fat\" or any synonyms (which it has in its word bank) , any reference to weight or measurements of weight, and the word \"size\" when used within 200 words of any article of clothing or the word clothes, and then showing, through links to the pages and highlights, the word. Then, it's a simple matter of replacing the reference to weight with something less controversial to the town. See, watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa watched. Some fantasy novel she hadn't read appeared on the list, along with it's picture and information. The man clicked on it, and some stats popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fat: 0</i><br>\r\n<i>Synonyms: 5</i><br>\r\n<i>Thin: 0</i><br>\r\n<i>Synonyms: 2</i> <br>\r\n<i>Weight measurements: 0</i><br>\r\n<i>Apparent clothing sizes: 0</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then clicked on \"Synonyms\" under \"Fat\". Another window popped up, going directly to page 163. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhandel observed the troll. It was an ugly sight: a <span class=\"clred\">potbellied, distended </span>creature, with grey skin covered in warts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man clicked on the highlighted red text, and replaced it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhandel observed the troll. It was an ugly sight: a <span class=\"clred\">skeletal, gangly </span>creature, with grey skin covered in warts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then clicked the \"next\" button at the bottom of the page. The page changed to 212.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'I refuse to marry that creep!', said princess Salvina. He' s ugly, <span class=\"clred\">porcine</span>, and absolutely disgusting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEditing it, it became:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuse to marry that creep! He' s ugly, <span class=\"clred\">gaunt</span>, and absolutely disgusting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fervern had been feasting many days in the Southstorm palace, and he had grown quite <span class=\"clred\">plump</span> for all the rich food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't need editing, because at this point there's no negative reference to weight.\" The man then saved the changes, exited out of the window, and opened up \"Synonyms\" under \"thin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was brought instantly to page 49<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salvina, Lexmus could tell, was a beautiful creature- she had a <span class=\"clred\">delicate, slender</span> body, with supple skin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rewrote it as:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salvina, Lexmus could tell, was a beautiful creature- she had a <span class=\"clred\">soft, delightfully corpulent</span> body, with supple skin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think I get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I do this for every book that the town is thinking of approving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's impressive!\" Lisa said this earnestly. \"But, what if you missed something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that's the question, now. You see, the next step would be to write up all the changes made, perform a new search on the same book, and find all references to attractiveness, and then change it appropriately. Then, I look over my notes, and I look up the character that was changed, and then I edit each description of that character's body to fit in. Then I can list the book as approved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite a lot of work! What's the point of all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The point? The point is so that people here can read books knowing that they're not going to be offended. When you've got a population that's almost all obese, you take extra steps. It's part of a whole plan made by the mayor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mayor? He's the one behind all of this? Is he also changing the shows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. He's hiring people to change all pieces of media entering the town so that the town can be comfortable watching or reading anything without too much controversy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And all this is legal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! It' s all incognito deals between the town and publishers and networks. As for theatre, they just use local actors, and anything's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this sounds expensive. Where is this town getting the money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, most of it's from tourism and taxes on the food industry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...that explains a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for your time. Sorry for the trouble, you know, delaying that brilliant work of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I guess it can't be helped. No huge problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I write about what goes on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? I suppose you can mention it. But please be indirect. Definitely don't mention me, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa walked out of the building, after finishing her notes. This was working really well! She walked back for a while, then took a passing bus. She was less self-conscious about being watched now. She got off near her hotel, then walked in, and went back to her room. Once again she was hungry, and made herself some pasta. She felt like going to one of the vending machines and getting more chocolate bars, but she only had enough money on hand for 1. She wasn't totally sated, but she was fine. Good enough to go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Naturally, she was hungry again. But, she simply ordered some toast with low-fat margarine, and a bowl of fruit, with some milk. The waitress looked at her, as if to ask \"Seriously?\", but Lisa pretended not to notice. When she finished her breakfast, Lisa got to work typing on her computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">South Barkalow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica's Fattest Town</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrote up what she had seen, first contrasting the various types of restaurants (and related commercialism), and noting the lack of exercise. She mentioned, of course, that snacks were provided everywhere, even pushed on the residents, and there was a stigma on being thin equivalent to the stigma on obesity in the rest of America. She decided to emphasize that fact, making sure to allude to the case of Rebecca Park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had finished, which was around noon, she thought that it was masterful, at least for a rough copy. But it was time for lunch. She put another 5 dollars in her wallet, and went out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to go to the Nuclear Submarine. She was starving, again, but she only had the money for two footlong submarine sandwiches and a chocolate milk (this order was great for Lisa's waistline, since she would have eaten at least double that on a whim). She had lean meats and vegetables. As she looked at the preparation, she noticed, to her dismay, the sandwich-maker slathering on mayonaise. She consoled herself, noting that she had eaten only a small breakfast and could abstain from future snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate with gusto, wiping off mayonaise that dripped everywhere from the sandwiches. A morbidly obese family, eating even more per person, stared at her as if she was a bizarre new species. Yeah, you just keep staring, she thought, walking out through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then went jogging on an empty lane, the only one in town, bought years ago, and in disarray. She ran for an hour, then decided to rest in the shade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You been working out again, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuthemawho?\" Lisa scrambled to her feet, startled and only just noticing the imposing figure next to her. She rolled over. \"What the hell are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Public property.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Kat, look. We're through. Stop following me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. You just seemed lonely, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa narrowed her eyes. \"How did you know where I was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tagged along to your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit that's creepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it?\" Kat appeared indifferent. There was a silence. \"So, you're just staying to write this article?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pity. You could always stay for longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could...\" Lisa said through grit teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I bothering you? I could always go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's fine. Stay if you want, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. So, when do you leave? Soon, I s'pose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Today's my second last day on the job. I'm almost done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Well, I have stuff to do. I'll be off then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa breathed a sigh of relief. It was getting both more and less comfortable to be around Kat. She picked up her stuff, which wasn't much, and killed time on a walk, several onlookers noting her legs with silent but well-expressed disgust. It was mid-afternoon already, and Lisa felt hungry, despite having not enough cash to fuel her binges. She was proud of herself for sticking to such a rigorous and well thought-out diet plan. She proceeded straight to her hotel room, being already bored of the mostly eventless and draining day, and got to rewriting the article, replacing choppy bits with clearer paragraphs, and being more concise in her wording. By supper, she couldn't resist her hunger, and made herself a large plate of pasta with cheese from the ingredients in her room. She then proceeded to entertain herself by playing through various videos she had stored on her computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to retire to bed early before she got hungry again. Tomorrow's the last day, she thought to herself happily. I can go back to Pennsylvania after, and go back with the usual friends. Somehow, sleep came easier since the dream. She wasn't sure why. Was the dream real, or was it just all the food getting to her? It felt very real, but many dreams do. She went to sleep pondering the question, half-believing that she truly was cursed.</span></div></div>",

Once again she had a light breakfast, just some bacon and eggs. She only made enough to fill her up, and then it was time to get back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called over Maria. When she got there, it was already lunchtime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sorry I'm late!\" Maria said as she came in, arms full of bags and boxes of food. \" I was just treating Chip to a whole chicken in gravy. Here, I brought you some food.\"<br>\r\nShe put a brown paper bag on the kitchen counter. Lisa looked inside. A few slices of pizza. She touched them. Still warm. So, she immediately gobbled them down. \"Thanks! Now, ah, if you don't mind, we have some work to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa washed off her hands as Maria took a look at the article. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's interesting, I'll give you that,\" Maria said sweetly. \"But, it's a little weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showing her the specific oddities, Lisa assured her repeatedly that she didn't mind. \"Uh, that's, part of the paper's tone.\" A half-truth. It was just written from an outsider's perspective, as Lisa duly noted. The work was fairly dull, but after Maria proofread and edited it, it looked good enough to send in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa went to her wallet and fished out a few bills. \"Here,\" she said, \"$35 for your help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing,\" Maria said, making more clear than necessary how flattered she was, \"we'll call it practice and a favour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa silently put the money away. She didn't really want any if she was to be out anyways. Too much temptation....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you want to have some of this stuff? It's really good!\" Maria yelled over from the table, enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no thanks. I'm, uh, on a diet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria gave her a shocked look. \"That's not like you at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, normally I don't eat much....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. Afraid all the sweets are going to pad your hips?\" She grinned incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa reddened. \"Uh, sorta. I'm more worried about this gut though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her belly. Maria narrowed her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven by typical standards, it would be a huge stretch to say Lisa had anything like a gut. At most her belly was slightly convex. Muscles were only slightly padded. As a matter of fact, her weight gain had only pushed her a couple of pounds past an average weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that, you're very pretty! If anything, a little weight would look good on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took the compliments well, but the last sentence, she thought, would have had more influence on her if the speaker hadn't been over 200 pounds overweight (during a chat, Lisa had learned that she was 386 pounds), as well as busying herself eating half a dozen donuts in one sitting (the contents, Lisa saw, of one of the boxes).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you know you can't resist some of this pecan pie! It's my own special recipe. Chip can't get enough of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she thought, Chip couldn't get enough of anything. Lisa wasn't sure as to whether the quality needed to be that good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa winced. \"Uh, ok. I'll try some thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's skepticism over the taste of Maria's treats instantly faded. Rich caramel, crunchy nuts, the best pastry she'd ever had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew it, she was thoroughly bloated. \"Mmmm! That stuff's awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it that much! I knew some goodies would get your appetite back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked down, surprised. She'd eaten the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be embarrassed, sweetie! I can always make more! In fact...\" Maria checked her watch. \"Oh! I need to be back! Well, you can keep the food. Except for this, it's Chip's supper.\" She grabbed the largest box. Lisa protested, but Maria was insistent, and quickly went through the door, wishing Lisa good day and good luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. How am I supposed to get rid of all this food?\" Lisa wondered. Then, it hit her. A second line of defense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FREE FOOD!\" Lisa yelled through the streets, after she was sure Maria was gone. It was hardly a minute before the food was totally taken by gluttonous inhabitants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had only kept some chicken and a stir fry, which she had for supper after more jogging. Kat wasn't there, or at least she wasn't noticeable. She spent most of the rest of the day packing her things for the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had gotten everything, she walked over to the bus station that led outside of town. The same one she had entered from. A man that looked three times as wide as her gave her a weird look as he walked over. \"Well,\" she thought. \"No more weird looks when I get out of here.\" She then walked confidently and cheerfully, until she tripped on a crack in the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled to get up. After roughly a minute of unceremonious squirming (which drew even more attention, including a few stares), she pushed herself backwards a little, and then slowly stood up, brushing herself off. She then proceeded over, carefully avoiding the crack, but she couldn't seem to go further. Her eyes widened. She tried again. No use. She was only about 30 steps from getting to the bus station, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't proceed. Her body just wouldn't let her go in that direction. Finally, she gave up, furious. She asked Maria for a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria went by in her red car, Chip in shotgun. He was eating from a huge box of pastries, all full of cream, some with jam, some with chocolate. He could hardly stop for a moment, and when he did, Maria pushed him. \"So, Lisa, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh, nothing. I just wanted to stay with you guys for a while, if that's alright.\" A total lie, but Lisa didn't dare say the real reason, for fear of being committed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure! We'd love to have you over again! For how long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't know. Can we talk about it later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they sped over to Maria's. \"Can I use the computer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa went over to an enormous chair, presumably that of Maria's father. Just imagining how big that guy must be, and how Chip had to get that fat...Lisa already felt sorry for him. But she had business. She plugged in the USB containing her story, and emailed it to her coworker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, this is my report on South Barkalow (attached), finished. I've had some difficulties with getting back, so I'll be taking an extended vacation here. Please make sure the boss knows, and that he emails me any future assignments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa Boytise\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then sent it, took the USB back, and took a rest in a huge couch. \"So Lisa,\" Maria said, walking over, holding Chip in her hands like a doll. \"How long are you going to stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" she looked at their faces. Surely she couldn't tell the full story. They'd never believe it even if she did. She thought for a minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell she did tell the whole story. Most of it anyways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An-and I think I'm cursed! And I just can't leave her, no matter how hard I try!\" Lisa sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...that's terrible.\" Maria gave a sympathetic look. \"I didn't know, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine. I just need somewhere to live now that I can't live in my own home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! We have an extra room and everything.\" Maria perked up. \"And don't worry about eating us out of house and home, either. As I'm sure you noticed, we're rich, and we all eat loads anyways. Even your eating isn't as much as my dad's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Lisa spent the next few days living with the Cobblers (as such was their surname).</span></div></div>",

It was beyond the impossible, and Lisa's journalistic side was itching to find out everything that she could about him. With that she left the crying blubber-ball behind, and made her way into one of the many restaurants that lined the side-walk. Surprisingly it wasn't as busy as the other places Lisa had seen, and she was able to pick out quite a few women who looked as if they would have something promising to tell her about the mysterious masked man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first target was a young red head who was wedged into a booth by the window. Lisa estimated her weight to be at around 500lbs, and she was quite pretty with it. The red head wore leggings that clung to every curve of her leg, a pleated skirt that was long enough to just keep her covered, and a blouse with a waistcoat that had no hopes of doing up over her bulging stomach. She gave Lisa a smile as she sat down opposite her, taking a moment to swallow her current mouthful of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" the red head spoke, setting down her burger back into it's box, \"Can I help you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lisa,\" the journalist spoke, resting a hand to her chest, \"I'm a reporter and... I was wondering if you could tell me anything about the Masked Fattener.\" The girl tensed for a moment at just those words, Lisa reached for her notepad and pen from her back, it was a relief to be more open about having to take notes out in public, and flipped it open to a fresh page. \"Please.. I'm only trying to help?\" The red head seemed to relax slightly at those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Erin,\" the red head added, reaching for her drink to take a long sip through the straw, \"Um... well.. no-one knows much about him. He got me just after I moved here, about two years ago?\" her chubby cheeks flushed a little, \"I was just 98lbs then. I worked so hard to stay so thin and then.. he appeared,\" Lisa waited intently for Erin to speak again, \"When the smoke cleared I.. I looked like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" Lisa questioned softly, \"I mean that's impossible. No-one can gain that much weight in such a short amount of time. How does he do it?\" Erin looked up, her eyelashes a little wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-one knows,\" Erin admitted quietly, \"He always throws a smoke bomb into a crowd, and targets the thinnest woman there. When the smoke clears, she's suddenly obese.\" Lisa took down notes, her pen scribbling furiously against the paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He only targets thin women? But they're a rarity around here,\" Lisa pointed out, she had yet to see more than three people who were her size or smaller, \"I thought everyone in this town was fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone who was bought up here is fat,\" Erin corrected, picking a piece off her burger to eat while she spoke, \"The Masked Fattener only targets the thin women who arrive here from somewhere else. Even if they're just here to visit, he ends up getting them, and they feel they have no other choice than to stay here,\" she swallowed anxiously as she lifted her green eyes to focus on Lisa, \".. that makes you a target.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gave a slight frown at that, but thanked Erin for her time, and swiftly rose from her seat.

Lisa shook with nerves as she pulled on a jacket over her tank top, examining herself in the mirror.

She walked the streets, receiving a good number of stares due to how thin she was, Lisa did her best to ignore them, and keep looking forwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was terrified about getting fat. It horrified her beyond belief. But at the same time, she wanted to know how the man fattened up his victims. If she could find out, then she could stop other women from suffering. Besides, Lisa touched her waist anxiously, she could always lose the weight afterwards. Somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she found herself outside the restaurant where the young woman from before had been fattened up before her eyes. She heard him before she could see him, and Lisa felt her shoulders tense as someone landed behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the Masked Fattener!\" one woman shrieked, and seconds later, the air was filled with smoke. </span></div></div>",

She asked for a extra large serving of steak and fries with a chocolate milkshake and a couple large pies for dessert as well. <br>\r\n<i>Soo hungry, i'm feel like i'm starving!</i> she thought, though a small part of her mind kept nagging at her <b>No fight the hunger, you're only going to become even fatter and then you'll never solve the mystery of this town</b> <i>but i promisse i'll only eat until i'm full then i'll go and investigate further</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>no you have to stop NOW otherwise you'll be another victim of this excessively glutted town.</b> <i>But my belly's nowhere near full yet. Besides i deserves a little break after all the hard progress i've already made.</i> <b>No lisa, look at what you're doing to yourself! You're just stuffing your face like a pig being fattenned up to market!!</b> <i>Well im already huge at about 500 pounds, i may as well try to embrace it and accept my fate...</i> Lisa's more rational side Was waging a losing battle as her hunger took over, her large meal finally arrived at her table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There ya go hun\" said the weighty waitress, smiling as she set the meal in front of Lisa. She promptly left, heading back into the kitchen as Lisa began to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone who gets affected by you immediately goes to this restaurant afterwards, and eats out of depression, before settling in to this town, but I was different.

As you can see, I'm a journalist, and I must always be thinking things through in my head, 'cause otherwise I'd lose my job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then dialed 911 under the table quietly, so as to record the following confession:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine, I did it, but what does it matter what these pigs in South Barkalow think?  All the need is someone to put food in front of their plates, and they'll eat that stuff.  I was amazed at how easy it was for me to change an entire town for this, but all the better.

Just the one I wanted to talk to.  So, did you find out what was going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ever!  There was this guy named Charles Barlos, and he was pumping some sort of liquids into skinny tourists, turning them into 500 pound pigs in an instant.  I got him to confess to everything he did without him knowing that I dialed 911.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, you are getting 3 promotions in a row for that.  Good job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  Lisa said.  \"But, you should probably know that I'm one of his victims, meaning that I'm now 513 lbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"  Her boss paused for a bit, then continued. \"But you still went through with your job?  You are amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he said, \" I'll make you a deal: after you send the story over to me, you can either live in South Barkalow, where I'll still pay you handsomely, or you can move back here, and have one of the highest positions in the office.

The thin figure she had worked so hard for was gone in just a matter of seconds, and she was left with rolls of unsightly pale flesh. Lisa grabbed a handful of flesh with a sigh, before easing herself up off the bed with a groan. It was hard walking around, Lisa had fast developed a waddle as her fat thighs brushed against one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should use this again,\" Lisa decided as she slipped the device back over the shell of her ear, \"I need to act more the part.

She was already out of breath by the time she had gotten down the first flight, her chubby cheeks bright red once she reached the lobby. Lisa fought to catch her breath, closing her eyes as sweat trickled down her back. It was going to take some getting used to, being so fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-excuse me,\" Lisa asked the fat receptionist who was on duty, currently half way through a bag of snacks, \"I need to find some bigger clothes. Mine.. uhh.. shrunk?\" The receptionist looked her other with an amused smile that suggested she knew she had outgrown them, and gestured with a chubby hand towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's Big and Beautiful around the corner for the classier lady,\" the receptionist pointed out between munching, \"Or there's The Obese Outlet. You can find anything you want there.\" Lisa hesitated. Should she buy expensive clothing that would look good, or cheap clothing she would hopefully grow too small for?</span></div></div>",

She looked over at the poor who woman had been targeted by the Masked Fattener, a blond who was close to tears as she tugged at her torn clothing. Fortunately she had a group of friends who immediately gathered around her to offer their words of sympathy, Lisa could see that she wasn't needed, and so she slowly retreated from the scene. She made her way back to her hotel, her heart racing in her chest as she kept her eye out for the Masked Fattener. Would he know that she had recorded him? What would he do to her if he had? Lisa's heart thudded in her chest as she finally reached her room, locking the door tightly behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting cross legged on her bed, Lisa pulled out her laptop, and extracted the device from behind her ear to slip it into the USB slot. She waited for the file to load, leaning back against the pillows as she drummed her fingers against the base of the laptop. She frowned a little, the file was taking an awfully long time to load; it should be just half an hour of footage. Lisa clicked for the video to start when it had finally loaded, and the screen filled with her own image talking into the mirror. <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"This is Lisa Boytise..\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa skipped the video ahead to where the Masked Fattener had appeared. The woman shrieked, and the scene was filled with smoke. Lisa leant forwards to try and make out anything, only to gasp as the fog finally cleared. Everyone was frozen in place, not moving so much as an inch. The target was led on her back, her eyes wide in horror. The Masked Fattener made his way over to her, a hose curled about one of his hands. Lisa could see that it was attached to a tanker parked just around the corner. The Masked Fattener forced it between her lips, and a liquid began to ooze through it. Slowly, but surely, the blond began to fatten before Lisa's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this..?\" Lisa murmured, watching as the blond grew, the crowd around her not moving an inch, \"What's going on...?\" The smoke must of have a freezing effect on whoever inhaled it, Lisa mused to herself, the Masked Fattener was protected by his mask. As for whatever the girl was drinking that was making her expand so rapidly, that was something beyond what science Lisa knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well,\" Lisa looked up with a fright as she heard the playful tone of the Masked Fattener, only to see him silhouetted in her window, \"I can't have you giving away my secret now, can I?\" With that he threw something, and the room began to fill with smoke. </span></div></div>",

I use to be a scientist creating weight-loss products. I had just created the ultimate weight-loss shake. But I was surprised when the testingcame, it made the girl tester gain 500 pounds. My reputation was ruined, so I moved here. But it wasn't until the next day I found something incredible, there was a huge stash of money under my home, 1 billion in amount, but I couldn't take it without a distraction. So I decided to fatten the women so I can easily make my escape. Next question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the smoke you spray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Distilled particles of liquid nitrogen.

As Lisa did this, her belly expanded and expanded.  At 39, her new pants popped their button, as did some of the shirt buttons afterward.  Finally, she was done.  \"BUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRPPPPP!!!\" Lisa belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then saw the guy, and asked:</span></div></div>",

Not the biggest girl in class, but the school. Bigger than every teacher. She transformed from Big Boobs to a once in a generation, Biggest Tits the school had ever seen. She had bubble gum cheeks and corn butter-yellow hair. A silly-young laugh and obnoxious bone-white teeth that sat like garage doors to a wet, warm parking deck. It was immposible to not take advantage of her. A freshman flicked a paperclip slingshot into her cleavage and was allowed to retrieve it with his mouth. He came out red-faced with a 'my life has changed forever'-smile and bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would see anything other than an angel? A body crafted for male entertainment. The eye does not need to pass judgement. The obvious is obvious. Every dick in the room is hard. Her bra strap is thick and industrial. It digs into her fatless shoulders and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie applied for her first job as a personal assistant in the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterviewer: And can you list some distinctive qualities about your body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie: I have blonde hair. I'm 5'9. Sorta tall for a girl. People tell me I have really straight teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterviewer: Do people tell you that you have a really large chest for someone so skinny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie: I have been told that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterviewer: Do you like having big boobs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie: The gym can be awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterviewer: Do you get backaches?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie: Sometimes, yea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterviewer: But you like them? Your big boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie: I do. Yes, I like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterviewer: Can you say I time when having big boobs is difficult?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie: Certain outfits, I guess. It can be hard to be modest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterviewer: Like the one you have on now? Did you have trouble doing this blouse up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie: You mean -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterviewer: Did you keep popping out of that thing this morning? Before showing up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie: I did have some trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterviewer: Do you think their size is going to be a distraction for a group of men trying to discuss business?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie: I guess they might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterviewer: So you understand if the group of men got distracted and wanted to squeeze them and release stress, you'd be okay with that? If your breasts became stress toys?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbie: I think I could understand that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterviewer: You realize that big tits, like the ones you have, are a lot of guy's favorite form of entertainment? This is your first job so you do not know what the real world is like or how big tit girls like you are treated. This will be a learning experience for you. Do you expect to be taken seriously as an educated and capable professional when you have tits that big? Do you think a client would look at you and trust your judgement? If you saw you, would you say, \"Oh, there is a woman with intelligence. She knows what she's talking about.\" No. You would think \"Gentleman's Club.\" And isn't that nice? That is a great thought to put in the mind of our client. Maybe we can have you walk around the conference room in an outfit like the girls in the boxing ring wear. Holding those numbers up. You can hand out our agenda like that. Or is that too comical? Have the big tit secretary become a cock-robot? It is typical but honestly, who else gets a chance to do it for real? This is a rare thing, you must admit. Where else could you make money to be taken for massages and manicures weekly anywhere else? Those milk saucers are useless and distracting for anyone who wants to talk seriously. But they are perfect for someone who wants to be VP of Morale. Very advantageous for a future Feminist Mogul. The most entrepreneurial tit queens of her decade. A genius Martha Stewart. The personality of Vanna White. Brains of Martha Stewart.

If done right this story could make you very, very big. As you may or may not know a recent study from Stanford University proved South Barkalow to be the fattest town in all of the USA. Why is this break through for you? Well it may seem like chump change to other newspapers but I see this as perfect front page news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanford's findings say that an astonishing 98 percent of the citizens are either overweight or obese. We want you to report there, and find out what is so different about this town and what is going on. Find out everything possible about this growing town. Why is the population booming? What is the cause for such a high number of overweight residence? And why are tourists so interested in this place? I want to break open this story wide-open before anyone else has a chance too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe company and I are sending you out to South Barkalow for a week long reporting bonanza. Trust me Lisa, if you take this opportunity and run with it this could end up being very successful for you and the paper.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this fat town more than meets the eyes? Join Lisa and uncover the many secrets of this over-bloated city, meet the citizens, talk to the mayor, eat and chat or go undercover. Do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this, and have fun exploring the many places South Barkalow has to offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnoop through the post office's mail, ease drop on the citizens, make small talk with the mayor, or go dumpster diving for clues all the while completing your boss's extra tasks.
