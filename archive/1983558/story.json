            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy sighed as she walked trough the streets of Station Square, Eggman was defeated just a month ago, the Chaos emeralds mysteriously disappearing after Sonic had used them to defeat Chaos. This wasn't the reason she was sighing, everyone had endeavored to find the Chaos Emeralds so that Eggman couldn't use them again, Knuckles, Tails, even Cream had found an Emerald and been able to help Sonic but she hadn't. Passing her favourite jewellery store Amy looked over the jewelry on display, more specifically the wedding rings, Amy wasn't stupid, Sonic had rejected her more times than she cared to count but she still held onto that hope that one day he'd just appear on her door, jewelry box in hand and down on one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes traveled up the display case before resting on a large purple brilliant cut gem sitting proudly on a pedestal, a soft white light seemed to radiate from the interior of the gem. There sitting right before her was a Chaos emerald, she simply stared for a second too stunned to do anything before rushing into the store. \"How much for that purple gem in the window?\" she asked, the saleswoman turning around and looking straight over her before looking down and smiling at her a light laugh underlined her voice as she spoke down figuratively and literally to Amy \"little girl if you have to..\" she never got to finish as Amy jumped up, grabbing her by the collar and bringing the woman down to her level \"how much?\" She growled. \"5,000?\" the woman replied hesitantly, Amy simply pulled out a credit card and handed it to the woman, 5 minutes later Amy walked out emerald in hand, with a happy squeal she ran off towards Tail's house as the little fox inventor had a vault which he claimed would as he said \"mask the emerald's power and prevent any time-space anomalies which could potentially disrupt their location\" or in simple terms 'hold the emeralds' Amy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Amy long to reach Tails' house and she quickly ran downstairs to Tails' vault, what she found waiting in the vault surprised her, there standing in front of the pedestal in the middle of the vault was Sonic, placing the 6th chaos emerald with it's five brothers. A large grin spread over her face as she slowly walked up to her crush \"hey Sonic, guess what I've got?\" Amy said in a sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh, h-hey Amy, what do ya have there\" Sonic replied hesitantly pointing behind her back, why he was hesitant Amy wasn't sure, it wasn't like she had ever tried anything deceitful before, she had always been up front and honest with Sonic, so his mistrust hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh nothing\" she said teasingly \"just, this!\" Amy thrust the emerald forward and was happy to see Sonic break out in a smile, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, good job Amy with yours we have all 7 emeralds, and if Tails is right, we won't have to worry about them, now if only Knuckles could keep an eye on the Master Emerald.\" Amy and Sonic laughing at the joke for several seconds, as Knuckles inability to protect the Master Emerald had led to most of their adventures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was on top of the world, she had helped Sonic and they were having a nice moment together, this happy moment however was short lived as there was a cough behind them, Amy wheeled around her Piko-Piko hammer appearing in her hands ready to face what was sure Eggman and his goons, what she saw however was quite different. Standing in the doorway of the vault was a human woman who Amy couldn't help but admit looked quite nice; long blonde hair, blue eyes, relatively nice figure being shown off by a slim black cocktail dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? And what are you doing here?\" Amy snapped anger boiling within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, my little soney--poo didn't tell you?\" the woman replied, those words boiling Amy's blood. She was not about t let some hussy move in on Sonic, especially when they had been having such a nice moment together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soney-poo, who the hell do you think you are calling him that?\" Amy shouted, the hand holding the Piko-Piko hammer shaking in her rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman only smirked and walked in like she owned the place before draping herself over Sonic \"oh please honey, you still don't get it? Sonic has no interest in you, and he never has, he just couldn't bring himself to hurt your little feelings.\" As she continued her smile turned cruel, any sense of mirth or kindness disappearing from her face \"in fact, all you've ever been to him is a tool, I mean come on, all those years of stringing you along, you've helped save the world several times over, that'd deserve at least a kiss, but as far as I know you haven't even held hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat chance of that\" Amy replied defiantly \"like Sonic... would... have... any... interest... in... you?\" Amy couldn't help but lose steam as Sonic wasn't looking at her but at the ground ashamed. \"S...Sonic, that's not true right, you...you care for me right?\" Amy couldn't stop a gentle quiver from entering her voice as she stared at the one she had loved for so long. Sonic seemed to stop for a second, literally he stopped breathing for a few seconds, before taking in a large breath and releasing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, look, you're nice, really nice and you're always there when I need you, you're not a tool\" he replied glaring up at the woman behind him, however Sonic wasn't finished \"however that's all you are Amy, and I never have, and never will have any feelings for you, I'm sorry\" Sonic finished, his head downcast in shame, although he didn't seem to have any problem saying what e had said, like he had been practicing the lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's an old saying about when you're angry, that you see red, Amy at the moment was seeing crimson \"YOU!!!\" she bellowed at the top of her lungs \"you think that makes it any better, your little hussy is right, all this time you've been stringing me along, using me, is the only reason you saved me so that you wouldn't feel bad, mister big hero hog.\" Amy punctuated each statement with a nice batter's swing of her hammer as she slowly approached Sonic and his supposed girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Amy settle down, I'm sure we can talk this out, c-come to some kind of understanding\" Sonic hesitantly replied, his hands held up in a form of supplication, Amy saw something in the blue hedgehog's eyes that very few could say they've seen, pure fear,...and you know what, at the moment, she wanted him to be afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UNDERSTAND THIS YOU BASTARD\" Amy roared as she raised her hammer above her head and attempted to bring it down on the two-timing hedgehog and his little hussy, however neither was there, her hammer making letting out a long ringing echo as it struck the floor of the vault. Looking around she noticed Sonic and his blonde bimbo where now standing just at the entrance to the vault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what it's worth, I'm sorry.\" Those were the last words she heard before Sonic ran away. Amy just simply stood there for a few seconds, her body unable to comprehend what had just happened, finally it hit her, her legs giving out as she collapsed sobbing onto her hammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why? Why? All I wanted was for him to love me, is that so much to ask? To love and be loved? I just, I just want to be loved.\" she sobbed, Amy in her moment of grief missed the inner glow of the emeralds slowly growing till they the gems became pure white, the power of the emeralds activating to grant her heartfelt wish, in a way no one would expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n(You can switch this to 1st or 3rd person after this, for some reason I'm just better with this with 2nd person.)<br>\r\nYou sighed as you stared at the doll in your hands, it was an old beat up doll of Amy Rose, the years as well as wear and tear had taken their toll on the object, your sewing skills being...subpar you couldn't simply repair the thing, you could always take it to someone to repair it, but you were too embarrassed to admit it was yours and you tried lying about who it belonged to once, surprisingly they hadn't bought it, maybe it was the fact you couldn't help but smile like a idiot when you lied. You sighed as you placed the doll down on the rest of your stuff, \"sorry Amy, I wish I could have you fixed\" you say, you turned to grab something else when a flash of light caught your attention. You turn around to see the doll glowing, you hesitantly touch the doll and several things happened all at once, there was another flash of light that blinded you for several seconds, you felt like you were being torn apart and re-assembled, and you heard what sounded almost like a train in a tunnel. When your vision returns you find yourself...</span></div></div>",

You were shocked to see that everything in here is huge. You remembered about strange lights coming out of nowhere, then blacking out. The light must've brought you here and it must've also shrunk you. Before you can think about what happened, you hear sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and see Amy Rose. You were shocked to see her so big. You then remembered that right before the lights appeared, you were fixing your Amy Rose doll. Now you are seeing the real deal in front of you. But for some reason, Amy appears to be crying. You can't understand why she's like this, so you walked up to her, hoping to see if you can calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me. Are you alright?\" You asked. Amy stopped crying as she heard your voice. She looked down to see you standing on her bed. Amy was in absolute shock to see you so small. She then picked you up and brings you to her face. \"Who are you?\" Amy asked. You tell her your name and she tells you hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get here?\" Amy wondered. \"I don't know. I was minding my own buisness until these flashes of light came out of no where. When I woke up, I'm in here looking like this.\" You explained. \"Wow! That's something you don't see everyday.\" Amy said. \"No kidding! Anyway, can I ask you why are crying? That is if you want to. If you don't, I understand.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! It's fine. There's this guy I love so much. His name is Sonic. The reason I'm crying is because I found out she's with this blond haired woman. All I want is for him to love me as I do for him, but I guess I was just waisting my time.\" Amy said as more tears come out of her eyes. You can't help but feel sorry for her. You know that Amy is in love with Sonic. But every time she tries something to impress him, she gets flat out rejected. And it looks like what she told you was the final push on her already aching heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, If you want, I can stay here with you until you feel better.\" You said. Amy looked at you with concern, but she also felt touched by your offer. \"You would do that for me?\" Amy asked, wiping her tears out of her eyes. \"Sure. But if you need to be alone, I'll just be on-.\" You stopped as Amy interrupted you. \"No! You can stay here with me. I could use the company.\" Amy said. You look at her with a smile on her face. \"Sure. Whatever you need.\" You said. Amy feels a little happy that you are willing to help her with her broken heart. She grabs you and hugs you on her cheek. \"Thank you so much.\" Amy said happily. \"No problem.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then opens the top of her dress and puts you in between her breast. \"Um you don't have a problem with this, right?\" Amy asked while blushing. \"No not at all.\" You answered while blushing. Amy snuggles you in between her breast and lays back down on her bed. She was actually feeling better than expected. She feels really happy now that you are here with her. You felt the same way because this is what you've been fantasising about for years. But it's different than what you expected it to be, but you like it nonetheless. Amy continues to blush as she thinks that you're kinda cute. She then feels something in her heart, something that she used to have for Sonic, Love. She could believe that she may have fallen in love with you. And she believes that she might be right. Amy then falls asleep with you in her breast. You then fell asleep too, dreaming about the things that you can do with Amy. You thought that maybe being small won't be so bad after all. Whatever the case, both you and Amy are gonna enjoy each other.</span></div></div>",

Also, you've been pretty nice to me so far, and you didn't even raise a fuss about spending time with, well, you know\u2026\" Amy was blushing madly, recounting her letting you sleep on her boob obviously. \"To tell you the truth, I wanted to wait for when me and Sonic were finally together before doing ANYthing like that, but oh well. Something about you makes me want to, well, do all kinds of things!\" Amy quickly got closer to you, and it would have been more unsettling if it wasn't for the pure pre-teen sparkle of excitement in her eyes. \"Hee hee~\u2026! I can't imagine how many girls would want such a small boyfriend, but I guess it must be pretty fun!

She was succesful, rich... very rich! But her lifestyle was like many others, it lacked something which money couldn't buy, love. Sure it could buy physical \"love\" but that wouldn't take care of you when you were ill, give you hope in your darkest moments, or simply care for you. It was lonely in the house. She and Knuckles had been dating for a while, till some slutty little vixen had caught his eye, then the traitorous Echidna had the gall to simply text her saying \"things weren't working out\"...she saw the two of them the next day sucking face. \"That traitorous bastard\" she thought angrily, thinking back on the day she had been betrayed \"*sniff* W-why?! I have everything a man could dream of, looks, money, so...why??!\" She started to cry, mourning her crushed heart, she wanted to be loved, she couldn't stand a lonely life. A few days ago she had stolen one of the Chaos Emeralds, the priceless jewels always interested her, but now the jewel only reminded her of her past love. She wanted a man of her own, a man that she could trust and love, to be with her and share his life with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish for a man... I wish for a man that would love me, no matter the circumstance\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile... you had just returned from a very stressful day of work, you couldn't help but to go bed and wait for the night to end, a new day starting your daily routine all over. It was tiring, stressful and lonely, no one waiting for you reminded you of your past triumphs or rather failures with the opposite sex. It was annoying and pointless asking a girl for a date. They kept calling you freak, or weirdo when they learned your interests, \"you're not my type\" was the most frequent line you got when it ended before that stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your interests happens to be the Sonic the Hedgehog games. One of the things you'd never admit however was that you had a crush on a character, namely Rouge the Bat. You found her attractive and bold, admitting this, was difficult but you finally had. You had a better chance with her than any real girl. Falling asleep you wished for a change of pace, you didn't care how it happened, you just wanted a change...'meeting Rouge would be a nice change' you thought wistfully.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lowering himself to the \"floor\" he began to feel it, it was strange, the floor felt like it was made of fabrics; silks, satin, and lace. The strange thing was that the \"floor\" pressed up slightly causing round hills as large as he was tall and wider as well. He took a few moments to look around, all around him was darkness, although it seemed thicker right in front of him, reaching one hand out and slowly crawling forward his hand met wood, slowly standing up his hand again met wood. \"Where the hell am I?\" he thought confusion being the main feeling going through him. Walking over to one area of the floor, he began to feel it, the light weight of the material allowing him to lift it up. After several minutes of examination he was able t describe it, two hills with a small piece of material connecting the two. Sitting between one of the pair of hills he stopped to try and think \"what could these be\" he thought. His thoughts were interrupted as everything suddenly lurched forward, burying him under one of the hills in front of him. As wherever he was lurched forward, light flooded the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"hills\" that surrounded him suddenly lurched forward, scooping him up and sending him reeling onto his back, falling to the \"peak\" which obviously wasn't that at all. He pulled his face out of the bottom, just as it stopped moving. Looking out of the \"hill\" his jaw dropped, staring right at him were two large round full breasts, the lightly tanned skin leading up to two golden-brown nipples. Several thoughts were fighting for supremacy but the loudest question in his mind \"where the hell am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge sighed as she stared at the chaos Emerald, it wasn't like the little gems had ever been recorded to have wish granting powers, so why would they now? Taking a moment to think, as she really didn't have anything to do she decided that going for a run was a good idea, it would help clear her head, and keep her figure, she stopped as she smelt something, she took a small whiff then cleared her nose, \"pick your clothes, shower then go for a run\" she muttered to herself. Walking into her bedroom she took a second to note that despite how well furnished it was the room felt expansive, empty. Entering the room, Rouge stared at her large 4-poster bed, silken sheets and large luxurious pillows adorning it providing a her with very easy, very comfortable sleep. The bed was flanked by two nightstands, the one on the left holding a small lamp for when Rouge felt like reading in bed. Entering the room she walked to the right wall of the room where her dresser was. Opening the top drawer she pulled out a simple black satin bra, the material light and airy yet comfortable. Taking a few steps back towards the door she started at herself in the full-body mirror resting to its immediate right. Holding the bra up in front of her breasts she nodded slowly content with her choice moving back to the dresser she grabbed the matching set of panties. Holding the bra lightly against her so as not to wrinkle it she walked towards the left wall of the bedroom which other than a single door in the center was devoid of any furniture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door Rouge entered her ensuite bathroom, walking inside Rouge smiled, the luxurious bathroom would put the ones found in most 5-star hotels to shame. Marble tiles, granite counter surrounding the sunken marble sink, a shower large enough to hold several people and a sunken bathtub the size of a small swimming pool. Rouge gently placed the underwear down on the counter and headed for the shower. Stripping out of her usual bodysuit, boots and gloves, as well as her current underwear. she placed them down near the shower door, opened the door and stepped inside, turned on the water and began to shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly peeked his head out of the cup of the bra, although the bra had been placed like a bowl, with the nipple area facing down, it was still only cloth so it was easy to climb out of. Taking a moment to look around he was stunned and honestly very intimidated by what he saw. It was a bathroom, a very luxurious bathroom but that wasn't what intimidated him. He had seen a breast bigger than he was, this bathroom however provided him with a true sense of just how small he was, and it scared him. He froze as he heard the most beautiful singing ever to grace his ears, turning to the side he saw a giant shower, to his credit he quickly turned away when he realized someone, or rather some woman was using the shower despite the fact that the glass prevented anymore than her silhouette being visible. What he had seen of her had him very intrigued, even as she turned and moved inside the confines of the shower, there was a definite sway to her hips as well as a graceful precision in her movements. The two large full breasts sitting high and proud on her chest were also very hard to ignore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back, no matter how wrong he knew it was he couldn't resist the opportunity. He watched her silhouette cup one of her breast in one hand before she gently pressed her back against the glass facing him. That however drew his attention away from what she was doing, as he now noticed something he hadn't before. Attached to the woman's back were two large, semi-curved bat wings, and on top of her head were two large bat ears. \"That's impossible\" he thought his mind telling him that standing right in front of him was Rouge the bat, as if to confirm his fears a loud feminine moan of \"oh Knuckles\" left the shower, causing him to promptly bury himself back inside the bra. Slowly sticking his head out he saw Rouge masturbating \"this is something I shouldn't see\" he thought ducking back down into the bra, the sounds of Rouge's self-pleasure were a bit harder to escape though. After several minutes of moaning and a final loud scream of \"Knuckles\" alongside the sound of more than just water hitting the shower floor the room became silent except for the constant sound of the shower head. Poking his head out he saw Rouge washing herself, her self-pleasure session the most likely reason. After several minutes of her washing her body and her head-fur she reached to shut off the shower. He quickly pressed himself as deeply into the bra as possible as he heard the water shut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge sighed contently as she shut off the shower, she was feeling a lot better now. Humming happily she stepped out of the shower, walking over to the towel rack she grabbed one and began to dry off, sighing in slight annoyance at how difficult it was to dry off her ears and her head-fur. Turning to stare at herself in the bathroom mirror, she wrapped the towel around herself and walking up to the mirror stared at her reflection trying to find any bump or blemish. Smiling happily as she couldn't see anything wrong, she looked over at the clothes she had discarded. Grabbing them up in a heap she left the bathroom momentarily to deposit them in the laundry basket, returning once that was finished she slowly picked up the satin bra, 'Knuckles this could have been yours' Rouge thought sadly as she stared at her naked form before...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He groaned as he sat up on a hard surface, looking around all he could see was darkness beyond a weak field of illumination. Searching for the source he noticed that the illumination was coming from underneath him. Looking down he saw he was on top of a gigantic green gem that was gently glowing. \"Where the hell am I?\" was one of several thoughts that raced through his mind. Suddenly there was the sound of breaking glass as well as several large shards falling around him, before he and the gem were lifted up and deposited into what he assumed was a sack. An alarm starting to sound a second later, before he could react he suddenly felt the sack tighten around him and whoever stole the gem was probably lifted out by helicopter as it felt like the sack he was in rose for a few seconds before heading more or less horizontally in a direction he was unsure of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't do anything more than just lay on top of this giant gem as his kidnappers flew along, after about 5 minutes he heard a sound, almost like a window opening before what sounded almost like heels on tile before the sack was deposited on something and the sack was pulled down. He was momentarily blinded however when he could see again what he saw stunned him. He was in a quite luxurious kitchen, white tile, black marble counter tops, oak cabinets, but more important than where he was, it was who was towering above him that left him speechless. Towering above him was none other than the femme fatale jewel hunter herself Rouge the Bat. He let out a small squeak as she leaned over and plucked him off, what he now realized was a Chaos Emerald. \"Quite a sophisticated little robot G.U.N's made to track this emerald.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have any time to reply as Rouge covered him in her first and began to squeeze, so he did what anyone would do in this situation, kick with al his might, all though he didn't seem to hurt her, the movement made her pause for a second, long enough to get out four words \"I'm not a robot!\" Surprisingly Rouge let up with the pressure yet she still kept him in her hand, he was brought up to her face and he noticed a small smile on the bat's lips. \"I didn't think G.U.N had it in them to shrink one of their soldiers to protect an emerald, don't worry I'll mail you back to your superiors.\" She started to root around in a drawer before pulling out a plain white envelope \"wait, I don't even know who these G.U.N guys you keep talking about are.\" he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge replied even while she was writing an address on the envelope \"and I assume you don't know what it was you were just sitting on hmm?\" He hated to lie but he replied with a vehement \"no, I have no idea other than it's a shiny green gem.\" Rouge stopped her writing \"you have no idea?\" she asked again. He shook his head as vigorously as he could, he wasn't sure why but he was pretty sure he was safer with Rouge than with G.U.N, mainly because he was pretty sure that G.U.N would try to dissect him. \"Alright than my little partner, you're stuck with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partner? What do you mean partner?\" he replied, he was pretty sure he hadn't done anything criminal. Rouge lifted him and the emerald up after stashing the envelope, she walked through her house, he got no more than a few glimpses of black walls and expensive looking flooring before she entered a living room. He and the gem were deposited onto a glass table before Rouge took a seat in front of him \"what I meant by partner, is you my little friend showed up on the chaos Emerald moments before I snatched it, that's a bit coincidental isn't it?\" she asked. \"Wait you saw that, and you stole the emerald anyway?\" he replied. \"Of course, I wasn't going to let some strange little light show stop me from getting the emerald. Now as I was saying, you showed up right before I snatched it, if they're going to be looking for me, they're going to be looking for you as well.\" He froze for a moment, letting this information sink in, \"well damn it, you wouldn't be willing to just take all the credit and leave me out of this would you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge leaned over and patted him on the head with a single finger \"it's not that bad, besides do you have any idea how useful someone of your...size would be to me, getting through air ducts, unlocking doors, sneaking into buildings and letting me in, you are the perfect partner.\" She smiled down at him, \"look that's very nice, but I don't really want to work as an accomplice to a petty thief\" he replied. \"Petty thief!\" She replied indignantly \"I am not a petty thief, I'm the world's greatest jewel-hunter, yes that means...liberating a gem or two from another's possession, but I am not a petty thief.\" He simply stood there, one eyebrow raised. After a few moments Rouge sighed and sat back on her couch pouting \"fine, I am a thief, but I'm not petty, besides I'd give you your fair share\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't want to be a thief\" he replies, \"mmm, I'm sure I can sweeten the deal\" Rouge replies, before he could say anything Rouge leaned over and he lifted him up before dropping him into the cleavage of her dress. \"I've been quite lonely for a while\" she said looking down at him \"you'd be more than just my partner in crime, you'd be someone for me to cuddle and celebrate my victories with, maybe more given time, what do you say?\" His situation, he had to admit was leaving him flustered, Rouge was already a rather busty character, 4ft tall or not, his relative size was making it so he was surrounded by two perfectly round hills about three times his size. \"I....\" he tried to wiggle free but he couldn't \"I guess I could take you up on that offer, I mean I don't really have anywhere to go \"sigh\" and if what you said is true I can't really expect help from anyone else as I'm a wanted criminal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge pulled him out surprisingly gently, \"don't worry\" she said with a smile \"us thieves have to stick together, honor among thieves and all that\" she said. He couldn't help but smile as the normally quite cold Rouge was trying to reassure him \"thanks...um I never got your name?\" Surprisingly Rouge blushed quite heavily before depositing him once again on the glass table \"I'm Rouge the Bat, world's greatest jewel-hunter, and you are?\" she asked. \"You can just call me Tiny\" he replied, \"really? You don't want me to call you something else.\" He shook his head no and rouge let out a small chuckle in reply. \"Fine, Tiny...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tikal sighed as she walked through the village her people once inhabited. All around her was reminder after reminder of what had happened all those years ago; desolate dirt roads, homes with their interior and exterior preserved in perfect condition, but empty and long-abandoned. The master emerald had given Tikal exactly what she had wanted, a place of beauty where the majesty of nature flourished unbridled, a place with no war or suffering...a place of isolation and loneliness. A small smile crossed her face as she heard the happy cries of the chao coming from the Altar of the emeralds, knowing there was nothing she could do to change the past Tikal shook off the melancholy that had begun to settle in and proceeded towards the altar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the altar she saw a sight that warmed her heart, the chao were playing around the Master emerald, although it was only a simple game of tag it was nice to see the chao happy after all that they had been through. Ene of the Chao floated up to her Tikal failing to notice the mischievous smile on its face, with a small cry of \"chao\" it lightly bopped her on the noise declaring her as \"It\". For a while at least the sadness which had had set upon her fell to the wayside as she attempted to tag the little chao, their excited cries and giggles spurring her to catch one of them, although the chao seemed to stay ever out of her grip. After several minutes Tikal was exhausted, with a tired sigh she slumped against the Master Emerald, which began to glow upon her contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">Tikal, what bothers you?</span>\" The voice seemed to flow through her mind, cool like water, as she stood back up a trickle of water seemed to flow out of the top of the Master Emerald the water coalescing until a 2-toed, 3-fingered humanoid creature made of the water stood before her, its glowing emerald green eyes focused intently upon her. Most would fear this strange creature that appeared out of thin air, but Tikal only smiled as her eyes fell upon it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Chaos, what do you mean what bothers me?\" Tikal replied. She had no reason to feel anything but joy; she had Chaos, the chao, there was a beautiful waterfall basin she could visit, and the majesty of nature to explore, and above all else there was no war, no conflict. So why then did she feel...empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cblue\">Tikal, you taught me what it is to be a \"friend\". One of the things you taught me is that they do not allow their friends to hurt, let me help you.</span>\" Chaos walked closer to Tikal as he spoke to her one of his arms finally coming to rest on her shoulder in what he hoped was a comforting gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know what's wrong with me. I have you, the chao, but still I feel so...so empty, so alone\" Before she could stop herself Tikal was embracing Chaos, hot salty tears trailing their way down her fur as she bore her heart out to her friend. Tikal and Chaos simply stood there for several seconds finally Tikal\u2019s tears dried up and she stared up into Chaos' eyes, although they looked no different she could tell he was concerned for her. Chaos let her go and walked over to the Master emerald, with a wave of his arm an image appeared in the surface of the emerald. Walking over Tikal took a peek at the image, what she saw was a place that looked like the \"Station Square\" that Chaos had attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">You're jealous</span>\" Chaos' words came out of nowhere yet they pierced Tikal like an arrow. \"<span class=\"cblue\">You have the peace you long sought, but no one to share it with, to care for, no one whose company you may enjoy. They however do, even though they still have war and this makes you jealous.</span>\" Tikal could only stare at the image flickering before her, she wanted to deny what Chaos was saying, but she couldn't. The pain and sadness written on Tikal's face was something Chaos hadn\u2019t seen many times and seeing her like suffering was something that bothered him greatly. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Tikal, I can help you, all you need to do is tell me what it is you wish.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTikal sighed, \"I...I want a little friend, someone to share my time with and care for.\" Tikal knew the request was selfish but as she stared at the image before her, all the people happily going about their lives, families, couples, things that should have brought her great joy to see only brought forth thoughts of jealousy and spite, and the only thing that would take those thoughts away was a companion of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos simply cocked its head, \"<span class=\"cblue\">a 'little' friend, that's all that you desire?</span>\" Tikal seemed to miss the emphasis Chaos placed on the word little and simply nodded her response, Chaos stared at her for several seconds before turning back towards the Master Emerald, \"<span class=\"cblue\">I shall see what I can do Tikal.</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos was surprised as he felt a warmth pressed against his back arms encircling his torso as Tikal hugged him. \u201cThank you Chaos\" Tikal said happily before leaving the altar. Chaos stared at the image before him his eyes scanning each person, the connection he had to the chaos force revealing everything about each individual his eyes fell upon. He cared for Tikal deeply, she was one of his few \"friends\" and he would not allow anyone who would even dare to think about harming her come to the island. Finally his eyes fell upon one individual who seemed pure enough, Chaos' arms became long tentacles which plunged straight into the master emerald, piercing straight through the image as if it were the reflection sitting atop a pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_______________________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you walked along, today had been a good day there wasn't much to complain about. Work had been good, your few friendly co-workers making the tedium seem almost bearable but it felt...boring? No that wasn't the right word, mundane was better. Life was neither good nor bad, and that was the problem, nothing had happened and nothing ever would happen. Your head whipped around as you heard a woman scream, to see something that made your blood run cold. Several feet away from you was a green swirling vortex and coming out of it were two large tentacles which were almost a foot in diameter, made out of some viscous watery substance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tentacles seemed to be searching for something, and that something seemed to be you. As soon as they pointed towards you the tentacles froze for a second before shooting towards you and ensnaring you faster than you could blink. You were slowly pulled back towards the portal, looking towards the woman who had screamed before and several of the other people on the street one thought seemed to categorize their looks at you 'better him than me'. You turned to stare at the swirling green vortex in front of you, and with a final sigh you went slack, submitting yourself to whatever horrible fate awaited you. With a final tug you were pulled in, however there was a jolt of energy as you were pulled in which knocked you unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________________________________________________________ <br>\r\nChaos smirked as the human was pulled through the emerald and into his waiting palm; he knew that he couldn't simply give the human to Tikal, as he wasn't exactly sure how she would react. With a small burst of chaos energy he teleported Tikal's new companion to somewhere he was sure they would be found, with that Chaos returned to the Master Emerald content with the fact that he had helped his friend. The important thing is where Chaos sent our pint-sized protagonist...</span></div></div>",

Turning around and seeing her mother like this the little bunny ran back and hugged her \"don't worry Mommy, I'll be fine\" she said wrapping her little arms around her mother's neck as she tightly reciprocated the hug. \"I-I know, but you're still going away to school for so long\" Vanilla replied barely stopping herself from sobbing. Cream cocked her head in confusion \"but Mommy, Miss Radishes, School for Little Bunnies was your idea\", Vanilla took a long shuddering breath before replying. \"I know, I'm just going to miss you Creamy\" she said hugging her daughter close. \"I'll miss you too Mommy, but I'll be back for Christmas, and you'll come visit me on my birthday, oh and we get to spend all summer together too.\" Vanilla nodded unable to trust her voice anymore before letting her daughter go and gently pushing her towards the waiting bus. Cream ran off and just before she stepped on turned back and waved \"Bye Mommy, love you\" Cream yelled, \"I love you too\" Vanilla yelled back before Cream got on the bus, the doors closed and it drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever had Vanilla felt so alone, her husband had left her when Cream was born, that wasn't exactly true he had offered her $5 million to leave him alone and since she didn't want Cream to have a father like him she took the money, bought their current home and raised Cream all on her own. Cream never seemed to mind that she never had a father which Vanilla was thankful for although for the first time in her life she wished her father wasn't such a bastard. As she walked inside she felt alone and empty, the large manor they called home seeming lifeless without her daughter's cheerful laughter or the sounds of her running and playing, Vanilla sighed, \"might as well do some chores\" she though ruefully before losing herself in the general maintenance of the home for several hours. When she finally stopped it was dark out, after making a simple cucumber, lettuce, and carrot sandwich she walked out to a small hill she and Cream would use to stargaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat upon the grass she saw the first star of the night wink into existence, at that moment she decided to make a wish reciting some familiar words \"star light, star bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may I wish I might, have this wish I wish tonight.\" She thought for a few seconds before coming up with a wish, although since she knew it wouldn't come true and she needed a pick-me-up she decided to be a little silly. \"I wish for a little man all my own, who will cuddle and care for me, who will love me as I love him\" She smiled to herself as she got up and walked back inside, never noticing the star grow brighter for several seconds before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a different dimension our protagonist sighed as he lay down in bed, an image of Vanilla Rabbit washing through his mind. He'd be lying if he said he didn't have a crush on her, \"I wish I could meet her\" he yawned out before sleep overtook him. When he awoke he felt that something was wrong, he wasn't sure why, however as his eyes opened he realized that something was very wrong as he found himself...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Vanilla had come in from the shower and was all dried off and ready to get dressed. she was standing above him fully nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm. the house is just so quiet with out her around. I do hope she is having a good time and is learning lots.\" says vanilla in a sombre tone. she already had her dress picked out and was getting her underwear. her dress wasn't the same as it usually was. she was going to wear a looser fitting green dress instead today. it had shoulder straps and went down to her knees and then flared out a little. she looked into her underwear drawer and picked up a pair of red panties with a small bow on the front and put them on, unaware that a small little admirer was watching her get dressed. she then reached in and picked up a bra that she hadn't worn in a while. she tried it on but it just would not fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh dear. this one seems to have shrunk or maybe I just out grew it some how. well they do seem bigger than they used to be.\" she said to herself. she then placed it on the dresser and picked out the one with a little passenger with it. he noticed that he was being lifted upward and could see the drawer get further and further away. Vanilla was about to put on the bra when she noticed something weird was dangling from it. she turned it over and gasped. \"oh my!! what is that?\" upon closer inspection she found that it was a small human, maybe only 3 inches tall. \"here let me help you out she said as she untangled him and placed him on her dresser she proceeded to put on the bra and her dress. then she looked at him quizzically. \"um. well I guess I'll introduce myself. I am Vanilla Rabbit. now tell me, what were you doing in my underwear drawer little one?\" she asked genuinely curious. she wasn't mad at all which surprised him. \"umm well Ms. Rabbit I'm not entirely sure.

Your brain sends mixed signals -- be quiet, but also scream in shock. It seems to find a compromise, and when you go to scream you quickly put your hand over your mouth to muffle the otherwise unwise reaction. Luckily the beast in front of you doesn't seem to notice, instead continuing to blow some warm air onto you from her nose. It was weird, though lulling, and it allowed you to recollect your senses, so your instincts tell you to look about the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed in the dark, vast landscape was that what was once your bed was actually a gigantic, white pillow that stretched as far as the eye can see, then the rest of the bed, which while you couldn't see very much of, really looked fancy as hell. Could you be in some rich guy's house? As you look further about from your position you can see a mammoth nightstand with a photo case with a picture you can't exactly see due to the darkness of the room, alongside a lamp. Finally, your eyes rest upon the sleeping beast itself... or, as you take a closer look at it, herself. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you can't even believe what you are seeing, despite just now seeing the giant landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was none other than the spitting image of Vanilla! Your mind was racing to think of how any of this was even possible in the first place, but you soon gave up on the idea and decided to go with it for now, for the sheer purpose of not making things far more complicated than they already are. But now, you come up with the age-old question, a question that many have asked, with many answers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...What do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Writer's note: This is honestly my first submission I've ever made. While I may be adding more to this path and maybe some other paths, I'd like for ya'll to continue this as well with hopefully good additions. Cute, lewd, gentle, whatever. It'd break my heart to see something half-assed! Also I apologize for Choice 2, the limit of choices really blows.)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Outside on a lounge chair next to a pool<br>\r\nVanilla woke up slowly, the normal comforting warmth of her bed empty as she wasn't woken up by her daughter's laughter, or her gentle shaking rather by a simple beam of life penetrating through her window and striking her eye. She slowly sat up and let out a gentle yawn before getting up, making her bed, and then heading to her bathroom. She took a nice long shower, a luxury that was in short supply when Cream wasn't out playing with her friends. Vanilla made sure that her fur was soft and shiny before exiting the shower. She walked back into the bedroom a towel wrapped around her body and thought about what she could do today. She had invested the money her husband had given her wisely and neither mother or daughter would need to work for the rest of their lives unless they chose to. After a few seconds of thought she decided on sunbathing, donning a simple purple one-piece she noticed that the suit felt tight around her chest and her ass. \"I guess I'm not the lean little bunny I used to be\" she thought glumly before exiting her bedroom, grabbing a towel before stopping in the kitchen, eating a banana, and than walking out to her backyard pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up slowly, the sun beating down on him, the smell of chlorine assaulting his nostrils and the sound of birds filling his ears. He slowly turned over, the sun attempting to blind him even before he opened his eyes. He quickly sat up as his brain reminded him that he should not be sleeping outside on a...velvety surface, what? He turned around and saw what he was sleeping on, it was green and covered in velvet, he swore it looked almost like a giant pillow, as he took the time to actually examine his surroundings he was honestly quite afraid of what he saw, not because anything was dangerous but because what of what it implied for him. He appeared to be sitting on top of one of two pillows adorning a white lounge chair, a second one further up meant to prop up the head while the one he was sleeping on was probably meant to be sat upon or used as a foot rest. The chair was sitting on the side of a quite large pool with grass on one side and what looked like a patio on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patio was honestly what scared him most as he knew that for better or worse he was on someone's property and he was probably only a few inches tall. As he thought about a way of escaping his current location a sound that filled him with dread met his ears, the sound of a sliding glass door. He turned to the patio and his jaw dropped as he saw what or rather who exited the gigantic home. He stared at Vanilla Rabbit this would have been bad enough if she was standing there wearing her normal outfit as he'd guess she was probably 150ft tall, but she was standing there wearing a swimsuit that looked at least a size too small for her the fabric he could see was straining to contain her assets. She walked purposely straight to the lawn chair he was standing on, this making sense as it was the only one but he still cursed his bad luck. He expected her to stop and scream, or stare, or something but she looked right over him and dropped the towel onto the arm of the chair before turning to sit down. He obviously couldn't just let himself be sat on so he reared back and shouted at the top of his lungs \"STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla screamed and jumped forward at the sudden yell right behind her, turning her eyes blazing with fury at whoever would dare violate the sanctuary of her home, her gaze instantly softened at what she saw, standing upon the pillow she going to sit on was a man, no larger than 2 inches tall and despite his yell she could see his body shivering, she just stood there dumbfounded for several seconds before slowly bending over and gently reaching an arm forward to touch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are, are you real?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was trying his hardest to stop shivering as he literally just stared death in the face, death by milf bunny ass is definitely a way to go but he still didn't want to die. He slowly looked Vanilla in the eye and she stopped moving for a second \"yes, I'm real, sorry about scaring you like that, not exactly the place I expected to wake up this morning\" he replied as he attempted to smile up at the titanic lagomorph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his words were meant to comfort they hit Vanilla like a sledgehammer as she stopped moving, every worst case scenario appearing in her head 'does this mean my wish kidnapped him, what if he has a family? What if he has a wife and child? I just stole him from them, I'm worse than my husband.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared in confusion as Vanilla's face turned from one of confusion, to utter horror, to just despair before her gaze fell solely on him and she spoke two words \"I'm sorry\" before breaking down. He was at a complete loss at what to do as Vanilla sat on the ground and cried. \"Hey look it's not your fault, it's not like you're the reason I'm here\" he said trying to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes I-it is, a-and y-yes I-I am\" she wailed in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was caught off guard for a second but he knew Vanilla's personality and there was no way that she meant any harm by, however she brought him here. \"Look, just tell me why you're crying and we can sort this out\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I st-stole you fr-from your w-wife and child\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you didn't\" his response was so quick that Vanilla actually stopped crying \"look I don't know how exactly I got here but I can tell you that I've never been married, and honestly I've never really even thought of kids let alone had one so if you're the reason I'm here you haven't stole me from anyone...well except the rest of my family but I've moved out so hopefully I'll be able to figure out how to contact them somehow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla slowly stopped crying \"I'm sorry about this, I never expected my wish to come true\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla's ears went red \"w-well I made a wish on a star, and it brought you here, it was just a silly wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, so umm...what do we do now?\" he asks taking a seat upon the pillow. Vanilla slowly stood back up and sat down on the chair beside him, her weight landing on the chair causing him to bounce slightly into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since I'm the reason you're here, I would be a terrible rabbit if I didn't offer you a place to stay\" Vanilla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at her \"that really isn't necessary Ms...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanilla, Vanilla Rabbit\" she replied a small smile crossing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you Vanilla\" he replied, there was an awkward silence for a few seconds before Vanilla cleared her throat/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name is?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks flared as he realized how rude he was \"my name isn't really important\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla leaned over her amber eyes gazing intently at him \"your name is important, I mean I have to call you something\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really wasn't sure why but he didn't want to give Vanilla his name, thinking for a second he replied \"you can just call me whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever I want?\" she replied he couldn't help but notice a slight reddening of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you want\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright, my little darling\" Vanilla's ears went red as soon as she said it and he was sure his ears went red too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, darling?\" he said looking up at Vanilla who now couldn't keep eye contact and only nodded. \"Isn't that a little personal?\" he asked, again this bringing an instant blush to her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am single, and you said your single, and you are the man I wished for\" she replied a small smile forming on her face as she gained confidence, it now being his turn to blush. He gave off a small yelp as he felt Vanilla's slender fingers wrap around his chest and lower body and he was lifted up so that she could lie down on the chair, his form being placed down in front of her. \"I know we just met, but well it's been a long time since I've dated and you're...unique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you can just stick me in a jar if you're mad at me\" the joke surprisingly got Vanilla to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you say?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a few seconds before answering \"I'll be staying with you anyways, so I guess, but you won't kick me out if things don't turn out will you?\" He knew Vanilla pretty well, but he really wasn't in a position for making any mistakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, that would be horrible\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" he said sitting back \"what do you want to do?\"</span></div></div>",

If you want, we can even stay right by the staircase.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved, he was eager to swim again. \"Well great, let's go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla held out her hand, and he hoisted himself up onto her palm. From here, he could get a better view of the pool and how it seemed to stretch out, almost to the length of a football field. As Vanilla walked over to the pool, her hands swayed side to side. He made sure to hang onto one of her fingers for a bit of support. <br>\r\nMoments later, Vanilla knelt down to drop him off, getting ready to enter the pool herself. While she slid off her sandals, he realized that he had no swimsuit of his own to change into. He was a bit embarrassed, but didn't quite want to bother the rabbit. As she unwrapped the towel around her waist, he noticed not too far away a few dolls, appropriately themed for the beach. They might feel a bit stiff, but the swimsuits on the dolls would be better than swimming naked. He took a few steps in their direction before hearing Vanilla shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the water in this pool is always so cold, even on a hot day like this. Are you coming in, darling?\" She called out to you, biding her time before diving in fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, just a minute!\" He responded. He had to admit, Vanilla was right when she said today was hot. But then again, so was she. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I can show you around, my home is your home now\" Vanilla said happily. He had no real qualms with this, and was a little surprised that Vanilla had so readily accepted him as a part of her home. He waited as Vanilla reached for him and he was once again lifted up, this time being placed on her shoulder. He quickly sat down and Vanilla slightly turned her head towards him \"comfy?\" She asks. \"Yes\" he replies and with that Vanilla walked away from the pool and back towards her home. Surprisingly they had to walk all the way to the front of the home to enter, as they did however Vanilla couldn't help but laugh as she saw the look on her little darling's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The entrance to Vanilla's home wasn't normal, it was a large indoor courtyard, continuing their little tour they entered a large entry hall with an adjoining sitting room and a stairway heading both up to an upper floor and down to a basement. Vanilla stops and seems to think for a moment before taking the stairs down, the two of them coming out into a small common room. What surprised you was what lay behind a door just to the right of the common room, a fully stocked wine cellar. Looking up at Vanilla you saw a small blush upon her cheeks as she quickly shut the door, \"I like wine\" she said quickly before walking into the next room. The main room of the basement was a recreational room, directly across from where they entered was a family room, and there was a small hallway off to the left. \"Down that hallway is our own little private theater, as well as a guest bedroom with its own bathroom\" Vanilla says. To the right of the recreation room you found out was another bathroom, another guest bedroom with its own bathroom, some storage and a covered terrace that connected to the family room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Heading back upstairs Vanilla quickly walked through the entranceway revealing the main room of the main floor was a large dining room with an adjoining kitchen on the right, another small hallway on the left hand side and a large two-story room with a grand piano sitting proudly in its center opposite the entranceway. Entering the kitchen Vanilla walked to its right hand side and opened another door revealing another hallway \"the pantry and laundry are down there\" she said before turning and walking to the opposite wall. Opening another door she revealed a deck/porch that seemed to curve around the house and connected both to the kitchen as well as to the room with the piano in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Walking back through the dining room and taking the stairs up this time the two ended up in what looked like a small library, with a single door on the left and an adjoining loft on the right. Walking into the loft Vanilla walks up to a railing, the loft looking down on the piano room, Vanilla walks up to the room on the right and reveals another bedroom \"with adjoining bath, the door in the library leads to another bedroom much the same\" Vanilla says. He was a little surprised as Vanilla now sounded, nervous. Now that he took a few seconds ever since they had been to that wine cellar Vanilla had almost been rushing through their little tour, like she was embarrassed about the size of her home, heck he was pretty sure he hadn't even seen a third of the house, just heard it was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vanilla quickly walked back downstairs and took the hallway to the left, \"this is the master bedroom\" she says. Vanilla opened up a door to the right of the entrance to the room revealing a large walk-in closet, and a door to the left of the entrance of the room led to the master bath. Looking from Vanilla's shoulder he could see a large four-posted bed made of mahogany and covered in red and gold sheets. A dresser sat opposite the end of the bed, and opposite the entrance to the room there was a large window-seat with a large window looking out upon a garden. He looked back at the dresser and noticed it was covered in pictures of Vanilla and Cream, now that he thought back there had been numerous pictures of the two throughout the house he just hadn't paid them much attention. \"Who's that?\" he asks pointing to one of the pictures, Vanilla walks up and picks up the picture, he was a little surprised as she stared down at it forlornly \"that's my little Creamy\" Vanilla says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The first thought that went through his head was \"holy shit is Cream dead?\", but he obviously couldn't as that. \"So where is she now?\" he asks. Vanilla paused for a second before replying \"Cream's off at school, she'll only be coming home for Christmas and the Summer months.\" Vanilla replies. He found himself letting out a soft sigh \"really glad that Cream's not dead\" he thought. As far as kids go he usually wasn't that good with them, but Cream was always a respectful, gentle little girl so he was sure even at this size he could probably handle her. \"So....is that why you made that wish, because you were lonely without Cream here?\" he asked, Vanilla nodded slightly before surprisingly starting to tear up. Before he could move he was pressed lightly against Vanilla's cheek as she started to cry \"I miss my little Creamy\" she sobbed, he really wasn't sure what he could do other than to gently stroke Vanilla's cheek and do his best to try to comfort her. \"It's ok, I'm sure Cream is missing you as much as you're missing her, I'm sure she's being well taken care of and is having fun, making friends\" he said. Obviously he couldn't know that, he didn't even know where Cream was, but he had to assume that Vanilla had chosen Cream's school and Vanilla would never let anything happen to her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Slowly but surely Vanilla started to calm down, although he had to do a bit of dodging as she lifted her arms up to wipe away the tears, \"thank you\" Vanilla said giving him a soft smile \"you really didn't need to do that\" she said. \"Of course I did\" he replied \"everyone needs a shoulder to cry on when they're sad...metaphorically speaking.\" Vanilla again giggled and he found that he was enjoying that sound more and more \"besides what kind of man would I be if I let a beautiful woman cry\" he said, then froze as he realized he said that out loud. Looking up at Vanilla he saw a deep red blush upon her cheeks and Vanilla looked away abashed. \"I should probably go and freshen up\" she says, he knew this was true but it was also probably a way for her to get away from him for a little while. He was quickly placed down upon the bed before Vanilla walked off, she walked to the master bath and quickly entered. It was silent for a few seconds as he assumed Vanilla was getting undressed. A few seconds after that he heard the sower start up, and surprisingly he heard what sounded like singing. He couldn't help but smile slightly at the fact that Vanilla was one of those people who liked to sing in the shower, and from what he was hearing she was quite good. Sitting there he couldn't help but have a few thoughts, namely that Vanilla Rabbit was having a shower, and he wasn't trying to wiggle his way under the door of the bathroom. 'Of course you aren't' he chided himself 'you respect her too much to do something like that'. Yet despite that thought some quite...alluring images of Vanilla just wouldn't leave his head. Finally he decided...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

An entire palace and its guard, dozens of rooms of traps, and still Captain Whiskers had somehow been able to steal the Jeweled Scepter, again! She had trusted 100 of her \"elite\" guard when they had asked her to take care of the scepter, an item of such value and power it could only be compared to the Sol emeralds themselves, and they had failed her. Blaze sighed as she spared a glance to the pouch at her side, the Sol Emeralds would always stay safe she would make sure of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh, what be bothering ye lass?\" Captain Whisker taunted \"it weren't like ye actually expected those pitiful defences to keep me from me rightful booty did ye?\" Blaze only growled her response, and urged herself to run faster, obviously Whisker had given himself a few upgrades since last they had met, he shouldn't have made it past the edge of the castle before she had captured him, but she had been giving chase for several minutes, and while she was gaining ground it was at a slow pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chase continued for several more minutes before Blaze was able to corner Whisker's at the edge of a cliff. \"Very good Lass\" Whisker said tipping his hat to her \"however I be the one wielding the Jeweled Scepter, and unlike last time ye don't have your little friends to help ye. Where be they by the way? Last I heard they up and skedaddled.\" Whisker meant for the simple taunt to confuse Blaze, however all it did was anger her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends, who needs friends?\" The ferocity with which the words were spoken surprised even Whiskers. \"Friends are those who say they care about you, but all they care about is themselves. They use you till they get what they want from you, they say that they'll visit, but you never see them again.\" Blaze's words became more and more personal as she spoke, each word being emphasized by a single step towards the Captain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now, you better step back lass, I-I be the one wielding this here scepter, a-and if you don't step back I'll be sending all the islands straight down to Davy Jones Locker.\" These words prompted Blaze to stop, and Whiskers to speak words which would spell his doom. \"Lassie, we all know that you can't beat me all on your lonesome, you're nothing without your friends.\" With these words, Whisker would swear he heard the sound of a rope snapping, out of the pouch on Blaze's side levitated seven emerald cut gems, the Sol emeralds. The 7 gems began to spin around Blaze before speeding towards her. In a blinding flash of light Blaze transformed into Burning Blaze, the sheer heat from the flames surrounding her causing Captain Whisker to take a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well Lassie, you have ol Cap'n Whiskers beat it seems, what say ye I just be given ya back this here scepter and we all can just go on our merry way?\" Whiskers knew he was beat, but what he saw scared him, there was no mercy in her eyes, and while he had clashed with the lass before, this was the first time she had ever regarded him so coldly. Whiskers let go of the scepter and it fell to the ground, rolling till it reached Blaze's feet, however she ignored it. Slowly she took a step forward and he took one back, this pattern continued till he was standing just on the edge of the cliff. \"Al-alright lass, this be not funny anymore ol Cap'n Whisker is sorry, so I think it be time to be hauling me away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it\" Blaze's voice was cold, something Captain Whisker had never heard, sure he knew she was supposed to be the stoic guardian of the Sol Emeralds, but there was usually some emotion to her voice, usually anger as she chased after him but there was none in her voice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Say what lass? Ye be making no sense.\" Captain Whisker honestly thought about jumping off the cliff, however being a robot with no aquatic subsystems, he would be the one sinking to Davy Jones Locker if he fell off that cliff, and that wasn't something he was hoping to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say that I'm just fine without any friends and I don't need them\" Captain Whisker winced at the renewed anger in Blaze's voice, but he wasn't exactly going to go against her, not when he was stuck between her and a drop off a cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Aye lass, ye beat me fair and square all on your lonesome, ye don't have any need for friends, and you\u2019re just fine without them.\" Blaze's eyes narrowed for a second as she regarded the captain, with a nod of her head she turned, picked up the scepter, and took off back to the castle. It only took her a minute to return to her room in the castle, with a sigh she held the scepter in her hands, contemplating the power it had yet for all that power it couldn't give her what she wanted. Images of the adventures she had shared with Sonic and his friends appeared in her mind, Sonic and Tails had even come to the Sol dimension once, and they had again fought as allies. That had been a long time ago, and she hadn't heard anything or received even a visit from Sonic and his friends. Tails and Sonic had returned home, and she had used the power of the Sol Emeralds to visit Sonic's dimension for his birthday one year, so she knew it was possible to travel dimensions, relatively easily in her opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really that unimportant, I thought I was a good friend, and I thought they were my friends, they helped me retrieve the Sol Emeralds rather than steal them, and Sonic and Tails aided me in retrieving the Jeweled Scepter. So why does it seem like they've forgotten me?\" Blaze hated this feeling, she had opened her heart so that she could make friends, but all it had allowed was for them to hurt her. \"I-I just want a true friend, is that so much to ask for, someone who would actually be there for me?\" Blaze was on the edge of tears by the end, while she hadn't let it show Whisker's taunts had hurt her deeply. Staring again at the scepter she sighed before placing it under her pillow, \" I might as well go tell the guard that I've returned the scepter, and that it stays with me from now on.\" With that Blaze walked out of the room, this absence meaning she missed the glow that began to emanate from under her pillow, the Jeweled Scepter activating at Blaze\u2019s heartfelt plea.<br>\r\n_____________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were feeling pretty good at the moment, while you hadn't had anything amazing happen like winning the lottery, everything was more or less working out. Bills were getting paid ahead of time, work wasn't too bad, and nothing life-changing had occurred, so while things weren't perfect, they could definitely be a lot worse. You sighed staring up at the bright blue sky before returning your vision to the road, that was slowly becoming more and more blurry, 'that couldn't be good' you thought, you tried to fight off whatever was affecting you, but slowly your vision began to darken. Your other senses must have been affected as well because it felt like you were falling for a second before you landed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What happened?!\" Jet's angry voice cut through even the loud cheers as Sonic stood at the finish line, Wave had run up from her spot in the dessert, her eyes wide as she stared at Sonic's perfectly intact Extreme gear. Wave couldn't speak for several seconds, she had made that bomb herself every inch of wiring, every micro-circuit had been perfect. She was finally able to speak as she saw that two-tailed fox pal of Sonic's walk up to him, hidden behind his back was a small pair of pliers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fox, he disarmed the bomb\" she growled, she was about to go and give that rat a piece of her mind before Jet stopped her, shaking his head, the three Rouges walked up to Sonic and his friends, Jet plastered the biggest, fakest smile Wave had ever seen on his face before making to shake Sonic's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations buddy, guess the better racer won\" The venom in Jet's voice was enough to make a cobra jealous, Sonic only smiled and nodded back at Jet, making his way towards the emeralds. Jet suddenly ran past him, holding up the key of Babylon, before anyone knew what was happening, the Chaos Emerald's floated into the air, striking the key with a beam of light before the key activated, raising Babylon Gardens from its burial place beneath the sands. Wave watched Jet stand there triumphantly, before a claw came out of nowhere and snatched the key out of Jet's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohohoho\" Eggman laughed as his eggmoble held the Key of Babylon in its pincer, \"now the treasure of Babylon is al mine\" he cried before taking off for the ruins, Amy Rose somehow jumping on the back of his craft. Wave ran up to Jet and was about to take off after Eggman before Jet's arm blocked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going?\" Jet's voice was cold, something Wave had never heard before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the Babylon Gardens of course, to claim the treasure our ancestors left us\" Wave replied her voice a mix of excitement, trepidation and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The treasure was left for the Babylonians, you lost the right to call yourself that the minute you failed\" Jet replied. \"Come on Storm, we have a treasure to claim\" and with that Jet and Storm took off after Eggman, Sonic and his friends having already left to chase the doctor. Wave could only stare there slackjawed for several moments, unable to comprehend what was happening, she had worked all her life to unearth the treasure of Babylon, Jet and Storm always at her side, they had been a trio, and they had just cast her aside like a tool, like one of her wrenches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave jumped on her extreme gear and took off back to their private airship, she spent a long time, several hours in fact cooped up in her room before she finally was able to pull herself together. With a determined smirk on her lips she started up the ship's cloaking field and made her way to the Babylon Gardens, Jet and Storm didn't want her as a Babylon Rouge anymore, fine she was alright with that. The airship was hers now, and any treasure she was sure her former partners missed would be quite valuable, neither of them were really that observant, they'd miss a pile o gold coins if it was sitting on a big altar waiting to be taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave took a few hours and searched every nook and cranny before heading for what was the obvious treasure room hoping to find something, sadly there was nothing, as she entered the main treasure room she could do naught but let out a shriek, as the room was empty, from only smooth stone walls, ceiling and floors met her gaze. With a sob she collapsed against one of the walls, there was nothing, nothing, all tis time, all those years wasted. Wave however didn't notice the slight motion of the wall she was leaning against until it moved, swinging inward, Wave falling backwards and landing on the top step of a narrow spiral staircase. 'What's this?' the thought echoed through her head, with a shrug she descended the steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe descended the steps for several minutes, strangely even though she had descended paste light provided by the door after several seconds she found herself able to easily navigate the steps. Down into the depths of the gardens Wave went, when the steps finally ended she was in a long hallway leading up to an altar, atop the altar was a large arch made out of metal, honestly it looked kind of like a gateway some form of control panel sitting near it. Walking forward she tapped one of the keys tentatively, a large holographic screen appearing before her. There she saw what the device was, and all she could do was scoff \"dimensional relocate pfft, yeah right\" she thought as she tapped through the options for the apparent 'dimensional portal'. \"So what do we have here? Location of entry, location of exit...size of object? Even if this does what it says it does why would the Babylonians need something like that. Why do they have technology that seems like its thousands of years ahead of what we have?\" Wave thought to herself as she keyed in a bit of information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave sighed before smiling \"this seems to be the real treasure of Babylon, so let's see whether this thing really works or not. Location of Entry, hmm\" she thought for a few seconds before putting in a random location, what she didn't notice was on top of the usual x, y, and z values there was also a 4th value. This 4th value was the dimensional value, and at the moment it wasn't set for Mobius. \"Hmm, well let's see location of exit, it should probably be somewhere on the ship, but where should I put whatever I get the cargo hold? My room? Hmm\" Wave spent a few minutes in thought before finally deciding on where she wanted whatever was going to come through to show up then inputting the location in. \"Now all I have to pick is a size, well obviously I don't want it to be too small as I want to actually be able to notice it, but what if I pull something alive through.\" That thought gave her pause for a few seconds mainly about actually using the device that stood before her \"I'm sure if I pull anything through it'll be like a squirrel or something. 4 inches should be small enough\" with a satisfied smirk she typed in the value and stared at the activation key. \"Now or never\" she thought before hitting it. With a loud groan underneath her she heard...something activating before the portal in front of her flared into life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave was no coward but she'd admit she took a few steps back as a swirling purple vortex filled the gateway. She saw some sort of pinprick at the centre of the portal for a fraction of a second before it disappeared in a flash of light, with a loud whine the machine suddenly fell silent, the \"portal\" collapsing in on itself before disappearing. \"D-Did it work?\" she thought, a hint of trepidation about using that device entering her thoughts as she walked up to the console and tried to reactivate it. \"Guess that last use must have fried the circuits, or drained it. I can't imagine sitting in the ground for millennia has done this place much good\" she thought. With a shrug she turned around and headed back to the airship, she knew exactly where she had sent whatever had come through, if something had come through, and she planned to find it and see if this thing was legit or not, if it was...then it was a shame that it seemed to be fried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a nice peaceful day, quite idyllic actually the sun was shining, bathing the meadow you laid in with its soft warm rays. A gentle breeze wafted over you, cooling you slightly; there was nothing to worry about here, no co-workers getting on your nerves, no deadlines to be met, and no mortgage to be paid. You shifted uncomfortably as the thoughts of what awaited you come the morrow returned to your mind. You let out a sigh then a grunt as you couldn\u2019t find the comfortable sot you had been in just a moment prior, you kept shifting around but it was like you weren\u2019t even laying on the same thing. With another exasperated grunt you sat up and opened your eyes\u2026what you saw shocked you as you were\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wave couldn't help the quick pace she maintained after she re-entered her airship. while whatever that machine would have spit out would only be a few inches tall it was the only treasure her people would have left her. Centuries of history, and it wouldn't be going too far to say her whole life culminated in seeing what awaited her on top of her dresser. She froze a few feet in front of the door to her bedroom, took in a big breath, released it and calmed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly opening the door she walked into the room. As she entered years of practice looking over the most minute components told her everything seemed to be in order, her queen-size bed still lay in the center of the room as well as her nightstand, no damage had been done to the large wardrobe on the right wall, and the door to her ensuite bathroom was in the exact same position it had been when she left. Turning to face her vanity she saw something sitting in the center of the darkened wood, it looked like a human, only shrunken down to 4 inches exact. She couldn't let on that she had noticed what she assumed to be a guy as there were no breasts, looking over her new shrunken companion she admired herself in the mirror and inwardly cringed. Searching the ruins had left near every inch of her dusty and dirty and while she would be considered a tomboy, as she had grease stains coating nearly her whole body more times than she could count, she still took pride in her appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInwardly sighing she turned and headed towards her ensuite bathroom, her new little friend wouldn't be going anywhere soon, the vanity was too high and there was nothing on it that could help him get down, with a satisfied smirk crossing her features she closed her bathroom door and got ready for a long, and in her mind well-deserved hot shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but jump as the gigantic door that lay across the expanse of the room in front of him closed, the difference in size making the simple sound echo like a thunderclap. What, or rather who he had just seen he had no idea, she and he knew it was a girl due to the small but still noticeable breasts that pressed against her tight top. She seemed to be some kind of bird-woman as she had a beak, although she had purple fur that was so fine it looked almost like skin, her leaning over had given him a very close look at her. The giant bird-woman could maybe be his way out, or his way home but first he had to figure his way off of, whatever it was he was on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around he was able to see several items that looked like beauty products, and the fact that there was a large mirror behind him led him t deduce he was on top of a vanity, although this information did him little good other than telling him he could still recognize items at his diminutive size. Spending a few moments to look around, he was startled as the sound of running water started up, she was taking a shower, if she was like most women that gave him a few minutes to figure something out. Quickly running from one corner of the vanity to the other he couldn't see anything he could use to get down, sighing he laid back against what seemed to be a compress, there was nothing he could do until the bird-woman finished her shower...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing Wave stepped out of the shower, hot steam filling the room \"took longer than I thought\" she muttered, then shrugged it wasn't like Jet or Storm would get mad at her for using all the hot water anymore, and at the moment she didn't have any treasure she was planning to steal so there weren't any deadlines to fill she could be a bit indulgent. Taking a few moments to dry off as her body really liked to retain water after she bathed,  she exited the bathroom and humming happily waked over towards her wardrobe. Taking a moment to decide she chose a simple pair of white pajamas before letting the towel fall to the floor, she took her time getting dressed making sure each movement was pronounced and noticed. Wave didn't forget that her little guest was there, and in fact she could feel his gaze on her body, surprisingly she was enjoying the feeling of him watching. It was naughty Wave knew that, but she was the one in complete control. She decided how much he saw and whether his little show ended. In a few moments she finished placing her pajamas on yet her little companion's gaze never left her body as she turned and walked up to the vanity, taking a seat she grabbed a brush and began to brush out her hair into its iconic twin trail style. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could honestly keep the game of not knowing he was there going for a while, but she was a treasure hunter not some cruel tyrant, letting out a sigh she looked down at the vanity \"where did I put...\" surprising even her the micro was right under her face, so her eyes fell near instantly on him. She couldn't help but pull back, as did he and she simply stared at him for a few seconds before lowering her head and really examining him. She noticed small things about him that she couldn't at a distance. He was wearing a black t-shirt, khaki shorts, and he was even wearing small sneakers and socks, his eyes stared up at her and she saw several emotions in them, confuse, trepidation, and a hint of fear characterizing his gaze but there was a hint of curiosity and awe as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...Hi\" Wave's eyes widened as she saw her diminutive companion speak, his mouth opening as if to shout although it sounded like little more than normal room level speech to her. Wave couldn't help but smirk a bit, this little guy had a lot of guts to start up the conversation, given their difference in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\" Wave replied, she had to take a second to decide just what she wanted to do with her diminutive shipmate, she didn't have any jobs even those requiring precision that she'd need a second pair of hands with, although he might be quite useful to get through cracks when treasure hunting, \"assistant\" worked quite well in her eyes, besides she could always just have him take care of her if nothing else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in my home?\" she asked, there wasn't any malice behind the words, but there was definite authority. She couldn't help but giggle internally as she saw him freeze for a second and try to come up with a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't honestly know\" he replied honestly, while he knew the answer would seem inadequate, he had no other \"I was just laying down and then I found myself...here\" he emphasized his point by sweeping his arms across the expanse of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Wave pretended to ponder his answer, although it sounded about right, given that he had been teleported to her room rather than confirm or deny him she decided to have a little fun. \"While I was changing it felt like there was someone watching me, you wouldn't happen to know about that would you?\" Her question ending with a slight coo, she knew that he'd make excuse after excuse and that was all the justification she needed to start the ball rolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yes I did, I'm sorry\" his voice was barely audible and characterized by regret and remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave swore she heard a record scratch in her head \"W...wait what did you just say?\" she asked leaning over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I watched you change, I'm sorry but you just looked so beautiful...\" He trailed off and Wave could only stare at him for a few seconds, no way was she expecting him to fess up and to compliment her as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, so you admit to peeping on me\" Wave took a second to consider her options before deciding that being \"somewhat\" honest would work best. \"I don't think it'd be proper to punish you without knowing just who you are, so?\" Wave trailed off and he looked away for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J...Jack, you can call me Jack\" he replied hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave smiled for a second, \"I'm Wave, a treasure hunter, now Jack considering you were...honest with me I'm going to let you decide what you do to make up for peeping on me, understand?\" Wave was honestly expecting him to come up with some line like \"then I pick nothing\" or something like that but she was surprised when he said....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(I know the chapter just stops, but 10,000 character limit screwed me over)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh escaped Sally Acorn\u2019s lips as she walked around Mobotropolis, despite the drafty nature of her attire, black shorts with white trimming, a black crop-top with a light blue vest atop it, dark blue boots with white outlines along the buckles and white gloves she was warm as the sun\u2019s warm gentle rays beat down upon her. Looking out over the kingdom of Mobotropolis from one of Castle Acorn\u2019s numerous turrets she tried to remember a time when they had not been at war with Doctor Eggman. Unable to recall a time since her early youth she felt a shiver run through her body. Knothole was safe as it should be, as was her own kingdom, Doctor Eggman had not unleashed a single attack, attempted roboticization, or raid for several days. That did not mean that he still was not out there, as she would not trust any report that the megalomaniac was defeated and out of the picture until she had him standing before him preferably with every extremity lashed and shackled. As she thought about all the pain that monster had caused her personally, the unfathomable suffering he had caused the people of her kingdom and the world at large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic himself had reported that Eggman was no more, one of his latest death-dealing machines having exploded before the tyrant could escape when Sonic defeated him. At least that was what the hedgehog believed, moments before the machine had exploded the facility they had been battling in had begun to collapse and Sonic just escaped, a backdraft wave following him out the building, moments later the entire structure collapsed. There had been no activity for several days, scouts were searching every inch of Robotropolis but there was still no sign of Eggman. She could not help but have this bad feeling about the whole thing, though Sonic had suffered several close calls over the years, even she had suffered one or two brushes with death Eggman had this nasty tendency of presumably dying only to come back stronger than ever. She did not want to believe that the war would start again, she wanted for it just be over with all her heart but she was not holding her breath. Sighing she glanced up at the blue sky, the white fluffy clouds, it was a beautiful day, not one to be spent indoors moping around about what might be, brooding about the most cynical and paranoid outcomes when her kingdom knew a peace false though it may be, short though it may be that they had not known in years. Leaving the tower she quickly navigated the intricate maze of halls passages, and corridors as well as the numerous interconnecting rooms that made up the interior of Castle Acorn until she arrived at the great throne room. There sitting on his throne was her father, for just a moment there was a phantom image of another throne, and another figure, a woman seated next to her father but in an instant, it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSally, is there something wrong my dear?\u201d King Maximillian asked his daughter, standing from the throne he was surprised to find her in the throne room. Normally when she came to him, it was to alert him of some trouble. \u201cIs Doctor Eggman back?\u201d He asked, the barest hint of fear entering his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no he\u2019s, he\u2019s still missing. I just came to let you know that I\u2019d be out in the village\u201d Sally replied, as she walked up to her father, her hands rising in a placating gesture as the ape guards began to look around warily at the mere mention of Eggman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSally, my dear you\u2019ve fought a war against Julian and Walter at completely separate times while I\u2019ve been trapped. For years you led the people instead of me, destroying factories, facing down armies, monsters, anything and everything that could or would dare threaten our kingdom and Mobius as a whole and I\u2019m not supposed to trust that you can visit the Mobotroplolis proper or Knothole by yourself?\u201d Despite his words there was a jovial, teasing tone to King Max\u2019s voice, one eyebrow raising as he looked at his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have been kidnapped a few times too Dad\u201d Sally replied abashedly, turning away and rubbing at her wrist in embarrassment \u201cand with Mom gone we\u2019re all each other has,\u201d Sally finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate the concern Sally\u201d King Max replied, as he strode across the throne room to embrace her. \u201cBut you are one of if not the most competent women on the planet, you\u2019ve faced a fair number of hardships and though I\u2019m your father you don\u2019t need to come to me for everything. I trust you and your judgement, especially on whether you can go out on such a beautiful day as today. Frankly, if I didn\u2019t have court to attend to I just might join you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d Sally replied, giving her father a quick peck on the cheek and a gentle but quick hug. With that Sally ran out of the throne room, racing down into Mobotropolis proper she was still a little surprised that the city despite Eggman\u2019s numerous attacks, the legions of badniks, hordes, of Swatbots, and a Death Egg or two had survived relatively unscathed. As she walked around the village she was greeted by numerous sights and smells; the scent of freshly baked bread, children scampering back and forth around their parents as they played with each other and friends, a pair of lovebirds exchanging sweet nothings as they walked hand in hand. Smiling she felt a gentle warmth suffused her body, this was what she fought against Robotnik for so that her people could have these moments, enjoy a peace and security she was denied during her own childhood. Every citizen that saw her gave her at least a small bow, some of the most conservative residents of the village bowing to one knee or curtsying so low the hems of their clothes touched the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to wave the royal treatment off but was quickly rebuffed by several citizens \u201cit\u2019s not just that you\u2019re the princess, you and the rest of the Freedom Fighters have saved all our lives dozens of times, the least we can do is show you the proper respect.\u201d That comment would have brought a bright flaring blush to Sally\u2019s cheeks if her fur did not get in the way; setting off after the minor interruption she passed a small alley when she heard something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, Princess Sally, come here,\u201d a voice from the alley called. Looking around Sally hesitated for a moment before her father\u2019s words came to mind, she was more than just the princess she was a freedom fighter. Even if there was someone waiting to ambush her, she could protect herself. Walking into the dark, dingy alley, she was surprised to find it very quickly opening into a small open space, several lanterns filling the area with light as the buildings surrounding the little space cast it into shadow. As she looked around the entire place, it was painfully barren except for a simple table facing the alley she had just come from. Spread across its length were numerous machines, just as strange as the machines themselves were the person standing on the other side of the table. A lanky overlander, standing far above herself stood there in a full suit, pearly white teeth were revealed as the man\u2019s lips split into a wide grin. \u201cI am so happy that you decided to take up my offer to visit my little store Princess, browse as you please\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMobians and Overlanders did not have the best of relations thanks to Eggman but the man seemed harmless, as she looked over the numerous gadgets and gizmos on display one caught her eye. Sitting atop the machine were the words \u201cWish-Granter\u201d in bright neon as if the creator had to make sure everyone knew what it was. The machine itself was simple, consisting of a slot that looked large enough to insert a ring into, a digital display, a microphone, and a lever. She could not help but chuckle as she pointed it out \u201chow\u2019s the \u201cWish-Granter\u201d work?\u201d Sally asked. Though she tried she could not help but let a giggle escape as the idea of a wish-granting machine was absurd. There were devices like the Ring of Acorns or the Chaos Emeralds that could grant wishes but no machine could do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple my dear princess, you just insert 100 rings, tell the machine what your wish is and pull the lever. The display tells you how many wishes you have left\u201d The man replied, a small smile splitting his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only get a limited number?\u201d Sally replied, her voice incredulous though she continued to humour the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, if it gave out unlimited wishes do you think I\u2019d be selling it?\u201d the man replied, his face once again splitting into that wide grin \u201cfor you princess I\u2019ll sell it for\u2026.100 Mobiums, royal discount and the fact that I\u2019ve already used four of the wishes\u201d he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hundred mobiums honestly was not that much money, her royal stipend easily gave her enough to purchase the item. The question was did she really want to spend that much money on something that didn\u2019t work? Shaking her head, and shrugging it wasn\u2019t like any harm could come from purchasing the device, looking it over there were no power gems or other energy sources on the device and she could always insert the rings one at a time to make sure powering up the device if it had any consequences wasn\u2019t too severe. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a deal\u201d Sally replied, reaching into her vest pocket as she did and pulling out a small roll of money before quickly counting out 100 mobiums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasure doing business with you Princess, hopefully, the device will make all your wishes come true\u201d the man replied placing the hand-held device into a small bag before handing it to her. Sally nodded her thanks and walked away if she had turned as she left the alley she would have seen it slowly fade away revealing a solid wall where two building met. </span></div></div>",

She could just wish Robotnik was gone\u2026or that all the horrible things he had done never happened, or that Sonic was hers. Giggling at that though she quickly returned to her room, after giving one of her guards an order to bring her 100 rings as she was working on a \u201csecret project.\u201d The requested rings were brought to her within minutes and with shaking fingers, she slowly inserted one ring after another into the machine. The number ticking its way up to 100, as soon as it hit 100 rings the display lit up, revealing a number five next to the \u201cwish\u201d label. With trembling fingers, she grabbed the microphone and prepared to make her wish. \u201cI w-wish that my true love was here in my hands right now.\u201d She did not even think about the strange wording, nor did she feel the slight magical effect on her as she made the wish, she only knew that there was a sudden flash of light...</span></div></div>",

Time seemed to stop as Eggman spoke the word that would devastate not only her husband but her whole world \u201cdetonate.\u201d What froze Bunnie\u2019s blood wasn\u2019t the paralyzing light, the searing heat, or the chunks of metal now scattered across the forest floor. It was the unmoving form of her husband lying there, his body covered in terrible burns down to the bone in some places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cANTOINE!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie bolted awake, a cold sweat covering her entire body as the same vivid memory, her own personal nightmare replayed through her mind once again. It had been months since she\u2019d moved away from Knothole, abandoning her duty and leaving Antoine behind. Getting rid of her robotics was a dream come true, she could be normal, she could\u2026raise a family. The thought brought a brief smile to her face as the crushing weight of reality fell back upon her. She was nearly useless to the resistance now, her robotics, her curse had been what allowed her to protect those she cared about. Looking back they\u2019d allowed her to help and protect so many. \u201cNow, ah\u2019m not good for much other than as a vegetable farmer.\u201d Her voice was characterized by pain, she wanted so badly to undo her mistakes, she\u2019d even be willing to be re-roboticized but nothing would be able to change the past, nothing could undo the pain caused by the fulfillment of her selfish wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up slowly, she reached for her hat, sitting atop her small bedside table Bunnie made her way through her modest home. A short hallway connected her bedroom to the rest of the home. Making her way quickly through the home and out the front door out onto her home\u2019s modest porch a gentle breeze stirred up blowing through Bunnie\u2019s sweat stained fur and hair. She didn't even notice the nightmare caused her to be drenched in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing out over the modest oasis she now called home, one of the few sanctuaries of the Great Dessert and Mobius as a whole. Slowly she let her eyes lift to the stars above her, the ephemeral dots of light strangely comforting the scarred fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, if ah\u2019ve done anything right with mah life, all ah want is to be able to do is protect someone again. Ah already failed mah Antoine, and\u2026\u201d Bunnie\u2019s voice slowly trailed off. This last nightmare had been the last straw for the poor drained bunny and even as she tried to continue speaking her words slowly devolved into subdued sobs that quickly turned into a keen wail as Bunnie thought about all she\u2019d lost, and in her own mind it was all her fault. She wasn\u2019t sure how long she stood outside her home sobbing into the darkness, but eventually the tears stopped flowing. Her body simply too exhausted to produce anymore tears rather than her sorrow leaving her. Bunnie turned and slowly trudged back into her home. Taking a minute to walk through her home she crawled back into bed and thankfully sleep quickly reclaimed Bunnie, in part due to the emotional exhaustion she was suffering. Unbeknownst to Bunnie, ever since she had looked to the skies and made her heartfelt plea, several stars had begun to glow brighter and brighter before vanishing completely from the night sky off to fulfill the duty entrusted to them, to bring Bunnie someone to protect and love.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bunnie gently yawned as she stirred from her fitful slumber, her eyes stuck fast as she tried to open them. Dried tears from the night before held her emerald orbs shut for a moment until she forced them open, Bunnie having to wipe at her eyes to clear them a moment later. Yawning she realized that much more than her eyes had been affected by her late-night excursion, her fur tear-stained and clinging to her body thanks to last night\u2019s emotional release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of bed she headed for her bedroom\u2019s adjoining bath, the small room large enough to hold her more than adequate bathtub, a toilet, as well as a small vanity and mirror. Taking a moment to examine herself in the mirror she was a little shocked at how she looked even though she wasn\u2019t usually a girl for primping and preening, that\u2019s how bad it was. Of specific note were her ears drooping behind her as well as her matted and generally messy fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Bunnie stripped out of her pajamas, the soft silken garments falling to the tiled bathroom floor with a soft \u201cthump\u201d. Stepping into the bathtub and shutting the curtain behind her, Bunnie started up the water \u201cI really need this\u201d she muttered tiredly. Yet as the hot water struck her exhausted body, new life seemed to flow into her, her body awakening as all the physical if not emotional stains were slowly cleansed from her by the beating droplets of warm water. \u201cAhhh\u201d the gentle sigh was one of peace, Bunnie knew she\u2019d have to eventually confront the events of the prior night, as this was an event she couldn\u2019t just ignore, but now wasn\u2019t the time for that. Leaning over she grabbed a bottle of fur-wash and after making sure a loofah was heavily coated, began to wash away what the water couldn\u2019t. In a matter of minutes the bathroom was filled with steam and the barest hint of lavender as Bunnie thoroughly cleaned from the tips of her lop-ears to the pads of her feet. Moving on Bunnie undid the braid holding her hair up, her long tresses cascading down over her shoulders and back in a golden waterfall. Focusing her attention on the freed locks Bunnie spent nearly a full minute washing and conditioning it, as while she was sure she\u2019d be getting dirty in the next several hours there was just something gross about having her hair dirty and clammy even if most of it was kept under her Stetson. Feeling refreshed and cleansed Bunnie turned off the water and stepped out of the bathtub, taking a good half-minute to examine herself in the mirror. Gone was most of the evidence of the previous night\u2019s events, now Bunnie\u2019s fur and hair shined in even the soft mornings light, gone was the doubt and sadness she\u2019d felt before\u2026atleast on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfidently Bunnie walked back into her room, and after a minute of choosing her outfit\u2026not that she had the greatest selection to begin with. It only took a few seconds to don a light blue underwear set, her usual pink jumpsuit, leather jacket and gloves \u201cnow where\u2019s mah hat\u2026\u201d she muttered before spotting it lying where she\u2019d left it, on her bedside table. Walking over she was just about to grab it when she noticed something\u2026strange, there was something nestled in the groove in the top of her hat. Slowly reaching forward and gently lifting the hat as slowly and quietly as she could Bunnie brought the hat as close as she could to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll be\u2026\u201d she muttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________________________________<br>\r\nSomething was wrong; Michael knew that much as he ran through the dreamscape, as a strange warmth seemed to surround every inch of his body as his legs carried him through the ink black landscape. Yet despite the comforting feeling from this warmth there was an even greater feeling, of a great weight looming over him, about to crush him. He could feel it growing closer and closer until \u201cAHHHH\u201d he woke up screaming, his eyes jumping from side to side as he looked around and very nearly screamed again. He was surrounded on all sides by horizontal golden-brown pillars covered in fur. Eyes following the pillars the colour shifted instantly from brown to pink, the different colour drawing his attention and his gaze upward, up past the two perfectly round orbs jutting out of the pink, up past another field of golden-brown to\u2026a face. With the admittance that he was looking up at a face, albeit one that looked very rabbit-like compared to the usual human face, a small fear was confirmed in his mind\u2026he was looking at a giant humanoid female specifically one that was at least part rabbit. Her emerald eyes focusing down upon him as her small pink nose seemed to almost twitch in excitement as a small smile graced her features. Before he could even think of moving one of her hands was beneath him, and he was carefully but quickly brought to her face. She opened her mouth as if to talk and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want from me?!\u201d Michael had tried his hardest but he couldn\u2019t help the outburst. The giant rabbit woman paused for a moment, he was about to repeat his question when he was suddenly lowered back down to where he\u2019d been before and her legs began to move as she changed position so she was spread across the bed before him staring down at him, head in her hands rather than surrounding him on all sides with her legs. <br>\r\n\u201cBetter Sugar?\u201d She asked, and while Michael was still freaking out, the fact he actually had space to move calmed him, if only slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, now answer my question\u201d He continued in as commanding a tone as he could muster, he knew he wasn\u2019t in control here, but the illusion of some sort of control was comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here\u201d her reply was characterized by what almost seemed like regret for her answer \u201cah was hoping you\u2019d know what was happening and ah could get a few answers from you, but ah guess that\u2019s not happening huh?\u201d She chuckled at the end of her sentence and while he was sure it was for his benefit more than anything else he stepped backwards unable to really accept what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThump\u201d He had been paying so much attention he hadn\u2019t even realized her left arm had reached over him and was now preventing him from moving any further as his back pressed against the solid wall of flesh. Wheeling around, ignoring every instinct that said he shouldn\u2019t give the giantess his back he was about to bolt before her right arm came down meeting with her left sealing off any exit he had. Suddenly the rabbit woman began to pull her arms back towards her; bracing himself to be smashed against her cheek Michael was surprised to find rather than crushing force he was surrounded by the same gentle warmth as in his dream as she gently rubbed her cheek against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re here, but ah promise ah\u2019m not here to hurt you\u201d she spoke sincerely or at the very least was very good at acting. Turning to face the giantess he was met with a soft smile barely a foot from him, although the rabbit woman quickly pulled her face back. \u201cAh\u2019m Bunnie, Bunnie Rabbot, and you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichael, Michael Phelps\u201d he replied hesitantly. Not like telling her his name really mattered, but he never knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet ya Michael\u201d Bunnie replied cheerily, \u201cnow ah\u2019m feeling a mite bit peckish as ah haven\u2019t eaten yet, would yah like some breakfast?\u201d Now that he wasn\u2019t freaking out over the situation it was quite surprising to Michael that Bunnie wasn\u2019t questioning what was happening as much as he was, then again she was the larger one, and he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be exactly worried if the roles were reversed in fact he\u2019d be pretty curious if a tiny rabbit woman appeared in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm\u2026yeah, food, food sounds good\u201d He replied softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, ya don\u2019t mind if I pick ya up do ya?\u201d Bunnie asked her legs flying above him as she slowly sat up, her form towering over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDepends what you want to do with me?\u201d He replied chuckling and trying to pass over the answer as a joke but being completely serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I just want to put ya in my pocket\u201d Bunnie replied opening a breast pocket on her leather jacket. \u201cI just don\u2019t have very many places to carry ya in, and I didn\u2019t think ya\u2019d want to just sit in my palm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pocket works fine\u201d Michael replied more quickly than he\u2019d intended, yet this seemed to only draw a giggle from Bunnie as she suddenly reached forward, her fingers closing on the back of his shirt with surprisingly little force yet extreme dexterity. Slowly he was lifted from the bed, and above her right front pocket, rather than letting him drop however Bunnie took the extra time and care to place him in the rather spacious pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go get some breakfast\u201d With those words and a pat to his pocket Bunnie began to walk through her home. Yet this pat made something very clear to Michael, namely that he was in a \u201cbreast\u201d pocket, as Bunnie\u2019s pat was enough to press him against the soft warm orb his pocket backed onto. This contact making him acutely aware of how he was separated from a breast larger than his entire body by only a comparative inch or so of fabrics, this realization causing his cheeks to flush profusely. Slowly Bunnie got up and began to walk through her home\u2026</span></div></div>",

Someplace isolated for her to go when things became too hectic or when she needed time to think like now. Sighing she slumped against one of the world\u2019s digital trees, the green flora just resembling the real-life plant it was supposed to represent. Holding up one gloved hand, slowly the blacktopped, white-bottomed glove faded away revealing a slender brown hand. Flexing and unflexing her fingers she had to wonder just how real she was the truth revealed to her after revealing Dr.Ellidy had left her in a state of shock and for a while panic had overwhelmed her systems\u2026her body.

Always she had been acting in relation to another, with Dr.Ellidy and as loathe as she was to admit it, with Sally. She did not begrudge her friend, she was only a little girl when the two of them had first met and Sally was one of the reasons she had so desired, evolved to be more than just what she was. Yet she still acted only in relation to her friend, aiding the Freedom Fighters was a noble goal, they were acting to restore the whole world from the destruction Eggman had wrought and yet there had to be more to life? If there was more to life, than what was it? She was connected to the Royal Archive, so as she was wont to do she went searching through the vast repository of information, thousands of books worth of info, lifetimes of knowledge flowed through her in an instant as she searched desperately for that which so eluded her. As she finished her search a sigh escaped her soft gentle lips, there was no consensus on what the reason for life was, reasons ranging from money, to power, to the selfless sacrifice for another. There was a greater consensus on the more altruistic reasons, to help others, self-sacrifice, and of course love. Love, she had observed the emotion displayed by several of her teammates, Amy expressed it for Sonic, Sonic and Sally seemed to express it for each other though they seemed to attempt to hide the emotion. It was especially present in the actions between Antoine and Bunnie and yet despite multiple viewings of the emotion from several of her most trusted friends she still did not understand the emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, she gazed up at the pale green sky of the Digital world, pixelated clouds outlined by dark lines of green floating overhead as the world attempted to simulate reality to some degree. Shaking her head she walked further and further into uncharted territory, though she knew Phage was out there somewhere, the malicious viral entity, a construct of Dr.Eggman she was fairly confident she was safe. She could return to her terminal at any time, and the Red Star Ring leant to her and the other Freedom Fighters by Dr.Ellidy now stayed permanently attached to her console. She could \u201coverclock\u201d as Sally had described the process, whenever she wished. Even without the power boost waiting in the wings the digital world was as large if not larger than the real Mobius, Phage would never find her even if it came looking, after their first encounter she had no intentions of meeting the entity again and had set up every personal firewall, and protection program she could not be tracked. Kilometer after virtual kilometer fell away beneath her paws as she walked, though the digital world had never seemed beautiful to her before she had gained a new insight into life and now looked on it with some awe. How such a massive program could have been built was beyond her, and in fact, no one on Mobius knew where the Digital World had come from. It already existed when Mobians first learned to access it, Rotor once describing it to her as \u201ca global system of interconnected networks\u201d though as far as anyone could tell the networks the Digital world had been connected to no longer existed yet it still remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked the Digital world around her began to change as he forced some of her will on the landscape, gone were the plain green textures that outlined everything, spreading out from her the Digital World became \u201calive\u201d for lack of a better term. \u201cGrass\u201d sprouting from the simulated ground, the sky above her changing to a pale azure rather than the digital green, the clouds lightening to soft white shapes, which flowed and changed as a gentle ephemeral breeze wafted over her blowing the lynx\u2019s shoulder length black hair up and into her face. Nicole having to spit out the troublesome strands, tough she was annoyed for a second she could not help but laugh the unintended consequence of the wind, \u201cchaos\u201d one of the few things that separated the real from the digital. She had not intended such a thing but she was heartened by its occurrence, despite being a digital being she was not bothered by the unexpected. Smiling she watched as the area grew, stopping as it reached about a thirty-foot radius around her, she set off. Nicole watched with fascination as the area before her, which was once just barren pixels or items, which were at best caricatures of what they were supposed to represent change as she approached, and fade back to the way they had been as he moved away. It was as if the entire digital world was just lying in hibernation, waiting for someone to make use of it, she had to wonder just how much of an influence she had over the digital world. She had been able to affect it in some ways before, creating physical objects or weapons but never in such a way as she was now. \u2018Is this a result of learning where I came from, or has some other variable been introduced into the digital world\u2019 Nicole pondered for several seconds until a sudden shout appeared from out of the blue \u201chelp!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising her head, Nicole was not able to pinpoint the direction of the sound immediately but after several seconds of searching, she found there was another presence in the digital world, though she could not get a precise lock on it, it was as if it was not even a digital entity. Confused by the sudden intrusion yet curious at the same time she knew she had to investigate. \u201cI\u2019ll just go tell Sally and the rest of the Freedom Fighters\u2026\u201d Nicole trailed off as she realized what she was doing. She was as much a Freedom Fighter as anyone else and she did not need anyone\u2019s permission to do anything. If she got into trouble, she always had her overclocked form, and if the very worst should happen, she could always return to her handheld. Pausing she waited several seconds to confirm that the signal as strange as it was, was not Phage, getting a negative reading to the Doctor\u2019s malicious entity she set off in the direction the shout had come from. Moments later, another shout of \u201chelp\u201d reached her ears; thankfully, it came from the same direction, the shout louder though not by much, speeding up Nicole could not help but smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the Digital world; whatever she willed could happen here, and as she wanted to reach whom or whatever was calling for aid quickly her legs slowly began to spin, gaining momentum as she took on Sonic\u2019s speed. Blasting across the digital landscape she almost missed the next call, as she had naturally assumed that there would be wind when Sonic moves, she barely heard the next shout over the roaring of the wind. Analyzing the shout, they were fairly even in timber, loud and clear with no signs of pause or impediment, so the shouter was not in any pain though there was a clear sense of anxiety and confusion emphasized by the pitch of the shout, whoever was yelling did not seem to know that they were in the digital world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018That\u2019s strange\u2019</i> Nicole thought as she raced across the digital landscape, the only way she knew to enter the digital world was if someone was hooked up to a Digitizer like Dr.Ellidy had created. As far as she knew the one Dr.Ellidy had was the only one of its kind, unless Phage had somehow been able to steal the plans for the device! She did not know what Dr.Eggman would do with such a device, but whatever it was, if the criminal mastermind had somehow gotten his hands on the plans for the Digitizer then some poor soul, might be lost within the Digital World. She would not say she was the \u201cguardian\u201d of the Digital World, but as she was the most knowledgeable member of the Freedom Fighters about its usage and in fact the only one who could freely enter it she felt a certain responsibility. Speeding up she became little more than a blur of light, streaking across the landscape the next cry came from right in front of her. Instinctively Nicole jumped; her momentum carrying her straight up, the height she gained would normally have been daunting to anyone but the holo-lynx, who simply descended gently, a purple aura of energy surrounding her as she landed gently upon the digital landscape. Looking around she could not see anything until she heard something below and slightly in front of her. Looking down Nicole quickly stepped back though she was careful to watch her step, one gloved hand gently covering her mouth as she saw\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Land disputes, petty squabbles over food even though there was more than enough to go around, children arguing, it was all so frustrating. She stood in the doorway, staring wistfully into her large but empty home, being Grandchief while mostly advantageous had some notable flaws, namely no wolf within 5 miles thought they were good enough for her. The one wolf she approached had treated her invitation to have a meal as if it were some sacred privilege rather than a date. She sighed, taking one more look before briskly walking through her home and onto her private balcony that overlooking her nation, sighing she rested on the balcony and gazed up at the night's sky. Gazing up at the sky her attention was immediately captured by the North Star, memories of ancient legends about the star surfaced, about its power to grant wishes, to give those whose desires were true, their heart's deepest desire. Lupe sighed as she stared up at the star \"stories for pups\" she muttered to herself, \"but what have I got to lose.\" Taking in a breath she entrusted her most heartfelt desire to the star in the form of a simple wish. \"Oh North Star, hear my plea, all I ask for is a man who will cherish and love me, his stature does not matter, what matters is the size of his heart.\" She looked up to the star for a few seconds, and seeing nothing, sighed \"I guess wishes don't come true\" she thought before stripping and turning in for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross time and space our protagonist sighed as he sat back on a grassy knoll examining the night sky, he hated light pollution as it made the sky an inky curtain of black, rather than the beautiful canvas it should be. Overhead stars twinkled and danced across the night's sky, painting upon the canvas a picture so majestic and beautiful as to be unmatched by human hands. The serenity of the night was interrupted momentarily as a star seemed to wink into existence, focusing his attention on this new star he noticed that it was quite a bit brighter than the other stars, nestled in between a small nebula all its own. He suddenly felt the urge to yawn, and as he stared the feeling of sleep intensified, slowly his eyes began to fall the darkness of the night being replaced by the inside of his eyelids. Finally his eyes closed as he fell into unconsciousness.. </span></div></div>",

Looking around he noticed it was dark, like wherever he was had been cut off from the night's sky, however that was impossible as he remembered falling asleep outside. He couldn't help but jump as a sudden soft warm breeze blew over his back. That however wasn't what made him jump, in time with the breeze the ground beneath him raised slightly, a second later there was another gust of warm air, and this time the ground underneath him descended slightly...it was like something was breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'That's impossible\" he thought, a nervous chuckle escaping his lips, 'for me to actually move on something that was breathing, it would have...to...be...massive...' his voice trailed off as the moon decided to finally make its presence known at that moment. In front of him was a gigantic canine head, it was dark so he couldn't tell anything specific, what he could see was a square shaped muzzle topped with a small black nose extending several inches from the creatures face. The creature had two very large eyes, much larger than a human\u2019s and despite the fact it was a canine of some sort it had hair, black and it was styled similarly to a Mohawk with part hanging in front of the creature's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He'll admit he froze up; his heart rate, breathing, everything just stopped for a second as his mind couldn't comprehend what exactly he was seeing. When his senses finally returned the thought of running was first and foremost in his mind, every inch of his body tensed up, ready to flee for as long as was necessary or until he was physically incapable of running anymore, whichever came first. However he was able to get himself under control, and assess the situation, the rhythmic rise and fall of the creature's chest continued, uninterrupted by his appearance, and if he was lucky it would continue uninterrupted as he made his exit. Taking a second to calm himself he made a ninety degree turn, and ran into something, he froze as a slight moan escaped the creature's lips, against his better judgement he pressed his hand against what he had impacted, and felt two things, fabric and a gentle warmth underneath, looking behind him he noticed a similar object sitting opposite the one he ran into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Taking a second to study the object he was able to make a few observations, it was slightly rounded, about as tall as he was, and there was a smaller round nub on top of it, he gulped as he realized what the shape represented. It was a breast, which meant he was standing on the chest of a sleeping creature that was obviously female, taking a second to look down her body. He realized this wolfess was semi-human as she only had the single pair of breasts and her body shape was that of a biped. Slowly, and as carefully as he could he inched his way around this creature's chest, thanking whoever or whatever was looking out for him that he hadn't woke \"her\" up earlier, god knows he would have had a hard enough time explaining himself if he wasn't around 2 inches tall and hadn\u2019t first woken up in her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n After a half-minute of careful movement he reached the edge of her body, he jumped down onto the actual bed, and took a moment to observe his surroundings, he couldn't see very far past the bed, but he could see another pillow on the bed, as well as a nightstand sadly the nightstand loomed above him the edge too high for him to jump. Heading to the edge of the bed, he peered over, past the sheer drop there was a simple dirt floor, with a small carpet sitting right against the bed. He could chance the jump, but that seemed more like a desperation move than one he\u2019d like to take at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking back the only option he had was to wake the titanic canine woman, or simply hide, the only real hiding place he had was the unused pillow but that seemed as good a place as any, he had theoretically been sleeping on this woman, for how long he didn't know but just the fact he was able to do so said she didn't move in her sleep...probably. Walking over to the pillow he now had to decide whether to hide under it, or on it, both had obvious pros and cons, the most readily being whether he wanted to be spotted or not. Taking a few seconds to think, hiding under the pillow seemed like the better option, he wanted the meeting that was inevitably going to happen be as much in his control as possible, it was the only way he saw himself surviving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Taking a moment to judge the weight of the pillow he found it wasn't that heavy, it only felt like he threw a 50 pound sandbag on his back, rather than the potentially crushing force he was expecting, shimmying further under the pillow he turned so just his head was sticking out, the remained of the pillow acting as a giant blanket would. Slowly the weight became more comfortable by the second, combined with the warmth given off by his body and the surprisingly soothing rhythm of the canine woman's breathing he fell into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was violently jerked out of his sleep as the pillow that lay atop him was removed 'oh shit' was the first thought that entered his mind, however after a few moments of...admitted cowering, he looked up to see the woman hugging the pillow against herself. He couldn't help but let out a nervous chuckle, as he thought his cover had been blown what he didn't notice however was that the woman\u2019s nose was twitching. Looking back up at her, his blood froze as her eyes snapped open. Green irises that seemed to shine in the darkness of the night, were the only noticeable feature he cared to take in, with baited breath he watched as her nose twitched again, and she lifted the pillow she was hugging to sniff it. Once, twice, she sniffed the pillow to identify his scent the sound somehow audible to him over the roar of his blood and the hammering of his heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Slowly she began to look around the room, he didn't dare move as she seemed to be searching as much by scent as she was by sight, suddenly her nose fell to the bed and she started to sniff like a bloodhound, he just resigned himself to his fate at that point. As he heard the sniffing of her nose get closer there was little for him to do till it stopped and she was staring directly at him. Looking up at her, she was wide-eyed, as she stared at him she seemed to go through several emotions at once; confusion, probably at what he was, anger, that something had invaded one of her most private places...compassion and a few more, finally she simply stared down at his shaking form, after a few moments more she made a move.</span></div></div>",

Her green eyes staying focused on him \"can you speak?\" was the next thing out of her mouth. The fact that she was questioning rather than eating him was confusing him but he wasn't about to look a gift horse, wolf in the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes?\" he replied hesitantly, what surprised him was while she seemed surprised, she didn't seem freaked out, like things like this could or did happen on a daily basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned over till her nose was almost touching him, a few small twitches of her letting him know she was smelling him \"Hmm, you look like a human, you smell like a human, but I've never heard of any humans being so...small\" her comment caught him off guard, the fact that there were other humans...where ever he was at the moment was a definite blessing. However that meant that he had somehow been shrunk by...whatever it was that had brought him here, either that or he was just tiny compared to the inhabitants of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm a human\" he replied hesitantly, the wolf's eyebrow raising, whether due to the fact that he had started speaking of his own volition, or some other fact he wasn't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over her voice changed, although she wasn't aggressive before, her tone became even softer a sympathetic tone characterizing it. \"You're a pretty long way from Station Square, what happened to you?\" she asked. Her eyes roamed over his body, whether to help her discern his intentions, or to keep him from lying he was unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing loudly enough for her to hear as he noticed her ears twitched slightly he decided there was no reason hiding anything, although eve if he convinced her that he was telling the truth, what would happen was completely outside of his sight. \"To start, I'm not from Station Square, I've never even heard of the place, I don't think I'm even from this world, as I've never seen anything like you. I've seen wolves before, but never bipedal wolves that could talk\" he said. Watching her eyes, she seemed curious when he mentioned that he was from another world but she made no attempt to interrupt him. \"I know this must sound insane, but I'm telling the truth\" he couldn't help but let a twinge of fear enter his voice, while the wolf woman didn't seem to want to hurt him, she was the only one who knew of his existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she sat back up, a finger tapping at her chin as she thought. Several moments pass before she speaks \"I believe you\" she said, relief washing over him as the two of them stared at each other. \"Your explanation is strange, but stranger things have happened\" she said, a small smile playing at the edge of her lips. Taking a moment to consider something she leaned over, drawing his attention to her lower body. As he watched her torso he missed two of her fingers moving behind him, only realizing they were there when they latched onto the back of his shirt. With a small yelp he was lifted off the bed, and to his surprise deposited into her right palm, lifting it up to her face he soon found himself eye to eye with the wolf woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just realized we haven't even intruded ourselves\" she said, raising her left palm she placed it against her chest \"I am Lupe Wolf, Grandchief of the Wolf Pack Nation, and you are?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jacob Everson...that's about it\" he replied, he knew it wasn't anything grand, but that was all he was, not really anything special. What he wasn't expecting was to see Lupe smile at him as she started to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, I'm sure there is something extraordinary about you, something that sets you apart from others?\" He could only shake his head in reply, this caused Lupe to frown. Sighing, and expecting to be put down he was surprised to feel one of Lupe's fingers gently press against his back and begin to gently stroke across his spine. \"Facing down an unknown foe, many times your size isn't something worth speaking of?\" she asked he simply shook his head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not some monster or anything, and it wasn't like I was fighting you, we're just talking\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think that is some great act, although I dwarf you many times over you stared me in the eye. There is hesitance in your voice yet you stand tall and face me. Although you are in an unknown situation you haven't succumbed to fear, you are much stronger than you think\" Lupe said. that small smile playing over her lips. He was honestly confused, he didn't understand why this was such a big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...guess I am\" he replied, the smile on her face growing larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what are we to do?\" she asked him, \"I do not wish to crush your hopes, but I will not lie to you, I know no way of returning you from whence you came, Princess Sally might, but currently many nations including hers are at war with a man named Ivo Robotnik, and I do not know even without the war that we could return you home.\" His entire demeanor crumbled under those words, potentially he'd never see home again, not only that but he was left several inches tall on an alien planet. The only reason that he was alive was Lupe's compassion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could really fall into depression he felt his body surrounded by warmth as Lupe gently pressed him against her cheek \"it will be alright, I'll take care of you\" she cooed softly. While her words were comforting they weren't enough as he felt warm tears start to trickle down his cheeks. He felt himself gently pressed against Lupe's cheek again, and taking the hint buried his face in her fur as he began to sob. All he heard as he cried was Lupe's gentle cooing and the warmth of her fur. After several minutes the tears dried and he pulled himself out of her fur, gently he was pulled in front of Lupe's face where she smiled sweetly down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is not much, but you are welcome to stay with me as long as is necessary\" she said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you\" he replied, while it might not have seemed like much to her, somewhere relatively safe in a world that would sooner see him as a bug than an intelligent being was a godsend. \"If you'll just put me down, I'll leave you to get back to sleep\" he said, not noticing the look Lupe was giving him. Rather than place him down on the bed however he was gently deposited on her pillow, before Lupe laid her head down right beside him. He was about to get up before her hand rested on top of him, the weight of her hand being little more than a heavy blanket, yet when he tried to get up she gently pushed him back into the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sleeping with me\" she replied matter of factly, a small yawn leaving her mouth. Taking a moment to get comfortable he watched her start to drift off. He felt tired but his body wouldn't let him rest, he had gone through a lot in the past several hours. Sighing he was about to gently push her hand off him when Lupe began to growl, it wasn't a bad growl, more like that contented growl dogs give off. Before he could move her fingers gently wrapped around him and he was hugged to her chest, her other hand draping over the one holding him. He began to struggle, obviously not wanting to wake up in a position like this but as he did he heard Lupe whine her grip around him tightening slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to think he knew that he wasn't going to be getting out of this, resigning himself to being stuck he got as comfortable as he could, not noticing Lupe smiling, after several minutes he fell into a tumultuous yet dreamless sleep.

It was longer than it was wide, and there were two thick straps above you, the same color as the surface and connecting to it on either side. This was completely alien to you. You couldn't even tell exactly where you were,  though the most you could get her was that you were inside. Was there even anyone else here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if on cue, you heard footsteps in the distance. Though, they seemed to be louder than they should be. You quickly saw what was causing he footsteps as it rounded a nearby corner; a wolf with jet-black hair, a blue outfit, and... it was walking on its two hind legs? It also appeared to be looking over a list that it was carrying, so it didn't notice you just yet. As this wolf came closer to you, you heard it speak in a powerful, but calm, feminine voice.<br>\r\n\"There seems to be more to do today than previously expected... well, it seems now would be a good time to start early.\" You guessed that she was going out for the day, for reasons unknown to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up from the floor a blue sandal with many straps and began putting it on, and was less than a foot away from you. Only when you noticed the color and shape of the sandal did you realize that you were on a sandal just like it! This worried you greatly, but there was not much that could be done. The giantess wolf has already finished putting on her left sandal and was in the process of putting on the right, which you were on. You had no time to escape as the wolf's toes slipped through the opening of the sandal, followed by the sole and the heel. The giant foot rapidly filled your field of vision before pressing you deep into the sandal with a great force. Although the sandal itself had some give, it still made for an uncomfortable experience, being trapped in between the wolf's paw pads and the firm sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she notice you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"ugh I can't stand having to put up with his insanity some days!\" shouts the red echidna woman. she makes her way out of a wide corridor with large metal walls and pillars holding the part of dr.eggman's complex she is in together. \"some days i think, i made the wrong decision joining that... that. buffoon!\" she scoffed. sliding a key card at the sliding doors at the end of the corridor reveal an elevator. the red coloured lady steps inside and presses the button for the third floor below ground, where her living quarters is located. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwho is this woman you ask? well, she is the leader of her people of whom obsess over technological advancement in all sorts of ways. she has an implant on her left side into one of her dreadlocks that can function in many different ways, communication, connecting to computers and storing data amongst other things. she has short red wavy hair radiating down her head and two big curly bangs down the sides of her face. a look of determined angst seems to be permanently etched into her facial features. long red echidna dreadlocks with a crisscross patter of white tape drape around her head and face. shes clad in a black leather jump suit which seems to be rather form fitting, especially around her chest. she walks around in a commanding gate with matching black leather boots that have lots of oomph in the sound herd when she is walking, letting everyone know she's approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe elevator arrives at her desired destination and the doors slide open. with a sigh of resentment of her current employer she makes her way past the bunks of beds that house the people of whom she proudly leads, the dark egg legion. those she passes by stand at attention and salute her as she walks past. ignoring them completely she strides on down to her private living area, which to her seems to be her only safe haven. sliding the card key in her hand and having her retinas scanned unlocks the door and she steps inside to take her mind off of the precedings that had happened only a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe sits down on her comfy bed and begins to think of ways to change her bosses mind about not putting her fully in charge of the entire operation. she may lead the soldiers in battle but she is limited as to what she can do for her own gain in power when there is no need to be sent out on the defensive. looking over at her small alcove shelf of books and manuscripts, she tries to make sense of what her next assignment is supposed to be about. \"what crazy messed up plan could it be this time?\" she ponders as she reads the title text on the opening file. the file reads; OPERATION SMALL INTRUDER. \"hmm... just what is he up to?\" she asked to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nupon opening  up the file she finds schematics and notes pertaining to one of two things, a small robot with two eyes for a camera and a laser seemingly to protect itself. the other a gun that is supposed to fire a charged beam at anything directly in front of it to dwindle in size to presumably any size necessary. she looked on in astonishment as she found that the plan and designed hardware were quite formidable and she needed no explanation as to what they could be used for. with a grin she placed all of the contents of her assignment on a desk just off to the side of her bed. she was supposed to report for research and development with dimitri in dr.eggman's lab at 10 am. looking over at the clock, it said that it was already 11 pm. the red lady figured she'd better get ready for some well needed rest, having to fend off sonic and the freedom fighters and deal with the egg overlord. she slipped out of her suit and boots, took off her bra and panties and entered into her personal shower which also had a sink in side so she could just brush her hair and teeth before exiting and going to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe next day she awakens to her alarm, alerting her that she has one  hour to get ready for r and d. rubbing the sleepiness out of her eyes she pulls herself up out of bed and proceeds to ready herself for the day. she puts on some clean underwear, brushes her hair, slips into her black jumpsuit and straps her boots on. she trudges to the door hoping for the best and leaves her room and proceeds to the elevator, passing by legionaries of whom are either sleeping or congregating to discuss various topics. most salute as she walks by if they are noticing. this time shes a bit more chivalrous and gives those she sees a smile of approval before entering the elevator. she presses the button for the lab which isn't very far just two floors up. the elevator lifts her up to her desired floor as she awaits what she'll see. the red woman begins to contemplate just how this is going to work considering the technology involved. but, she knows with all the advances that her and her employer have made in technology and science that there isn't much that stops dr.eggman from fulfilling his plans. whether or not they work out is completely up to fate to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe doors open and reveal that eggman and snivley are currently constructing one of the inventions that was in her copy of the assignment while dimitri is situated in front of a computer crunching the numbers and working out the variables in hopes of success. she approaches him and speaks. \"hello grand master, are things working themselves out or do we have any major problems with how this is going to work?\" she asked. \"you'd better change your tone or you could be the test subject.\" he retorted. she rolled her eyes and then went over to the doctor and his lackey. dr.eggman turns and sees her approaching. \"ahh there you are.\" he bellowed. \"did you read over the plan last night?\" he asked. she nodded yes to answer him. \"good. then you are up to speed on what we plan to do today.\" he added pointing at the contraption in front of him on a work table, tools, bits of metal and a soldering iron strewn about. what was on the table was a small robot about 3 inches tall by an inch and a half wide. there were two cameras on its top just like in the designs, two doors on either side were closed but she knew that they contained propellers to help it float and fly around. a single retractable small laser cannon was placed on its bottom. \"snivley,\" said eggman getting his attention. \"show the commissar just how this glorious invention is supposed to work.\" he instructed. snivley then began to control the small robotic device and preceded to fly it around, demonstrating its speed and agility. he was controlling it from a radio controller that also had video feed of what the two cameras were seeing so he could view his surroundings in 3d. \"as you can see,\" said snivley as he turned to face dr.eggman and the red lady. \"this is a very agile machine and because of its size it can go into places relatively unnoticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"if you haven't already noticed, it will be used for future surveillance of those pesky freedom fighters and meddlesome hedgehog.\" described. \"well doctor, i think this might be a wonderful idea to survey and seek out the best form of attack on those rotten pests.\" said the echidna woman. \"but, what about the second piece of hardware you were working on?\" she asked. \"just how do you suppose that will work?\" she said pointing to the gun on the table in front of her. \"oh, yes! we will be testing that shortly.\" said eggman excited. \"dimitri, are the variables worked out?\" he called. \"well sir, it appears that it is set to be a working success.\" he replied. \"very good grand master. please come and watch the demonstration.\" he motioned for dimitri to come over to them. dr.eggman picked up the ray gun and held it targeted at a can on another table a meter or so away from the other table in front of them. he pulled the trigger and held it in place. as the gun charged up a blue glowing energy source began to form around the tip of the guns firing ray. he grinned maniacally as the power meter on the back of the gun read 100% and letting go of the trigger sent a bolt of blue lightning towards the can and in a moment the can was out of sight. with the tip smoking and astonishment on all of their faces, except eggmans, they all asked what happened to the can. \"go and take a look for yourselves.\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthey all went to the table and inspected where the can had been. eggman placed a large magnifying glass in front of them and there it was, now just barely able to be seen, was the can he had shot at, just this time, much much smaller. \"i-i can't believe it worked!\" said the female echidna. \"of course it worked! i designed it.\" corrected eggman. just then a siren went off, alerting them that someone had just stepped into the city bounds. \"snivley, who dares to step foot into my city with out my permission?!\" demanded eggman. snivley took out his pocket video feed and switched it on and selected the camera where they could see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\na human had just started to walk into the city, appearing to be lost. \"who is that? what are they doing in my city?!\" questioned eggman. \"i'm not sure sir. probably just someone lost looking for their way back to their home city.\" replied snivley. \"well i dont' care who it is, i just want them brought to me. they are now my first living test subject for this shrinking gun.\" he declared. \"lien-da, you go and fetch that lone wanderer. he can't be too much trouble for you.\" she glared at him and said, \"oh well why don't you send someone more capable? i'm sure you don't want someone failing you.\" lien-da said sarcastically. dr.eggman stood firm and said, \"well if that's how you feel then i'm sending you out to get that person as punishment. now go and bring me that test subject!\" he ordered. lien-da stormed off out to the elevator to get into her egg mobile and retrieve the intruder. she went to the main floor and headed down the hall a short ways to a door on the right. she swiped her key card and went into the small air craft hanger. she located her egg mobile and then lien-da set off outside to find the intruder.</span></div></div>",
