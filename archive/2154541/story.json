It was then that Asia floated over to the spell book on her desk. and started to read the spell again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so I read the spell right the first time. Oh there is a note on the back of the spell page\" Asia said to herself. The note read that one can not re enter the body they came from till after they had taken over another's form. Asia took that to mean she would need to take someone else body before casting the spell one more time. Again she went to the book and read everything one more time just to be safe. She found the spell would last 24 hours before anyone swapped could re due the spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsia know who her target was going to be..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote:<br>\r\nIf you guys want to see more of this tell me which path you want to see and i will try to do it.

Then she did what she always doe's give her a nice hug and make sure she was okay first. Asia was a little scared about what to do next. She know that the only way to get anything done was to make Rias body her own for the next 24 hours. So she would need to explain it to Rias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Asia is bad. I had a date with Issei and his parents to talk about the future. Do you know what is going on\" Rias asked her. Asia shook her head and pointed at the book on her desk. Asia started to explain everything that happened and the fact that she did not read the whole spell before she started to cast it. Rias only nodded at her. Well she understood, She was the same way when she was younger. Asia continued say that they could not go into there original bodies and need to stay in another for 24 hours. Then the spell will work again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really am sorry i hope that you can forgive me Rias\" Asia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is okay Asia at least I'll know there is some one i trust controlling my body and not some stranger. I give you promission to take my body for the next 24 hours. Just treat it well and try to act like me\" Rias said. Asia smile and hugged Rias before flying to her new host body. Rias sighed and held her head in her hand. Well she should have expected this now what did she need to do.<br>\r\nShe turned torwards the open body that would hold her for the next day only to see Akeno and Rias (Asia) taking the body to the transport circle that would leave her trapped here.

Asia slipped out of the room and went into another to wait for Akeno to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkeno arrived at the room and entered. When she did she saw the huge mirror that Asia had placed in this room. She felt a power coming from it. So being the girl that did not like being curious she went to the mirror. The room in the mirror had a table and chair but those were not in this room. As she walked forward to within arm's length from it the trap Asia set was sprung and she could not move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsia entered the room and smiled which Akeno saw in the mirror. <br>\r\n\"Really Asia if you wanted to play this type of game I would have gladly done it with you and Issei\" Akeno said. Asia only smiled still and walked to the other side of the mirror. Akeno on the hand started to watch her own reflection. But something strange was happening to it. Well she herself was not moving her reflection was. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe reflection of Akeno started out very simply moving her head left and right. Then the reflection started to lift her arms up and do a few jumping jacks. As Akeno was watching her reflection something felt weird.  That was when she noticed that she was also doing the jumping jacks. But it was not by her choice. The reflection was controlling her actions now. It smiled and tilted it head and looked over its shoulder waiting for something. That was when a door opened and out came a look alike of Asia. But it was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asia reflection was holding what look like a pile of clothing, some shoes, white underwear and bra, with a hair brush to finish it all off. The reflection of Akeno took the clothing and other items and laid them on the table. She then proceed to remove her own clothing. Removing the shirt and skirt and handing them to Asia's reflection. The real Akeno was forced to removing her own shirt and skirt. The reflection then removed her shoes and socks and hand them over to Asia's reflection. Akeno did the same and removed her shoes and socks, the thing that bothered her the most is when she took an item off it would disappear. The only thing left covering her was her lacy black bra and panties set. The Akeno reflection removed them and hand them and her orange ribbon over to the Asia reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection of Asia smiled and started to head back to the door it came out of.  It disappeared and Akeno did not know what would happen now.  The reflection started to wave goodbye well pointing at her chest. Akeno was doing the same thing it had her very worried. Akenos reflection walked over to the table and picked up the bra. She placed the cups under her breasts and tried to clip the bra on. But low and behold it did not fit. Akenos reflection pulled again. This time the clips came closer. Again and again the reflection pulled the clips getting closer together. Akeno realized why the clips where coming closer with every pull her breast where shrinking. From 40\" down to 36\". Akeno wanted this to stop  but the reflection kept going. That was till her breasts fit firmly in the fully clipped bra at 31\". The reflection gave a smile and tilted her head Akeno followed suit.  The reflection looked down and Akeno did as well she was wearing the bra now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection grabbed  the panties and started to pull them up her legs. As they got higher and tighter around her hips the reflection had to pull harder and harder. With every pull her hips got smaller and smaller till they where 32\". The panties where now pulled tight across her reflections waist that was till the panties started to constrict the waist and they where no longer stretched out. The reflection pulled on the elastic and let it snap to her. Akeno felt that snap, she knew that she was also wearing those panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Akeno saw was her reflection grabbing the shirt and putting it on. The reflection had little trouble but it was tight for a few seconds and then fit just right. It seemed that with the shirt Akenos shoulders had shrunk  just  a little bit. The skirt came next and fit right into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection sat down on the chair that was near her. Then started to pull the socks up her leg. As they were pulled up to she felt her legs cramp and shrink. Akeno went from her 5'6\" to being 5'1\". She really was scared. Why was this happening to her. The shoes fit just right when they were put on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection picked up the brush from the table and started to brush her long silk black hair. But with each stroke of the bush Akenos hair started to change color. from the black to brown then to a blondish tint then  honey blonde till finally it reach the golden blond that was Asia color. Akeno could see from the hair on her shoulder that it really had changed to golden blond.<br>\r\nAkeno's new reflection got up smiled at the mirror. Akeno followed suited. The reflection started to mouth something but Akeno did not know what it was. That was until she started to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my name is Asia. I am a third year student and love Issei\" Akeno said.  So shocked was Akeno that she did not relies that she was free of the reflections control. When it did happen she fell to her knees and started to cry just like Asia did when she was upset about something. It was truely unfair. That was when she looked up and found herself smiling and waving at her. Asia must have transformed into her. Akeno was on over load from everything that was happening and fainted to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsia in her new body put her hand on her face and elbow in her palm and said \"Oh my this was fun\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to see something specific happen please email me. I do take suggestions.</span></div></div>",

Asia continued to smile and walked to the other side of the mirror. There she let the mirror do it work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are you ready for this\" said Asia. Well more like her reflection made her say it. Asia still smiled and let the reflection do its work. Asia's reflection striped of clothes and so did the real Asia. The Asia reflection smiled and grabbed it chest and motioned that soon they would be bigger.  It made a nice neat pile of the outfit Which she picked up and went to a door that had just appeared. The reflection came back thru the door with a similar pile of clothing. Well except for the bra and panties that where a lacy black and much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to get bigger\" the reflection spoke through Asia. Asia smiled. The Reflection started with the panties. She pulled them up every inch Asia felt her legs get bigger. When they where all the way up her hips expanded to fit the new size going from her old 32\" and growing out till she was 35\" around her hips. Asias waist filled out expanding quickely from a 22\" up to 24\" making the panties fit just right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection made Asia turn so her head was looking over her shoulder to see the assets she had just been given.  The reflection gave a quick pat on her butt  and it felt very sensitive and very nice. I almost felt as good as when Issei was play with her in bed. Well he was doing it unconsciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection grabbed the bra and put it into place. Asia was sad when she put it on it just sat there half empty. That was till her reflection started to grab her breasts and give a big tug. It stop after the first and point to the now bigger breasts. Asia with one pull went from her  31\" size to a 33\". the reflection smiled and placed her hands on her breasts again, grabbing and pulling. Once more they continue to gain size going for the 33\" to 36\" to 38\" till they stopped at the 40\" size Akeno had.  she place her new breast within the cups and was set.The bra now fit just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection then decided it would jump up and down to make Asia feel the weight and get an idea of what she was in for. The reflection did this for a few seconds and Asia looked like she was in heaven at the time. Her new chest was super sensitive she really did not know how Akeno keep sane with feelings like these all day long. But she then it all stopped. The reflection picked up the shirt and put it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsia could feel her back and shoulder get stronger and larger. her upper body grow an inch or two making her about 5'3\" tall. The skirt was the next thing to go on. Nothing happened when it was fully on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsia and the reflection grabbed the socks and put them on. The socks came up to a little bit above her knee. Well that was the case at first, but then the socks started to shrink. No they were not shrinking Asia's legs where getting longer it seems. After it was done  Asia stood at a height of 5'6\" tall. the only real thing that was left to swap was the  her face and hair. The reflection took a brush and started to brush her hair. From the golden blond to honey blond to a blackish color it changed. Till her hair was all black and fell down to her legs. The reflection grabbed the ribbon and tide her hair up in a pony tail as Akeno usually did . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all this done her eyes blurred and she lost sight for a minute. When she gained back her vision the face of Akeno was staring back at her. It was also mouthing some words. Asia started to listen and heard and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my Name is Akeno I am a college student and the mistress of Issei.  So hands off\" Asia said. She went around the mirror to check up on Akeno who sounded like she was crying. So she went around the mirror and started to wave at The new Asia. Who when she looked fainted on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsia in her new body put her hand on her face and elbow in her palm and said \"Oh my this was fun\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell since it worked it was time to get some other involved as well. But she would be keeping this body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A new dress for her and maybe the other girls as a nice gift for all they had been though. They really did not get any time with Issei as of the last week. She would need to change that soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias took both Akeno and Koneko out to get a new outfit with her. Asia was gone and had been for some time. She keep in touch with Akeno though. Rias spent an hour getting the right outfit for this moment. The outfit consisted of a black and white skater dress with no sleeves and a small jean jacket that cover her shoulders. She also picked up a pair of 3\" heels. After finding everything she needed she went to help the others. Akeno decided not to get anything and Konekos new outfit was kid like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small shirt that showed off her belly with a really cute cat on the front. A short thigh length skirt in black and white stripes. Koneko grabbed a pair of white panties and a training bra to match it both had little cats on them. The shoes where just flat black slip ons accompanied by a pair of thigh high white stockings . Rias took all the items and paid for them. They left for home after that with a smirking Koneko and Akeno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk back to the present time.<br>\r\nAkeno (really Asia) had called Rias down to the room saying that Koneko wanted to talk to her. Rias really had to wonder why at this time and in the storage room. Rias opened the door and stepped in the light came on and a flash was seen from the floor. Rias then looked to her right and left were Koneko in her new outfit. Then to the front and saw herself and Koneko standing there. The mirror Rias was wearing  her outfit and koneko once again was in her new outfit. This was a really weird mirror room she though.<br>\r\nRias tried to move but was having trouble. It seemed that something was holding her in place but what. that was when she looked again to see that the Konekos on her left and right now seem to be grabbing something to the side of them. Both turn and looked at her  with a smile. They lifted up whatever they were holding and her arms flow up. Rias tried to put them down only for the Koneko's to shake their head and look at their hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias realized finally that what every the mirror was doing was effecting her now. She turned her head to the koneko and Rias in front of her to see what they would do. The Koneko walked up and lifted Rias left leg took off the shoe and sock. She did the same with the right leg and smiled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias looked to see what her mirror self would do. But what she saw shocked her the socks and shoes  had been taken off. But the image had never moved what so ever when she was watching it. The Koneko in started to lick her neck in just the right spot. It sent her in a daze allowing the koneko in fron of her the reach around and unzip the dress from Rias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Konekos let go of Rias arms so the dress could fall down. Rias was still in her daze not realizing she was only now in her bra and panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias finally out of her daze notice once again the Mirror Rias was stripped of her dress. She had to wonder  why only that image was not help. But was still glade at the same time because she could not have taken on all of them herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happen the Koneko on the left of her grabbed the back of her bra and started to unclip it. She looked forward and saw the bra the mirror Rias had on was also coming undone at this point. Thanks to the Koneko on the right it seemed that the panties mirror Rias was wearing came down as well. That was when she felt her own come off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Koneko in the front walked around and picked up all the clothing and pilled it together. Then she started to take off her own outfit. The belly shirt came off and she placed it on the floor neatly and then the skirt came off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko slipped of the slipped the shoes off and pulled the stockings off after that.  She place the stockings neatly on the pile of clothing. And the shoes right next to it. Then she slipped of her bra and panties. Rias looked down at the smaller girl and saw a very small 4ft 6 inches a 26 inch bust,  a 22 inch waist  and lastly a 29 hip. Rias followed the girl as she turned to the mirror Rias. <br>\r\nKoneko ran a hand up and down mirror Rias body. She rubbed her head between the valley of cleavage of  that  39 inch bust. She turned to the real Rias and mouthed this is the last time you get to have big boobs. Koneko started to juggle Rias breast up and down just for fun. Rias was shocked at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko grabbed the small bra she had just been wearing and placed it in front of mirror Rias. The image smiled glade to put the bra on. She moved her arms threw the straps. The mirror Rias held the bra in place and let koneko tug to pull the clips together.  The real Rias felt a digging pain in her shoulds and on her back. So she looked down and saw the little bra was tightly in place. Well it felt tight for a second then the pain started to ebb away. Rias looked back at her mirror double and saw it smile well waving goodbye to the breast that she was so proud of. She went from her 39 inch bust slowly down to 34 inches  then 30 inches till it stopped at Konekos 26 inch bust size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not long before Rias saw the koneko picking up the panties and going over to her mirror double. Koneko placed a leg threw one hole then a leg threw the other. Koneko pulled them up till they would go no farther on Rias big 35 inch hips. Rias watched as the doubles hip started to shrink down and down till they were 29 inches and the panties were tight to her. She then felt another pain on her waist and then just as it had come it was gone. Rias saw she had lost at least an inch on her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko retrieved the stocking and started to put them on the mirror Rias. They only came up to right below her knee. That was when Rias felt something pull her closer to the ground. The mirror Rias and herself both had the stocking come up to mid thigh just like when koneko wore them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias was getting really scared.  She need to stop this she was not going to be someone else again. But it keep going.<br>\r\nThe skirt was added on to both of them and then the cute cat top. At this point Rias looked at the mirror Rias and saw the shirt only came down to just below were her breast where. When Koneko had worn it, it only showed off a little of her belly. Again she felt a pull and vertigo hit so she closed her eye. When she opened them again she was looking eye to eye with the koneko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing about her that was still Rias was her head. And that was about to change as well. Koneko took out the brush that Rias used to do Koneko's hair all the time. Koneko smile patted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko started to take the brush used on her and comb the mirror images hair. The strands of lovely red hair that Rias took such great care of started to fall to the floor. It took a few minutes to get them all and for new white hair to start coming in. It ended when it reach the same cut style as Koneko had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Koneko did was start to pet Rias on the head. Rias had to wonder why she was doing this. That was till she lost any hearing she. Then it pop right back, but the sound seemed to be coming from a different place now. Looking to the mirror Rias saw to Cat ears on the top of Mirror Rias head. No at this point she should just say Koneko.  She looked at koneko and saw her mouth \" Purr for me now\".  And Rias did that because she was still that scared now. At this point the other Koneko that had been holding had disappeared. So it was only now her the mirror reflection and koneko in the room. Rias passed out and woke up in a bed not know what was going on. she looked out the window and saw it was already night time. That would mean the date to look at wedding venues was over.  She got up and saw....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuys and girls really need help hear.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Koneko looked at the girl on the floor who was purring peacefully. Koneko would need to finish fast if she was to get on the date with Issei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the mirror and smile as the copy of her and Rias started to help her dress. Koneko stay still and left the work for the mirror girls to do. One lifted her leg up the other place the black silk panties over her foot then the two did the other one and both slowly pulled a side up. As the panties where placed on Koneko's waist her hip slowly went from a 29\" to 31\". Then continued to they reach 35\". Koneko patted her new hips and ass to get a feel for them and it felt really good. The mirror her just smile well the mirror Rias that was helping out looked upset. Koneko though maybe the magic had a backlash. But decided not to do anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Koneko held her arms up so the strapless bra could be place on her. The mirror Koneko went around back to snap the bra closed well the mirror rias held the front in place. Koneko looked upset cause after a few minutes nothing was happening. She turned to her mirror clone and watched as it breast went from the 26\" slow increasing in size to 30\" again up to 35\" to finally stop at 39\". Koneko waited for it to happen on her only it did not. The mirror Koneko smiled and held her hands to Koneko breast. That was when Koneko felt pain from the quick size increase of her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko was breathing hard and looked shocked. Okay so maybe this was the down side to the magic and Asia had never told her. But she still need to finish this. The mirror Rias held the dress above Konekos head and quickly put it on her  then zipped it up. Koneko felt the pain of growing again. She went from her 4' 6\" tall to begin 5'8\" tall. And boy did it hurt it felt like all her bones where begin pulled thru a taffy machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror koneko place the shoes in front of Koneko and had her step into them. Koneko feet then filled out the 3\" heels. Koneko felt a pulling on her head the mirror Rias was brushing her hair and making it change to the crimson red that Rias always had. Koneko eyes blured for a minute and next thing she know her face and eyes changed to match what Rias used to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror Koneko smiled at her and gave a thumbs up. But the Mirror Rias looked on sadly and just waved goodbye well disappearing.  Perfect she looked and sounded just like Rias there would be no way Issei could tell the two apart now. Koneko lifted Rias and took her to Koneko's old room to sleep. She would come back later to tell Rias her new roll in the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 hour later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei had finally finished with looking at venues with Rias and his mother and father. Both he and Rias (Koneko really) waved goodbye and went to get dinner at the reasurant Issei made Reservations at. But before that .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I need to ask you something Rias. Or should I call you by your real name Koneko\" Issei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoneko was shocked at this. She though she had nailed Rias's action down to a t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know. What gave it away Issei\" Koneko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is just the feeling i got coming off of you from your energy. Plus Rias grabs my arm on the left side well shoving it in between her breast. you where alway ready to jump on my back Rias never doe's that\" Issei replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you had your fun I think you need to Show me where the real Rias is at so we can fix this mess. And well where at it Asia can stop pretending to be Akeno\" Issei said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Akeno was bit uneasy about the lady and was about to leave but the Lady NPC responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to the shop~. Is there something that can be of interest for you <i>young adventurer~</i>\" The Lady NPC spoke with some... glee. Akeno still felt wary about the NPC but at least she knew that the NPC worked in the shop. Akeno began to ask about the items in the store. The NPC showed her various items. They seem.... standard according what Issei normally told her about shops: HP recovery items, low grade equipment, food, and some more. As Akeno contemplated what to buy, the NPC Lady brought out a potion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you are having a hard time choosing. Might I make a special offer?\" The NPC Lady asked presenting a strange potion of some sort. Akeno raised and eyebrow, she couldn't tell what the potion was. Perhaps she could in the real world with her devil abilities and magic, but she's in a video game. Different rules. \"What is that potion?\" Akeno asked the NPC Lady whom smiled at the response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a special Status Item that targets you and another. Drink part of this potion and splash the rest of it on your target and both of you will swap something. Buff and Debuffs, Equipment, and <i>more</i>.If you can [Focus] you can swap something specific but if you use it with haste, the swap will be random.\" The NPC Lady spoke with interest. Akeno looked at the potion, thinking if she could really use this kind of potion. Akeno asked for a price, a bit suspicious of the offer, and NPC Lady gave her a cheap price. VERY cheap. Akeno would think it's a scam but she did want to see if could work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm curious about this potion, but I want to make sure I'm not being scammed.

The lady then take out a small vial and pours some of the potion inside and corks it. She puts on the table for Akeno, should she decide to take a sample. However, Akeno had a strange feeling about all this. The NPC in front her seemed... different than the Male NPC she encountered earlier, move lively. VERY lively. She didn't know if the game had the NPC Lady programmed like such or if something was a foot. There was a strange feeling in the air ever since landing eyes on this NPC Lady, yet Akeno choose to go to her in order to buy items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkeno couldn't deny that the shopkeeper wasn't trying to be helpful. For one, she explained each item Akeno looked at before the NPC made an offer for what could probably be a rare item. The price for the strange potion was cheaper than the cost of HP Potions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkeno looked at the sample, then realized something. \"How can I test this?\" Akeno asked the NPC Lady. The NPC seemed to take a moment to think. Before Akeno could have any thoughts about an NPC needing to think, unless it was programmed, the NPC responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you could go out and test it on the wild life but you don't know what you will encounter. Perhaps you should test a more willing subject? In fact! Why not try it on me? I'm the one selling this to you, should anything happen it's my responsibility.\" The NPC Lady responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkeno stopped to think. Yes, the NPC Lady could be a perfect test subject: she was right here and willing. However, Akeno was wondered if she could even take from the shopkeeper in the first place. It's not like she didn't have her friends in the game to test it out with. Asia might be willing to try it out. All though... maybe Akeno should keep it a secret of a surprise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Did Akeno try a sample of the strange potion?</span></div></div>",

[Switch Potion Sample] x1.] </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My I suggest we go to private area? The backroom where I take a break should be enough. Akeno raised an eyebrow in suspicion but did understand the Lady's point. They were in the store. Best not to test items instead the store where there could be other people. With that Akeno goes over what the lady told in using the potion as she followed the NPC to the rec room. They where the only ones around now in the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkeno then tries to [Focus] like the NPC Lady instructed before but nothing seemed to have happened. Akeno frowns and tries again...and again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't appear to be working....wait.\" Akeno eyes widen. She remember that some abilities could only be used in Battle. Perhaps [Focus] could only be used in battle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter dear?\" The NPC Lady asks Akeno. Akeno looks at the NPC Lady and explains the issue. The NPC Lady hums and goes to a closet. She opens it and takes out a magic wand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall be your opponent then.\" The NPC Lady says firmly. Akeno steps back in surprise. She tried to say something but the world changed. Akeno finds herself in a game's makeshift battlefield. For some reason she saw some text:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>{Rogue P. [Error] - Witch [Error] Lvl. ?? challenges you to a fight! Warning: Can not Escape!}</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkeno paused at what she was reading. What was this!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready girl? Use your [Focus]! That sample is your best bet to get out of this!\" The NPC(?) said to Akeno. Akeno frowns. She hates to admit it but she may no other recourse with her opponent being at an Unknown Level. After this fight she was going to back out and quit the game. Ask Issei to check this game out. Maybe even get the other to quit too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkeno readies to fight. She selects [Focus]. She could feel herself concentrate more. She then tries to use the potion but it sees to change to NPC Lady's turn. The NPC Lady casts a spell effecting both of them. Akeno feels herself hit, but take no damage. Text appears on the screen:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>{Ninja Akeno is hit with an [Error: Unknown] Debuff!}</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Akeno paled. She found herself in a bad situation: Unknown enemy, these errors, and unknown powers. She gulped. She felt cornered, believing herself to not be able to do anything BUT to use the sample. Like it was a voice in her head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Akeno's turn again. She takes out the sample and uses it. She drinks part of the vial, then the game kicks in allowing Akeno with a follow up to toss the potion at the NPC Lady(?). It hits the her target...The NPC Lady then smiled. Akeno then eyes widen in a realization: Why didn't get to select an swap option? Then the some text appears:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>{[Error: Unknown] debuff allows [Rogue P. [Error] - Witch [Error]] to choose ability effect.}</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkeno looks in horror just in time to see the NPC(?) tap something in the air.

She lifted her arm up to see if the Akeno above her was real that was when she saw a old wrinkled hand. Not unlike the one she saw of the shop keeper when the potion was headed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I see some one is finally up\" The other person said. Akeno tried to place where she had heard that voice and she know it because she heard it every day. It was her own. The shock was written all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I see your reaction but you should have expected this when it comes to devils\" The ex shop keeper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do really thank you for the release from my Statues as A NPC. An I welcome you as the new NPC Shop Keeper. I will tell you that it was hard learning about you players and the world you come from. I had very little knowledge till I meet with a a boy calling himself Mil tan asking to find a gender potion. That was something I had never heard of and was quite curious about it. After he started to talk error appeared but he just keep talking about his world. The errors disappeared after a few minutes and I found that i retained what was told to me. I now could think for myself and was free to say what i wanted. But I could never leave this world\" Said the new Akeno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few days had gone by and Mil Tan brought very nice young man with him. Issei was his name I believe. He was a very gullible child and told me all about devils and how they grant wish's. Well I asked if he could free me from this place and with a straight face said he could not do that. You had to have a body in his world to link out to to be free and he could not do that to any one of his friends or lovers\" Said the new Akeno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe original Akeno's shock had faded and was glad to hear that Issei was not to blame for her situation at this time. But she still had to wonder what had cause this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo how did you do this then what was the point of it all\" the orginal Akeno said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ex shop keeper stared and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well when the only thing you can do is sell potions and then you are given something new to do and see would you not take that path. It was that youth Mil Tan that gave me the potion and sample he some how had made it in the game to try to switch his gender. He came to me to find out if the potion could do that. After using one of my many skills to check out the potion I was amazed that it would switch a NPC like me and the Player like you. I gave Mil Tan a potion and told him to drink it I said it would make him feel better. Really it just let me control him\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe original Akeno was surprised now not from the story but from the fact that she was forgetting thing from her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah the next part of the swap is finally kicking in your memories will now be over written with my own and you will start to act the part of the shop keeper next. I will keep all of my own memories and get yours. That way I will have your class and my own witch class as well. Oh you will be a lvl 1 villagers after all this is done. But let us keep going with the story\" the New Akeno said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well the orders i gave to Mil Tan was to get a nice looking girl into the game and he could only think of a few from his devil friend Issei. So I said that would do. He would give Issei the game console and tell Issei to play it with the girls. Then it would only be a matter of time before one of you came to my store. And here you are. Oh did you feel that of course you did not you dont even know what I am talking about right now\" said Akeno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe New Shop keeper (Original Akeno) felt her head go numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well did you like the sample and will you taking the rest of the potions\" said the New Shop Keeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile on her face the New Akeno agreed to the deal. She would need to free a few people from this place so that she could deal with everything in the new world. Maybe the young helper well, okay that one could not help but distract the men so maybe with a real body she could be better. Help her get that cutie Issei for themselves. There was the maid in the village chiefs house that was always getting hit for making the simples mistakes she could really use an out. So many people she could help now.  But where to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Akeno you in here\" yelled Issei. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is time to log out now. we have school soon\" Issei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Akeno looked and smiled waved goodbye to the shop keeper who now had tears rolling down her face for some strange reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLog out.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should the new Akeno do......</span></div></div>",

He knew he was on summer vacation starting next week since he is exempt from his finals, unlike his two \u2018friends\u2019 the Perverted Duo, he now has a lot of free time and wants to know how to spend these three months of summer vacation. After walking around town he starts seeing his harem all huddled up talking and ponders what if he could be a girl would the girls still love him for him or only care if he was male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei was now back home and went to his room to relax until he spotted a book on his dresser. \u201cHm, what\u2019s this it looks like a spell book.\u201d Issei said as he started looking inside the book. He found a couple of spells that involved swapping magic like body swap, head swap, power swap, etc. \u201cOkay, I think I know how I can have some fun this summer. Now what kind of spell should I do first to test this power?\u201d Issei pondered as he looked at the list.</span></div></div>",
