She has invited quite the number of guests and after a few minutes Toadsworth comes over to make an announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness, I'm happy to announce that princess Daisy has arrived.\" He says and she arrives with some Toads guiding her and once she's in front of Peach she makes a bow. Luigi comes over to hold her hand and together they walk in.<br>\r\nA little bit later some Lumas come floating down followed quickly by Rosalina. \"Thanks for the invite Princess Peach, after all the trouble Bowser caused us it's refreshing I can come see you without trouble.\" She says making a bow to Peach. All the Lumas do the same and head in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up a portal opens and Pit walks out. He kneels in front of Peach and says. \"Princess Peach, I'm here to announce that Lady Palutena has arrived for your party.\"<br>\r\nSoon Palutena comes out the portal and makes a small bow to Peach. \"Glad you've invited us Peach, hopefully it will be fun.\" She says and they walk in.<br>\r\nNext up Samus walk up carrying Pikachu and Pichu on her shoulder. They all bow down as well as Samus says. \"It's refreshing to be called for a party as opposed to another bounty contract. My two cute little friends will like it here as well.\" She says patting them before walking in.<br>\r\n\"That were all the guests that could make it your highness.\" Toadsworth says as Peach and Mario head inside as well now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the party Pit sees Daisy with Luigi as Peach walks in and says. \"I guess they truly were different princesses after all.\" Palutena pats his head a bit.<br>\r\nRosalina chats up with the others while samus plays with the two mouse pokemon. A while later they all start talking about their adventures and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour everyone's called to the table. Once everyone's there the toads come over to serve everyone their food. Peach gives her little speech and everyone starts eating. However suddenly Peach felt a strange pain in her belly.<br>\r\nThat's because a villain managed to sneak a vacuum mushroom into her meal and only hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario came towards Peach to help her but suddenly she starts sucking in so much air that Mario got sucked straight into her mouth screaming his iconic \"Waaaaah\", getting shrunk in the process as well. The Toads all panic but instead of running away they run in circles and soon all get sucked into Peach's mouth just like Mario did.<br>\r\nLuigi said \"Oh Mama Mia not again.\" as he grabs Daisy's hand trying to run away. Sadly Peach turned to them and both Luigi and Daisy scream as they both too got sucked inside Peach's mouth and down her throat. The Lumas all cuddle with Rosalina who tried flying away, but the suction was too strong and they all became another snack for Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPit grabbed onto a pillar while also grabbing Palutena's arm. \"Don't worry lady Palutena, I won't let you go.\" <br>\r\nMeanwhile Samus did the same and grabbed the two Chu's who were terrified.<br>\r\nThis almost worked but the parts of the pillars they were holding broke off. Palutena managed to use her staff to keep her and Pit from going any further in but there was nothing Samus and the two screaming little pokemon could do and were now on their trip into Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalutena kept hlding onto her staf but this time the floor gave in giving her no more support. Unable for her and Pit to do anything they hugged each other as they finally ended up inside the princess as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone was swallowed and shrunk by the effects of the vacuum mushroom Peach ate the princess fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho shall we follow inside Peach's body? (Still open to choose where they ended up: Stomach, lungs,...)</span></div></div>",

Next up was Toon Link followed by Villager and last but not least it was Ness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe countdown finishes and the match starts with Villager trying to plant a tree but Ness used a PK fire on him and gets combo'd as a result. Peach meanwhile fights Toon Link both by throwing bombs and veggies at eachother often times grabbing eachother's projectile to throw at eachother as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone's surprise however items started dropping. They expected a no items match but oh well. A lot of items got tossed to eachother hwoever they did manage to grab enough healing items to keep them from getting launched into the blastzones. However Peach soon notices a lightning bolt and grabs it causing the others to be shrunk down. Not only that but a super mushroom landed on top of Peach making her bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach smiles noticing her advantage over the others an her belly growls giving her an idea. The boys start fleeing from her but Peach easily catches villager. Popping the little guy in her mouth and swallows sending him into her belly. Ness tries going off stage to avoid her but Peach easily reaches far enough to grab him and soon he's on his way to Peach's stomach. Toon Link however went under the stage hoping to hide but Peach eventually found him and as he tried to flee he got caught, thrown up in the air only to land inside Peach's mouth and down her throat he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the boys now inside Peach's stomach how will the match proceed?</span></div></div>",
