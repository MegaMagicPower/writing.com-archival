There are some male Earthlings on board the ship, but the majority of the passengers are female. Most of the pilots and crew are female as well. Most of the passengers are 12 to 17 years old, and there are a few adult passengers on board too. Mostly the kids parents. All of the tiny humans clothes could mysteriously vanish while going through the wormhole, or they could be taken off them by a giant, your choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Does this choice interest you?</span></div></div>",

This unarmed space plan has everything on board like showers, a kitchen, sleeping quarters you name it. As it cruises above the stratosphere towards London, it is seven hours away when suddenly an eerie wormhole opens up before the craft sucking it in. The craft emerges on the other side intake, but it has to land. The main engines are gone. The mostly undamaged ship gently lands in a clearing of some kind. The ship is undamaged, except for the main engines, the scanners, and the main communication system are gone. As the ship rests, the tiny, mostly female Earthlings on board the ship are all passed out inside the craft and for some mysterious reason they are all naked as the day they were born. Even the clothes in the storage area along with most of the blankets and the towels have vanished. The ship is where?</span></div></div>",
