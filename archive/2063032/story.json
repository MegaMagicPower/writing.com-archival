Woodland's agreed to enroll you, under one condition: You had to pretend to be a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was an all girls academy, they didn't want to have others think they were playing favorites. This meant that you were to dress as a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no other options, your family agreed that this is what was best for you. Since you were petite anyways, you could pull this off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a standard uniform; however, you still needed clothes for down time, so on the way home you went shopping. Your parents were unsure as to what freshman girls wore; but they tried their best while staying in the budget. They bought you everything that you might need, including UNDERWEAR!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you returned home they decided that you should get used to acting and dressing like a girl. So you went up to your room and picked an outfit. The first thing you grabbed was the underwear. The underwear you got came in 10-packs, so you decided to pick the manliest pair. They were black with pink polka dots and pinks waist bands. They were size 14 and with a little bit of adjusting, they fit pretty well. You then threw on a white training bra that your mom got you. Next your threw on a plain white t-shirt. You then put on a blue and white striped romper. You remember seing girls in your high school wearing something like this. You then walked downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parents had a good laugh and poked fun but ultimately agreed you could pull of being a girl. Over the next week, your mom gave you as many fashion tips as she knew. She taught you to style your hair like a girl, how to do your makeup, and how to paint your nails. At the end of the week, you packed up and headed to school.</span></div></div>",

And then after that maybe you can take a bus somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad nailed the windows in your room shut months ago, after you used one of them to escape the prison you call your house. Little did he know just how clever you are. The top of the windows were nailed shut too but they were not as secure as the bottom part of the window and so the nails were easier to remove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to Krystal's house. You use the same window you used to meet her the day you sold her the drugs to find your way into her house. Inside you find her sleeping with Johnny, your best friend, or who used to be. Johnny jumped off of her and lunged himself at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asshole, you went to far this time!

She practically begged me to get inside of her.\" This wasn't untrue, she'd do anything for some heroin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fucker!\" The punch hit you hard. You just smiled, the taste of blood filling your mouth. You get hit again and begin laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can hit me all you want, it does change the fact that I had her screaming my name so loud that she was unable to speak after I was finished.\" Rather than hitting you again, Johnny threw you back out of the window and you hit the concrete of the driveway with a sickening thud. You stand up. You can't feel your head and you are dizzy. You look around. Bricks lined the walkway to the front door of their house. You pick one up and throw it through Krystal's bedroom window. \"I'll be back, Krystal! And next time Johnny won't be here to save you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you go now?</span></div></div>",
