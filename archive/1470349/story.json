Then you can do whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand-\" Celeste's hair started to creep along her back, independent of water or wind pushing it; it stretched from her skull, became more slippery and like seaweed in texture. The scales on her tail seemed to be spreading higher up her body past her stomach, thankfully submerged, and threatening to peek at her breasts where Jesse might see and comprehend the horrid change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time. \"I'm sorry,\" she repeated and dove into the ocean, arms outstretched to propel herself out of earshot so she couldn't hear Jesse's pained cries. On the night when their love, hinted at for months, had finally surfaced with all its possibilities, now obtainable, fate had pulled Celeste away with a melodramatic flair. She swam deeper and deeper, neither the water pressure or lack of oxygen bothering her. The tail beat against the water viciously, leaving bubble trails as it cleared ten to fifteen feet at a time. She had only wanted Jesse as a boyfriend! She just wanted to finish college with him by her side, if they were lucky, but neither would be happening now, would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste slowed down with a decisive flick of her tail, pulling it in front of her to break against the current until she was floating in one place. She looked for the shore but could only see cracked bedrock and beady-eyed fish gulping up krill. Scales now covered her body up to her breasts and where her skin persisted it gained a teal glow. Her hair was once a contained and manageable torrent, but underwater it exploded into multiple rapids flowing in many directions. It extended at least three feet away from her body and would, at rest, cover her rear. Strands floated in front of her eyes and glinted a mahogany red instead of their original blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm alone...</i> She thought. <i>Alone and a mermaid... And I don't know whether to be surprised or just sad.</i></span></div></div>",

You have lived is the small town of Port Godfried, Oregon your entire life, spending your days combing the rocky beaches. You are the son of a fisherman and are learning to one day become one yourself. The ocean has always beckoned to you. Being a sailor is in your blood. But sailing had honestly never held your interest. Having been a lifeguard and a swimming intructor, you've always loved the water. But the waters of Port Godfried were known to be dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no secret that merfolk existed. They were highly intelligent and diverse in appearance. All are aquatic mammals. There are two types of merfolk known. <br>\r\nThere are the peaceful Nyangumi, who migrate and follow the fish between the poles. Growing up to 30 feet long, they resemble both seals and orca whales in color and how they store blubber. They are very gentle and are the only semi-terrestrial merfolk. They used their strong upper bodies and thick claws to haul their bulk onto land to breed, bask, and raise their pups in ice dens.<br>\r\nThe most dangerous type are the Bahari. Also called Sea Tigers, Baharis have sharp claws and lion-like teeth. Hunting in packs, Baharis are the wolves of the ocean. They are brightly colored for display and grow to be 20 feet long to deter other Bahari from attacking.  They are aggressive and fiercely protective of their young. They live in the coastal and tropical waters of the world, and are as infamous as sharks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich kind are you?</span></div></div>",

Besides the obvious threat of a sudden storm or choppy seas, an everyday threat were the local gang of Baharis. This pack's territory was along the coastline of Port Godfried and loved to harass the fishermen. Your father's boat had a hansdome supply of moose darts to deter them if things became too hostile, and there was a harpoon waiting in case a Bahari decided to cause a real problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is a normal day. The sun is shining bright on a lovely fall afternoon. The air is still warm, but crisp. The leaves are bright oranges and yellows and the marina is buzzing with activity. But today, you are going out to sea alone. Against your father's wishes, of course, but you were confident. However, it was time for Baharis to have their pups. And that pack was not looking forward to any visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pilot your little tugboat out to sea, you are oblivious to this fact. You pay little attention to the circling multicolotlred masses around your boat. You continue preparing your net to toss over to catch a nice load of cod. As you step near the edge, a female with her pups eyes you with bright magenta eyes. To her, you are a threat and she would not tolerate you. Just as you lean over to toss the net, the female bursts from the water and lands halfway on the boat, causing the whole thing to jolt and tilt. You cry out and jump back from the snarling beast. Her fangs are bared and her claws left long scratches in the steel flooring. In terror, you climb up the angled boat to the bow, spotting the harpoon. The female reaches a powerful arm out and tries to snatch you up, but her claws rake the floor instead. You dinally grab the harpoon and throw it right at the monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harpoon pierced her right in the fleshy part of her neck. With a strangled cry, she released the boat, making it crash back to a level position. She struggled and thrashed, her powerful tail slamming into the stern and shoving the boat violently forwards. You watch as theBahari's struggles become weaker and weaker until she completely stopped.  Moments later, five pups were circling her, chirping anxiously for their mother to wake. The other members of her pack watch. You had not only killed the mother of their pack's pups, you had killed their matriarch. They then set a curse upon you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA curse that would...</span></div></div>",

His family's expedition vessel had forayed forty miles off the coast of Bermuda and bumped into choppy waters mixed with torrential winds. Waves smashed into his window in time with the creaking floor and he swore a few drops managed to splash on him despite the \"impenetrable steel skeleton\" advertised by the ship makers; \"skeleton\" was an unfriendly word anyway, and it conjured in Max images of impending doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents spent most of their time trying to keep the ship on course, leaving him the only child to rot away below deck with his face green and throat trembling under the strain of rising vomit. He had regretted this vacation from the first day. In his more coherent moments he remembered his friend Sam back in Ann Arbor, playing <i>Gears of War</i>, hanging out with their other friends. Max didn't care if staying home meant going to school and facing the horrors of high school, freshman year; if it meant escaping this Godawful water ride he'd fly there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the last night of a two-day storm Max dreamed of standing on stage at an underwater opera house. Fish slouched their dorsal fins into the 1,000+ chairs and watched Max through binoculars they gripped in their mouths like fishing hooks. He sang a plangent, tremulous melody for them in a shrill soprano a 4'7'' body like his shouldn't be capable of. But his body wasn't the same, was it? He tried to look down while he sang against his will but his eyes forced themselves forward, and his arms motioned across the stage in time with his wordless crooning, and his toes tiptoed in place with balletic grace. Max thought it would be a relief to wake up and see his bone-white ceiling, made darker by shadows and his own nausea, with control over his limbs again. Instead he woke up to fog wrapped around him, obscuring an endless stretch of white caps crashing and foaming against sharp rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax awoke slouched on a rock instead of lying in bed, cradling a lyre under his left arm. He had drifted off in <i>The Walking Dead</i> boxers and a ratty t-shirt, but currently, the wind beat against a nude body reshaped by a more feminine touch. Looking down he saw it all: thicker, baby-fat thighs and feet speckled with silver fish scales; further up a crotch with hair and little else; further up a pleasant potbelly as soft to touch as, reaching back, his plumper butt; even further up breasts like he imagined under Natalia Hayworth's shirt in P.E; and right before his eyes a cascade of hazelnut hair combed perfectly to his right, bound in place by a clam-shell hairband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, he was no longer nauseous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm a girl?</i> he tried to say, but instead his vocal chords resonated with an airy singing too beautiful for words. Max touched his throat, shocked. A few days ago in a sick daze he'd picked up a book on nautical mythology, and inside he'd seen a picture of a Siren. It had looked much like he did now. Was he stranded on a strange island, far from his parents in a strange form, because he read a book?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Toby was on a run, easily keeping pace, with his best friend and roommate Daniel. It was early in the morning still, and the sun had just begun to rise over the snow tipped mountains surrounding the small town. Toby could see his breathe, and silently cursed his friend's name for making him get up so early. But, he continued on the run with his friend beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were seniors at the college in town, with graduation just months away. They had just a few units this semester and managed to take their last classes together. One of those classes being in the morning, and why, according to Daniel at least, they needed to run early in the morning. \"You know I don't like to run in the afternoon.\" Toby heard Daniel's voice in his head as the conversation from last night played in his mind. \"The trails are too crowded. Besides... running in the morning makes you feel refreshed and energized the rest of the day.\" Daniel's last statement. The one that convince him to run with Daniel this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby was so distracted that he missed the root. Suddenly, he found himself falling, face first into the dirt trail. An unbecoming yelp of surprise escaped Toby's mouth just before he caught himself with his hands planted in the dirt. Or mud actually. This part of the trail was still damp. Toby's ego was bruised when Daniel, of course, had to stop and laugh. Daniel did offer his hand to help his friend up a moment later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think... that is enough running... for today.\" Toby said though breathes of air. \"Let's start back...\" He was rubbing his hands together, trying to wipe off the mud caked on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already... I guess we've been... out here awhile.\" Daniel said looking up at the early morning sky, between the leaves and branches having over the trail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby turned to face the direction they had just come when he caught a glimpse of something in the corner of his eye. \"What's that?\" Toby was already heading over to the root that had tripped him. Under the some of the brush beside the root, there was a gold pointy corner sticking out. Toby wiped most of the mud onto his pants before bending down to pick up whatever had caught his attention. Pushing away the leaves, the gold corner was part of a book, a heavy. Toby picked off some of the leaves sticking to the book as he lifted it. \"Wow, this is worth the fall.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book felt like leather and seemed to be embroidered with what Toby assumed was gold and some gems. It had the emblem of a dragon in front. Daniel walked over and stood beside his friend to get a better look. \"Nice find! It must be worth a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby opened it to a random page. At first glance, it seemed unreadable. It was written by hand, with some ornate drawings along with sides of the pages. The language was not English, but Toby could still piece out some words, like he knew the language. The one used most often was... 'Dragon.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel did not understand a single word of it, but the pictures on the page interested him. \"This is neat. Whoever drew these had some talent. It looks like the guy in the picture was... transforming or something... a dragon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Into a dragon.\" Toby said, agreeing with his friend's assessment. The words, although hard to fully comprehend, supported that thought. \"It's weird. I can read some of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can?\" Daniel had a skeptical look on his face. \"It looks like Greek to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This page sounds like it is finishing a long explanation about dragons and... I guess dragon culture. Weird.\" He traced the lines of the page with a finger. \"And here...\" Toby pointed to a pointed to the paragraph. \"It's talking about... transformation... a spell or something.\" He turned a couple pages, and skipped more towards the end of the book. \"Look here. It is a phrase all by itself. Maybe this is the spell it was referring to earlier.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or spells.\" Daniel said, pointing to a couple other phrases that were separate and by themselves. \"You found an Witch's book! Some crazy person's spell book.\" he teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha...\" Toby rolled his eyes. But, Daniel did have a point... though the book looked kind of old. At best, maybe it was worth a little money. Though... something about it called to him. Toby looked closely at several of the standalone phrases. He tried his hand at pronouncing the words in his head, and the more he went over them, the more he seemed to be able to say them. \"Well, this one is interesting.\" He began reading it aloud, his tounge and mouth creating the words as if he really knew the language. A moment later, a great pain erupted through both of the college students. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fred did as asked, and saw then inside the office the medical technician who did his physical and gave the injections. Standing in each corner of the room along side the desk of the rodeo manager were two guards. Mr. Marshall stood behind his swivel chair and looking down at Fred, he said, \"I need to inform you the injections you received today, one of them was incorrectly administered to you. In fact, the injection was intended for use on rodeo riding bulls. It being a special formula of Reformation D.N.A. serum, the type and brand name used by the state on occasion to terminate sex offenders without causing their death, but affecting of them their body to transform. The syringe and serum injected into you will cause a steady trans-morphing of you human body to begin resembling that of a Red Angus breed of bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards are here to take you to a place where the transitioning of your body can commence and finalize. If you own the will to fight the serum mentally, you might remain partially human, as become then a Minotaur. If you are weak and give up easily, expect then by the end of three months to be back here and enjoying life from the physical form and mental perspectives of being a leased herd-sire bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly the choice is yours to handle what you will become, there is no know antidote, as the government uses it to defer sexual offender to liking of cow rumps rather than women.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake hold of Freddy, and transport him to the research facility for his Reformation serum monitoring, and/or bull mating training if he decides to follow that path of a lifestyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards took a quick hold of Fred, as Fred did not fight with them for his freedom, he felt stunned from what all he had heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guards hustled Fred out the office door and to a waiting vehicle for his transportation, a scream from inside the office turned some heads to look. Inside the private office, Mister Marshall had become angry with the medical technician. As the tech stood waiting for the guards to subdue Fred and load him into the transport vehicle, another syringe with bovine Reformation serum D.N.A. formula was injected into the neck of one crass minded technician.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, the Tech turned to look at Mister Marshall and before he could ask as what and why, the rodeo manager told the man what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karl you act like a virtual Jackass, not giving a care about a nice fellow you doomed to being an animal and a bull. The injection just put into your neck is Pony Serum, as a full strength dose, assuring your complete transitioning of form to being a pony animal for use in our kiddy pony ride and petting zoo. You shall keep your gender but I want you castrated, made a gelding, the change is one of permanence, and your wife will receive a payment of life insurance money for her dead husband. Effectually, you shall be considered as dead, a certificate of death registered with your name by the research facility, as of now you are to be caged and kept as the changes consume your human form. I was informed that your mental factors will not be affected, other than the lacking of speech, and the ability to write. You will know what is happening and the life you must learn to endure, so expect to learn liking eating hay, raw grains, and sniffing mare rumps on a daily basis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred heard part of what Mister Marshall said to Karl and that made Fred smile.</span></div></div>",

His thoughts about his future were uncertain, as the boss told him he could fight the onset of animal urges and curb the final outcome, leaving him then not as a complete bull animal, but as a freak, a Minotaur! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiding in the center seat of a window van, Fred sat handcuffed and ankle shackled, barely able to move. Fred did not fight with the two muscular guards, he knew them as security men working there with rodeo, both were always friendly, as they were when putting Fred in his restraints. One of the guard noted how Fred looked and acted as mentally stunned from what all he had heard told to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fred, where we are taking you, is to a scientific research farm. They are nice people there, very understanding, we, Jake my partner and me, have visited there, going to pickup new Brahma bull stock for the bull riding events.\" That said and Fred came out of his fog of being told his life was so to being through; the thought of becoming a brute bull animal was to most anybody as unthinkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Dale, the the guards that had hustled Fred out the Rodeo office door and to the waiting van for his transportation, all stopped when for inside the office building was heard then a scream. Dale continued to converse with Fred as Jake said nothing, as he drove the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That scream we all heard, Fred, you remember when we were loading you into the van, we heard a scream form inside the office. Yea, Dale took a cell phone call, it was from Mister Marshall. What the caller told Jake, was that the boss was really upset from what Karl did to you. He, Mister Marshall has vials of serums he keeps, serums made special for use to control certain disrespecting employees. Karl is the medical technician and a male nurse, he works to patch up those working the rodeo who get injured. The really bad injured go to a local hospital, but the smaller cuts and injuries get fixed there at the rodeo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would imagine that Karl had a grudge about you, and he working where the boss kept the serums, when he got his chance, he injected you. Had you not made any mention about the extra injection Karl gave you, your physical changes would begin slowly, causing you minor discomforts. It really begins to show drastic changes after six weeks, I know, well because..., well I know, okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, it was reported that Mister Marshall became angry with Karl, the medical technician. So, when Karl stood there gloating, he all smiles as we were taking you to the van, the boss then held another syringe with the Reformation serum, and injected into the neck of that bastard Karl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought to tell you, as hearing about what the boss then told Karl as to his certain doom, did surprise Karl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serum injection the boss used on Karl was a equine Pony Serum. He tends to like using that breed of serum. Oh yea, he has used it often, as it works fast. Someone so injected remains at the rodeo, as gets loaded into what the boss named as the Changing Room. In reality it is a steel shipping container, one lined with sponge foam to soak up the yelling, begging, and screams of the changeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYea changeling, that being an old word, but nicely proper for what happens to people injected with stout strength serums as was Karl..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, just to let you know, as Karl will be a changeling, as very soon he shall walk on all fours, having hoofs, a tail, and force by his new nature to eating hay as his meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOw, Jake what was that for, elbowing me in my gut, ah oh yea. Well when your changes finish, you get to graze and rarely need to eating of hay, as in the barn you get tasty food pellets made of grains and alfalfa, molasses, and vitamins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl, after he becomes a pony and a animal to anyone working at or the general public, he shall be so perfectly different, to see him, anyone would see a horny male pony. The boss told Karl he could keep his real gender, but after allowing him to delight his maleness  mating with pony mares for a few months, he planned to have Karl the pony as castrated, made a gelding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSad to say, but the changes are permanent, as those so injected, they stay then as an animal. Many retain their identity, knowing what they became, though not capable of communicating their feelings. You did not get the full strength serum, so you will retain your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl though will realize his mentality as fading, so after a year of living like a pony he will go insane and then after a few more days become wholly an ignorant animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Fred, as for you shall know then what you know now, still able to reason and think. If anyone were to ask, you shall be reported as having died, a certificate of death registered with your name by the research facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs when you arrive to the research farm, there are no cages, but  the give you a 20x20 stall and some privacy. During the  coming six weeks to two months the changes consume, or transition your human body. Your mental factors will not be affected, other than the lacking of speech, and later, after growing of hooves your ability to write ceases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrust me, you will know what is happening, but for those like you, the life you learn to endure is one of leisure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey look here, we have arrived, nice farm, green pastures, hey and look there, they have a whole herd of red Angus cows, you soon new breed!\"<br>\r\n</font></span></div></div>",

Loving every second of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was summer in her 20th year of life and she was off riding one of her father's prized palmero horses Mandy came across something shiney.  A moment later She stopped the horse and jumped off and lead the horse to the the same spot that the shiney thing was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she walked up to the place she looked down and noticed that the item on the ground was a glissing diamond.

The extra height coming for Adagio. Oddly she was glad that Adagio's coat matched her hair colour. A giggle burst from her lips, as she imagined mismatched hair and fur and who she would ask to help her do her roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood pulsed in her ears, as she felt an eagerness flood her. She was free now, in ways she'd never expected. One hoof scrapped anxiously at the ground. Taking a deep breath, she set off. The pacing came easily enough, as if her equine body was guiding and helping her. She managed to walk without staggering, and struggling for balance like a foal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeeding up, she found the canter felt different, almost like she was dancing. Inhaling a deep breath of fresh air, she looked out across the field. The scents felt more immediate, more invigorating, and she had plenty of room to race. She charged off at a trot, even that felt tame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roar, she let rip, and started to gallop. The scenery whizzed past, and she felt her hooves kicking up the ground behind her. This was the life. Freedom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt sweat start to form, giving her body a healthy glow, a sheen. A bead trickled between her breasts, and looking down, Mandy realised that her human half had been scaled up as her body became one with Adagio. Her generous C-cups, were now DD's, and her arms were brawnier too. Not ugly or disproportionate, just more fitting for her bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached the end of the field, she slowed down. Resisting the temptation to see how easily she could jump the fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, she hadn't realised how far she'd run. How fast she'd been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting an appraising eye over her rear, the tail flicked instinctively, drawing her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snort she dismissed her first judgement.

She wondered if there were others similarly affected, transformed like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an intriguing thought, if today was the day that a new race was created. A population of centaurs and centauresses. It was reassuring, a sole centauress was a curiosity, and might end up in some government lab. But a larger population would be impossible to hide, impossible to deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about racing back to the stables, surely where the horses and people were densest, that was the place most likely to have other ... other <i>transformees</i>. Transformees, she liked the sound of it. Simple and non-judgemental, a frisson of uncertainty raced all the way down her spine. She felt her tail swish agitatedly from side to side. The only '<i>transformee</i>' she knew for certain was herself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe doubt didn't get a chance to linger or take root. In the neighbouring field she spotted a centaur. His human half had a dazed, slightly sceptical look, as if he no longer could trust his own eyes. The equine half was almost certainly 'King', one of the stallions. King was coal black with a chalk white star on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout his former head, she couldn't be sure. The human half, had a ripped chest bulging with muscles, and mousy brown hair. A mane of hair traced it's way down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" she called out. As he saw her, she waved, beckoning him closer. An uncertain smile flickered across his face. But he walked over towards the fence and the smiling Mandy.</span></div></div>",

Taking a few quick strides, Cliff raced towards the fence. His powerful thighs bunching at the last moment, and propelling him into the same field as Mandy. Her face flushed crimson, as she fought to forget how her eyes were drawn to King's bouncing cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it did confirm what she suspected. The boy was atop King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it hit her. Cliff wasn't the one in control. King was... and King was the prize stallion on the ranch. On the Stud Ranch. She felt Adagio take control, momentarily dancing nervously to the side. Taking a deep breath she fought for, and won control from her equine half. However, she also got a lungful, of something else. A sharp, musky aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdagio was getting harder to keep under control, a very false smile was on her face as her panic built. She managed to face Cliff, and found to her horror, that he was getting an erection. The damned thing was nearly scrapping off the ground. But instead, it danced in the air, waving back and forth like a two foot long salami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth was dry as the desert and she moistened her lips. Her nostrils flared, and again that musky aroma bit at her nostrils. She whimpered, as Adagio danced around, her hooves prancing. She presented her rear to King. Cliff looked horrified, and powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWailing, he lolled backwards, as King lunged forward. His forehooves locking around Adagio's torso. Mandy twisted trying desperately to dislodge the excited stallion. Her calm wasn't helped as she felt his cock slapping wetly between her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whimper slipped unbidden from her lips, as she saw that she was signalling her own readiness. Her tail tucked off to the side. She felt her pussy wink in anticipation. Once more she pictured King's massive cock. Surely it couldn't fit. Surely it would split her in two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instinct took control, her breath caught, as she felt the tip brush against her lips. King knew the sign, with a single powerful thrust he was inside. He pistoned his full length, despite her fear, she found herself warbling her joy in time to his plunging thrusts. In a few moments, he came. Losing all interest in her he slid from her back, his retreating member already softening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slid free with a gluttonous squelch. Mandy's felt humiliated. Made worse moments later, as she felt King's excess juices slick her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no two ways about it she was fucked!</span></div></div>",

The nine clay decanters filled with rare wine, one of which he tapped and drain the contents into several two liter plastic screw-capped bottles.

After a momentary stare at the closet and his hand gripping then that long as pink and rigidly hard male rod, he decided that beasts need not wear clothing. He turned and walked better then, as out into the hallway and to the kitchen of his spacious penthouse apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHard cloven hoofs became a quickly noted detriment when he stepped upon the highly polished linoleum kitchen floor. A scramble of still uncoordinated legs and hoofs caused Guy to skid across the kitchen floor, and do a near split when he landed flat on his furry butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this sudden turmoil of fret and cursing his changed body, Guy lost control of his throttled maleness ans shot a hot stream of Greek wine tainted urine onto the floor, making it more than slippery, it suddenly smelled like a goat barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuy, his groin aching from stretching of leg and groin muscles not flexible for doing such gymnastic style leg splits, his balls ached too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling about his falling, as he tried to grab hold a kitchen chair to right his stance and stand on the slippery floor, he stepped in some of his oily urine and fell, this time face forward as down on his chest. As injury was insulted and made to pain him more, when he hit the floor instead of saying another colorful metaphor, Guy let go a very goatish bleat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe realization of his changed essence and form was of becoming a satyr, and though he knew the wine was the cause of it, he had a want to drink it some more. Though he was an educated and well experience science minded professional, his passion for wine had caused him some downfall in the past. This had gone beyond being a downfall, and as he thought more about his want to taste and drink more of the ancient wine, he reasoned his changing to satyr might continue and he could become a real goat animal !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his eyes caught sight of the glass he had used to drink the wine, and in the glass was about an inch still of the dark liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInching carefully across the kitchen floor until Guy was holding then to the counter-top with his dark colored fingernails, he reached for the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing one hand as he needed to use the other hand to hold a grip onto the counter-top, he took the glass in hand, in a shaking hand, and began to lift it up as toward his face and mouth. Tipping the glass the wine from standing overnight had thickened, as jelled and trailed very slowly from out the glass to a mouth opened wide, a black tongue sticking out, it beckoning the wine to touch at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dangerous moment of expectation had Guy let go the counter-top to help hold the glass from it shaking in his furry hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFur and glassware do not hold well one against the other and with the minutes of excitement, Guy felt his state of arousal protruding his new sheath. A glancing quick look down to view what he relished trying to toy with more as soon, and the glass slipped from his grasp. Guy tried to grab at the glass as it fell toward the kitchen floor and at the touch of his furry hands he managed to touch-knock-causing it to fall down to covering his rising red male rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis erection then sunk into the cold as thick wine remaining in the glass, as the wine began to touch, coating, warmed and became more like a salve on the sexual rod of a then male satyr. As the wine touched and coated the length of sensitive pink penal skin it began to cause a burning sensation. It seared and tortured the pink penis skin, causing Guy to bleat wildly, as he grabbed at the glass to get it off, and at holding dearly to his more sensual changed penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoated in the wine the penis began to swell, the pointy head bloomed into a mushroom shaped head, glands puckered, as along the full length of the male shaft the skin changed from a pretty pink color to a dark brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA want for drinking of more wine right then ceased, and with much struggling to remain standing, Guy turned on the kitchen faucet and tried desperately to soak as cool his burning rod in the tap water.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing the damage, it is shrugged off as unimportant, as the doctor appointment holds greater urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the busy office, and announced to the secretary the name, took a seat and waited to hear the doctor was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin,\" yes come inside, the doctor will be with you in a few minutes,\" says the nurse with a kindly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the door opens ans in walks not the doctor but another doctor, and he is not smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sits on the roll-a-round stool and opens his laptop computer, as he sighs and says, \"Kevin, you have a cancel, the kind what is not easily operable to remove without major damage done to your face. Therefore, unless you wish to have the surgery anyway, and several years of facial reconstruction done, I would suggest you put your life in order, and death is at hand, maybe three months.\" That said he got up and walked out leaving a patient setting there stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned by the harsh uncaring way the doctor just washed his hands of a human being, and went next to someone there able to pay money for the services rendered, an angered Kevin stormed out the doctor office door heading for the car and then a drive to home and sit as think about what all to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt, as beside the car stand a woman, and she is not looking too happy about what happened to her car door from another door scratching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this, scratched my car!\" she said, she angry and for good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea sorry,\" is all that a stunned man soon told he would die could muster a remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you plan to do about this, I want it fixed, you need to pay for the damage!' She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into the car and starting the engine, she stands outside there looking, she points at the assailant to her car, and says, \"Damn you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the car window, as backing out of the parking space, and with as much disdain for the world then, as answering the woman, said, \"You old goat, go get screwed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said and she having something in her hand, she threw it, as whatever it was it struck the face, splattering a stinky scent throughout the inside of the car too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking from fearing death, the drive home is slow, and requires several stops to rest, relax, and then drive on toward home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce arrived at home and feeling weary, the thought of taking a nap seemed proper. Yet napping, the scene of the doctor office confrontation with the woman plays over and again, as if mental reruns of the scene become a constant reminder of how vain one can be at the wrong time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking, getting a drink of water, and there in the window ledge is a cute statue purchased for the wife as a joke, she too was remarked at as being the old goat, and the molded statue was of a young satyr sexually molesting a doe goat, one crude and silly a thing to give to a loving wife, but she thought it as quite funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to nap again, this time the mind dreams of the statue, and of the old goat, as well the bestial act of a youth molesting a female goat. The crazy dream reruns a dozen times as if it were a sports replay of a situation out on the playing field or a pasture where such is common play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, waking and yawning, the urge to use the bathroom takes president. Walking into the bathroom, the head is half asleep still, the eyes view the toilet, and doing as having done some thousands of times previous, is the act of unzipping, as mooching out that limp male member to point it toward the bowl and let go the flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome trouble at finding the limp organ and what seems to protrude out the zipper is not what was expected, as comes the flow. Suddenly there is a yellow fountain spewing upward at a high angle the urine, it splattering upon the bathroom wall, running to the floor as it stinks an acrid scent, strange, and not at all what is normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpset that what happened, happened as it made for a mess. As then the hot stream of yellow goes straight upward, as raining down upon a balding head, coating its maker in his own stench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn me, what a day!\" Was said, and as much is was a beginning at feeling damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUrinated upon by self, required a shower and tossing soiled stinking clothes into the washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the shower and the steam clouded the room, as letting the water flow down off a foolish head. As finger and soap go to work cleaning, the feel is of hair there, thicker hair, more hair, something feels strange. </span></div></div>",

Stopping the stroking of arms, the soapy lather a thick foam, was not remembered it doing that before, a rinsing and grabbing for a towel to dry blurry eyes, what is the fist sight of the hands shows hairs sprouted and flourishing, grown between the fingers, about the hand with exception of the still bare palms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning an \"Oh God no,\" the sight of what were suntanned skin on the arms has a streak of thick as inch long hairs grown from the left side of the wrist, wrapping to the underside of the forearm to upper arm, the hair being ever so black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting the towel to the chest as shoulders and the back, the feel as seeing there too is hair growing, as maybe two to three inches long. This hair is also black, making the body look all black, as its owner begins to whine with worry as what is happening to him, and why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloud of steam has dissipated, the bathroom ceiling fan sucking away the steam leaving the air clear to the view, but oddly scented with the scent of a wet dog smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting a leg to dry the thigh, the buttock, the shin and foot, what rises is not the leg with what walked inside the shower stall. As there lifted and the foot set upon the corner seat to the shower stall is similar a foot, leg, and from the feel, the buttock is all that of a black furred goat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick check of the other legs proves to be the same and is made wore as the toes on that elongated foot have become cloven hooves. To feel of the hooves, to wiggle them ever so slightly, the feel of it brings out upon the face a slight smile as of, if of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what in the Hell is happening here,\" is said, as hearing the voice, the tone of it is not what is remembered of being capable to being still in the church choir. The voice is gravelly sounding, has an essence of terseness never heard or noticed before then. A check again of the feet and both are the same, ending in cloven hoofs, legs hunched slightly, thighs look stronger, thighs more muscular, as is the butt flat, the pelvic bone closer to the skin and having less plump-roundness. As then feeling the furry butt, touching too an anus not previously set opened to the air or plainly visible, the hand touches there a tail, a very goat-like tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDashing out from the shower stall, cloven hoofs on hard tile floor offers poor footing, as slipping and grabbing for the sink and its counter top, the hands hold as the head turns and looks into the large wall mounted mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No..., what is this, that is not me?\" A statement of fear said to self, for seeing there in the mirror is not that face what was shaved as looked at every morning for many years, as it is black with hair, only the eyes and lips remain devoid of the black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBare palms pat as stroke a face changed, is furry but there is more what has become different to the point of being unrecognizable to maybe even dear mother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with eying the face of both a manly self and something becoming somewhat goat-like there too, two spike harsh pains erupt from the peak of the forehead. There pushing from out the skull, through the black as thicken fur come two points, two horns. As eying them to see them grow, gaining girth about the base as they get longer, curving slightly, black as is the fur, very pointy, with small rings of horn every two or so inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the horns grow the view of the face went unnoticed until it was almost finished changing. As a human black nose grew and merged with the upper lip, the chin and jaw a muzzle appeared. Curling up of lips upper and lower reveal the teeth have taken different positioning, some to the front as are those of a grazing animal and the moulders remaining together in rows, look as if they too have expanded in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow-baa...,\" as new pains strike, the shock from it emitting out a slight bleated baaing tone. As eying the mirror the sweeping changes have begun to affect the until then unchanged ears, though they were furry, were then growing. Lopping ears become furry flaps, reminding of the mcculloch hat ear flaps worn during wintry months when outside shoveling snow from off the sidewalks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...would baa..., be-baa worse-baa...?\" Is said, as bleating baas break up the slurred spoken words, making for wonderment and worry if in a short while only the goat bleats shall be then the voicing of any opinions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrastically changed, wondering of why, the mind searching for reasons, there then was the thought of telling that woman standing by her car, telling her she was an old goat and to go get screwed. Screwed is becoming like a goat, and what continues to rise as protrude out past the end of a fur covered sheath as portion of the lower abdomen suggests of feeling horny, wanting, lusting with each moment to be at rut with females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHairy hands set to holding the changed self weighted down upon the bathroom counter top, as what are hind legs to a large as tall goat stretch out behind, the tail wiggles as the erection grows out long, very reddish-pink it color, is blunt without the circumcision done at birth. It is a reflection of being beastly, as want and instinctive male lust begins to rise, stiffening the male shaft member to a rigid thing filled with passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoans of undeniable lust to be male and feel as know what it is to be male, to dominate, rule, mount, rut and mate as would a Billy goat.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your insomnia ensures that you're up before the Sun. That combined with your dislike for sleeping in tents. The archaeological dig site looks almost mystical with a low hazy mist covering the first open pits. As the lead archaeologist, you take this as a chance to inspect the progress the team has made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour current position feels more administrative, rather than practical. A quick, guilty inspection confirms there's no dirt ingrained beneath your fingernails, the outline of the ancient Roman temple clear through the remains of the walls. However, you don't know the actual state of things, instead your spreadsheet tells you exactly how the finances stand, how long you have left, and how much money you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dew glistens, transferring to your hiking boots as you walk around the site. The hints of fragments visible on the surface confirm the period of the site. Your smile beams, as you find a mosaic floor with only a few cracks spoiling it's perfection. A soft grunt of surprise slipping out, it's almost too perfect. Normally, you'd expect the walls to be re-used over time, stolen to build homes and other buildings over the centuries between then and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps there were more worshippers here, or the locals were more kindly treated by the Romans here. Either respect or fear, you decide. One or the other would be good reasons for the good condition of the site. Thinking over the papers you'll be able to write about this, you smile to yourself, inhaling the streaming coffee vapour curling up from your tin cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then that you take a second more intense look at the mosaic. It looks as if one of the figures is pointing oddly. A Roman noblewoman, whose attention is in the opposite direction from everyone else in the design. Following her outstretched hand, you find the edge of the pattern. The tessellation just a little thicker than elsewhere. Plucking your brush from your tool belt, you kneel down and go to work. A guilty thrill as you clear away the dirt from area. An irregular outline is revealed, briefly you consider calling Jack,or waking one of the rest of the team to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the orange Sun streams through the branches of the nearby copse, reminding you how early it is. Dismissing it as nerves, you see your fingers are now dirty, and you do now have dirt beneath your fingernails. Carefully with your trowel, you lever the section of mosaic up and away. You've found it, a hidden compartment. Giddy as a child with his first taste of wine, you see a stone flask inside. The seal on the hidden chamber so good, that the flask is pristine, it simply lies there unsullied by dirt, even the stopper: a stone marble held in place with a red wax seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously, you pick it up, turning it over and over admiring the glazing, and the design. It looks out of place, the figures dancing round and around. The tallest one, obviously intended as a God. But, it's none of the pantheon of Roman Gods. A soft moan slipping out, as you realise that's why it's hidden. It's heretical, a throw back to some other worship. Turning it one last time you see the final face of the 'dance', the figures entwined in passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding at your own speculation, this is dedicated to a more hedonistic God, to a more pleasure oriented life, one dedicated to Pan... or Bacchus. Or maybe one of the tricksters, amusing themselves by tormenting mortals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your caution and gentleness, the wax seal crumbles at your touch, and the marble stopper falls with a crack to the mosaic. A thin tendril of green smoke snakes out of the flask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrosion?, Copper?, desiccated wine?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not scientific, but you lean closer and take an sniff. As if responding to an invitation, as if triggering a conscious reaction, the green vapour moves with unnatural speed towards your nostrils. Blinking rapidly, your eyes are filled with hypnotic visions of wanton, lusty behaviour. Oddly, unsettlingly, arousingly, you see yourself from the female perspective, her passion mounting, her body alert and pleasure filled. You don't notice as your body slips backwards, you sprawl across the mosaic your body twitching, as your skin ripples and transforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unfamiliar voice haunts you, mocks you. \"Time to leave those dull books behind you, and restore your passion for life, your passion for adventure and excitement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sentiment chimes with your own thoughts, about leaving the administrative side of things, returning to getting your hands dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll be dirty.\" the voice confirmed with amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dirty girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping upright, as if waking from a dream, or surfacing from a deep dive. You awake with a heaving gasp. Looking around you see the walls of hotel room, one you wish you could have used for the dig. But financial restraint meant that staying in tents bought you another day of digging. However, you barely noticed the room, barely questioned your presence there. A more immediate, more pressing problem demanded answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/0698fd2338800f8602b16be24bfca9fc/tumblr_olhkt2SNxS1w2lwkto5_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/0698fd233880...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body, your voluptuous Succubus-sweet body.

He finally got his science teacher, Mrs. Howell fired. It took a lot to accomplish this task, but he finally did it. He had to hide in Mrs. Howell\u2019s closet, strip off all of his clothes, and act like she was molesting him, but the embarrassment was worth it. She was not only fired, but also taken away in handcuffs, crying. Just to let you know, Pierre is a spoiled brat, and Mrs. Howell made the mistake of giving him detention for a week. That will teach her, he thought to himself laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n However, unknown to him, Mrs. Howell is a practicing witch who normally wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. However, sense that little twerp ruined her carrier, and her life; she felt no choice but to do something bad to him. In her empty prison cell, 31-year-old Mrs. Howell stripped off all of her clothes, reveling her incredibly hot body to the world. She then drew a pentagram in her blood, and began chanting a curse in Latin. The curse would be lifted, if he simply told the truth. She cursed him to become on the outside, what he was on the inside, a horrible imp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pierre is resting on his bed in the nude, when the first of his pains begin in waves. As he lies there, moaning in agony in the fetal position, his body begins to change. First, all of the hair on his body falls off him, and his skull starts to expand, becoming bigger. Second, his arms and his legs become much shorter, more muscular. His abdomen is becoming much smaller too, at the same time; bat wings are beginning to sprout from his back. His genitals however, are becoming very large. In addition to this, his eyes are turning pure black, his ears are become really pointy, his mouth is becoming wider, and his skin even turning a dark, greenish color. It takes him several agonizing minutes to morph into this demonic creature, and Pierre the imp now looks just like a classical imp, complete with bat like wings. He also has all the powers of an imp, complete with all the knowledge of how to use those powers too. However, he cannot use those powers against Mrs. Howell or any of her family members. Pierre now awakens and finds himself an imp, he decides to go...</span></div></div>",

However, instead of words in normal English coming out of his mouth, he begins to speak weirdly, almost like a snake would, if a snake could speak English. In addition, his screams for help almost sounded like whispers, they were barely audible to the human ear. Just then, his beautiful older sister, 13-year-old Juliet opens up the door, and looks inside. Not wanting to be seen by her, he magically disappears, and goes to the only other place he feels safe. Remarkably, that place is school, Jefferson Public schools to be exact, and his school encompassed nearly all grade levels, from kindergarten, all the way two the ninth grade. However, he never associated with any of the younger kids, and the students his own age, around 8 years old hated him. Therefore, he spent a lot of his time pestering the older students.

You also remember that she one of the most popular kids at your school. You begin to feel your new demonic urges desire her, so you begin to watch contently as she continues to get dressed. After Cassidy gets dressed she zips up her boots and ties her hair in a side ponytail and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After she leaves, you begin to feel your new urges come full force as you desire to be with her, to be IN her, so you quickly fly after her. After following her or a while you both arrive at her house which you both enter and head up to her room. After you both enter her room she sits down on her bed and starts texting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to me but right now I don\u2019t care, all I know is I must have your body.\u201d you say to yourself as you fly over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then fly over to her and land behind her, on her bed. You then approach her and faze your arm into as reach into her back. You then watch her body collapse on the ground as you pull a glowing pink orb out of her. You then proceed to put the orb in your mouth and swallow it. You then feel a rush as all of Cassidy\u2019s memories come flooding into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn to Cassidy\u2019s lifeless body lying on the floor. You then approach her head and open her mouth. After that using your new powers, you begin to squeeze yourself into her mouth and down her throat. You then feel her throat squeeze you down into stomach as it swallows you. After you reach her stomach you begin to feel a warm and tingly feeling as you watch her stomach acids slowly dissolve and absorb you. Once you are fully dissolved you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come to, you notice you are staring at a ceiling.

His parents were off working, despite it being Saturday.  But something was bugging him.  A soft thumping.  He walked carefully and found Old Meow, the family cat nearly 15 years old and couldn't catch a mouse if it ran into his mouth.  He slept soundly by Aaron blinked as he realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hear your heart beat,\" he whispered.  Reaching down with clawed hands, he scratched the old cat.  He purred and glanced up at Aaron before falling back asleep.  \"Well, at least I have one person who won't abandon me.\"  Aaron gave a weak smile as he heard a car drive in.  He shivered with fear as a knock came on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron, it's me,\" came Naomi's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-doors open,\" Aaron said.  Naomi entered and looked up at Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" she whispered.  \"Aaron, you're taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Aaron asked.  Naomi came close.

She led him to the living room couch and sat down.  \"Now, tell me everything.\"  Aaron nodded and told her about Holly, rejecting her, and the words exchanged after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I wake up and I've become this,\" Aaron said as his shirt ripped from an expanding chest.  \"I'm becoming the fucking devil.\"  Naomi touched his reddening face as he continued to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can find a way to fix this,\" Naomi whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Aaron yelled with a deeper voice.  He rose and walked around before noticing a <i>clop-clop</i> as he walked.  \"Don't tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have cloven feet now,\" Naomi said, \"And a tail.\"  He turned and saw a spat tip slowly growing.</span></div></div>",

I must say, I think Aaron is more handsome now than he was before.  I mean while he was no heartthrob as a human he was still a very good looking guy.  A man any girl would be lucky to date.  Now he is smoking hot.  Pardon the pun Aaron,\" Naomi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Aaron said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  No!  No!  You were supposed to freak and leave him!\" Holly yelled.  Naomi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what a shame.  You know I was hoping Aaron would be my first time tonight after the party.  I guess it could still happen.  Ciao,\" Naomi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait?  You're still a virgin?!  No!  Don't sle-\" but Holly's words were cut off.  Aaron looked down at her.  His muscular chest barreled out as his body became fitter than it ever was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did,\" he said softly, \"Did you mean that?\"  Naomi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every word,\" Naomi said.  She walked around the broken table and looked up at Aaron's face.  \"I've really liked you for a long time.  When you asked me to this party, I was never happier.\"  She gripped his fingers with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the part about sex?\" Aaron asked with a concerned tone.  \"Holly sounded scared by that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she is about to lose big time,\" Naomi said.  The phone rang again.  Glancing at it, Holly tossed it onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Naomi, what if, I don't know, you become a devil too?\" Aaron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will be one.  And then you won't be a lone freak,\" Naomi said.  She kissed his belly, as that was as high as she could reach.  \"Please Aaron.\"  Aaron glanced up and saw how close he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'll be able to reach my room,\" he said.  He walked over to the couch and pushed it away.  He cleared a spot and laid down, his tail wagging with anticipation, his devilhood was growing eager too.  Naomi walked over and kissed Aaron on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.  That tongue felt nice,\" she whispered before undressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone rang again and Naomi grumbled.  She walked over and unplugged the receiver from the wall.  She walked back her her red hunk and kissed him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisses turned into more intimate and passionate actions until Naomi the virgin lost herself in ecstasy to the young devil.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Justin is a somewhat stupid, angry, and selfish 15-year-old boy, whom attends Wilson Middle School, because he flunked the last two years. Justin is currently walking home from school and down a deserted dirt road towards his home. As he does this, he sees something in the clear blue sky. He sees a dark, greenish colored object above him, and he notices that it seems to be following him. He naturally panics and begins to run for it. However, the UFO quickly moves above and in front of him. He can now clearly see that this Alien ship is saucer shaped, about one hundred yards wide and fifty yards tall. He then sees a blue beam coming out of the craft and it engulfs him, lifting him off the ground and into the ship. The beam then brings him into a well-lighted room, and he was powerless to fight back. The beam held him in place, two feet above the ground, motionless, except for his eyes, which watched in terror as a bunch of alien creatures walked towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They were humanoid in shape, about five feet tall, and they looked like a cross between reptile and insect. These aliens surrounded him as the beam began to vaporize his clothes, which the commanding alien pointed too, one at a time. First, his shirt disappeared, then his blue jeans, and then his underwear, until he was completely naked. He could see that the aliens now surrounded him, looking him over, as if they had never seen a human before, pointing to various parts of his body, including his genitals and buttocks. To his shock, the aliens then placed a long vacuum cleaner like device on his penis, while he was suspended in midair. The device then began to do something to him, as he felt himself ejaculating. He could literally watch his seamen being sucked out of him, and into a big machine. They then removed the device from his penis and put it up his butt. He squealed in pain as the device now past his cheeks and entered his rectum, sucking out his fecal matter. His torment only lasted for a few seconds as the device slowly withdrew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The commanding alien then placed a green crystal on Justin\u2019s head, and left it there for a few seconds. The commanding alien then took the crystal off Justin\u2019s head, and placed it on his. Justin watched as the leader alien began to move his mouth and words began to come out. The leader alien then passed the crystal to the other aliens. It took less then a minute for the leader alien, followed by the other aliens to be speaking nearly perfect English. The alien tells Justin \u201cYou are a nice specimen. However, we need to study your species further. I will inhabit your body, until I deem this mission to be a success.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin then notices that he can speak, and says, \u201cWhat if I refuse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader alien responds, \u201cWell, we will be forced to find another host. In addition, that decision would be unfortunate, for you. We ill dissect you alive, and your remains will be stored for further study, or you will live out your life in a zoo or as a school specimen, our choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d said Justin. \u201cWell what do I have to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u201d the alien responded. \u201cJust do what you do normally, and when I want too, I will take over your body and begin my studies. I might have to take many others of your kind to our ship for further examination and study. Some we might choose to take back with us for a variety of reasons.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before Justin could say anything, the leader alien walked up to Justin, and literally fused into his body. Justin shook violently for several minutes, and then slowly opened his eyes. Justin could feel the leader alien inside of him, looking threw his eyes, as the beam placed his clothes back on him. The beam the placed the now alien possessed Justin back on the dirt road, and only thirty minutes have gone by. Justin is still confused and in shock as he goes back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Note: Justin family consists of a nice looking thirty seven year old mother; two very pretty younger sisters, one beautiful older sister, and a handsome younger brother.</span></div></div>",

The moonlight shone perfectly on the skin covering her neck where her head belonged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she asks waiting for an answer.<br>\r\nYou are frozen by both your attraction to her beauty and her headlessness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uhh.. hi\" you reply in a most awkward way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" she asks looking genuinely confused by your nerve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not everyday you meet a naked, headless woman\" you say nervously trying to cover your arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm a dullahan.\" she says fluttering her eyelashes, \"but I'd imagine you knew that given your 'approval' of my state\"<br>\r\nShe says this while walking towards you, sliding her hand across your own neck. You try not to stare, which is made easy as you can't decide where you want to stare. <br>\r\nHer breasts jiggle with each step, one lightly tapping her head. Unable to say anything, you stood there in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you haven't runaway like most yet. So let's take this another step\" she says using her free hand to draw a large sword, \"this is a magic sword, it can turn humans to dullahans if used properly\".<br>\r\nShe poses in a seductive fashion while saying this. You had no idea why she was doing any of this, but you briefly daydream of your own head rolling across the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still here, huh? I guess that means someone is tired of having all the weight on their shoulders\" she walks towards you holding up her sword. Biting her lip she pulls back with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please!\" you say, not knowing what else to call out, \"take my head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles and with a huge swing, the sword cuts straight through your neck as if it were soft butter.<br>\r\nIt feels blissful as she cuts. With the swing complete, you fulfill your dreams of rolling across the ground as a head. As just a head, you...</span></div></div>",

She doesn't seem done as she taps your shoulder, leading you down to a basement level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down there to discover an armory of sorts. You see the rest of the armor your new friend should be wearing, but opted for nudity instead. There are also extra sets of armor, both cloth and steel. An assortment of weapons hang along the wall.

The body walked over to the head.
