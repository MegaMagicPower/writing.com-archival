For some reason her pillow she was resting on seemed smaller and she was higher up down. She rolled over, trying to repostion herself, but nothing felt right. Rarity took a few seconds to ponder this then shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sure its nothing.\u201d She said, still breathing quicker than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity showered then wrapped her dressing gown and towel around her, noticing these were tighter than normal, to the point where she didn't bother doing it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grimaced down at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave I put on weight? I guess its time to start that diet.\u201d She shuddered, pulling her robe up, hoping to make it less tight around her legs and felt her stomach, expecting to find some extra pudge, but didn't notice anything. \u201cHmm.. how strange.\u201d Rarity stared a few seconds longer, giving herself another quick scan, hoping to find the extra weight, but couldn't see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she gave up and headed into the kitchen, making breakfast for herself and Sweetie Belle. She wondered why the counter seemed lower down, but trying to push those strange thoughts away. Prehaps she hadn't fully woken up yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle followed in a little later. She stared vacantly at Rarity, as she was want to do sometimes. Rarity took no notice until Sweetie Belle had been staring at her for entirely too long a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweetie Belle what is it?\u201d Rarity's teeth clenched as she tried to sound like she wasn't bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRarity... Did you get taller?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity looked over her shoulder, still preparing breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be silly Sweetie Belle, grown up ponies like me can't-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped as Sweetie Belle approached, immediately noticing that she was smaller in relation to her own height. The kitchen was smaller as well, and there was something strange about the bathroom... the bit dropped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am taller!\u201d Rarity shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie belle titled her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you said-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that!\" Rarity cut her off, then took several quick breaths. \"I don't know how it happened!\" Rarity's eyes widened and her breath quickened. \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a few inches, whats the big deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to resize all my dresses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT's what you're worried about?\"</span></div></div>",

He'd always been able to swallow things in one bite most ponies couldn't, but Rumble's dare was the biggest yet. Slowly he felt the fruit slide down his throat and into his stomach. \"Done! You owe me five bits,\" he smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumble huffed as he hoofed over the coins. \"Just you wait, I'll find something too big even for your big mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it,\" Button smirked. \"I bet I could even swallow your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumble laughed. \"Yeah right, I'd give twenty bits if that were possible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do it then,\" Button said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Rumble asked in disbelief. Button just stared at him. \"Hey, if you wanna lose the bits,\" Rumble said, still giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nButton stood over Rumble and opened his mouth wide. His lips swapped around Rumble's forehead, but he couldn't open any wider. He pushed with all his might but all that happened was Rumble fell to his belly. \"Looks like you owe ME twenty bits,\" he sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nButton kept pushing, his mind filled with thoughts of what it could feel like to have Rumble's head in his mouth, struggling as he tried desperately to escape. As he imagined a strong tingle rushed up his back and into his head. Slowly he felt his jaws widen until Rumble's head slipped inside. A tide of pleasure raced down his spine. He was doing it! He'd actually fit the colt's head into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually did it,\" Rumble mumbled, his voice muffled by Button's cheeks. \"Now let me out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nButton was lost in the sensations of swallowing Rumble's head. His tongue licked all over the colt's face, every inch pleasuring his taste buds. Without thinking he gulped, and his friend's neck vanished inside his jaws. Everything faded away except for  the feeling of Rumble in his mouth. He quickly gulped down the pegasus's chest and stomach. Next came his crotch, and Button moaned at the tastes there. He licked all over Rumble's balls, his sheath and even his tailhole. He felt Rumble's cock emerge and he attacked it with his tongue, licking and sucking until he tasted a sweet but salty liquid fill his mouth. Another strong swallow sent the last of his friend down into his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Button came down from his pleasure high and looked down at his massive stomach, swollen with the body of another pony. \"Wow, I actually ate him! Wait, I ate him! Friends aren't food?\" As his mind raced, Button... </span></div></div>",

As he sat there he felt a surge of heat in his stomach, and as he watched the bulge of Rumble started to shrink. After nearly a minute Button's stomach was back to normal ,but the warmth spread to his whole body and before his eyes the colt saw himself growing. His hooves moved over the grass and his rump spread over the ground until he was over four feel tall, nearly as big as Mrs. Cheerilee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy moly,\" Button smiled as he stood up. \"I look good.\" Looking around the park, he didn't see any other ponies nearby. \"Whew, nopony saw that.

If they sell good enough I may just switch my supplier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the cookies were baked and cooling, Twist dusted the flour off her mane. She was just about to taste test one of the snacks when the door was thrown open and Lyra barged in. \"Bonny, I need your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm baking Lyra, it can wait,\" Bon-Bon said with a tone of practiced patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's an emergency! I finally caught a human in one of my traps and I need a witness!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyra, humans aren't...\" The earth pony trailed off. \"Twist, I have to go rescue whatever poor pony Lyra's trapped this time. Can you watch the shop for just a few minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thure thing,\" Twist replied. Once the adults had gone, Twist went back to eyeing the cookies. \"Maybe one, I gonna thee what they tathte like.\" Taking a large bite, Twist's eyes widened. \"Thith ith great!\" She wolfed down the rest of the treat, and as she swallowed the last bite a warm feeling grew in her stomach. \"Maybe one more.\" That one became two, then three, and before Twist knew it the baking tray was empty. \"Oh no, I ate them all! What am I gonna do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she panicked, Twist failed to notice that she was slowly growing, rising an inch taller, then two and then three. Her tummy rumbled, and without realizing it she began grabbing other treats and gulping them down. Cookies, cupcakes and pastries all were packed away inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes Twist finally snapped out of it. \"Hey, am I taller?\" She asked herself. Looking down, she was shocked to see that she had grown nearly an entire foot taller. \"How could thith have happened?\" Another rumble brought Twist's attention to the hunger in her gut. \"Gotta eat,\" she said, shoveling more food into her mouth, whole cakes meeting their end between her lips. Her growth continued slowly and steadily, and by the time her belly was full the filly stood nearly four feet tall. \"Bon-Bon will be mad when she thees everything I ate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could come up with an explanation for Bon-Bon, a near roar came from her tummy, causing Twist to double over. \"Need more food!\" She gasped, throwing anything her growing hooves could reach into her mouth. After nearly ten minutes of frantic eating, every scrap of food in the bakery was gone, and Twist sank to the ground. \"Ahhh, better,\" she sighed. The warm feeling in her stomach was building, the heat increasing until finally....</span></div></div>",

Her rump crashed through a display case as her glassed fell to the floor, causing things to become slightly blurry. The heat in her stomach reached out to fill her entire body as she grew. \"Ooohh, thith fees tho good!\" She moaned, every inch of height sending shockwaves of pleasure surging through her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her head hit the ceiling as she reached fifteen feet, sending plaster bits raining down. Her growing body was rapidly running out of space to fill. \"Bon-Bon won't like this,\" she said, not able to keep a small grin off of her face as she imagined what was going to come next. Her hooves were already breaking through the storefront, and her butt spread over the back wall, sending cracks radiating out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt of effort, Twist stood up, her head breaking through the roof as the rest of her body burst from the disintegrating shop. Shaking the debris from her mane, she looked around, marveling as her size. She was at least twenty feet tall, her head easily able to see over the roofs of the buildings around her. Ponies looked up in confusion and fear at the massive filly in their midst. \"Hey everypony,\" she smiled. \"I had a little to much to eat, hehe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan came from her stomach, and Twist grabbed at her middle. \"Need more food, more!\" She grimaced, looking around before....</span></div></div>",

So just enjoy it.\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle sighed as she pressed on through her exhaustion, not wanting to ruin their adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the foals in her class were obsessed with the idea of growing up, wearing signs of maturity like a cutie mark or an apprenticeship like badges of pride. Sweetie Belle wasn\u2019t as enthused. It seems like the closer she comes to adulthood, the more everything she enjoys in life gets lost in the shuffle. Now that she has her cutie mark, it is considered time for her to take her next step in life and decide on a craft. It is vital she choose her life\u2019s career as early as possible, or so she\u2019s told, because it takes decades to become a master in any craft, and thus she needs to start an apprenticeship somewhere ASAP. Rarity constantly ushered Sweetie Belle between cutie mark interpreters and counselors, who only served to instill in her that dreadful fear that any wrong decision she made could ruin her entire future. She always feels alone, like nopony understands what she\u2019s going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept with Applebloom. Applebloom felt like the only pony she could really relax and be honest with. Every once in awhile, Sweetie Belle would complain about all her stress and problems, and Applebloom would listen. She wouldn\u2019t say anything, or give any suggestions. She would just listen, silently, and that\u2019s all that Sweetie Belle needed. Applebloom was the one who came up with the idea of these \u2018adventures\u2019, after all. Ever since the CMC first met, Applebloom would occasionally call for an adventure, and they would rush off somewhere new and unexplored, wearing nothing but capes and homemade origami tricorne hats, and spend the day playing games and pretending to uncover lost treasures until the sun went down. It was something they haven\u2019t done in\u2026 forever, it feels like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, the places they were having the \u2018adventure\u2019 were pretty boring; just wandering along the fields at the edge of Ponyville, where Fluttershy tends to do her gardening. But Sweetie didn\u2019t get bored, because she enjoyed rambling with her friend about unrelated topics. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou ever wonder what would happen if all of Fluttershy\u2019s animals just went crazy one day?\u201d</span> Applebloom thought out loud. She tended to guide the conversation, which Sweetie never minded, because Applebloom tended to be more a more interesting speaker anyway. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI mean, it wouldn\u2019t be too hard for them to take over, right? Her pet bear looks like he could swallow her in one bite!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cHasn\u2019t Fluttershy scared off a dragon before?\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle noted. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cShe probably could handle a bear.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYeah, her friends say she did, but do you really think it happened?\u201d</span> Applebloom laughed, with an almost conspiratorial tone. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cI mean, could you imagine Fluttershy scaring anything? She\u2019s too nice.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cSo you think they\u2019re lying?\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOh, no! Even Applejack says it happened, and my sis would never lie about anything!\u201d</span> Applebloom shrugged off the notion. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cBut maybe the dragon got scared off by something else? Maybe they just misunderstood what happened?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle pondered it. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI like to imagine that it was just a particularly cowardly dragon,\u201d</span> she decides. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cI mean, stranger things have happened.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cEhhh. Maybe\u2026\u201d</span> Applebloom shrugged. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSo what\u2019s been happening with the, uh, apprenticeship?\u201d</span> Applebloom didn\u2019t have to worry about her future like Sweetie Belle did, as her career had already been decided for her just by virtue of her being a member of the Apple family. Scootaloo didn\u2019t have to worry about it either, since she couldn\u2019t fly yet and wasn\u2019t considered \u2018ready\u2019. All of her other classmates had already gotten apprenticeships, too\u2026 damn! Sweetie Belle just wished she could be as confident as Applebloom was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cNothing new,\u201d</span> she sighs. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cMy counsellors keep telling me that whatever\u2019s going to happen is my destiny, anyway. So if my destiny is to fail, I\u2019m doomed to fail no matter what I do. I guess that\u2019s supposed to be comforting.\u201d</span> Destiny was a revered concept in Equestria, particularly in the journey to adulthood. It is believed that the Stars plan out everypony\u2019s destiny when they are born. Only by following the plan of the Stars can order be maintained in Equestria\u2026 or so she has been told. But Sweetie Belle isn\u2019t as enthusiastic about the idea of destiny as most ponies were. She wasn\u2019t even sure if it was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHmm\u2026 that sucks,\u201d</span> Applebloom says simply, in that sympathetic, comforting way she always does. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cHey, hey. We\u2019ve made it to the fun part!\u201d</span> Applebloom suddenly declares enthusiastically, tugging at Sweetie Belle\u2019s hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle asks as she follows the enthusiastic foal deeper into the wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cThe treasure I was talking about is in there,\u201d</span> Applebloom says, standing at the edge of the Everfree forest and pointing into the foliage. The wind blowed through the trees, ominously, as they stared into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cHuh? Are you joking?\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle balks at the suggestion. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to go into the Everfree! It\u2019s too dangerous!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s just a few feet in. It\u2019s not in any of the dangerous parts,\u201d</span> Applebloom reassures the other foal. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cTrust me, I played with this thing all day yesterday. You\u2019re going to love it.\u201d</span> Applebloom walks confidently into the underbrush, and Sweetie Belle hesitantly follows. Everything was different in the Everfree, as if the rules of reality themselves change. Gravity becomes stronger and it becomes harder to walk, and even the areas that were exposed to sunlight seemed darker than normal, as if she was wearing sunglasses. The trees look unusually haggard and twisted, like a thousand bony fingers reaching up towards the sky. At any time of day, Sweetie Belle found the forest creepy. But she didn\u2019t want to come off as a coward and ruin the fun, especially after they\u2019ve already come all the way here. Applebloom was always confident. Why couldn\u2019t Sweetie Belle be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they found what they were looking for; a mine cart! They approached to see it was still attached to ancient railroad tracks running through the forest, overgrown with vines and weeds. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhoa...\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle says, surprised. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cDoes this thing still work?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhy don\u2019t you climb in and find out?\u201d</span> Applebloom dares, flashing her friend a mischevious look. Sweetie Belle responded with as much confidence as she can muster, climbing into the mine cart with no visible hesitation. <i>If Applebloom can be brave, so can I,</i> she thought to herself. <span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAlright, hang on!\u201d</span> Applebloom warns, and starts pushing against the side of the mine cart. Applebloom pushes with all her might, but can\u2019t seem to make it budge for a few seconds; until finally, the cart starts picking up momentum. The second it started moving, Applebloom hopped into the mine cart alongside Sweetie Belle, and the two of them went careening down a hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhoa!\u201d</span> Sweetie Belle\u2019s brave facade drops, and she screams in shock as the cart suddenly starts flying through the forest. Applejack giggles at her outburst, causing Sweetie Belle to blush in embarrassment and punch her lightly in the shoulder. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cHey! Warn me next time you\u2019re going to do something crazy like that!\u201d</span> She says, angrily. Soon, the two foals scoot around and get comfortable in the cart, and they are able to sit back and enjoy the view of the scenery rolling by as the cart rolled easily up and down hills. Sweetie Belle can\u2019t help but laugh at how surprisingly fun the cart ride was, and just how fast they were going in such an ancient vehicle. <span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201d</span> She says again, this time in a whisper to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWhat did I tell ya? Is this awesome or what?\u201d</span> Applebloom smiles, and Sweetie Belle smiles back. There isn\u2019t much room in the cart, so the two friends are pretty much pressed together, causing Sweetie Belle to suppress a blush. Something about being close to Applebloom caused her heart to flutter sometimes, a feeling she could never explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">\u201cUmm\u2026 we\u2019re going a bit deep into the forest, aren't we?\u201d</span> She says, trying to distract herself. As they rolled the cart deeper into the Everfree, the beautiful fields that used to be rolling by were long past, and all they had left to look at was the eery, dark forest. She noticed that she couldn\u2019t hear anything, either; not even any birds chirping. Only the squeaking of the cart and the ominous sound of wind sweeping through the leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYeah, but when we reach the end of the tracks,we can just push the cart in the other direction and ride back to Ponyville. No big deal,\u201d</span> Applebloom shrugged it off, fearless as ever. Sweetie Belle sighed and remained silent, not wanting to look like the coward. As the cart ride continued and they were sent deeper into the forest, Sweetie Belle only grew more anxious, though having Applebloom by her side comforted her a bit. Eventually, just when she thought the tracks would never end, Sweetie Belle saw a landmark in the distance.</span></div></div>",

The Crusaders' clubhouse was filled with the smell of various chemicals and other ingredients. Since she'd started taking lessons from Zecora, the earth pony's abilities had grown by leaps and bounds. Today she was trying her first non-supervised potion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure this is gonna work?\" Scootaloo asked as she passed a dish filled with a glittering blue powder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive; the book said this potion is sure to 'send the drinker up through the clouds'. Y'all will be flyin' with Rainbow Dash in no time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much longer is this going to take? Rarity's expecting me back at the boutique soon,\" Sweetie Belle said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few more minutes. The liquid had ta turn bright orange, then it'll be ready,\" Apple Bloom promised. \"Now, the book says to add one tablespoon every ten heartbeats.\" Carefully tipping her hoof, she sent a small amount of the powder into the bubbling brew. A puff of smoke rose up, filling the air with a spicy scent. Slowly the dish emptied until the potion at last turned the desired color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, let's do this!\" Scootaloo grinned, leaning in and drinking down several mouthfuls of the potion before lunging back and panting. \"Hot, hot, hot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it IS over a fire,\" Sweetie giggled. \"Just drink some water, you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Scootaloo downed several glasses of ice water, Apple Bloom ladled the potion into two large bowls. Once it stopped steaming she handed one to Sweetie and took the third for herself. \"Cutie Mark Crusaders fliers!\" She toasted, downing her bowl quickly while Sweetie sipped hers. \"Anypony feel any different?\"</span></div></div>",

Her teeth sheared through bark and branches easily, and she smiled as she chewed and swallowed. \"The wood tastes pretty good actually.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, those are mah family's trees Scoots!

It tastes so good! Just give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth pony's tummy rumbled again. \"Well, maybe just one bite,\" she said. Leaning in, she bit off about half of a tree top and chewed.

The fur of Silver's face was the most delicious thing she had ever tasted. She swallowed, and Silver Spoon's neck entered her mouth. Her hooves beat against the pegasus' chest, but Scootaloo merely swallowed again, and this time her maw doubled in size as Silver's chest and front legs passed her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara fell back in horror as she watched her friend being consumed by the blank flank. \"Hey, let her go!\" She demanded. \"You do not eat ponies better than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo smirked around her dissented jaw at the terror in Diamond's eyes. She swallowed, bringing Silver Spoon's stomach into her mouth. Her head was in Scoot's stomach now, and the vibrations from her screams started a heat building in Scootaloo's loins. She ran her tongue over Silver's vagina, savoring the sweet flavor before taking her rump in her mouth, leaving only her tail twitching in the air. She slurped it down like a long noodle, leaving her huge gut to descend to the ground. \"You were saying something?\" She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara couldn't believe what she had just seen. Silver Spoon, her best friend had just been eaten by a stupid blank flank. \"You give her back right now!\" She screamed. \"Or my Daddy will make sure you never see the light of day again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm scared of you anymore?\" Scootaloo laughed. \"Well I'm not!\" Her massive stomach began growing hotter and loud gurgling noises came out as the bulge there rapidly began shrinking. As it did Scootaloo started to grow as her meal was added to herself. By the time her stomach was smooth again Scootaloo had doubled in height, and in a flash of light a silver spoon appeared on each of her flanks. \"Huh, looks like I got my cutie mark after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara turned and ran, but with her longer legs Scootaloo quickly caught up with her. A hard shove sent her tumbling to the ground. A smirking pegasus stood over Diamond, a bit of drool hanging from her lips. \"Please, don't eat me! I'm sorry!\" She begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not. You've just saying that cause I'm bigger than you now,\" Scootaloo said. \"I wonder how you'll taste.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond righted herself and tried to run again, but Scootaloo stood on her tail. Letting it up cause Diamond to trip into a mud puddle which filled her mouth. Scoots leaned down and sucked up the pink earth pony's tail, dragging her off the road and into the bushes. Diamond tried to scream, but the dirt and mud in her mouth muffled the sounds. Scootaloo's next swallow took in her back legs and rump. She ran her tongue over Diamond's crotch, enjoying the taste for a minute before swallowing her stomach and chest. Her front legs beat against the lips holding her, but Scootaloo simply giggled as she sucked down the last of Diamond Tiara. Her signature head gear fell to the ground as Scootaloo felt her gut begin digesting its meal. As she reached seven feet tall she saw a tiara flash into being on her flanks, both marks now half the size they were on their previous owners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so awesome!\" Scootaloo shouted. A part of her wanted to feel bad for the two ponies she had just turned into food, but the sensation of growth overpowered everything else. \"I wonder if the others are growing yet. I should see, or maybe find more snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rubbing her sore nose, she saw she'd veered off her intended path and ended up in Whitetail Woods. \"Wow, I was really out of it,\" she giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" came a voice from her left. Turning she saw Apple Bloom standing behind some bushes, as tall as Scootaloo and with a big grin on her face. \"So ya ate Silver a Diamond huh?\" She asked, pointing to Scoot's flank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they were making fun of me, so I made them PART of me,\" the Pegasus laughed. Looking at Apple Bloom's flank she saw a pair of cutie marks; a snail and a pair of scissors. \"Spips and Snails huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, caught 'em lookin' for stuff in the woods and just gobbled 'em up,\" Bloom smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you see Sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm over here,\" the unicorn filly said as she walked into view. The other Crusaders looked up at their friend. Sweetie Belle was over fifteen feet tall, her horn running into branches with every step. A trio of different flowers adorned her flank. \"Guess who I ran into? The flower mares were all taking a nap in a clearing. I was quiet and just ate all three of them. They never even knew I was there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you guys think maybe we should stop this? Eating ponies is wrong isn't it?\" Scootaloo asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it just feels SO good when I grow,\" Sweetie replied. \"And besides, we finally have our cutie marks! But we can get even more, and be good at everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point Sweetie,\" Apple Bloom said. \"Come on Scoots, we got more cutie marks ta get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Scoots replied with a smile after thinking for a minute. \"So where to now?\"</span></div></div>",

Then when we're big enough we go into Ponyville.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Scoots smiled. The three massive fillies detoured around the edges of the town, keeping behind the gentle hills to stay out of sight. Soon the thick stands of trees and glimmering ponds of Ponyville Park came into view. Slowing to a careful walk, the Crusaders passed the outer ring of trees. Sweetie's horn snagged on several branches, and she used her magic to part them. Ears swiveled as voices came from up ahead. Near a pond two mares were swimming, both earth ponies. A picnic basket lay on the ground near the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScootaloo stalked behind a cluster of berry bushes until she was a few feet from the water. Tensing her wings, she leapt into the air, mouth wide open. Coming down on top of her prey, she swallowed the mare's head and neck instantly. Once again the incredible taste of a pony filled her mouth. Gulping again, she swallowed the struggling mare's chest and forelegs. She watched the other mare desperately swim for shore, only to be grabbed up by Apple Bloom. The red maned filly tossed the green coated mare up and simply let gravity force her down a hungry throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScoots gulped down the rest of her prey in seconds, sucking her wet tail down like a noodle. Paddling to shore, she lay beside Apple Bloom as their bellies digested their prey. Both fillies moaned as they grew, their height going up to twelve feet. \"We're almost as big as you Sweetie,\" the Pegasus said as a sliced lime flashed onto  her flank, while Apple Bloom now sported a trowel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, the fillies half crawled along until they came upon a half dozen ponies in one of the small clearings. A unicorn was tossing Frisbees with his magic to a pair of pegasi in the air, while three earth ponies were setting up a tent. \"We can't get them all at once,\" Scoots said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to move fast,\" Sweetie said. \"Scoots, you go after the pegasi. If one gets away that's ok, we  were gonna show ourselves soon anyway. Apple Bloom, you and me charge in from two sides and eat as many as we can. If more ponies show up and try to stop us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll just end up addin' to us,\" Bloom grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three fillies broke up, Scoots launching herself into the air at the flying ponies. The sight of the twelve foot filly stunned the two ponies long enough for her to slam into one with her wing, sending her tumbling to the ground while the other was enveloped by the filly's maw. Gulping rapidly, she swallowed her victim down in only a few moments. Before digestion could begin she hurled herself downwards towards where the other pegasus was struggling to her hooves. Opening her mouth as wide as she could, Scoots simply shoved the mare down her throat instantly. Moaning as two ponies struggled in her belly, she saw Sweetie gulp down the unicorn, her throat rippling as she hums in bliss. Apple Bloom had two ponies in hoof holds while the third vanished down her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother minute and the clearing was empty, the Crusaders bodies growing until they each stood at twenty feet tall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, we're huge!\" Scootaloo smiled. Her flank glimmered with her new cutie marks, the other fillies flanks likewise glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'd say we're big enough for a little trip into town,\" Sweetie grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Crusaders high hoofed, and then....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Look how big we are compared to everything else and I bet we can get a lot bigger if we have a few more snacks!\" Apple Sweetie exclaimed merrily as soon as the tiny citizens heard this,they began panicking,running back to their houses to hide behind locked doors or just running around in circles as one might expect terrified citizens to do during such times but with one quick swipe from her left hoof Scootaloo grabbed hold of the nearest one dangling him over her opening mouth with him panicking and squirming around like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No..no not me please!\" He begged frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but you look so tasty sooooo....\" As she dropped him straight into her mouth and swallowed instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who saw this panicked even further trying their best to hide,to plead for their lives not to be stomped or eaten but fortunately the now gigantic fillies had no interest whatsoever in stepping on anyone they were just incredibly famished and wanted to see how BIG they  could get with each meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh RUN! THEY'S ATTACKING OUR TOWN!!\" Another citizen cried as there was absolutely nothing anyone could do one by one the three massive ponies gulped,slurped and practically tossed down each and every single individual into their mouths sending gem a one way no return trip into their stomachs without a thought of hesitation until there was hardly anyone else in the entire town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well that was certainly fun don't you think?\" Bloom giggled. \"But oh my there's no one else around for miles and we still look the size as before!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You're right maybe if we find a couple more people,we can grow to a even bigger height than mere twenty feet!\" Scootaloo said thoughtfully as she prepared to trot away but before they could even set a single hoof on Th ground there was a burst of light and they all cried out in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...hey what's going on?\" As soon as the light cleared all three were amazed that they were now........</span></div></div>",

Scootaloo walked to the center of the park, where trees and carefully tended bushes and shrubs formed spots for picnics and romantic encounters. A unicorn stallion was setting up a picnic blanket with his magic, his back to her. Tensing her wings, Scootaloo shot from the bushes and slammed her prey into the ground. He yelped as the air was driven from his lungs. Before he could recover she swallowed his head, his horn scraping the roof of her mouth. Once again a surge of pleasure filled her mind as she gulped down his neck and chest. His kicking forelegs slid down easily, surprising Scoots with how strong her own legs were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly swallowed down the rest of the stallion, her stomach already preparing for digestion. She tossed the picnic basket in after him, seeing no sense in letting it go to waste. The familiar heat filled her as her stomach began shrinking and the mark of a puzzle appeared on her flank. She moaned as she grew to ten feet tall, a small puddle of juices pooling under her. \"Oh man, that was the best growth yet!\" She grinned.

One little peak can't hurt.\" Hopping over to the crate in the middle of the room, she carefully pried the top open. Inside the crate was packed with a glittering white powder. \"Looks like sugar.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugar!\" Pound Cake smiled, jumping on Pinkie's back before bouncing up and towards the crate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't,\" Pinkie grinned as she caught him. \"No diving into things that might be sugar. We could be wrecking somepony's cookie mix.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pinkie placed Pound on her back, Pumpkin stealthily levitated herself up and into the crate. \"Sugar!\" She giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Pinkie said as she raced over to grab the little unicorn, but as she did Pound took the opportunity to leap into the powder from her back. \"Double oh no!\" The foals sent up little clouds of powder as they played around, and Pumpkin's horn glowed as she tried to levitate herself again, but instead the powder glowed the same color and the crate exploded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the cloud of powder settled Pinkie saw the foals playing on a somehow clean floor. \"Where'd it all go?\" She wondered. \"You two all right?\" The foals giggled as they rolled around and Pinkie wiped her brow. \"Whew, you had me worried for a sec there. Oh no, what if whoever that was going to still wants it? I gotta tell Twilight! Don't you two move; I'll be right back!\" Pinkie raced upstairs to get the magical letter Twilight had given her for emergencies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pinkie left, Pound and Pumpkin started feeling strange. Their whole bodies were tingling, and their stomachs growled with sudden hunger. Pound flew up to a plate of cookies on the counter and started shoveling them into his mouth. Pumpkin phased through the glass and started working her way through the cakes and pastries within. Her mouth opened as wide as Pinkie's as she shoved a whole cake inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the whole front of the store was bare of anything edible. The foals lay back, their tummies bulging with their meals, but then the tingling feeling returned and they watched as the bulges shrank and their stomachs were back to normal. The tingling got stronger, and their bodies began to grow. Pound watched happily as his wings grew bigger, their feathers now those of a colt three times his age. Pumpkin felt her horn grow longer and her magic get stronger. Both of their diapers quickly tore apart and fell off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigger and bigger they grew, finally stopping at the size of full grown ponies. \"Biggah!\" They giggled together.  As they stood up their tummies rumbled again. Pound spotted a big of powder still on the sides of the crate and lunged for it. His jaws shattered the wood and the entire crate vanished down his throat. He smiled at being able to eat something he hadn't before. The tingling returned as the colt grew another two feet, but rear breaking the display case Pumpkin had been inside before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie came back down the stairs at that very moment. \"Ok, letter sent to Twilight, now I just have to AH!\" She shouted as her eyes found the two giant foals. \"You...you're bigger!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biggah!\" The two foals giggled together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungie,\" Pound said as they looked around for more to eat, and their eyes settled on....</span></div></div>",

But first we might want to do something about them,\" Pinkie said, pointing to the foals who were now munching on a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try,\" Twilight gritted her teeth and fired a massive pulse of magic from her horn which centered around Pound and Pumpkin's legs, immobilizing them. \"That won't hold them for long, come on!\" Twilight said, setting off at a full gallop with Pinkie bouncing along beside her. </span></div></div>",

Further down she could feel the straps of her bra digging the slightest bit into the flesh of her shoulders. \"Afraid not,\" she smiled sheepishly. As another inch was added to her height she suddenly realized that her vision, normally a bit blurry without her glasses, was crystal clear. \"But whatever's happening, it just fixed my eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more concerned with how big we're going to get than your eyes right now Silver Spoon!\" Diamond frowned. \"I don't wanna be a freak like that Sunset Shimmer turned into!\" Her shoulders started shaking as she pictured herself fifty feet tall, everyone running from her as she begged for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's not going to happen,\" Silver Spoon wrapped her arms around her friend. \"We're not changing into flame haired demons, and besides, I'm right here with you.

We should see if we can control this. Sunset could direct what her magic did, maybe we can too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll try.\" Closing her eyes, Diamond tried to feel whatever was inside her and making her grow. The tingling from before came back, and she felt it across her whole body. It felt like thousands of tiny soap bubbles were popping under her skin. She imagined them stopping along with  her growth. For a moment the popping sensation did stop, but almost instantly a pressure started building under her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked Diamond, you're not growing anymore,\" Silver smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it feels worse now. Hurts,\" Diamond gritted her teeth as the pressure built more and more, until it felt like her skin was going to pop. \"GAH!\" She cried as she stopped fighting it, and just like that the pressure was gone as her growth started again. \"I tried, but that's as much as I could fight it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least we know we CAN stop growing, even if not for very long. Now we just have to find a way to deal with what you felt, like directing the magic or whatever's inside us out without growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now both girls had grown three whole inches. Their pajamas were tightening ever faster, pressed against growing skin. Silver Spoon winced as her bra was pressed uncomfortably against her growing chest. Her calves were also pushing her pajama pants up her legs. Throwing the covers off, she adjusted her legs so they were straight out and watched them pass one crease after another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can't stop growing, we need to get out of the house,\" Diamond said. \"I'm NOT going to wreck my home because of this, even if I can never fit in it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good plan,\" Silver Spoon nodded. \"But if we keep growing this slowly we've got some time before we have to do that, and I want to keep trying to find a way to stop this.\" Another wince as her bra straps dug into her shoulders and back. \"But first I have to do one thing.\" Reaching with difficulty under her almost skin tight shirt. she undid the clasp of her bra. \"Ahhh,\" she sighed in relief as the stinging faded and her boobs bobbed as their support went away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiamond Tiara blushed as she watched her friend chuck her blue bra to the floor. Her own only barely pressed against her own chest, for now at least. By now both girls had gained a full six inches in height, and the growth seemed to be accelerating. \"Let's go to the backyard. Between the garden wall and the pool we'd have to get twenty feet tall or more before anyone could see us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, and we can keep trying to find ways of stopping this,\" Silver added. </span></div></div>",

The staff will have all went home, so we shouldn't run into anyone on the way there. We can slip out the sliding glass door in the kitchen and then it's a straight shot to the pool. Dad just had a privacy fence installed last week so no one will see us out there... hopefully.\"<br>\r\nSilver nodded in agreement at first, before her brow furrowed in concern as a sudden thought jumped to the forefront.\"What about your mom?  Doesn't she usually wake up early to work on her aerobics machines?\" she whispered back.<br>\r\nSpoiled Rich had recently started on a new health and exercise regimen to slim down after finding out that wouldn't be able to wear one of her new dresses. She of course threw a fit and began investing into buying the best exercise machines and dietary supplements money could buy. If only she knew that her only daughter was steadily increasing in size to the point where she may never be able to fit into anything again.<br>\r\nUpon hearing this Diamond Tiara (quietly) smacked her forehead in frustration. \"Oh geeze, I completely forgot about her. She obviously can't see me like this, so if it comes down to it we'll just have to avoid her. The longer we hang around here, the bigger we're going to get, so let's just go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSIlver, despite her reservations couldn't help but agree with that sentiment, so letting Diamond take the lead, the two tip-toed through the house making sure to make as little noise as possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
