A horrific monstrosity of neither reality nor nonexistence of such limitless unspeakable power that the very thought of this entity could drive entire planets into a madness that claimed it's life. It has existed since before time was conceived, and has ruled for nearly as long. It sustained itself with the negative emotions sentient creatures were famous for giving off: Greed, hate, fear, vanity, and most importantly, lust. It merely observed at first, until it discovered it could force such emotions from the frail bodies he observed; a ravenous hunger formed in it, a hole which couldn't be filled, but not from lack of trying. As it consumed whole systems of planets the other ancient beings commenced a last ditch attempt to seal it away, in another dimension. They were to lure it to a solar system without any life and banish it to the void. The fairest of them consented to be the tribute. It came, and immediately began to engorge itself on her. So fixed on such a prize as she, it lost all awareness around it, and the old races were given the chance to complete the ritual that sealed it in the gap between dimensions; but it came at a cost, for the maiden was trapped in the void with the beast for all eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wept for a very long time. their tears eventually brought life to the planet, and they disappeared into space. The planet is one most came to call earth, and after an eternity of feeding off the same soul, its prison was weakening. It's physical being was trapped inside the void, but it's consciousness could roam freely across the newly found civilization on the planet, predominantly a place called Suburbia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's mind probed the landscape for a possible victim.</span></div></div>",

The demon sensed numerous humans living in their large metropolises on the island. Each a worshipers of those damned gods. The demon saw the shrines dotting the island, accursed bright spots against the dark landscape and no different than a beacon to the demon. So, it flew towards the brightest light in the south. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA resplendent shrine greeted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon trembled at the sight of it. Not out of fear, but excitement at the idea that it could get back at those detestable gods even just a little bit. Human worshipers walked across its ground as they went along their way. They could neither see nor sense the demon outside of the shrine, which the demon laughed at their dull senses of humanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt flew towards the shrine, a wisp of dark air against the sky and crossed over the fence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiko in red hakama and white kosobe walked passed the demon, none aware of its presence. It browsed through the crowd of human worshipers, searching for the best candidate to possess. Only a high-ranking priestess or acolyte would do to strip this place of the goddess's remaining power. If it corrupted them beyond redemption, then the powers of this shrine would cease to be and the demon would move on to another shrine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the demon headed to the inner shrine, just in time to witness the procession of miko heading into the heart of the shrine. It quietly followed after them, slipping inside as the prayer began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head priestess was a beautiful young woman with golden eyes and long, silky black hair. She was a flower in the prime of her life with a pair of large breast protruding underneath her uniform. The younger acolytes with her were just as beautiful, each possessing their own charms that tempted male desire just by looking at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon contemplated who to possess. </span></div></div>",

This ball of light is quietly landing in a clearing amongst the tall trees of the area, and as it lands, the lights on this object suddenly shut off, and it becomes undetectable when it finally lands. Part of the now dark objects hull opens up, and out comes a puff of smoke. Then a small, dimly luminescent creature emerges from the spacecraft and begins to fly around. This luminescent creature was not bright and it would have been easily mistaken for a firefly or lightning bug if a human had seen it. This creature was extremely intelligent, and made of pure energy. It had the ability to possess nearly any living or non-living thing thing on Earth other than humans, and it could modify those things, as it deemed fit.

Alas, all she cared about was sex and dominating others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked around the lovely backyard, Alex muttered, \u201cHuh\u2026 Well, it looks nice, I\u2019ll give it that. I doubt I\u2019ll do more than mow the grass\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should really plant some seeds, if you know what I mean, sweetie!\u201d A woman\u2019s voice said.

They snaked into Alex's clothes through his sleeves. As the vines wrapped around his arms, legs, and body, the rose cooed \u201cIt\u2019s going to end well for me. I\u2019m gonna pop your cherry and you\u2019ll get to seed your lawn\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rose then chuckled before she added, \u201cbut not many seed their lawn with semen, do they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a psy-CHO!\u201d Alex uttered before he felt the tips of two vines caress his dick. The other two rubbed his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaughty, naughty! Use that mouth for constructive purposes\u2026\u201d The rose cooed. As another vine appeared. This one had a sunflower at the end, and it had what appeared to be a woman\u2019s vagina. It moved near Alex's mouth and began to drip with some unknown fluid began to drip from it. From what he could smell, it was somehow arousing, letting him realize that if any went into his mouth, he might become horny enough to do whatever the flower wanted. From the corner of his eye, Alex saw another sunflower vine appear, but that one also sneaked into his pants. The rose pouted before it said, \u201cYou\u2019re a real meanie! Guess you need some kisses!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vines rubbing his chest and legs then sprouted some roses with mouths. As expected, they all began kissing Alex's body.

The panties bounced her cheeks beneath her skirt before she felt a hand slap her ass with an audible 'smack!'. Lauren grabbed her ass in response. \"Calm down will you!?\" she whispered. \"Not until you start enjoying yourself.\" The spirit whispered behind her ear, as the panties slowly began to rub her clit. Lauren bit her lip and sighed. She was surprised at how sensitive her pussy was. \"Alright alright,\" Lauren whispered, \"just give me minute..nngh..to process this.\" The underwear relented, and that's when she noticed Lizzie down the hallway, mixing drinks in the kitchen. She realised she would know the most about the book, and began to walk toward her. <br>\r\nThen, a thought occurred to her. \"Did you say I had powers while wearing you?\" <br>\r\n\"Oh yes, you can manipulate objects with my energy.\" <br>\r\n\"How?\" <br>\r\n\"Just try.\"<br>\r\nLauren looked around, then spotted a blonde girl in a black skirt with her back turned to her, leaning against a wall watching some other girls dance. Lauren felt a tingling between her legs. She arched an eyebrow, and the back of the blonde's skirt flipped up, revealing her bare ass. She quickly let it down before too many people took notice, while the girl looked back for a minute, but saw nothing. <br>\r\nThe spirit chuckled and whispered in her ear, \"Aren't you a kinky one.\" Lauren smirked an continued toward Lizzie, realizing this night just got a lot more interesting. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Leaf, you're about 2 inch tall with white hair and slightly pointed ear.  You live on your own outside the village and you're known to go farther outside the forest than other fairies. Leaf is a strange fairy to begin with since his body is able to restore itself without fail, can become semi-transparent, and is fluent in the human language. Leaf was on one of his trips to the edge of the forest, but a group of young women caught his attention. There were 5 women that were walking towards the old schoolhouse. They appeared to be high school seniors around 19 years old. Leaf saw they were wearing the same uniform, so he figured they were from the same school. Their uniform consisted of a white buttoned up blouse, a checkered plaid skirt, a short-sleeve black over-jacket, and knee length socks. Leaf zoomed into the leaves of a nearby tree and listened to their conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cassandra, where is the old school building you were taking about?\" asked a red-haired woman towards the blonde woman leading them.<br>\r\n\"We're almost there, Amelia.\" Replied Cassandra <br>\r\n\"Why did we have come when its almost dark?\" asked a black-haired woman <br>\r\n\"Supposedly If a group enters the old school house near dusk, a small light can be seen flying through the halls, Susan.\" said Cassandra<br>\r\n\"What so great about a flying light.\" Said a Asian looking woman<br>\r\n\"I heard it suppose to grant love towards couples. It can help with your relationships Liliana\" said another blonde haired woman<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Arthur! snapped Liliana <br>\r\n\"My name is Arteria, you jackass.\" Arteria snapped back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued towards the school house as Leaf listened closely. Leaf snorted at what Cassandra said because that so-called light, was actually a just a light-bug that some fairies ride and the love granting part is just a powder fairies make to cause a animal to go into heat. Leaf decided to follow the group since he was interested in them. Leaf turned semi-transparent and flew close to the ground toward the unaware women. Leaf slipped between them, to get a closer look at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassandra is a blonde, with light blue eyes, g-cup size breast that were straining against her uniform and a good size butt. <br>\r\nAmelia is a redhead with sea-green eyes, a hourglass figure that was perfectly balanced for her size. <br>\r\nSusan has black hair with purple highlights, dark eyes, medium size breasts and a large butt. <br>\r\nLiliana was of Asian descent with slim arms and legs, dark hair and eyes, a good size butt, and small breasts.<br>\r\nArteria had green eyes, her blonde hair was tied in a braid, with toned arms and legs, with her breast slightly smaller than Cassandra's and a small butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Leaf had finished memorizing them, he flew on ahead of them, towards the old schoolhouse. Leaf arrived 10 minutes ahead of them and he quickly flew towards the old lock. He shoved his tiny arms into lock, and with a small click the door was unlocked. Leaf pulled away and turned transparent as the group appeared. Cassandra pointed out the building and puffed out her enormous chest, which told Leaf that the others probably didn't believe her before. Leaf flew closer as Cassandra gave the door handle a few twist, before she opened it to let them in. Leaf flew in above them, as they entered and shut the door behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree of them got out flashlights that lit up some of the dusty hallway. Leaf stayed above them as he listened in. <br>\r\n\"So, Cassandra where is this floating light you were talking about?\" asked Liliana <br>\r\n\"I don't know right now, but it should see it if we looked. Maybe we should split up and search each level.\" said Cassandra <br>\r\n\"Maybe, but I think we should stay together.\" Said Susan <br>\r\n\"Please, there's nothing here but us. Are you afraid Susan?\" sneered Liliana <br>\r\n\"No I'm NOT.\" said Susan <br>\r\n\"Fine, how about Me and Susan check this floor, Liliana can check the second floor, Arteria and Amelia can check the third floor.\" mediated Cassandra<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" All of them said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf laughed at them and he quickly flew to the second floor to wait. Soon, Leaf hears them making their way up the stairs as Liliana separated from them and started exploring around. Leaf followed Liliana as she trekked deeper into the second floor and Leaf smiled as she went into a isolated classroom. Liliana entered the old classroom and Leaf followed her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf used some of his magic to quiet close the door while her back was turned, then he flew closer before he fried the light bulb with magic. The room was plunged into darkness as Liliana swore and tried to turn the flashlight back on. Leaf soundproofed the room with magic, then turned towards his target. Leaf could see in the dark as he flew between her legs and without waiting, rammed his body into her crotch. Liliana cursed and stumbled back, tripping on some rubble and landing on her back. Leaf used magic to possess some of rubble and pinned Liliana by her wrist and ankle. Liliana started to swore more but Leaf didn't listen as he landed between her legs and stood in front of her panty cover crotch. Leaf pulled her panties off and he gazed at her love tunnel. Leaf grabbed some powder and threw it into her pussy. Liliana's swearing stopped and was being replaced with moaning as her pussy started leaking cum. Leaf leaped into the air and flew to Liliana's chest. Liliana felt Leaf land on her chest and tried to look at him, but it was too dark. Leaf unbuttoned one of Liliana's buttons and crawled into her shirt. Her breast were covered with a lacy black bra that rose and dipped with each breath. Leaf crawled under her right bra cup, with her soft breast molding under Leaf as he crawled towards her nipple. It stood completely erect as Leaf reached it and started playing with the erect nipple. Liliana moaned as Leaf played with her and soon Leaf heard a wet SPLAT. He stopped and crawled out of Liliana's shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiliana's face was a moaning mess as she was still in heat till Leaf let her off. Leaf flew down and stood in a puddle before her drenched womanhood. Leaf grinned and plunged into her love tunnel. It was extremely hot and filled with her cum as Leaf pulled himself deeper into Liliana until he ran into her g-spot to which he clamped down on and started attacking it with extreme vigor. Liliana instantly reacted with her walls clamping down on Leaf and river of cum started flowing out till a world shaking earthquake happened with a tsunami following close behind it. Leaf was washed out onto the floor, satisfied with the experience and took pity on Liliana. He threw a different powder from his bag at Liliana's womanhood and soon she was able to sleep. Leaf released her, cleaned her up, and left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf debated what to do next.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leaf flew down stairs towards the next two girls (victims). Before he went to look for them, Leaf flew towards the front door and used magic to lock the entrance. Satisfied that they can't escape, Leaf listened for their voices and he heard them walking around near the old cafeteria. He found them as they entered the cafeteria's kitchen and started looking about for something. Cassandra had the flashlight, while Susan followed behind her as they started moving old pots and pans. Leaf quietly flew towards a large pot on one of the lower shelves. Leaf hovered behind the pot and then gave a it a spinning kick that echoed with a loud CLANG. Cassandra and Susan jumped and whirled towards the pot, Leaf turned transparent and flew in front of pot. Cassandra cautiously approached the pot and crouched down to look inside the pot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf dropped down to the floor as Cassandra peered into the pot above him. Leaf stood between Cassandra's legs, looking up at her red lacy panties that he could reach out and touch. Leaf jumped up and grabbed the lip of Cassandra's panties, then pulled himself into her panties. Cassandra was too focused on the pot to notice Leaf's intrusion and sighed in relief at seeing nothing. Leaf laid down in front of her sex as he felt her stand and say, \"Nothing's in there, I guess something must have dropped on it.\" Cassandra started walking again as Leaf swayed in the hammock of her panties, while thinking about what to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaf pulled out his bag that he always had on him and looked to see what he has inside. Inside was the aphrodisiac powder, sleep powder, a small blow dart gun and 10 darts, a bag full of seeds, and his notebook. Leaf skimmed through his notebook till he saw some notes on plant manipulation and Leaf got a idea. Leaf grabbed a seed and dropped it into Cassandra's panties. Leaf mumbled a chant and the seed started growing into the panties. Leaf had the seed's roots start to spread out until it cover the entire inside of the panties and then MERGE with Cassandra's panties. Soon the panties were under Leaf's control as he pulled himself out of her panties, turn transparent, then fly up towards her humongous rack. Cassandra's boobs swayed with each step and Leaf landed softly on her soft boobs, then he gave one of the buttons a hard kick. The already strained button snapped off and shot into the air like a stray bullet. \"Damn it, why now.\" boomed Cassandra's voice and Leaf dived into the gap to the fleshy canyon contained inside. Cassandra didn't notice as Leaf planted another seed on her bra and like the panties, the seed grew and merged into the bra. Leaf dived out and started planting seed on Cassandra's uniform. Eventually the unaware Cassandra was now wearing living plants for her clothes that Leaf could now possess, but he was patient and turn towards Susan. </span></div></div>",
