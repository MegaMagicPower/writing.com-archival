            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hello, I'm Jack and I have to say thank god for gyms. I have to work in an office cubical and deal with the world's worst boss! She yells at me for THEE dumbest things ever, her coffee is too hot or cold. She breaks her seat and switches it with mine. When I put food in the fridge, she takes a bit out of it, and if I order food, she makes me pay extra for it and she gets some of it. The job itself is super easy,being the IT guy. It's just the boss that makes it suck. If gyms weren't around... I'm not sure if my boss would still be alive. Each day after work I HAVE to go to the gym or I will be stressed through out the day. Since my boss started to pick on me I have been going to the gym, and before hand I benched 150 lbs. Now I bench 220 lbs after three months, that's how hard I workout to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday though has to be the worst thing she has done yet. I park my car far away from the building so she doesn't find out what kind of car I drive. Some how she found out what kind of car I drive and got it towed. That was thirty minutes into the day. Her coffee was \"too cold\" and to prove it she duped it on me, which it was actually super hot. Once I got to my seat, it fell apart out from under me with a note saying \"Chair broke I'm taking yours\". My lunch was replaced with a note \"I don't like lettuce on my tuna sandwiches\". And when it came to showing my power point to improve the buildings Internet connection, and couldn't stop laughing at how much of a mess I was. When it came to leaving I had to take bus (to the other side of town where it was towed) and pick it up paying a $500 fine. Once I got back into my car another note that just had a smily face on it. If I could find another job I would, this is the only job that would take right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending 3 hours working off the stress I went home. I couldn't wait to take a shower and just go to sleep. After today I just need to sleep and try and forget today, though tomorrow she'll try and top herself. After returning back to my apartment I just walked straight into the shower and enjoyed some cold water on myself for 10 minutes. I went straight to the bedroom to lay down and go to sleep. As I laid my head on the pillow I heard something shifting. I looked up and tried to find where the noise was coming from. Though I didn't see where it came from. Then a thought came to me, check under the bed. Taking a glance under the bed I can see this small little woman walking under my bed!</span></div></div>",

I was your boss, Miranda, and when you had been taken a shower, I had arrived at your house to give you a promotion in order to apologize for all the douche activities I had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to give you a promotion as an apology. But now it looks like I'm at your mercy.\" I said. I was wearing my work out fit still, a brilliant black outfit, showing off my double d-cup breasts, and a pair of black slacks, down to a pair of open-toe platform heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked out, and you picked up my body, and I marveled at your barely dressed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never noticed you were..this handsome Jack.\" I said, beginning to blush. Even though I was six years older than you, I was blushing like a teenage girl who was drunk.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My mind was running a blank. This had to be a dream. There is NO WAY this could be real. My whole body tensed once I realized who she was. Let alone what I could do to her. She seemed to be talking but I her words feel deft to me. I was in denial that this was real. It couldn't be real, but I could FEEL her weight in my hands. My mind was trying to figure out if this was real or not. Taking in a few deep breaths trying to calm down, or wake up. Since I wasn't waking up I guess this was real... but it couldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way this is real,\" is all I could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda just sat there in my hands laughing a bit, \"I was doubting it myself, until you picked me up.\" The nervousness in her voice was so easy to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind tried to make sense of all this bit it was too tired to think of anything. \"Miranda...\" Then a thought hit me, she has been the world's biggest dick since day one of the job, why the hell should I give her any mercy? Her life laid in my hands, I should make her pay! But then why should I go to her level? Hell I  didn't even know if this was real. Looking around and finding a small shoe box, I just put her in it. \"Stay here and we'll see what we can do about this tomorrow.\" Only thing I could think of since all of this seemed so weird. After a good night sleep I should be able to see if this is a dream or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda nodded as she was put into the shoe box. Though she did ask for a blanket and a pillow. I did an inside sigh and got her two rags, one for a blanket and another for a pillow. She thanked me, and I just fell back on my bed and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarm goes off jolting me awake. I look over and see its 5:45 in the morning. I just lay there trying to remember what made me so confused last night, when I hear a small voice yell, \"Turn that thing off!!!\" Oh that's right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo my boss was shrunk. And at the mercy of me, the guy she tormented for 3 months. The dark and twisted thoughts that came to mind. But then another thought came to mind. Why should I treat her like she treated me? Though the my want for revenge was strong, my kindness was stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned my alarm off and poked my boss's tiny form to wake her up. When she awoke... she forgot what happen yesterday and screamed her head off. This made me laugh a little. </span></div></div>",

I'm fine with whatever decision you make, I deserve some pain for all of which I put you through.\" I said. \"Also, the only reason I was so mean to you, was because I was the youngest in my family, I always had to do the most chores, I felt like my family never loved me. So when I actually got power in the business, I guess I let it go to my thick head. If I ever return to normal size, I'll make sure to give you a promotion and a $1000 dollar raise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had taken my high heels off, but put them back on quite quick.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So she just wanted to come over and give me an apology and a promotion? I defiantly need the month, with a gym membership and just enough money to buy a small little \"energy\" bars for meals, a raise would be really nice. But where could I take her? If I took her to a doctor or hospital they would rather dissect her, then help her. Oh what to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think there's a way to turn you back Miranda\" I said, feeling kinda weird calling my \"evil\" boss by her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just finished combing her hair and said, \"There has to be. Just take me to a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just shook my head. \"That wouldn't be a good idea. Do you have any idea how famous you would make them. The discovery of a life time, a person who has shrunk to six inches.\" That last part I made it sound like a sideshow attraction. And before she said anything I cut her off, \"Trying to brib them is like trying to brib a gold miner from the gold mine where it is load with riches, far more then any brib would go.\" Miranda got the idea sadly. Her head went down and I could hear her starting to cry. You can only guess what I did next. Me, being the giant softy I am, picked her and and gently hugged her into my gut, rubbing the back of her head letting her calm down. She cried for a couple of minutes, but she was able to pull herself together and sit back down in my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. For that.\" I just smiled and nodded at her. \"But why do you care so much about me? I have gone out of my way to make your life hell at work. Don't you want some form of payback?\" When she said that a giant smile grew on my face, and she was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I won't get some payback?\" I took the other hand that she wasn't sitting on and I ran my fingers over her stomach and sides. The moment I started to tIckle her, Miranda was laughing uncontrollable. Minute after minute I don't stop giving her \"payback\". Though as I continuless tickled her I could hear her say something, like \"Stop it\", or \"This is worst then what I imagined\" something along those line. I didn't stop until I saw the time, 6:13. I was going to be late. I stopped tickling my tiny boss and started to get ready for another day at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... are you... doing?\" Miranda panted trying to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting ready for work. That little \"joke\" you did yesterday cost me a weeks worth of food shopping. Even if I wanted to stay home, I can't afford it.\" I took one of the few suits I owned and went into the bathroom. There was no way I would get changed in from of my boss, tiny or not. Once I stepped out Miranda looked really confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I suppose to do all day? Stay here and wait for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first thought was yes, until I remembered that she is barely six inches tall. There is no way she could stay by herself without someone else to help her. \"I guess your coming with me.\" Miranda tried to argue, but with one hand she was quickly put into my shirt pocket and off I went.</span></div></div>",

I thought I should give it to you since I may have to stay with you now.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried to give it to you, and as you took it between two fingers, a blue flash happened and it was a normal sized paper check, with all the writing still on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

When the check turned back to normal size, I think my jaw was stuck like that for a while. How the hell did that just happen?!?! She just handed me a piece of paper as small as my pinky's fingernail, and now it's a check, for $70,000,000,000! My head was starting to hurt for trying to make any sence of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath in, I decide to think about what I understand.<br>\r\n1. My boss shrunk<br>\r\n2. She just gave me a check $70,000,000,000<br>\r\n3. The check regrew back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what might happen if I take this?<br>\r\n1. I'm going to be super rich<br>\r\n2. Since my boss disappeared along with all her money people might get suspicion. And I might get arrested. If I show them tiny Miranda then I might get charged with kidnapping and she would get dissected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough holding a check for $70,000,000,000 felt so good and exstreamly tempting I couldn't. Too many risks would come if I take all that money. So doing something I would never think I would do, I tore up the check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!?!?!\" Miranda scream at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another deep breath I said, \"First off your six inches tall. You won't be making any public appearances for a while. And with me taking all the money you own and putting it into my bank account would make me look super suspicion. And if they do find you tiny, I would be framed for kidnapping while you get studied as some science project. A lose lose situation.\" Miranda was speechless at first but got the idea. \"But I do want to ask you something after work.\" Miranda just nodded and off to work we went, though not in my car though. Miranda gave me the keys to her car and they also grew back to normal. And I must say driving in a 2012 mustang felt so good, I think I might of gone over the speed limit a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we got to work I handed Miranda her car keys and they shrank back down into her size. What ever was effecting her had to be something like magic. Because no disease could shrink a person along with their belongs. This would make things much harder if we try and explain things to the media.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sure thing boss,\" I said putting her back in my shirt pocket. As I walked to her office I realized something. My boss has zero power over me. Sure I might still work for her, but right now she can't make me do anything. Sure I won't torment her and make her a slave, but at least I can say no and put her in time out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I opened up the door to her office I put Miranda down on her desk. I opened her laptop and told her to stay on the keyboard just in case anyone came in. First thing she said was, \"What are you waiting for? Start cleaning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure lets start with these cabinets.\" I start to open one up when she yelled not that one. Once open I couldn't believe my eyes. She had not one, not two, but five porn magazines. Her face went dark red, and she was yelling at me. Saying I was fired unless I put them back, how I was a dead man, etc. On my part I couldn't stop laughing as I put them back. \"You didn't even lock it?\" I chuckled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!!!!!\" She screamed at me, making me laugh twice as hard. All I did was sweep up the floor, wipe down the shelves and desk. Once I finished I sat down in her chair. \"Excuse me. That's my chair,\" Miranda said putting her hand on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll it's not like its being used right now,\" I countered with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets not forget who's the boss here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat up and put my head above hers, \"Yes let's not forget who is half a foot tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked stunned for a moment until she said, \"Who signs the pay checks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And lets not forget...\" Before I finished someone was coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Ms. Miranda?\" It was Katy from accounting. Katy had the curves and the shape to be a model, but she didn't have the money to try and full fill her dream. Since she is really good with money and keeping count and track of all of the money and knew what to invest in to keep the money coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Katy.\" I said slowly standing up and quickly putting Miranda in my pocket again. Katy was always jealous of of Miranda because of the pranks she pulled on her. Lets just say she may not be a model, but her \"pictures\" from the staff party sure got her a lot of fans. A drunk Katy doesn't like clothes and Miranda took pictures and posted them all over the Internet. Since Katy was drunk, Miranda got her to sign a paper saying the pictures were allowed to be taken and put on the Internet. If Katy found out Miranda was half a foot tall, she would pay her back a hundred times worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Jack, where's Miranda? And why are you in her seat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She called me earlier telling me to clean her office.\" Katy was now walking up to where I was sitting. Swing her hips from side to side like she wanted something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty now right in front of me, bent down giving me a grand view of her cleavage. \"So she gave you the rights to her office?\" Katy was now starting to talk all sexual, when ever she did this she wanted something, something really bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took deep breath refusing her to try and use her sexual charm on me, I asked her \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you make me sound like I just do this for something.\" Katy pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I know you. You do this when ever you want something. What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty's little show was now over as she stood back up. \"Your no fun. Anyway would you mind if I go thru her drawers, or her computer history?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder normal situation I would just show Katy everything. But since Miranda was in my pocket, \"No can do. She didn't giver the keys to her desk, and I don't know her password.\" Katy just frowned and left the room, still swing her hips hoping to get you to change your mind. \"Answer is still no.\" I said before she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then put Miranda back on her laptop and I let out a large sign. Usually Katy would of keep trying until she got what she wanted.</span></div></div>",

Want to make up for it.\" Miranda said looking very annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's a wise idea Miranda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I'm want to make up for all the horrible things I've done. Even if she torments me, it's what I get.\" Miranda was going to be stubborn. I had to think of a way to let Katy get her payback at Miranda, without Miranda getting killed, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a thought hit me, \"Why not just call Katy back here and let her go through your stuff?\" Miranda shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will take me to Katy now or your fired. Understand?\" Miranda was being serious. And I did the only thing I know I could do. I put Miranda in he desk drawer as I got Katy. Miranda might, oh who am I kidding, will be angry but, she might survive if I do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found Katy at her cubical. \"Katy I found out Miranda's password.\" Enough said to get Katy to follow me. As we walked back into Miranda's office we both could hear Miranda shelf being pounded on. Difference I knew who was making that sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is making that sound?\" Katy asked as she walked towards the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to act fast. \"Katy I have a question for you.\" Katy just looked at me, curiously. \"If you could get payback at Miranda, what would you do? Or rather...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty cut me off at that point, \"Oh I would make her pay! I would make the whole world know of the bitch she is.\" The pounding in the desk stopped. \"I would love to see that perfect little life of hers come crashing down on her. For all the bullshit she put me through, oh there is enough ways to torment the way I want to.\" This is what I was afraid of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katy I know what she did was bad beyond any anyone could do, but wouldn't you give her a little mercy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends, why are you curious?\" Katy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Miranda wants to make it up to you. She wants to let you have some payback, though the type of payback your talking about seems a bit illegal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Miranda, our boss, wants me to give her some payback? Is this a joke?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked Katy straight in the eyes and said, \"Nope, but think of it like this. What would you rather have, your dream job at modeling or revenge that might get you fired, at least?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty paused and sat on Miranda's desk thinking this over. Dream job, or revenge. Katy bit her lip and said, \"Dream job.\" This made me smile, until she said, \"With a little bit of revenge. There is no way I'm letting her go with just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was propably the safest deal you could get for Miranda. \"Alright, let me get her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty was confused. \"Didn't you say she wasn't here, and that you found her password?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lied about the password and Miranda is here.

Before she said anything I said, \"No.\" I knew Katy enough to know what her first thought was. \"I don't want revenge on Miranda cause then I would be just as bad as her.\" Katy looked at me like I was crazy. \"And besides, she is welling to pay for your modeling career.\" This made Katy think for a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Jack, I won't be that harsh for my revenge, but I still want it.\" Miranda nodded agreeing this would be a good idea, when I wasn't going to leave. Sure Katy said she wouldn't be as harsh, but I still didn't trust her with Miranda's safety. \"Now who has a camera?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw the laptop had a built in camera. I asked Miranda for her password and soon Katy had Miranda in her hand with the camera recording a video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Miranda please say hello to all your future fans.\" Katy toyed with Miranda. \"Now lets see this little whore strip.\" Miranda then slowly and took of her jacket and tossed it on the ground. It didn't grow back to normal size, which I found that weird. Going back to Miranda and Katy, Miranda was now no longer wearing a shirt and is now taking off her skirt. Watching the skirt come off and to see the black laced panties under neath that surprised me. Then with her shirt coming off to show the matching bra that made me to into all. In the background I can hear Katy talking dirty to Miranda. With the look on Miranda's face, with how miserable it looked. I wanted to knock Katy out because of this, though Miranda looked back and say me, and shook her head in a no matter. Telling me it was okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty put Miranda down and then took of her own pants and shirt. Katy was wearing a red net bra and and panties. Katy then picked Miranda up and put her in between her breast, saying something like \"I used to envy your breast, now you can be crushed by mine.\" With the amount of force Katy was using Miranda looked like she was in pain. This is where I stepped in. I turned off the recording and pulled Miranda out of Katy's breast. Katy was about to say something until she say my face. She just sent the video to herself, and said, \"for the modeling bill, it'll cost at least $500,000.\" Katy finished getting dressed and walked out leaving Miranda and me alone.</span></div></div>",

I bent down and picked up her shirt, skirt, and jacket. I put her back on the desk and gave her back her clothes. Miranda was confused. \"Don't you want revenge on me?\" This made me laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down at my tiny boss, \"Okay, what do I want for my payback?\" I looked down at her see that she still isn't dressed. \"First, get dressed. I don't want my boss getting sick.\" She stared at me confused, but did what I said. I looked away, giving her some privacy. She yelled up for me once she was done. I turned around to see her standing there waiting for my next \"command\". \"Second thing I want is the keys to your house. No point in us staying in my tiny apartment.\" She looked up at me shocked, but agreed. She tossed her keys to be and I caught them as they inlarged. As for my last part of my revenge, I picked Miranda up and tickled her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is far worst then Katy's punishment!\" Miranda laughed uncontrollably. I didn't want to torment her at all. In fact after Katy's little payback, I didn't want to see Miranda in pain again. After a good five minutes I stopped tickling her and let her rest on her desk. I looked down at her panting body and smiled. It sounds weird but I like her like this. She was so an attractive woman fully grown and with her being six inches, I some how made her the hottest woman I have ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Miranda finally caught her breath I said, \"Lets go home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, don't we still have seven hours left in the work day?\" Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but you have to write Katy her check and I have to move my stuff into your house.\" Miranda looked at me and just shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but don't think this doesn't go onto your sick time.\"  Miranda joked. What she just joked? I guess there is a first time for everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI countered by saying, \"But taking care of you in your tiny form is now part of my job. In fact I might a little raise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope your lucky I'm letting you move into my house and drive my car.\" I laughed at this. Miranda just shook her head again. She pulled out her check book and gave it to me. I walked out of the room with Miranda in my shirt pocket and gave Katy her check. When I returned back to my appartment I called a friend of mine to pick up my crappy car to Miranda's house. I put all the food in a plastic bag, and everything else. Basically a toothbrush, deodorant, the five suits I owned, and the little bit of tooth paste I had left. Everything else wasn't mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling the owner of the appartment complex I was moving out and paid the rest of my rent. After that I got into Miranda's car and headed to her home.</span></div></div>",

I'm sixteen years old, 5 ft 6 inches, and I don't mean to brag but I have a killer body, that I can finally show off a little at my friends beach house. My friend Lisa owns a beach house in Miami and she and her family let me come with. I brought everything I needed. Six different bathing suits, a couple of towels. Some tanning lotion all the good stuff. After a hour or so flight and drive we were there! Me and Lisa went straight to the room to unpack and hit the beach. Lisa and I are BFFs nothing gets between our friendship. Lisa has a killer body just like mine. We both have stunning D cups and thee greatest waist line ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we're all packed Lisa and I just start walking the beach trying to find a good place to tan, or hit on guys, either or. We just sit there and relax, watching some of the hunks and cuties walk by staring at our natural beauty. Some of the guys invited us to play volleyball with them. We played for with them for a while. Then we went to the food court and got some milkshakes and a burger. Then it started to get dark out side. Me and Lisa both went back to the beach house and fell straight to sleep. This was just day one of our week in paradise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wakes me up telling me she's going to take a shower then we'll be off for day two. As she was in the shower I was looking for my flipflops. I might of tossed them under the bed. As I looked under the bed I see this little actio figure standing on one of my flipflops. I pulled my flipflops out along with the action figure, to find out it wasn't an action figure but a guy. A really tiny guy!</span></div></div>",

He was defiantly in shape, with a six pack abs, a well tuned chest and those arms maybe small but they were still nothing to laugh at. Though he maybe three inches tall he defiantly was good looking. Nice blind hair and I'm sure his eyes were nice too if he didn't have them closed in fear. But what to do with him? I'm not the kind if person to enslave another, but at the same time I don't want to just ditch him here to be someone else slave or worst. All of a sudden I heard the shower turn off. I looked at the little guy again and knew Lisa could help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa came out she was wearing a light blue two piece bikini, showing off all her goods in the best way possible. When Lisa came out she saw the little guy in my hand. \"Huh Jen what are you holding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's a tiny guy. Though I don't know his name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI passed the little guy into Lisa's hands and he started to shiver nonstop. Lisa then started to pet his back and said, \"Shhhh it's okay. We won't hurt you. Your save.\" After a minute or two he stopped shivering and sat up looking at us both. \"There you go, much better.\" Lisa said with a smile. This tiny guy the started to smile and not I could see his eyes. A nice deep dark blue, oh if only he was normal sized I would date him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now my turn to talk to him, \"You okay?\" He just nodded he's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then looked at me, \"What should we do with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't leave him, I don't want to think of something horrible happening to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't we take care of him?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking that, but not like a slave. That would be worst then ditching him here.\" I then began to pet his back, \"And I think he's cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa giggled and also started to pet the little guy.</span></div></div>",

Lisa was petting his head try to make him feel better, while I rubbed his back. This guy was breaking our hearts, and I was going to help him out no matter what. But the real question is what would be the best thin to do for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and I let him down on the bed after a minute of the hug. I looked at him and asked, \"You hungry?\" His stomach answered for him growling really loud. \"Don't worry we'll bring you some breakfast.\" I smiled down at him. Lisa and I then walked out of the room, but we just stood there in front of the door for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was the first to talk, \"We have to help him.\" I nodded, there was no way I wasn't going to help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what should we do?  If we return him back to his family they might just sell him for their needs, or worst.\" Lisa agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he should just stay with us. I don't want to force him to come with us, but I don't think there's another way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when I remembered, \"Lets not forget, we're on vacation. Even if we wanted to find them, i dont think we could track them down in time. Plus he would have to stay with one of us at all times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa agreed, \"Alright, lets just get some breakfast and ask him for his thoughts. He might also give us some thought we would never think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI agreed with her. As we now walked to breakfast I decide to make a little joke. \"Did you see his face when we hugged him like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god he went so red, he was super adorible!\" Lisa giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anything else we can at least say we brought a cute just home with us.\" I teased.
