These are the words that my father passed to me, as I now pass to you. Little did I know the importance of these words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the real world monsters are myth. They don't exist. <br>\r\nThe only monsters that you would see are in horror movies or in cheesy romance stories where werewolfs can't seem to keep their shirts on. Everything is all hunky-dory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow lets talk about my world, the world that I never wanted to know about. The world that changed me. In this world, monsters DO exist, the things that go bump in the night are beings that we thought only existed in our dreams and the \"Real\" world is none the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're in my world. The world that humanity thought had died long ago and had been turned into old wives tales.<br>\r\nWhat you decide to do with this knowledge is up to you, but as you read my journal, know this. Humanity has, for over 300 years, lived alongside these creatures. whether they know it or not. Not every one of these beings wish to harm humans. I found this out the hard way, I had befriended one of their kind and now the order has issued my death warrant. Time has betrayed me and soon I will be gone. Another \"Martyr for the cause. A hero that died fighting God's mistakes\". Those words are poison on my tongue now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leave this journal to whatever poor sap finds it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthew Thompson~ <br>\r\nDecember 29th 2013<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found this book two years ago....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought it was the writings of a madman. A dusty old book in a box, left out next to a yard-sale sign.<br>\r\nBut after reading it, I began to notice things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've had the strangest feeling that I'm being watched for almost a week now and it's maddening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've even caught myself \"Scanning the room\". thinking that I may find something that would prove that I wasn't crazy<br>\r\nbut all in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've read and re-read that journal. There was that entry from the author, Matthew Thompson, <br>\r\nthen there were other parts that I couldn't make out but something is telling me that there's more to it.<br>\r\nWas I mad for believing some of the stuff in that book? or was I mad for ignoring it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething tells me I'm about to find out real soon....<br>\r\nSomeone -or something- was knocking at my door, and people don't normally<br>\r\ncome to visit me, let alone at 3:00 A.M.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, as per the usual interactive, I have to ask...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon the lock was turned, a force far greater than you ever expected busted through the door, and slamming it shut as quickly as it opened. The impact had pushed you further away than you thought. almost 4 feet from your front door, you were practically in your living room. You got up quickly to see a girl. She was panting hard. Her jacket had tears and fine cuts. It looked like she had to crawl under a fence and into barbed wire to make it look that bad. She leaned against the door frame. You went into the kitchen and grabbed the tallest cup of water you had, as you were a writer, you had coffee brewing, the smell was strong, but it was not ready, maybe you would not need it tonight. \"What a waste\" you thought as you ready two cups for later. You fill the glass with as much water as possible and bring a jug of water just in case. You hear her panting, still at the door, only this time she had slid down it a was at rest. Knees curled up to her face, arms wrapped around tightly. You could see her now. A tall Girl, certainly taller than you. She looked to be tall and lanky, but she definitely had some power behind that girly visage. Her body was drenched in sweat, Her hair was matted and sticking all over her face. The dyed blue hair was cut to be just a tad above the lower back. As you moved closer you noticed she was in a state of shock. Her eyes, you thought just for a moment looked like a predators. You stopped and blinked quickly, \"I must be really drained\", You think to your self. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hand her the water. and she begins to chug it with great ferocity. She lets a good portion of it run down her chin and checks, flowing other her shirt and chest. She rubs the water on her skin around her neck and arms. She calms here breathing, all the while you stand above her, just watching, giving her time to collect her self. After a few minutes of rest she stands up. With a shaky voice. She begins to attempt a thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th- Th-Thank you. You have no idea how much this means to me. I was so scared. I-I-I.\" She Stutters, abruptly stopping and starting. With standing up now, you can clearly see her in more detail. She WAS clearly taller than you, by a good lead. At least 6'3. She had a body that had shape to it. her hips and thighs were shapely. Curved, toned with muscles, her abdomen was a six pack. You would had many words in your vocabulary, but those just seemed to not be enough to vividly describe her strange, powerful, yet oddly attractive frame. Looking up, Her face was beautiful; Green eyes, so deep you could lose your self in them. Her face and body had a cover of dense freckles, they only exalted her model further. As She moved towards you, you could she her eyes, flowing with water. She grabs you and hold tightly. You stammer back. Realizing the full power she possesses you think to yourself, \"If she is this strong, then what on god's blue earth could make her this scared.\" She has one hand clamped on your shoulder at what you assume is full power. As your face contorts into one of pain, she pulls you in to her embrace tightly; this is apparently how shocked she is, to trust the first stranger who showed her kindness, you could do more harm to now that she is vulnerable. Yet if she was to fight back, you instinctively push these thoughts away. Because if she did choose to fight you, or do anything to you, What 'could' you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets sit down on the couch. Its better than standing here all night.\" You say, even though your left arm feels like you should take her and your self to the doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, please.\" She she says in a more relaxed state. After a moments hesitation, she loosens her grip on you, but she does not let you go. This problem seems to be more than trust related now. She has released her death grip on you, but that did not give you back freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lead her to your couch, a large 'L' shaped thing. After a Nice year of sales thanks your moderately successful book series \"After the sun goes down\", They were based off the journal you found in that yard sale. You had to admit; who ever wrote it and left those notes had plenty of ideas and other sparks that certainly were unheard of, let alone sane. This couch was certainly big enough for both of you. Letting you lean into the corner while she stayed wrapped around you. After a period of silence, she began to speak up. This time she just seemed to use You as a barrier, or more to the point a security pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I stay here, for the night, or the day? Please.\" She looked at you with big eyes, still freshly made red with her crying. Although it was over, her trauma might be permanent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's fine. Do you need to shower too?\" You interject quickly. As you could smell her body and clothes, which other than the pants below the naval and above the knees were mostly cut into pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thank you, um.... My shit and jacket. I, uh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can borrow one of my hoodies and sweat pants. I don't mind it just take your time.\" Your captor lets you stand up with very little resistance and follow you into deeper into your house. After passing into a guest room you lead her to its bathroom. you leave her alone here and return with two towels, a grey hoodie that is a little to large on you, and some track pants. The water is running already, as you enter the bathroom, you place it on the rack out side the shower room and leave to the kitchen. \"Maybe some breakfast will help her.\" You think to yourself as you begin to make a basic breakfast of eggs, pancakes, and, bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh, what a night....\" You mutter after cracking an egg. The fear she had on her face, the strength she showed, and, the idea that what ever monster outside your door could do that to a woman that strong, it sent a chill through your body. The journal, all of contents were replaying through your mind. The monsters inside our world, hidden, praised, worshiped, and, hunted. \"Matthew, I don't know know who or what you are, but it was all fiction? Right?\" You say aloud. No response from your self. It was just you had become so paranoid lately, so much so your editor had begun to try and get you some psychiatric help. You hater her, unfortunately her existence, was necessary for you to live. After finishing the pancake batter you leave your thoughts alone to focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                        ********************************************************<br>\r\nAfter forty minutes and a freshly made breakfast finished at five a.m, she appeared looking for you, calling out to you from the guest room. She walked in cleaned up and refreshed. Her attitude was better, The scared girl was now a calm collected lady, who to your surprise had glasses on her, her face was certainly showing abetter mood and she smiled weakly, but it was a small token of trust from her. The blue hair was brushed back with a pocket comb she said she carried it was in a neatly tucked and lose braid, over her left shoulder. She had some scratches on her legs that you patched up and applied hydrogen peroxide to. There were so many you put bandages around her ankles. She slightly blushed when you had to stand up. You clothes was a little tight in some areas, but the hoodie she wore was too much. It was a baggy unbelievable mess. It was too large for you and it gripped her perfectly. More than anything to essentially made it a one piece. The body part was too long, on you it went below your waist and too your shins. But on her, the red, white, and black monster fit perfectly covering her body just right. You could see the outlines of her strong feminine body, her tall body was accented by it, the legs, while damaged. you only had one thought; \"legs for days.\". They were well taken care of and shaved recently. IT was a shame that she had to be in such a state and put through this night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the food. I don't normally have guys making me food this early.\" She said between bites. Smiling bigger than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine, you look better and frankly you need something else to help you rest.\" you replied after a swig of coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Oh, am Emily Drakaina, and thanks again.\"  She said it with a giggle of sorts. The heart warming kind. But your mind went back to Matthew's journal, Drakaina. It was a entry from the journal More specifically a dangerous to many people. Her smile was bright, her manners so far were good. But that felling of paranoia was back, except, the dread was far, far greater now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I should tell you my name now, Its Jacob Skyler.\" You manage to say after a very unusual long and big sip of coffee followed by a tactical maneuver of eating pancakes. You grin at her direction, and she gives another giggle. Her body may be a tall fighter, but you remind yourself that humans can be monsters too, trying to push the ideas spawned from the journal back. Soon your having a pleasant conversation with Emily. It has both of you chatting. You tell her how you failed at the university on the other side of town. She tells you that she is a student there now, and majors in archeology. The surprises come from topic to another. The biggest blow to you is that she has read your books, and can now brag to her sister about meeting the author of their favorite book series. The fact your more popular than you realize is shocking. Turns out your evil editor can lie to you. She Tells you about a the math professor Dr.Kall, the fossil is still breathing and teaching at eighty-eight years old. Both of you laugh loudly, and soon your moved to the couch with blankets out. As the sunrise shoots light into your windows, the drapes catch most of it the cracks of light are slowly luring both of you to sleep on that couch. Emily Leans close to you and you stretch out your arms for her, she lays in and cuddles closer to you. You cast her smile and she returns it. He giantess frame for all of its raw power and beauty is only downplayed by her cute personality.  </span></div></div>",

Join the monsters? or something in between?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few rules before we begin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;As per my usual for interactives, I prefer to make the reader out as the lead character.<br>\r\nThis is optional but please leave the choice to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;No adding chapters that would end the story. Keep it going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;I have a zero-tolerance for 1337 text. (lol, omg, wtf, etc.) Unless it would actually make sense to, such as receiving a text message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Please use your best grammar<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;No using any non-original characters, such as Naruto or Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;As per the usual, romance is allowed and encouraged. It is NOT an erotica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;This may have a 13+ rating, but blood and death should be expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;I retain the right to \"Prune\" any chapters that are unreadable or make no sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun and enjoy. </td>",
