My story started when one day I started my career as a researcher for Umbrella Corportation, otherwise known as Umbrella Chemical Inc., at the age of 17.  I was a researcher for James Marcus, who also had another apprentice William Birkin.  As we researched further on the T-Virus, Umbrella had us transferred from the Training Facility in the Arklay Mountains, located underneath the Spencer Estate.  From what we were told, Marcus was still researching on his own work.  We continued with the T-Virus for 13 years.  We finally broke through with the Tyrant, one of our most prominent experiments.  The Tyrant was still in its experiment stage, and as such there were two made.  One was the Prototype that was left at the Underground Research Facility near Raccoon City, the other was further improved under the Spencer Estate.  With the Tyrants created, Umbrella ordered us to assassinate Marcus and take all of his research.  William and I did as we were told and killed Marcus.  Two militants shot him dead and we had our last chat before departing.  Marcus, however, wasn't going to stay dead for long.  That, however, wasn't on the top priority.  Shortly after Birkin, after years of \"research\" with Lisa Trevor, found the G-Virus and Spencer, one of the heads of Umbrella, approved of the research.  I, however, wasn't reassured with what he had in mind.  I requested to be transferred to the Umbrella Intelligence Bureau.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Entry #1: The Before Crisis</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Entry #2: S.T.A.R.S.<br>\r\nWesker:  After entering the Umbrella's Intelligence Bureau, I established a new group called S.T.A.R.S., a rescue team, in Raccoon City apart of the Raccoon City Police Department, or R.P.D.  These men and women were trained in armed combat.  I was the leader of it all and the squad leader of Alpha Team.  I elected Kevin Dooley, Edward Dewey, Forest Speyer, Richard Aiken, Kennth Sullivan, and Enrico Marini, the squad leader, to the Bravo Team.  There was also one girl on the Bravo Team, Rebecca Chambers.  She had remarkable surviving skills.  On my team was Brad Vickers, the pilot, Joseph Frost, Barry Burton, Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, and myself.  There were other members as well, but they were dispatched to the main part of the R.P.D. instead of S.T.A.R.S.  After several years of training, there has been several reports of grizzly murders up in the Arklay Mountains.  Umbrella wanted to keep these murders as mum as possible.  The public saw them only as a cult's work.  I knew that was far from the case.  I sent Bravo Team into the mountains to \"investigate\".  I will follow my initial plan and lure the S.T.A.R.S. members into the Spencer Mansion. Their superior combat training should make them PERFECT test subjects for the Bio-organic Weapons Umbrella constructed, otherwise known as B.O.W.'s.  First, however, I needed to check up on our \"little friend\" at the research facility in Raccoon City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way to the research facility near Raccoon City as planned and Birkin told me what to expect of the Proto-Tyrant.  Unfortunately, dear James Marcus didn't stay dead as we intened and he was brought back to life by his research; the leeches.  Marcus infected a nearby train, linked to the murders reported, and the Bravo Team went to investigate there.  Birkin and I were in the facility trying to figure out what happened when Delta Team, a part of Umbrella's special forces, came in contact with us and reported what we had feared.  Marcus's creations, however, got to them and we lost contact.  I also had planned to destroy the train to get rid of any evidence that the T-Virus was leaked.  After some time to think, Birkin and I found out that Marcus was behind this and Birkin wanted to destroy this place, along with Marcus.  I had no intentions on destroying this place, but I really hadn't much time to care about the aftermath of what happened.  I just needed to collect battle data from the B.O.W.'s and leave Umbrella.  On my way out of the facility, I was greeted by the Proto-Tyrant.  He was released by Marcus to kill two intruders in the facility.  I learned that it was Billy Coen, the aparent one that killed the 23 people in the mountains, and Rebecca.  I was surprised she's survived for so long.  I intended that she won't last much longer though.  But I didn't have much time either to think because the Proto-Tyrant was set to kill any living thing in the facility.  I noticed that the Tyrant had severe wounds already, most likely from Rebecca and Billy.  I, nonetheless, killed the prototype.  This tyrant needed a lot of improvement in order to be of any use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI, however, was stopped by Sergei Vladimir, one of the heads of Umbrella.  He had heard of some of my betrayal, and sent one of his special Tyrants to attack me; Ivan.  I managed to distract to two long enough to escape out of there where the train had crashed eariler.I hurried out of there and back to Raccoon City.  Birkin had told me that he set the self-destruction controls and destroyed the facility.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I got back to the R.P.D. station, Birkin told from my headphones that the place was no more.  He also saw that Billy and Rebecca had killed Marcus once and for all and they escaped, with the rest of the Bravo Team going near the Spencer Estate.  At that point, I got back from \"running an errand\".  Brad told me that they just lost contact with Bravo Team.  I sent the Alpha Team to \"retrieve\" Bravo Team, which will be their last mission ever.  My battle data will be complete and Umbrella will soon see a new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Entry #2: S.T.A.R.S.</span></div></div>",

We landed in the forest, where the Bravo Team's helicopter was located.  Upon further examination the pilot Kevin Dooley was eaten.  As we made secured the perimeter, Joseph Frost was attacked and devoured by Cerberus.  One S.T.A.R.S. member down... The rest of us escaped to the Spencer Mansion.  I, fortunately, know all the ins and outs of the place.  I told Barry and Jill to search the dinning hall and Chris to look at the adjacent room across the hall.  I was left alone all to myself.  I made my way to a secret room in the mansion to watch how the events unfolded.  I've learned that most of the S.T.A.R.S. members have already been killed.  Edward Dewey was killed by the Cerberus on the train Rebecca and Billy were on and Rebecca had to kill him once he was raised from the dead.  Kenneth Sullivan had his throat ripped out by a zombie as Jill watched him get eaten by the zombie.  Forest Speyer was found pecked to death by crows.  He, later, came back to life and someone strapped explosives to him, making him one dangerous zombie.  Richard Aiken was hard to figure out.  Two monitors showed him getting eaten by the neptune and the other by the Yawn.  Either way, he's been killed.  The only members of the Bravo Team was Enrico and Rebecca.  I had no idea where the girl was, but I had a good idea where Enrico might be dieing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone from the Alpha Team, besides Joseph, was still alive.  Brad flew off in a panic and Barry was luring Chris and Jill into their demises.  He did what I told him, because I had his family \"held up\" and they would have been dealt with if he disobeyed.  Barry led the Bravo Team to their deaths, but Jill and Chris were still alive and Chris also found Rebecca.  I had to make a few appearances to look like that I was trying to find a way out of the mansion.  Jill, unfortunantly, heard in on a conservation Barry and I made, but I made sure that it was like Barry was slowly losing his mind.  Jill, Chris and Rebecca soon discovered that there was more under the mansion.  They also ran into one of our experiments Birkin was working on; Lisa Trevor.  She was almost indestructible to weapons, almost.  First, I found Chris and Rebecca fighting Lisa.  I joined in to get rid of the girl once and for all.  We got her to the cliff of her lair and pushed her into the abyss.  I gave my farewells to Chris and departed.  I've learned that Barry and Jill then found Lisa again, only this time she found her dear mother's skull and mourned for her death.  Lisa took another plunge into the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill and Barry soon found Enrico, barely alive.  Enrico was a little on edge.  For you see, he found several of my documents about betraying S.T.A.R.S.... and eventually Umbrella.  He could only figure out that it was either Barry, Chris, or me.  I already knew that Barry would never betray his fellow members and Chris wasn't the sharpest knife in the cuppard and he knew I was.  I couldn't let Enrico ruin my plan yet, so I took care of him before he let the info slip.  With only a few S.T.A.R.S. members, I will be able to take down Umbrella for something else.  I don't know how I'll get Brad though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went into the lab containing the first true Tyrant.  All I had to do is wait until the others came.  But before I did anything else, I took an experimented verison of Birkin's G-virus and injected myself with it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon came and I greeted them, only to have Barry point his gun at Jill.  I revealed that I was the traitor that decimated S.T.A.R.S.  I asked Barry to leave for a moment so the others could \"meet\" the Tyrant.  They saw it and it had broken out of its container.  The Tyrant and killed me right there and then.  The sample of the G-Virus I took would bring be back to life and give me super human strength.  I had planned for the Tyrant to kill me, just to look like that I have been elimanted in the eyes of Umbrella.  When I got up from my temporary death, I tried to retrieve all the battle data from Umbrella of the B.O.W.s.  My ultimate plan is to give the battle data and give them to another competitor to take down Umbrella.  However, Sergei had already backed up all the files and erased them all from the mansion computer.  I tried to get into the Umbrella's interface, but I was blocked by the Red Queen.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stay long trying to hack the computer as the the self-destruct system to the mansion was activiated and I had only a few mintues to escape.  I tested my new powers... and they have proved to be outstanding.  I was indestructable.  On my way out of the mansion, I met Lisa Trevor again, and she was quite persistant on getting rid of me.  I got her into the main lobby of the mansion and I shot the chanidler and it fell on Lisa.  Hopefully that will keep her dead.  I rushed out of the mansion before it was destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI discovered that Chris, Jill, Barry, Brad, Rebecca, and I were the only survivors of this incident.  However, they had destroyed the Tyrant.  All of my research was gone.  On that day, I vowed revenge on the survivors.  But until I get time, I'll have to stay undercover for a little while.  Umbrella is buzzing with knowledge that I betrayed them, but they also know that I \"died\" at the mansion.  I need to work fast in order to get a sample of the G-Virus Birkin is working on, and Umbrella already has plans to get the sample and assassinate Birkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Entry #3: The Mansion Incident</span></div></div>",

You see, while the T-Virus might have been obliterated, Birkin was still working on the G-Virus.  Umbrella wanted a sample and so assassinated Birkin for a sample.  They sent their private military to go kill him, led by HUNK.  Unknown to them was that Birkin had injected the virus into him just before he died.  The virus mutated him into a monster.  With his mutation, he sought out the soldiers that killed him and returned the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy goal was to give the battle data from the B.O.W.s to a group dubbed the Agency.  My next task was to retrieve a sample of the G-Virus.  I, unfortunately, was under the guise of death and had to work undercover to act my part.  I had several agents out there trying to retrieve a sample.  That task proved to be near to impossible, as there were scarse samples in the city.  HUNK had already taken the one sample of Birkin's, the one given to Birkin's little daughter, and then Birkin himself, a living sample of the virus...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Birkin rampaged the city, he contaminated the water and the rats, infecting Raccoon City in only days.  From what my agents have told me, only a select few had survived the incident.  My old friend Chris was out of town, while his girlfriend Jill was still in the city who teamed up with Carlos Olviveria, part of Umbrella's army.  The two of them had defeated the Nemesis, a nearly perfect tyrant sent to kill all S.T.A.R.S. members left alive.  The two also escaped with Barry in a helicopter.  I've been reported that a small group of roughly eight to nine suvivors escaped, without much training at all with firearms, let alone B.O.W.s.  Another group of survivors was Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield, an RPD officer and Chris's sister respectfully.  They escaped with a little girl named Sherry Birkin, the daughter of my dear late friend William.  That girl seems to pocess something that will come in handy someday.  Lastly was HUNK and my agent Ada Wong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda was to retrieve a sample of the G-Virus.  Nothing more than a little erand.  She, however, had difficulty trying to get it.  Her biggest problem was Leon, as she grew attached to him.  I kept in touch with her the most because she seemed to have the most potential with getting the sample.  Soon, she had retrieved the sample in the Sherry's locket, but she met one angry mother, Annette Birkin.  In the end, Annette shot Ada, causing her to fall over a railing and she lost the sample.  Annette didn't live long to enjoy any victory, as her husband quickly sliced her to death.  Ada was still alive and supplied Leon with a rocket launcher to kill one of the tyrants stalking him; Mr. X.  She, disobeying orders, soon lost almost her usefullness when Birkin, still mutating from the virus, attacked her and getting a seemingly mortal wound.  Leon left her, but again she was still alive.  She somehow got a sample of the virus from Birkin and went to the Apple Inn where I ordered her to meet with an Umbrella worker.  However, he already committed suicide.  This wasn't on the plan, and she hadn't known anything about the camera in there.  I told her that the city was going to be nuked by a missile to \"clean the problem\".  Her only way, I told her, was to get to a helicopter that was flying by her soon.  Supplying her with a hookshot, she went her way to the helicopter and escaped before being eradicated by the nuclear missile.  I later found at that she hopped a ride with our old friend Sergei and Spencer, the owner of the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe missile turned the city to ashes and rubble.  There wasn't a single trace of the virus left.  Umbrella was still standing, but not for long.  The area where Raccoon City was still standing was fenced off from further contamination.  The cards are set.  Umbrella will soon fall...<br>\r\nEnd of Entry #4: The Raccoon City Incident</span></div></div>",

With Raccoon City demolished, governments are going to eat them alive.  It was only a matter of time when everyone figures out where they're hiding.  After some investigation, a group of Anti-Umbrella groups found out that Umbrella's last factory in Russia had a viral outbreak and mutant monsters were amuck.  I gave the tip off and I picked up the pieces...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Chris and Jill trying to figure out where the main threat was, I was looking for Sergei.  He, however, was anticapting an uninvited guest amongst Jill and Chris.  He also had two Ivan tyrants ready for me.  Sergei didn't fully except what had happened to me at the mansion, so he let the two Ivans attack me.  I destroyed the two without lifting a finger.  Sergei underestimated me and went running deeper into his factory.  I followed and I found an Anti-Tank Cannon in one of the labs.  I never figured out why they built one if they were only going to destroy what they created.  Chris and Jill eventually found the Talos tyrant project and Sergei had his back turned for a moment.  I sneaked in and paid him a visit.  He had another project he created; himself.  He soon mutated into a monster and I disposed of him with the Anti-Tank cannon.  I then went to the master computer and retrieved all the data that Umbrella had.  Then... all of Umbrella was erased by me.  The Red Queen was turned off and Umbrella was soon no more.  I left the scene without Jill nor Chris figuring out what had actually happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbrella was charged for all the crimes they have committed.  The last action ever made was the international manhunt for Spencer himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But before Umbrella was removed from the face of the Earth, I had to retrieve one more sample for my plan.  The Agency sent an attack to Rockfort Island in search for Alexia Ashford, the researcher and creator of the T-Veronica Virus.  The B.O.W.s were released and the virus contaminated the island.  However, the fair lady was nowhere to be found.  It was later that she was located at the Antartica Research Facility.  Her brother had just died right before her awaken and her wraith could be felt throughout the place.  I then relealized that Claire was here looking for Chris.  I gave her a \"warm\" greeting and said that I wasn't here for her nor her brother.  I had to collect that sample...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eventually met Alexia in the lobby of a mansion at the facility.  She, however, wasn't going to give me a sample.  I had to forcefully make her give one to me, one way or another.  The lady also had powers of her own.  She mutated and started to spread fire around the room.  My powers weren't great enough to fight her in her condition now.  By a stroke of luck I found Chris hiding and I \"asked\" for his help and ran to figure out what I was going to do.  I eventually figured out that Chris killed Alexia who had mutated even further to a dragonfly like monster.  All the samples were lost until I found the dead body of Steve Burnside with the virus in him.  I took his body for the sample and went on with the mission...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before I left, I found Claire and I \"took her out for a nice walk\".  Chris, after killing Alexia, chased after us.  I let the girl go, only to have a one-on-one fight with my old pal Chris.  With my superhuman powers, I wiped the floor with him.  He didn't stand a single chance.  With pure luck, though, he found a crane and stopped me with beams hanging above.  I quickly picked myself up and stood before Chris.  I almost gave him the final blow until an explosion seperated us and burned me.  The Facility was about to self-destruct.  I told Chris he was lucky this round but next time it won't happen again.  I escaped the facility and my wounds healed in less than five minutes.  What was next for me was Spain...<br>\r\nEnd of Entry #5: The Rockfort Island/ Russia Report</span></div></div>",

I didn't have any more intentions with being the Agency and joined the S Corporation, another rival of Umbrella.  The Agency still wasn't completely sure what I had planned, so they kept Ada with me to keep in touch.  The fools had no idea that I was aware of everything they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had sent Ada to Europe to retrieve a sample of the Las Plagas virus, a brand new parasitic virus that gives the host more intelligence than the G and T viruses.  A man named Osmund Saddler was controlling a group of villagers called Los Illuminados that was infected with Las Plagas.  All her mission was to retrieve a sample.  She, however, got caught up with an old distraction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time Leon was looking for the president's daughter Ashley Graham who was also kidnapped by the same group.  As she continued her mission, she helped Leon throughout the island they were on, such as giving him keys to locked doors and eliminating enemies bent on killing him.  She eventually gave Leon a ride on a boat to the island which was holding Ashley up after being kidnapped again.  After the ride she departed to follow the rest of her mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Krauser, another one of my hired men, was sent to Spain to keep an eye on Ada, if she was doing her jon or not.  When I gave Ada orders to kill Leon, she had failed.  Not because she didn't have the heart, but because Leon was now trained to fight more than just zombies now.  That's when I sent Krauser in to finish off Krauser.  Ada, still attached to Leon, interferred and stopped Krauser from finishing him off.  That was when I knew that she was still with the Agency.  I ordered to go retrieve the sample now and leave.  As she progressed further into Saddler's lair, she found Leon struggling with the Las Plagas that was injected into him.  She gave him some medication to slow down the process, but not before he almost killed her from mind control.  Ada made her way into the stronghold where Saddler had Leon and Ashley pinned.  She tried to distract him long enough for them to escape, but in the process she was knocked out by Saddler and kidnapped to lure Leon to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon saved Ada and she gave him a rocket launcher to kill Saddler once and for all.  Leon picked up only to hand over to Ada, forcing him to give it to her at gun point.  She gave him a final farewell until they meet again and gave him a speedboat off the island, which was set to explode after Saddler being killed.  I sent a helicopter to pick her up and bring her back to HQ.  Her mission, both to me and the Agency, were over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda had given me the sample of the Las Plagas, but it turned out that she gave me a fake sample of it.  She gave the real one to the Agency.  I, however, didn't let that happen so easily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd of Entry #6: Las Plagas Report<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just need a little bit for it to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paid my old friend Spencer a visit at his secret castle to hide from the government during the manhunt for him.  Chris and Jill, now part of the BSAA, got a tip from a reliable source that Spencer was here.  Just before they arrived, I made my visit.  Spencer knew all about the project Birkin and I were working on.  He knew the special virus I took to continue living.  Apparently, there were other people invovled with the virus, but I was the only one to survive the test.  He called us the \"Wesker Children\", and that he would be God.  His dream came crashing down, however, when Raccoon City was erased from the map.  He got off his wheelchair and told me that it was his right to be a God.  His dream was crushed, but mine wasn't.  I forced my hand through his chest and back and told him, \"The right to be a God... that right is now mine.\"  and through him on the ground with his last breaths.  Just I killed the old man, Jill and Chris came barging in, only to find Spencer dead and me there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI greeted the two, but all they did was open fire.  I retorted with my powers and wiped the floor with the two.  I had Chris in my hand *zzzzttt* and I was about to give him the finishing blow when Jill interviened and pushed out of the window into a chasm.  The BSAA couldn't find our bodies, so they assumed us dead.  That was far from the truth.  We were very alive and I captured Jill for testing.  I made her like me, but under my control with a device to keep her in track.  I gave her a cloak and mask to disguise her from everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jill under control, I sought to join the Tricell Pharmaceutical Company to continue forward.  I met Excella Gionne and Riccardo Irving with Tricell and they helped by develope a new kind of parasitic virus called the Uroburos, much like Las Plagas, only improved.  The four of use then tested the Uroburos on the locals of a village called Kijuju in Africa.  After some time, the BSAA got their noses in the bio weapons being made here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris and his new partner Sheva Alomar, along with several others, were called in to figure out what was going on and to stop the bioterrorism that was being *zzt* caused.  As they looked through the village, Chris came upon a picture that looked like Jill and they continued to find out who was behind this.  Soon Riccardo was subdued by the two and killed and they found Jill.  I made a personal visit to let Chris \"catch up\" with Jill.  To Chris's dismay, Jill didn't show any emotion towards him and followed my orders and attacked the two.  They escaped and tried to figure out what happened to dear old Jill.  Unfortunately, they found *zzzttt* out what my one weakness was, and that was the virus that gave me new life.  If given too much in one shot, it would just be like giving me poison.  This was the first time in my life where I was begining to start to fell *zzztt* afraid...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two found Excella struggling for her life.  Why?  I injected her with the Uroburos, and they rejected her.  I didn't have any intentions of her being in my world, so I made due with what I had at me disposal.  Excella became the host for a massive creature of Uroburos, but the partners quickly killed her and they continued to find me.  On their way, Jill was freed of my control and the BSAA helped her back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey *zzt* found me and I gave them *zzzzztt* a fight.  I was dealing with them very easily, until Chris and Sheva held me down and forced a viral dose into me.  I tried to flee *zzztt* into a cargo aircraft, but they falled and they gave me more of the dose.  As the *zzt* plane flew, the cargo lift opened and I was unfortunately shot out and landed in an active *zzzzzttt* volcano.  The two followed and they were prepared to kill me once for *zzzzzzzzzzzzzzttt* all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*zzzzzztt* We fought while the volcano *zzzt* broke up and they pinned me down.  I was starting to mutate into a monster.  Chris and Sheva then sliced at *zzztt* my heart and left me to die when the ground *zzzzzzztt* under me broke and I plunged into the lava.  *zzzzztt*  I was prepared to fight to the end and *zzzzzztt* take the two with me to the *zzzzztt* grave.  Jill came in with a *helicopter* and saved the two before they *zzzztt* were taken by the lava.  Before *zzzzzt* they could escape *zzzzt* I tried to *zzzt*  grab the *zzzzzzzttt* helicopter and drag *zzzzzztt* to the lava.  The last *zzzt* things I *zzzzzzzttt* saw were two *zzzzzzttt* rockets flying towards me and *zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzztttttttttt* finishing me off.<br>\r\nTransmission ends here.<br>\r\nEnd of Entry #7: Africa Report</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Albert Wesker, former leader of the rescue team S.T.A.R.S., tells his story of what had happened throughout his life, before S.T.A.R.S., during the Raccoon City Incident, Rockfort Island, and Africa, and everything else after that.  Wesker is a rather busy guy...  If you have read \"Kirby's Super World Journey\", you know what to expect.  To those who are new, Wesker may not die (permantly) unless I direct it (unless it is a side branch and he may die.  But the story ends there regardless.)  This story also features other video game series, but some series will not be used (ex. Tetris, Nintendogs, Pikmin, almost anything cutesy that can't fight back, etc.).  If you feel like adding any chapter into this story, email what chapter, what it's about, and a rough draft.  If it needs serious editing, I will email you so.  If I like it the way it is (or I like it but it needs some editing) I will email that I will use the chapter.  Edits may/will occur.  If needed, I will email any changes that I deem necessary to address.  Thanks and enjoy the story.</td>",
