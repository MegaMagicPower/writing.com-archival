Here are the main methods you can choose from for the thief to use to steal the girl's identities:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Possession:</b> The thief hijacks the body of their target. The original is trapped deep within or removed from the body. (Possible easiest access to semblance and memories.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Body Swap:</b> Self-explanatory. The thief switches bodies with their target in some manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Transformation</b>: The thief alters their body somehow to appear as their victim/target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Replica:</b> Basically a clone body of the target, in every sense of the manner. This option is tricky as the thief is either the clone itself or someone using a clone body of there target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Disguise:</b>  Wearing something(s) over your body to appear as the target. This could be a 'special' bodysuit or just a regular disguise, like the ones in movies were they use wigs, clothes, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, which will you choose from? Remember once you pick a method you have to choose how they do it, (The 'How' is called a Sub-method here), I'll stop clarifying after this chapter.</span></div></div>",

Note: You can either push the previous owner's soul out or trap them inside the body for the thief's own use. (May or may not need requirement[s]. Your choice when you make the story segment.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanobots: The thief uses Nanobots to infiltrate the body of the target and transfers the thief's mind into the target's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerge Phasing: The thief phases their body into the target's body, leaving no trace of their former self. The thief is able to phase out of merge parts of their body with their target. Giving the target's body better or even new traits/'assets' while the thief is occupying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there is room for other ideas that are spiritual, technology-based, or magical. Like a Mind Transfer Machine, Being a Ghost, or even some manner of wishing. You just need to think of something that's a little different from the options presented.</span></div></div>",

Four hours passed before Cinder's eyes rolled back down and fainted while on the inside, I won control of her body and started to spread myself throughout her body. Few more minutes have passed before I opened my new eyes and stood up as I looked over Cinder/my body as I smirked. \"I can't believed that worked.\" I said as I heard Cinder's voice coming out of my mouth.

The Atlas military research base was totally silent as the guard looked out over the dusty expanse before him. The very same reddish sand lay for about twenty meters until it was halted by a sudden, large concrete wall that ended in thick coils of barbed wire. He was dressed in a white shirt with a grey tie. His trousers were the same grey and his feet were clad in black, leather shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the guard sipped from his steaming cup of coffee, making his glasses fog up. With a growl of annoyance, he takes them off and starts to wipe them with a small cloth he\u2019d pulled from his breast pocket. As he did, a shadow nipped over the wall, using a sheet of some kind to cover the wire. It drops down and dashes to his small, lit booth. Just as he puts on his glasses, it vanishes out of sight, unspotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard goes back to his usual routine, only to be interrupted by a thin wire begin pulled around his neck, silencing him as he was garroted from behind. His body falls after a few more seconds struggle and a short woman with brown and pink hair steps out of the booth, dusting herself off, now dressed in a replica of the guard\u2019s uniform. They put on the guard\u2019s belt and casually stroll into one of the hangars, using the stolen ID to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gaining access, the woman makes short work of the two guards inside before subduing the only scientist on duty using a single strike of a glass coffee pot. Now alone, she smirks and strolls with a nonchalant attitude towards the container she was sent to retrieve. She quickly opens the containment and picks it up. Quickly, she leaves and exits using a jeep she took using a note to pass the gate guard and claiming she was \u201con a late shift snack run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, like the sun at sundown, she vanished into the desert horizon\u2026 Now in possession of one of the most powerful unconventional weapons ever conceived and the only blueprints of how to make more\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is an Alternative Universe of the RWBY-verse. Someone or something is stealing the identity of the female characters in RWBY. However, as this is an interactive story, you get to say who, how, and why. Please read and respect the rules to see how the beginning chapters are laid out as you pick from the Main Method and how it's done(Sub-Method) before picking your thief and their target. I've tried to break it down into sections for you to read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>Disclaimer: I own nothing of RWBY. All property goes to there rightful owners.</b></i></u> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>Rules:</b></i></u><br>\r\n<span style=\"line-height:1.4;\">\t<br>\r\n<u><b>About the Theives</b></u><br>\r\n\u2022       A thief MUST be able to impersonate the victim in some manner, including their Semblance. (The thief can have Semblance(s) be similar, taken, or perhaps copied from the victim depending on your theft method.)<br>\r\n\u2022\tThere can be MULTIPLE thieves, depending on their relationship or recruitment. Though only start out with one. <br>\r\n\u2022\tA thief can switch between victims ONLY IF the original can come back to take their rightful place or get another thief to take their place. <br>\r\n\u2022\tGuys can only be thieves. Not victims. Sorry.<br>\r\n\u2022\tA thief can be either doing this for temporary time or permanently. Regardless, we should see how they live with their stolen life.<br>\r\n\u2022\tGrimm can be used as thieves.<br>\r\n\u2022\tIf you can, give a reason for the Identity Theft on whichever person.<br>\r\n\u2022\tA thief can be either doing this for temporary time or permanently. Regardless, we should see how they live with their stolen life.<br>\r\n\u2022\tOriginal Characters are allowed but DO NOT make them as self-inserts. Other people will be using these characters too.<br>\r\n\u2022\tThe \u2018Replica\u2019 route must have the clone as the identity thief to their respective original character unless it's a clone body but someone else in mind and soul. (This is a bit of a complex route to understand.)<br>\r\n\u2022\t<u>Try</u> to accurately write any of the characters in RWBY. You <u>can</u> slightly alter their persona to justify the identity theft.<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"line-height:1.4;\"><u><i><b>Main Theft Method Options:</b></i></u><br>\r\n<u>Possession: </u>The thief hijacks the body of their target. The original is trapped deep within or removed from the body. (Possible easiest access to semblance and memories.)<br>\r\n<u>Body Swap:</u> Self-explanatory. The thief switches bodies with their target in some manner. <br>\r\n<u>Transformation: </u>The thief alters their body somehow to appear as their victim/target. <br>\r\n<u>Replica:</u> Basically a clone body of the target, in every sense of the manner.  The thief\u2019s body is in its original state, unless the clone itself is the thief. <br>\r\n<u>Disguise:</u>  Wearing something(s) over your body to appear as the target. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <u><i>About Submethods:</i></u><br>\r\n<span style=\"line-height:1.4;\">\u2022\tSub-Methods of theft (How to possess, body swap, etc. with a target) can be made. (Ex. For Possession you can either use soul, a slime, piece of clothing, etc.) <b>Warning:</b> if someone does the Swap Remote, it can only have the Body Swap button, the other buttons effect range and who is being swapped, and the remote must stay with the user.<br>\r\n\u2022\tSemblances can be a sub-method to be used but these can only be on Original characters or RWBY character who hasn\u2019t gotten their semblances confirmed at this point. (Ex. Roman Torchwick, Sienna Khan, Prof Port, or other characters from Vol. 3)</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u><i>General</i></u></b><br>\r\n<span style=\"line-height:1.4;\">\u2022\tSexual themes are allowed. Except for things like rape. <br>\r\n\u2022\tNo Gore, vore, or anything of the sort. Try to keep the fetishes to the theme here, there are other stories where you can do that stuff.<br>\r\n\u2022\tPlease try to refrain from sudden or abrupt endings. Try to keep the story flowing with plenty of options.<br>\r\n\u2022\tHave good grammar. Try to check over spelling. If you miss a typo, that\u2019s fine as long there aren\u2019t too many.<br>\r\n\u2022\tTry to make any <u><b>story</b></u> segments at least around two paragraphs or more. <br>\r\n\u2022\tThe beginning takes place before Vol. 3.<br>\r\n\u2022\tEnjoy and have fun.</span></td>",
