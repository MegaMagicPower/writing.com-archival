A game of shadows were monsters were brought to life to fight for the sake of their masters, be it the noble or the corrupt. These 'Shadow Games' were thought to have been disposed of by a brave pharaoh who sealed the magic away. However, they say that the shadows can never be destroyed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Millennium Spell Book, used in the creation of the Millennium Items, had the most diabolical spells, curses and shadow magic written within its text. Deep in the back pages, however, hid truly dark spells. Spells that afflicted mortal man with what most would describe as 'body horror'. These afflictions were inscribed on stone tablets just as the ancient monsters were, but weren't incorporated into the card game for reasons unknown...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an old shack far beyond the outskirts of Domino City, an avid archeologist was creating an unstable deck of these horrific shadow spells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, at long last I've recreated the lost spells into my own Duel Monsters deck!\" He exclaimed, brimming with pride despite the danger these cards could put an unsuspecting duelist into. \"Now to put the finishing touches on my duel disk and I can try this out...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up for a minute or two before walking into the garage to complete the repairs on his outdated duel disk. Unfortunately for him he forgot to close the window where he left the deck. As the summer breeze picked up, the cards blew away into the sky, setting a course for central Domino City..</span></div></div>",

Grandpa Muto was away on a trip with Professor Hawkins and said he'd be out for a couple of weeks. At first Yugi was excited about getting some time with himself. Then it dawned on him that things can get real boring, real fast, especially when the shop is closed in the first place. He'd try to call and see if his friends wanted to come over, but they were all busy. Tea was too caught up in her job at Burger World, Joey was sorting out family problems, and he hasn't heard back from the voicemails he left for Tristan and Bakura. It was just so dull. Because of it, Yugi had just been watching reruns of past duel tournaments on TV while raiding the cabinets for snacks. It was only a matter of time before it showed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yugi, don't you think you're getting a little... er...\" Yami stuttered, trying to find the right words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Yami?\" Yugi asked, shoveling a handful of Cheez-Its into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're getting kind of... pudgy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you-\" Yugi looked down at himself, but he couldn't see his toes. He instead saw a crumb-covered tummy poking out from underneath his black tank top. All the laying around and snacking he'd been doing had gone straight to his gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always thought you were cute, Yugi, but now you're just plain adorable.\" Yami teased while poking Yugi's tummy. His now-chubby cheeks blushing a beet red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit it, Yami!\" He cried, trying to cover his new built-in pillow but to no avail. He knew his other half was just messing with him, but it gave him a weird feeling about being chubby. Something he hadn't felt before. Was it that he had a secret admiration towards his new frame? </span></div></div>",

You home?\" It was Joey, who looked a bit flustered. \"Can I hang out with ya for a while?

Seems like all the family troubles had been causing Joey to pack the pounds too, seeing that belly poking out from his white T-shirt. Oddly, Yami felt some admiration for it, especially after taking another look as they sat down on the couch. Joey sighed as he slouched on the couch, making his gut poke out even more. Yami blushed when he saw his blonde happy trail under his navel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, hope I didn't interrupt anythin', Yug. I just needed to get outta there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. Of course.\" Yami rubbed the back of his head as his remembered what he was doing just a few minute earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey chuckled as he saw Yami's own belly. \"Guess I'm not the only one who's been eatin'!\" He said with a pat of his own tummy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The once-bone slim CEO was finally putting meat on his bones. Underneath his black sweater, his midsection was swelling at an alarming rate. His unusually large pectorals were slowly metamorphosing into a supple pair of man breasts, which resting upon his ever growing and expensive gut. His own arm bands had been stripped off by his fatty arms, and his white trenchcoat appeared to perfectly fit his growing frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it up, Yugi!

Whether is was the competitive spirit in the air or something else he couldn't be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your dreamsh!\" The Pharaoh said, already on his fourth burger. He had missed the days of feasting he had once experienced as a king, and the beautiful memories were flooding back to him. The swollen bellies of he and his fellow svelte nobles, laughing as they undid their robes to compare their stuffed guts, He had always put on a few pounds around that time, everyone had, but he had secretly always wished for more. A fat, round ass and bouncing belly, nothing insane, just enough to play with...what was he thinking?! This wasn't his body, it was Yugi's! But the boy had been eating more lately...could it be some subconscious desire to get fat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba had taken the time Yami had spent lost in thought to catch up, and both were now at seven burgers, but slowing down, with still a couple large fries and pies to split between them. The billionaire let out a burp, and looked down at his normally non-existent torso. His flat, toned abs had rounded out underneath his tight sweater. No fat covering them, none of these calories had yet been absorbed, but if he ate all of this food, Kaiba thought, at least one or two would stick to his bony frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the boys guts were round and hard, and growing with every bite. Yugi's softer belly had begun to peak out from underneath his shirt as the boys his a dozen burgers each, and Kaiba's button seemed to be moaning under the pressure it had never faced before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe competitors seemed to gain a second wind, as the over-filled bellies groaned and churned as the greasy french fries filled their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys seemed at least seven months pregnant as they finished up the fries and pies, leaving only one pie left in the middle of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi and Kaiba both froze for a moment, Kaiba's painfully stuffed gut pressing tightly against his pants. His sweater appeared painted on his torso, revealing not just his massive pecs, his nipples perky and erect, but also his swollen gut, round and full, as if he had swallowed an entire raccoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi's shirt had completely ridden up over his pudgy belly. His stomach was barely soft, the fat having been spread out to all corners of his now-intensely bloated gut, but still a bit squishy to the touch. His smooth, hairless belly in full view to everyone, including not only Kaiba, whose glazed-over eyes darted to it, his heart-rate rising, but also to the teo duelists outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happenish naw?\" Marik asked, his mouth full of taco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They appear to be in some sort of food coma.\" Bakura said, taking another bite out of his. \"These tacos are amazing! Where did you get them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just the taco hut down the road...the drive through guy's named was Steve so I just told him to give me all of them.\" The Egyptian popped another taco into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them? Wait how many have we...Oh lord!\" Bakura gazed down at his now massively swollen gut, the same size as Seto and Yugi's. \"How this have, how could I?\" The fullness hit him like a wave. \"Oof.\" Bakura said, letting out a huge burp. \"This isn't...\" Bakura lifted his shirt, his normally slim waist was thick and round. Running a hand over his pale flesh, Bakura turned to Marik. \"How did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik eyed Bakura's full, pale belly and gulped. \"Oh it's nothing really\" He said, popping in a taco. \"My Millenium Rob can increase hunger in all males in a certain area. I figured we could use it to defeat the Pharaoh at his own game! Nya ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marik,\" Bakura said fuming \"I don't want to get fat!\" Bakura placed two hands on his taunt stomach for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax,\" The Egyptian said, eating another taco, \"It doesn't effect how many calories are absorbed or the person's metabolism, just double the stomach's capacity. See! I'm fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura look down at Marik's stomach.

The King and the billionaire looked down at Kaiba's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button lay quietly on the table, finally giving up after such a long struggled against the teen's swollen gut. Kaiba gulped and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at Yugi, and then over at the counter. Both the Pharaoh and the counter boy were staring, mouths agape like dying fish. The restaurant had refilled by this time, and customers we staring and giggling mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um, well, I uh.\" Kaiba stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami's mind raced back to one of the last feasts of his rule. The King had already packed on a small amount of pudge by the end of this feast, nothing to be concerned about, but enough to be noticed. He had challenged one of his most trusted advisers, a man who never participated in the feasts and that looked remarkably like Seto Kaiba, to an eating contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man had also beaten him, but with that victory came something embarrassing. When he jumped up in triumph, his massively full gut had torn the top of his robe, leaving his gluttony for the entire table to see. The man looked horrified at his actions, and the chamber burst into hysterical laughter. But Yami stood by his friend, and did the same thing he would do for Kaiba now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami stood up, proudly slapped his seemingly pregnant, fat gut, and said \"A proud victory! If anyone should be embarrassed, it should be me! I'm the size of a pyramid  AND a loser!\" With this Yami let out a jovial, almost Santa-ish laugh, that the entire restaurant, including Seto Kaiba (who never laughed) joined in with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing Kaiba! Look at this belly!\" Yami said happily, placing two hands on his stuffed gut and playing it like a drum. The friendly laughter grew louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Kaiba said jokingly, for some reason in a great mood, \"Check out the gut of a winner!\" Kaiba then lifted his own shirt, revealing to the world for the first time. It was round and hard, Kaiba had never been this stuffed! His smooth, hairless gut was magnificent. perfectly round with no fat on it...yet ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe billionaire began to drum his own belly, and when the laughter of everyone grew, the boy began to rub and bang on each other's guts, everyone laughing happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the bushes - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marik, what's happening now?\" Bakura said, absent mindedly stuffing another taco into his mouth. Marik hadn't stopped eating, but his abs were in no way effected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it'll go straight to his tiny ass...\" Bakura wondering, the though caused him to snicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=\" target=\"_blank\">http://browse.deviantart.com/?qh=</a>\u00a7ion=&amp;global=1&amp;q=marik+butt#/d49o8m2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik's heart rate was sky high. \"They seem to be...well they're\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik turned to face the Brit, Bakura's round, pale belly still exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at? Hey! Don't you...ooo\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik had begun to rub Bakura's swollen waist, his warm, tan hands gently stroking Bakura's round, full belly. \"Oh...that's amazing.\" Bakura moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik stopped suddenly, picking up the binoculars \"They're on the move! Get up Bakura!\" Marik shouted, pulling the limey to his feet and running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait!\" Bakura said, stumbling after him, looking and feeling nine moths pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami and Kaiba had left Burger World, strutting out proudly, their amazingly full guts on display, their \"audience\" applauding loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Yami and Kaiba's laughter subsided a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, maybe you are't so bad after all Yugi, for a nerd.\" the billionaire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, same to you, for an asshole.\" Yami said playfully, nudging Kaiba in the belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, this was just, you know, just a one time thing.\" Kaiba said gulping. \"I mean, if we eat like this all the time we'll get fat...and it's not like I even liked eating that much.\" Kaiba said, subconsciously his hands caressed his rounded belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I know...same.\" Yami said, his hands mimicking Kaiba's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh..,It's only polite for me to offer the loser a ride home.\" Kaiba set with a small burp, a limo pulling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it'd be rude to refuse.\" Yami said, smiling, and patting Kaiba's belly, sending a shiver up the billionaire's spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I had a lot of fun.\" They both said unanimously, sitting down inside the car, their full, round, exposed guts resting in their laps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car pulled out of burger world.</span></div></div>",

The dome of his belly was still as taut as a drum. His mouth still tasted of pastry, gravy and minced beef. A dozen thoughts ran through his head, a lot of them concerning over which diets would help him the most. He knew that the Board of Directors would start to ask any number questions about commitment, energy and public image, if they saw him like this. Not to mention the relief he would have after a monotony of pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, his thoughts returned to that moment, that contest, not an hour ago. He had experienced things, done things, said things that only yesterday would have been an anathema to him. He indulged himself in local pastry, he won an eating contest of all things, and, above all, he had laughed and joked with his rival! It had been aeons since he had shared a moment of levity with his brother! Tonight, it would have seemed as if he and Yami had been friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch a thought repulsed him and fascinated him at once. He silently continued to ponder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami stared out of the ceiling window, his head resting on his palms. His mind was wandering; already he was imagining what his host would say if he saw the aftermath of this evening, but other thoughts began to creep in. Before long, he could see the alabaster monuments of temples of his ancient kingdom. He could remember the feasts and revelries held in the honour of the Gods. For the first time in a very long time, he could remember those nights of feasting and song. His lips curled into a smile as he stroked his belly; was this the reason why? Had his eating contest with Kaiba awakened those memories? Would he have to continue eating to enjoy those treasured memories again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe silently chuckled at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to face Kaiba. Certainly, the two had done something extraordinary this evening, feasting, dancing, laughing and joking with each other, all thoughts of rivalries and grudges pushed aside. Perhaps it was just a passing ceasefire between the two. Perhaps the two would return to their old scores by this time the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence continued to fill the limo.</span></div></div>",

The movement re-exposed the billionaire's round, smooth belly, to which Yugi's eyes darted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba noticed this, and quickly pulled his sweater back over it. \"I just figured, with you being able to eat so much is all, it's not like I really want you there.\" Kaiba gave the Pharaoh's belly a slap<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys turned to the door as it opened.

He stood in front of the full length mirror in Yugi's bedroom, taking in his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would definitely be gaining a bit more plush from this meal. His belly was still round and taunt, and he could tell very small love handles would soon be emerging on his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shed his underwear, and turned to get a better view of his newly-developed butt. It was round and full, not very big, but much bigger than the non-exist bony-bottom he had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaked, Yami let his softening body fall back into his soft bed. His full gut still felt like it would burst, and he rub the smooth expanse of it as he drifted off to sleep, quietly wondering what Kaiba would serve tomorrow morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the limo, Kaiba re-examined why he'd even thought to invite Muto. He didn't like...he could just eat a lot. And Kaiba didn't want to waste all that food. He rarely let the two guards at his apartment eat, he never ate breakfast, and Mokuba would eat too many pancakes and then often times throw up, leaving an almost buffet of food uneaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, he just wanted to see Yugi eat it was all. His mouth chewing rapidly, his little gut swelling, pushing his shirt up. His tiny ass ballooning from all the calories. Kaiba's hands running over Yugi fat mound of a belly, Yugi feeding Kaiba, Kaiba's belly getting bigger and fatter- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba snapped back with a shake of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just... didn't want to waste food was all. That was it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the front of the limo. - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Steve, the Pharaoh will be over Kaiba's tomorrow! Excellent! We shall sneak in to the room next-door and keep watch. Pass me another taco would you Bakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik's abs of steel still held firm, and looked even more ripped next to Bakura's painfully over-stuffed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god..is it possible to feel like a starving dog and a stuffed pig?\" The limey said, shoving another taco down his throat and moaning in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bakura...\" Marik said, concern in his voice. His warm, tanned hands slipped under the Brit's skin-tight shirt and began too rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe limo drove off into the night....</span></div></div>",

Foam began to gather at the corners of his mouth, his eyes twitched without rhyme or reason or readiness to stop, his fists clenched until the knuckles turned white and his breath exited his nostrils in visible clouds. Even Yami looked nervous. From within the mirror, he shuffled his feet, his eyes darting from side to side; he looked like a small child being scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I let you take control outside of card games... and you... you...\" Yugi spluttered through his teeth. He gave up and spent many more minutes pacing about the room. The effects of Yami's midnight feast were much more noticeable on Yugi now; the round, taut dome of his belly had shrunk while he slept, albeit slightly, and had become a soft, bouncing mound of dough that jiggled with each step he took. His hips and thighs had flared out overnight as well, forcing him to sway slightly with each step. He could not see what happened to his buttocks, but he could tell that they had been inflated with food as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his pear-shaped torso was the most striking change, everywhere else had still become softer and plushier than he had been the day before. His cheekbones felt less defined, he felt a second chin developing and his arms had lost all definition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all because Yami was peckish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Yugi turned to face his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami looked uncomfortable. \"Well, Yugi, would you believe me if I said it was a pie eating contest with Seto Kaiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi sighed, his head lowered. \"Sure. Why not? At least tell me you won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so you pigged out in my body in an eating contest, and you didn't win. What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then he invited me - us? - over to his place for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi's brow furrowed. \"Why would he - tell me you said no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth froze as someone knocked on the door.</span></div></div>",

Yugi squirmed a bit, attempting to get more comfortable, and his recently rounded rump edged the bed up a bit too high, causing it to hit the nightstand, sending a lamp crashing to its untimely demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I really gotten this big?\" Yugi wondered nervously. Yami's feast had certainly pushed him over the wall from pudgy to chubby, but that had more to do with the King of Games stature being so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Pharaoh had thought the exact same sentence, but his reaction was one of intrigued and... arousal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming in!\" With that, the door to the game shop was violently kicked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing there was no way this person wouldn't have heard the lamp shatter, Yugi quickly stumbled out from under the bed, shoved on a pair of underwear, and began to cram himself into a pair of almost too small leather pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps grew closer and closer to his bedroom and Yugi struggled to get his pants over his pudgy thighs, his bulging butt. His body began to glisten with the struggle, and just as the button closed beneath his deepening navel the door burst open,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in the frame of the doorway, stood Mokuba Kaiba. Behind him hovered two much taller guards in sharp, black suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! I've got a-\" Mokuba's voice dropped off, and his eyes widened. He quickly crossed the room and stood at arms length next to the shirtless Yugi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King of Games could only blush and gape as Mokuba's small hands reached out and quickly squeeze Yugi small, but very much existent love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...Big Bro wasn't kidding last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't kidding? Wasn't kidding about what?\" Yugi asked, his anger rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two really did eat a lot! Ha ha ha!\" Mokuba's face brightened, and Yugi's anger was forced to dissipate in the presence of such a happy child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man Yugi, I don't know what you did, but when Big Bro came home last night he was...happy!\" Yugi's eyed widened, and the Pharaoh was paying full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...he was?\" Yugi croaked out, his anger now replaced by complete confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I had made him cookies that morning...and then I'd liked making cookies so I just made them all day..and usually when I make stuff Seto just stares and walks away, but this time he laughed and said I did a great job! Then he stayed up all night talking to the guards!\" Mokuba's speech was quick and exicted, and Yugi looked behind him as one of the gaurds burped. Judging by the well-muscled men's swollen bellies, they'd also enjoyed Mokuba's cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just couldn't believe it! He was so happy he'd beaten you and I read somewhere that carbs make you happy and you two must have eaten a lot of carbs cause his belly was soooo big! And I just...\" With this Mokuba pressed himself into the chubby King of Games, \"...I just had to come over and make sure you were coming. Seto said something about it last night, and i know it's so weird but...I've never seen Seto that happy. You just have to come over! You HAVE TOO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pharaoh sat in quiet anticipation as Yugi collected the facts in his mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami had lost an eating contest to Seto Kaiba<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had apparently had a good time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young boy was near crying on his shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the eff was happening to his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pharaoh...I can't deal with all this right now...I'm going to leave this one up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Yami became in active control of Yugi's body. Growing taller, the fat deposited on Yugi readjusted to his new height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pharaoh's round mound of a belly was most prominent. Big, but not quite as large as it had seemed on Yugi, the same went for his badonkadonk of a bottom. His pants were still very tight, showing off his newly developed lower body, put mostly accentuating just hoe large his middle had become compared to the skinny ruler he was before. Whereas Yugi looked like a thin boy that had noticeably put on weight, Yami seemed more like a guy that had let himself go a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami...</span></div></div>",

In Yugi giving his softening body over to the Pharaoh, it had grown it's usual couple of feet skyward. Mokuba, having been hanging on to Yami's neck at the time, was lifted off his feet, and now wrapped his little legs around Yami's newly-bellied, shirtless torso like a frightened Koala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either could speak again, on of the stuffed guards approached Mokuba. Obviously not used to being so full, the man's hands groped at his tighter pockets until he pulled out a small phone with a screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face of Seto Kaiba appeared on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mokuba!\" I shouted, somewhat angry. \"Where are yo-Oh. I see.\" Kaiba said, realizing his little brother had gone to Yugi's to ensure the Pharaoh's breakfast attendance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Seto!\" Mokuba said, beaming. He shimmied down off the King of Games, and stood next to him. His head a exactly the same level as the Pharaoh's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba blushed. \"Yugi, are you free? I'm just remember I had a meeting this morning with someone about something called \"Dungeon Dice Monsters\", but I can cancel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seto you have to cancel!\" Mokuba angrily through his hand up, accidentally slapping Yami's pudge. A ripple coursed through his newly formed belly, making it seem much fatter than it actually was. Kaiba and Yami went even redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually alright Kaiba\" Yami said bending down, the fat on his belly becoming rolls. Kaiba gulped. Yami noted Kaiba's belly was still spherical, so it appeared the billionaire had been eating all night like Mokuba had said. It was impossible to tell if he'd gain any weight, but with his height it wouldn't be entirely noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a little bit to think some things over, why don't we grab dinner tonight?\" The last words fell out of Yami's mouth, and all eyes widened. Had he asked out Seto Kaiba?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a date?\" Mokuba asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't a date Mokuba.\" Kaiba retorted, shifting his seating, his shirt riding up to expose an inch of full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like a date sir.\" One of the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't a date!\" Kaiba said, lifting his arms over his head, his shirt riding up completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami's nose almost started to bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a big as yesterday, if not a big bigger. There didn't seem to be any fat on Kaiba, but he had definitely been stuffing himself all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba blushed and pulled his shirt down. \"Alright, I'll see you tongiht Yugi. Why don't you come over? We'll talk advertising some new games I'd like you as the face of, maybe order some pizzas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Seto never eats pizza</i> Mokuba thought, <i>It was always too unhealthy</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll see you tonight then Kaiba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Is it a date?</span></div></div>",

Tell Yugi he's a friggin' putz!\" He waved cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get down, you <b>bloody</b> airhead!\" Bakura groaned trying to keep his hyperactive partner down while trying to get over the stomachache he was going through thanks to Marik stuffing him with tacos. That large pale belly poked out of the bush for a minute before he finally subdued the evil blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough dumbfounded, Yugi thought of a quick solution to his plight. \"Yamato, you gotta come with me to Kaiba's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, <i>me</i>? But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've always wanted to work at KaibaCorp, haven't you? And you've wanted to meet Seto Kaiba for a while now, <i>haven't you</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, but I don't think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled! Besides, you need to build up your confidence anyways! What better way than with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami just stood there, rubbing his own belly while watching the two squabble. \"Can we just go?\" He thought. \"All this bickering is building up an appetite...\"</span></div></div>",

It did not take long for the steward to be found. Bowing and smiling, the uniformed young woman spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, sir, and I see you have brought a friend.

Yamato's legs were twitching like a hyperactive squirrel, now that he was standing in front of his role model. Yugi glanced over at his friend, who was in a cold sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u7a4f\u3084\u304b\u4fdd\u3061\u3001\u305d\u308c\u3092 ;\u5931\u3046\u3053\u3068\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093 ;... \u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u3001\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u3053\u3068 \u306b\u306a\u308b\u3060\u308d\u3046... \" He whispered to himself as he wiped the sweat from his brow. Yugi knew Yamato would delve into speaking in his native tongue when he was nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Yugi! I'm glad you made it. It may sound odd, considering I've wanted to crush you and take my title back, but that breakfast made me realize something. Something I've been blind to all this time. You are a worthy opponent Yugi, and perhaps if we congrigated outside the field of battle, we could actually become f... fr... frr...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends?\" Yugi perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends.\" Seto spat out. \"I don't know, maybe it's just something inside warming me up. Mokuba told me the ice around my heart is melting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kaiba got up, the two noticed something different about him. About a couple hundred pounds difference, in fact. Yugi was amazed that Kaiba was now at least 3 times as big the last time they met. That white suit of his must've been tailored to fit his massive size, and now it was resting comfortably upon his massive stomach and corplulent man breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi chuckled. \"I guess it's not the only thing warming you up, Kaiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" Kaiba hummed as he waddled in front of the two, jiggle and all. He turned his attention to Yamato, who was blushing beet red. \"You must be Yamato Yoshida. I've heard about you; you're technological knowledge could prove useful in my company.\" He reached out his pudgy hand for a handshake. Yamato hesitated at first, but then shook his hand. \"Maybe we can discuss more about your new position over breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u79c1\u306e\u9670\u56a2\u306f\u3001\u591a\u304f\u306e ;\u7740\u8272\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b ;\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u3057\u3066\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044.\" Yamato said, still nervous and not in control of his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes.\" Kaiba smiled, and at that moment no puppies died. This time. \"Now, let's head into my private dining room. You must be starving. I know I am. Maybe we'll put some meat on your bones, Yamato.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamato chuckled, still recovering from his fangasm, but following his fatty friend and blubbery boss into the dining room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few seconds, neither of them moved an inch. Both Yami and Kaiba were staring at the last pie on the table with a hard gaze. Seeing that the other wouldn't move on either side, one decided to make the final move of the competitive rivalry. Yami leaned forward and stretched his arm out, grabbing the pie and moving back into his original position. Kaiba stared at his rival with a surprised expression written all over his face, wondering how did he have the energy to move at all. Yami shot multiple looks between Kaiba and the last pie he held in his hand. With one last groan erupting from his pudgy, bloated, and full stomach, Yami placed the pie into his mouth, chewing on it voraciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, the pie was swallowed and Yami was declared the winner. He smiled in content, as he looked at Kaiba. The rival slouched in his seat a bit, giving him a neutral look as he sighed. Yami tried to get up, but found the deed a little difficult with his belly rubbing against the edge of the table. He managed to get up, and walked over to the other side to where Kaiba was. He stood in front of him. \"As you know, I have won this competition. But, I must say, it was rather enjoyable.\" Yami held out his hand for Kaiba to shake with. Kaiba, being as stubborn as he was, took about two minutes to get over the loss and face his rival like a man. But, before he could shake hands with his rival, the two boys heard a low grumbling coming from one of the stomachs. Both, realized that Yami's stomach was the culprit behind the grumbling. A few people around the other tables also heard the noise. Even Yugi heard it from his soul room and wondered what the noise was and where was it coming from. Some people got up and ran away when they theorized what might happen in a few moments. Sadly, that theory did not live on. But another did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami looked down at his bloated belly, and grabbed the flabby orb by the middle, wondering why it was making that awkward noise. He got his answer. As his stomach made another low grumble, he felt it get a tiny bit bigger under his hands. Kaiba, who was staring at the belly the whole time, also noticed the small growing. \"What in the name of Ra is going on?\" Yami asked. And then, the cause hit his lower extremities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami felt his pants get tighter as his legs and thighs grew a bit more than his belly did. A few tears could be seen around the seams of his leather chamber as the fabric didn't have any more fight in it. His rear also grew out, causing Yami to, unconsciously, reach behind and grip the two plump cheeks, effortlessly trying to push it back in. Yami's belly sagged further by an inch when the button on his pants popped off, flying towards Kaiba. Awkwardly, the button collided itself exactly with the button on Kaiba's pants. This triggered a \"chain reaction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Yami's pants' button impacting with Kaiba's, both buttons dug a centimeter into his belly. Kaiba looked down at his own pudgy belly, as it sent Yami's button flying again, not after his button popped off. His belly, with no resistance holding it back, sagged over the waistband, causing the fly on his zipper to shoot down. Although he couldn't see it, Kaiba could feel part of his light-blue underwear, with chicks (chickens), sticking out of the v-shaped opening. He went red in the face since his underwear was never displayed in public. But, what happened to the other flying button?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Idea for Kaiba's underwear: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://katana-tate.deviantart.com/art/YGO-Underwear-models-Seto-138871489\" target=\"_blank\">http://katana-tate.deviantart.com/art/YG...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Yami's button flew off Kaiba's belly, it was sent at a fast speed. It made a collision, once again, with Yami, but in a different place this time. That's right. The button impacted with the area of Yami's... groin. After making impact, it bounced off his pants and landed on the table. Yami, instinctively, gasped and removed his hands from his bulbous rear and grabbed his groin through the pants. Yami accidentally bent down a bit from the small pain, and another noise could be heard. A loud tear, echoing through the whole place, confirmed that the seat of Yami's leather pants could not hold together as it ripped wide open. Yami looked back to notice this as his black boxers with red flames was now a piece of eye-candy for everyone to see. Yami was left \"petrified\" at the dilemma that had just sprung out. Kaiba got out of his seat, trying to cover his underwear in the process, and took a peek for himself at the sight before him. He smirked. \"Well, Muto. That's some 'show' you're putting on for everyone.\" He laughed at his own joke, while leaving Yami looking as dark red as a beet. Since he was laughing out of control, Kaiba put his hands over his belly and leaned back. But, he didn't realize what was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Kaiba was too busy laughing, he failed to notice that his own were starting to slip down his legs, revealing more of his underwear. Due to the fact that, his button wasn't on his person, his zipper was down, and the main fact that his underwear was made from spandex, were all good reasons for his pants to start slipping down. Kaiba cut off his laughter, abruptly, as he felt his pants collide with floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami noticed this, went wide-eyed, and started smiling a smile that had never been seen on him. \"I don't think you're one to talk about 'showing off.' Are those little chicks I see?\" It was Kaiba's turn to go dark red in the face, just as Yami had. Yami, however, was too busy laughing at his own remark. Soon, a few other giggles and laughs could be heard from other customers as they looked at the sight bestowed upon them. And, it truly was a sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

He's also extremely familiar with most electronic devices and can know how to operate and/or repair them in a short amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Notable Strengths</b>: As long as his friends are around, he's confident in himself. He's also a little too full of himself when it comes to nerdly wisdom, technological knowhow, or anything related to video games.<br>\r\n<b>Notable Weaknesses</b>: He's shy and timid around others, and doesn't like to approach first. He's also not very good at sports or social situations. He also has a weak will, especially when Runihura takes control of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Physical Appearance</b>: Long luscious black hair, azure eyes and a pale tan shade to his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Usual Attire</b>: A red &amp; white T-shirt with brown jeans and a black belt w/silver buckle. Wears fingerless gloves that match his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Inventory</b>: He keeps his duel disk and deck in a safe place somewhere in his room, and seems to keep the Black Emerald in arm's reach. Other than that, he'll usually carry his handheld gaming system and cell phone around in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Deck Theme</b>: Runs a Spirit deck, as Yamato is also quite fascinated with mythology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Personality Details</b>: Shy and soft-spoken, unless he's with someone who likes the same things as him. Often when that happens, he's prone to speaking complete techno-babble while nerdgasming. He's also into reading graphic novels and B-list monster movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Backstory</b>: Before he moved to Domino City, Yamato was a lonely Japanese kid with no friends. He kept himself close to his mother when he felt scared or alone, or when he missed his father who had mysteriously vanished sometime after his birth. The last thing he gave his son before his absence was the Black Wdjat Emerald, a mysterious artifact he purchased after a trip to the states. Because of financial trouble, they had to move to Domino City to try and make a better life for themselves. That was when Yamato met Yugi and company, and finally found a group of true friends. One of Yamato's biggest role models is Seto Kaiba, and hopes one day he'll be good enough to work at KaibaCorp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Close Friends</b>: Yugi Muto, Joey Wheeler, Tea Gardner, Tristan Taylor, Ryou Bakura<br>\r\n<b>Worst Enemies</b>: None<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Habits</b>: When he's nervous or scared, he'll often talk to himself in his native tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Likes</b>: Video games, board games, card games (including Duel Monsters), electronics, technology, mythology, graphic novels, monster movies<br>\r\n<b>Dislikes</b>: Sports, exercising, mocking his interests, bullies, anyone who threatens his friends (despite not being in positions to do much about it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Phobias and Mental Illnesses</b>: Because of the Emerald's negative influence on him, Yamato sometimes has delusions of such things as hearing 'voices' coming from the Emerald when he's by himself.<br>\r\n<b>Physical Disabilities</b>: None.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Character Alignment</b>: Lawful Good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Theme Song(s)</b>: Noble Spirit - www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqWioC\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Miscellaneous Trivia</b>: Yamato really doesn't like being called Blackie, so much he'll delve into blurting Japanese profanities when people keep referring to him as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Full Name</b>: <b>Runihura Ammon</b> <br>\r\n<b>Also Known As</b>: Yami Yamato, Dark Yamato, The Hidden Destroyer, The Shadow King, Runi, Blackie.<br>\r\n<b>Race/Species</b>: Spirit<br>\r\n<b>Gender</b>: Male<br>\r\n<b>Age</b>: 3000 - 5000<br>\r\n<b>Birthday</b>: Unknown<br>\r\n<b>Birthplace</b>: The kingdom of Khu Kek.<br>\r\n<b>Current Residence</b>: Trapped in the Black Wdjat Emerald.<br>\r\n<b>Current Occupation</b>: Evil spirit, Self-proclaimed 'Shadow King', duelist.<br>\r\n<b>Heritage</b>: Egyptian.<br>\r\n<b>Sexual Orientation</b>: Gay.<br>\r\n<b>Marital Status</b>: Single<br>\r\n<b>Languages Spoken</b>: Egyptian, English<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Abilities, Skills, and Powers</b>: Is capable of coming up with complex plans in mere minutes, can use the Black Emerald's power to absorb the darkness in mortals, inflict curses, use telekinetic powers and even control those who are overtaken by the darkness within them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Notable Strengths</b>: He's always one step ahead thanks to careful planning and his superb intellect, and using the Black Emerald's dark power makes him nearly unstoppable.<br>\r\n<b>Notable Weaknesses</b>: His egotism and insistence that none of his plans can possibly fail can really come back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Physical Appearance</b>: Almost like an older Yamato, with a much more toned body and longer hair that appears to have too much volume. As well, his azure eyes are cold and glaring, and appears to suffer from insomnia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Usual Attire</b>: A red &amp; white T-shirt with brown jeans and a black belt w/silver buckle. Wears fingerless gloves that match his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Inventory</b>: The Black Wdjat Emerald, which usually levitates around him when he's controlling Yamato's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Deck Theme</b>: Runs an all-around Dark deck focusing on Fiends &amp; Zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Personality Details</b>: Cold, calculating and gentlemanly, although he hides his sick, twisted nature behind a civil facade. He also doesn't care for present day mortals and has a supreme lack of empathy. It was once thought that he was once a good soul before the Black Emerald corrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Backstory</b>: Once the proud king of Khu Kek, the desert kingdom of darkness, Runihura had to take the throne by force when his father proclaimed he was unfit to rule. Unfortunately for his family, Runihura had already stolen the kingdom's prized possession, the Black Wdjat Emerald (created by the Millennium Spellbook long before the Millennium Items), and used it to destroy his family and anyone who would rebuke his right to the throne. Afterwards, he sought to expand his kingdom for the good of his people, but crossed the line when he committed genocide against the neighboring City of Light. He was eventually overthrown by a rebel group of his own subjects when it was clear that the Emerald was poisoning his mind and was too far gone. Runihura anticipated such an ambush, and willingly sealed his soul within the Emerald, promising vengeance upon the future descendants of the traitors. Even now, he watched from the Black Emerald, using Yamato as a vessel and awaiting his opportunity to rebuild his kingdom for the 'better'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Close Friends</b>: Although he doesn't have any present day friends, he's not above forming alliances with fellow evildoers, such as Yami Bakura or Yami Marik<br>\r\n<b>Worst Enemies</b>: Anyone who opposes him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Habits</b>: Those large, bat-wing bangs of his tend to rise, fall and react to whatever emotion Runihura is experiencing. Even though they're made of hair, they're oddly stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Likes</b>: Vengeance, Duel Monsters, Shadow Games, forming overly complex plans, torturing present-day mortals, games of wit, flaunting his intellect, flirting with equally attractive 'evil' men.<br>\r\n<b>Dislikes</b>: Foiling his plots, not submitting to him, present-day mortals, not being able to sleep, trying to adapt to modern world culture, and hates being called Blackie as much as Yamato does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Phobias and Mental Illnesses</b>: Megalomania, psychosis, and sadism.<br>\r\n<b>Physical Disabilities</b>: None.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Character Alignment</b>: Drifts between Lawful Evil and Chaotic Evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Theme Song(s)</b>: All Hail The Shadow King - www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0_5_T\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Miscellaneous Trivia</b>: Runihura watches from the shadows when Yamato is playing games or Duel Monsters because he can learn new tricks in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was lunchtime and the joint was packed with people, almost too much for the poor Japanese lad to handle. Suddenly, he felt someone grab at him by the head and put in a headlock! It was Joey, simply trying to mess with him by giving him a welcoming noogie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Yama', what's up? Nyeh heh heh!\" Said the blonde jokingly, still rubbing his knuckles into Yamato's jet black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did you have to do that..?\" Yamato replied, slightly annoyed. Poor guy wasn't used to joking around, though it was probably why they called him there. \"And why did you call me 'Yama'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would ya rather I called ya 'Blackie'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yama's fine, I guess. Ah hah...\" Came a weak chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so, heh. Well c'mon, Yamato! Yug' and I already ordered our lunch!\" Joey pulled Yamato into one of the booths near the open windows. Yugi was already sitting beside them, with Yamato squished in the middle. On the table was an unrealistic pile of food. Burgers, fries, onion rings, chicken snack wraps; it was almost as if the whole menu was on the table and tripled in number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wow...\" Yamato coughed. \"Did you think we needed all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of it as an initiation.\" Yugi smirked. The two wanted to introduce this new arrival into their circle of friendship, and what better way than with stuffing their faces? After all, Joey's big appetite, and Yugi's love of burgers shared only by Yamato himself, it seemed perfect. On the inside, he was very excited to prove himself to his new buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to d-d-d-dig in!\"</span></div></div>",

That was a good one, wasn't it Yug'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Yugi smiled, rubbing the sides of his swelled stomach. His tank top had rode up pretty far, almost exposing his developing moobs. \"I think we can say for sure that you're our new friend, Yamato. Not that you weren't going to be, but we just wanted to have some first-impression fun.\" He chuckled, patting his stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh... Ulp... Thanks, Yugi. You two are much better than my old so-called friends...\" Yamato smiled. In his old hometown, he was a big target for bullying thanks to his nerdy interests and being sheltered. He winced a little bit, remembering the painful atomic wedgies he'd get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyeh? Don' worry about them, buddy! We're your pals now!\" Joey reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, friends who'll always be together!\" Yugi added. \"Group hug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they moved in for a hug, their bellies sloshed and rippled up against each other. All three had a slight blush with this warm, soft hug. So much that it gave Joey an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, how about we move this partay to my place! I got some new stuff there that will really liven things up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamato grinned. \"Yes! No one's ever invited me to their house before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss those days of bullying goodbye, Yamato!\" Yugi chimed, wrapping his arm around the raven-haired boy. \"Because with us, we'll have your back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamato just beamed with happiness. He finally had a feeling of acceptance. As the three walked out of Burger World, Yugi and Joey tried to keep Yamato steady. Being the winner of the eating contest they had, his belly was the biggest and heaviest.</span></div></div>",

His large, sharp bangs drooped as he lost himself in the falling rain. This modern world was taking a toll on his already demented mind. He wished he could just leave the planet in ruin, and take back his rightful place as the dark lord that once ruled his long-forgotten home, the kingdom of Khu Kek. Not even remembering the first genocidal war he spearheaded against the rival City of Light so many centuries ago couldn't bring a smirk to his face. Deep inside, the shadows of hatred churned within his very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his host's cell phone rang. \"Oh Ra, what now?

And by proposition, I mean non-paying position! Join me and my evil council and we shall defeat Yugi Muto once and for all!\" The Egyptian heartthrob hammed it up over the line, though it proved useless. Runihura never had any interest in joining some run-of-the-mill villain club. He was more of a lone ranger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this about that starfish-headed kid again, Marik? I already told you, my beef is with the world, not a baby panda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bu-but I know the secret to his power!

It started to get louder, now joined by a distraught moan. \"...Please tell me you aren't making the sad puppy-eyed quivering lip face again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing but a pained moan came from the blond's mouth. Runihura could sympathize with Bakura's own annoyed groan heard over the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Fine, Marik!\" Runihura gave in. \"But if this goes about as well as I think it will, I'll be using that tattoo of yours as my personal bath towel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friggin' sweet!\" Marik exclaimed. \"We'll be right there!\" *click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ra damn it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a tricked out motorcycle soon came to the front of the Yoshida apartment. Marik and Bakura were indeed there in a flash, but something was different about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for, Runihura? Hop on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunihura eyed the Egyptian's waistline. Marik had put on a little weight, and his newly gained muffintop really showed. That midriff shirt was fabulous, but did nothing to hide it. Bakura tried not to make eye contact; he certainly was fatter than Marik, and his larger belly made his striped shirt ride up. He was so embarrassed and irritated at the same time, he kept looking away from his fellow evil spirit. In fact, he was so plump that he was stuck in one of the sidecars Marik put on his motorcycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hidden destroyer raised a brow. \"I'm sorry, I'm waiting for Marik Ishtar. You know, the one with the washboard abs and womanly fashion sense?\" He snarked before turning his attention to Bakura. \"And to think, the last I saw of you, you were tan, built and moderately sexy. Now you're all pale and flabby. Please tell me your host ate one too many cream puffs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik was unamused, neither was Bakura. \"Get in, smartass.\" He grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three rode off into the night, Runihura still had their newfound pudginess on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you sacrificed your abs, why?\" He asked in a rather droll tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all part of the plan, baby!\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Yu-Gi-Oh! was my first anime, and is still my most favorite anime to date. But like I said, these boys are so scrawny. It's time to dive into the Yu-Gi-Oh! universe and makes theses guy grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's basically just a weird do-what-you'd-like story, with a <i>few</i> rules to follow:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b>Only males can grow!</b>: The ratio of male to female expansion, at least in Yu-Gi-Oh!, tips far too much in the female's favor. I mean, sheesh, we have so many guys (good-looking guys to boot), there has to be some ways to blow 'em up. Females are allowed in the stories, but not allowed to grow themselves.<br>\r\n-<b>Absolutely no weight restrictions!</b>: Let's face it, it isn't as much fun unless they get ridiculously huge. Therefore, make them as big as you like!<br>\r\n-<b>Gassiness, slobiness and sweatiness is allowed!</b>: Since this is a primarily fetish-driven story, there's no problems if you want to include any of these.<br>\r\n-<b>No lethal popping/bursting or vore, please!</b>: I have no problems with non-lethal popping and vore, but please keep it to a down-low. <br>\r\n-<b>Yaoi is perfectly fine!</b>: Hell, especially with Bakura/Marik, it's encouraged! Just be sure that the couples aren't too outrageous, okay?<br>\r\n-<b>Weirdness is also encouraged!</b>: Try to think of weird, new ways to get these dudes to embiggen. Be it magical children's cards or some just plain otherworldly strangeness, just so long as it at least tries to blend in with the Yu-Gi-Oh! universe.<br>\r\n-<b>Canon and/or Abridged personalities are acceptable!</b>: May depend on choice, but in these stories it's up to you. Comedy is not discouraged.<br>\r\n-<b>Any males from the original Yu-Gi-Oh!, GX, 5Ds, and Zexal are allowed!</b>: Although I prefer the original, I have no qualms if you want to expand any of the guys from GX, 5Ds, or Zexal. <br>\r\n-<b>Including male fan characters is alright!</b>: I know it's a stretch, but even I have two Yu-Gi-Oh! fan characters that I wouldn't mind including in the story (and porking up, as well!). If you want to include your male FCs, send me a message about them. I'd love to know them before including them, and I'd love to share mine in return!<br>\r\n-<b>Have fun!</b>: Just to make this come out great, remember to have fun with it!<br>\r\n</td>",
