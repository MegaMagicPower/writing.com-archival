He wondered why it was acting like that, and why it hadn't hurt either of them. He reached out to the dragon...<br>\r\nThe dragon looked at his hand and sniffed it. He felt like he was going to lose his hand, but the dragon purred and put its nose into his hand...<br>\r\nAfter a brief moment he felt the dragon... he felt its strong breaths and muscles... as the bond, as it were, sent him the feelings of the dragon he felt that the dragon was a ...</span></div></div>",

Cassey did with a bit of timidness. Dragons were dangerous and well she didn't know if the dragon that was here with us was dangerous.<br>\r\n\"Watch her while I get her some food.\" Jake said. <br>\r\nAfter she started petting the dragon; the dragon crumbled and laid on her belly taking the attention.<br>\r\nJake ran down the stairs and out the back door... he was suprised no one else saw him, but it was a simple task to get a bucket of dog food from the dog food barrel and carefully run it back... He snuck inside as he went to the stairs... he heard voices: \"Well these children should be adopted not taken if a dragon selects them, besides are the rides going to take good care of them?\"<br>\r\nTake good care? Like the keeper of the orphanage did such a good job. The nanny and the keeper only gave children that bowed to her whims all the rest were kept locked up when a prospecting couple came along looking for a child or two to adopt. And you knew if you were a chosen child or not because the nanny would personally look at all the children and pick the ones that were picked. She didn't want to give away children to the riders for the reason of who knows what...<br>\r\n\"All children will be given a chance. All of them, not the select few, and we will know if you are showing all of the children.\" The voice said.<br>\r\nThe keeper sounded upset but she didn't voice her complaint instead she said, \"Fine, but next time I will not allow it!\"<br>\r\nJake hurried up the stairs before he was found out. He returned finding that Cassey had made the dragon roll over, the dragon was purring happily as she wagged her tail. After you took a few steps into the room the dragon got up and hopped over to you chirping with joy. You smile and pet the dragon before setting the bucket down. The dragon sniffed the food, then took a testing bite. It chirped, a bit disappointed but not completely as she dug her head into the bucket again. perhaps she was saying that it didn't taste good, but she would eat it as it was the only food that was provided...</span></div></div>",

Jake hid the bucket as he figured the Keeper would be coming up. But that left the dragon, so he looked around... there was the door to the bathroom that was broken... He and Cassey heard steps coming up the stairs, so he lead the dragon to the bathroom and opened the door, 'Stay here.' He said to the dragon as he and Cassey went and looked busy after he closed the door. The door to the room opened and the keeper was there. She said, \"Come children.\" She said as Jake and Cassey came to her...<br>\r\n\"Go outside there is a choosing happening.\" She said as she pointed to the stairs... Jake and Cassey followed her order and walked down stairs as she presumably went on to get the other children... They were the first outside.<br>\r\nThey saw the truck again this time all the dragons were outside of the truck, some looking at orphanage, others were looking like they didn't want to be here.<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes all the other children came outside...<br>\r\nWell the 'Choosing had started. and well Jake and Cassey wanted to chosen by one of these dragons. Well Cassey got a black dragon, but every dragon that looked at Jake whined and looked to the next candidate. It happened several times, then one of the men there came up to him and asked, \"So kid do you have a dragon already?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, there was a dragon in there and she let me pet her...\"<br>\r\nThe man shook his head, \"So you were already chosen, well call her or go get her.\" <br>\r\nJake nodded and because she had no name he had to go get her, so he Dashed into the house to the room. There he opened the door and let her out. <br>\r\n\"Come on, lets go outside!\"<br>\r\nThe dragon chirped and followed.<br>\r\nAs soon as they were outside he was greeted by the others that had been chosen, the few that were left were the brainwashed children... only one of them were chosen as he seemed to have retained some individuality.<br>\r\nThe men from before looked over the dragon and shook their head.<br>\r\n\"She just couldn't wait... well come with us.\" The man said </span></div></div>",

They stopped her and gave her the facts along with the need of the dragonets that had chosen the few children out of about thirty. It was myself, Cassey and a few others. But the rest were stuck there. To grow up and go on with their lives, or to get a family to grow up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour saw us packing the few belongings we had and getting in the vans provided for us. Our dragons seated next to us... Mine loved on me as did another with her chosen human... Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides that that started our lives.<br>\r\nThe first year we learned of how to care for our dragons, oiling and cleaning the scales and skin. Cleaning ourselves. Then just making our dragon, or dragoness, happy. The second year saw us training to fly, we all thought the dragons grew fast, well they did, but not in the matter of months that I imagined. It was over the course of a year that saw her big enough for me to climb onto her back, but not fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact we had been band from flying until they said we could. I didn't like that, and Lilly shared my dislike.<br>\r\nLilly... that is what I called my dragoness, she rejected any other name, noble or not. Till I called her Lilly. She liked that name and loved me for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis year we found that she could fly. And well she had to exercise those wings. Well because we wanted to fly, I had to encourage her to exercise her wings so that they grew strong, and brought us that much closer to flying.<br>\r\nI looked over the exercieses she did, two stretches and two wing workouts. That was all that they had for it. No amount of thought found any other that could be done besides putting weight on her wings, which I asked and the other tamers discouraged such attempts. So She had to work it at that level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time she grew stronger, and her wings grew bigger too because of it. After that she grew a bit more. <br>\r\nI thought it was an average growth, but once I saw the other dragons of the group and saw they didn't grow, I asked around... a few theories came up: She was a queen dragoness, next was she wanted to fly so bad that she grew, and last was the exercises we did forced her body to grow bigger to support it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless there was more dragoness for me.<br>\r\nOn the last of the year we were given the go ahead for short flights, and only to the point of discomfort for our dragons. Lilly had no such problems and we flew often. We were granted longer flights because of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the third year I had to find my place among the dragon tamers, there were three faction: one of trainers and searchers, two of riders, and three of hunters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrainers and searchers took dragonets out and looked around different towns and orphanages to find children that the dragons would look for. <br>\r\nRiders, they worked with their dragons to explore the world, serve in a military service, and keep the peace between wild dragons and humans.<br>\r\nHunters, had the job of providing for the covenants of dragon tamers. Covenants were everywhere, and they needed hunters to go and get the wild beasts or herds of domesticated cows, goats and other herd animals for food for the dragons, They may even fish if they live near a big enough body of water, namely an ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found my place among the...</span></div></div>",

To keep the dragons fed and happy in that area. Even though dragons ate but twice a month once they were fully grown, unless the situation called for something more energy. Even so Dragons stopped growing at five years of age, but were sexually mature at four... and the guys were saying I would find out just how active my dragoness was, especially during her first heat...

Till she started acting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst it was calm and tame, she became more lovey towards me. She would nuzzle me excessively, lick me wet, then nuzzle at my crouch. The first few times I was disturbed and pushed her large head from my crouch. However the next we she was more aggressive. She would pin me as she sniffed and nuzzle at my crouch. Eventually I started getting excited down there, it was there that I learned what those other Tamers meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreeding season for dragonesses were much worse than for their male counterpart as Cassey said her dragon didn't offer the same behavior only that his belly was warmer than usual. But he didn't claw at her unless she was on her period. He too was sensitive... which made sense as he would be attached to a female's scent... Oh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groan and blush as that thought line brought up why. She wanted to mate... and she didn't go around males as she wanted me and any other male would be raging to be with her. But then how did new dragons and dragonesses get born if the dragonesses mated with their riders?... <br>\r\nThat to had an answer as they would put the dragoness and dragon together and they would mate. I found a mating taking place in a safe room that was near the mating grounds...<br>\r\nI asked around and found that they didn't breed the dragons till they were read which was several seasons later, at least. They said to handle my dragoness on my own as she wasn't ready...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and looked to the entrance to her nest that we made together...</span></div></div>",
