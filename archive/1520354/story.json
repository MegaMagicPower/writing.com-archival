You moved into town just a few weeks ago, and have since been regretting it. This is your 26th time passing the Sawada residence on your way home from school. Ten of those times had been uneventful, three had been full of explosions, four had been shootouts, five were rampages of dangerous animals, two you were still trying to figure out, and one was a mine trap. You could only hope it\u2019d be an 11th uneventful pass and you could convince your parents to move before tomorrow came. That, or luck would continue to shine on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked away from the house and started to walk by, double checking the ground for nay kind of trap. There was no sounds coming from the house, so maybe no one was home. You thought you heard the second floor\u2019s screen window open, but you dared not look. Then it happened. You heard a single gunshot and that was it. You didn\u2019t even have time to hit the floor before your head went numb. You knew you\u2019d been shot and you hit the concrete hard before drifting into darkness. It was a mistake moving here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, your eyes fluttered open. You were, form what you could tell, alive. However, your head hurt like hell and your vision was all blurry. You reached up with your hand to touch the spot were you got shot, expecting to feel blood. To your surprise, all you felt was your hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened? I know I got shot, so why\u2026\u201d you began to say before your vision was back and a whole other problem presented itself. You were in a room\u2026a gigantic room. Everything was so huge and you could only have been an inch tall. You crawled backwards in shock until you felt yourself crawl onto paper. You looked behind you to see a giant note of some kind, with a message in colorful writing. You stood up and backed way to see the entire message. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ciao-su! Thank you for precipitating in the test of the new \u201cshrink bullet\u201d designed by the Vongola Family. You proved yourself worthy and here you are. Details on this bullet are sketchy, so I don\u2019t even know if there\u2019s a time limit or not. I hope to see results from your experiences.

You wince at the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, ow, ow, ow!\" Tsuna sits up and holds his aching head with his eyes shut. After a few more moments he cracks one of his brown orbs open to look at you. He screams again and darts off the bed, dashing toward the door and leaning his back against it while shaking and staring at your miniscule form on his bedroom floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-who are you?! H-how'd you get i-in here?! Why are you s-s-so small?!\" asked the junior-high student in a bundle. What's going on? You were the one who was shrunken to an inch, why was he scared out of his mind? You begin to explain yourself anyway, but your voice doesn't carry over to Tsuna. Realizing this, the young mob-boss gets down on his hands and knees and crawls over to you slowly until his face takes up your entire sight. And what a sight it was. \"Are you some kind of mini-assassin come to kill me?!\" You shake your head and start to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Erik.

You just stared back, not sure what to even say at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tsuna's finger rose up, and poked you in the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" You shout out, holding your tummy. Tsuna pulled back as well, scared by your sudden shout. \"Wh-What was that for?\" You asked, a little nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I was just wondering what you felt like!\" He said. It appeared as if he was scared of you too, despite the fact he was much bigger than you. He sat on his bed, looking down at the ground. Just what on earth was he supposed to do with this one-inch boy anyway? He looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just looking back up at him, wondering what he was going to do to you. Part of you wanted to run away and never come back, but you also knew that any sudden movement might make Tsuna think that you really WERE an assassin, and make him take action against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, to break the awkward silence, Tsuna's stomach made a loud growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry.\" He said, chuckling nervously as he looked down at you. You chuckled with him, but you also knew that you'd make the perfect after-school snack for the little mafia boss. He stood up, making sure to grab you in his palm as he headed to the kitchen.. He didn't hold you too tight, so it was a comfortable ride. However, at the same time, you could feel your heart race. You didn't really mind that he was heading to the kitchen... But why was he taking you with!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tsuna arrived at his destination, he set you down on the dining room table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't leave the table, okay?\" Tsuna said, giving you a serious look. Although you wanted to bolt for the door, somehow you figured that maybe you'd listen to the boy this once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a cat, you watched him as he moved around the kitchen. It looks like he was... Making something... But the question was, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after much suspense, Tsuna sits at the table. In front on him, you see...</span></div></div>",

At first you thought he had forgotten it and was going to get up again, but the teen remained seated and just looked down at you with a weird look in his eye. You started to get really nervous and your hands trembled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026where\u2019s the meat?\u201d you asked, gulping to clear your throat. Tsuna looks at you for a few more moments before sighing and replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight in front of me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks and you just stare into his eyes. Your lips move as if to say something, but nothing comes out. Eventually you manage to get the words out; \u201cWh-what\u2026are you t-talking about, T-Tsuna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you think you could trick me? I\u2019m always being tricked my mafia people like you and most of the time it almost kills me! Reborn is a crazy tutor, but even he wouldn\u2019t just shrink an innocent guy right off the street! In that note he wrote \u201cyou proved yourself worthy\u201d. He probably meant you\u2019re a skilled assassin who he found sneaking into the house! That\u2019s why he shrunk you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-that\u2019s crazy!\u201d you shout up at him. \u201cI\u2019m not an assassin! I told you; I was just walking hope from school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave it.\u201d Tsuna replied with as he separated his chopsticks. \u201cI\u2019m hungry and I need to get rid of you before you return to normal or something. This way I can kill two birds with one stone.\u201d Tsuna claps the two pieces of wood together and brings them down to you. You spin around and start running, not even thinking about where you were going to go. Tsuna, as skillful with chopsticks as any Japanese boy, easily grabbed you around the waist and lifted you off the tabletop. Your legs and arms flailed as Tsuna held you in front of his chest; the bowl of sauce just below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be happening\u2026!\u201d you tell yourself as you grab the chopsticks and try to pry them apart. You had eaten with chopsticks plenty of times before. All those nights at the dinner table with your family. Who would of thought they\u2019d be used to feed YOU to some boy?! \u201cTsuna\u2026please don\u2019t eat me!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant mafia boss ignored your pleas and quickly dipped you into the black sauce. You were submerged under the liquid and the familiar, strong taste filled your mouth until you closed it. After a few seconds in the sauce, Tsuna took you out and brought you before his face. Your clothes were drenched delicious sauce and you smelled just as good! The giant gave you a quick taste test with his tongue. As you hanged there, coughing from your little dip, you hoped he would find you disgusting and spare you. Unfortunately, Tsuna licks his lips with glee and crushed your hope a second later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about this\u2026\u201d Tsuna mutters before parting his lips and putting your tiny form into the hot cavern of his mouth. He uses his lips to slide you off the utensils, pulling the wooden sticks out\u2026but not you. He closed his lips all the way and began swishing you around his mouth. You screamed as the tongue tosses you around and presses you into his teeth, cheeks, and gums.  The sound of his moans filled the dark cave as he sucked on your body. It was almost scary to him how much he was enjoying his human snack! The delicious taste of the soy sauce just went so well with your natural flavor; even with your clothes on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d Tsuna hummed as your top half suddenly emerged from his big lips. He started sucking on your lower half, drenching it with even more saliva. You screamed up at him desperately, begging him to spit you out, but he seemed too transfixed on eating you and simply sucked you back into his mouth. You were really scared now. Tears were forming in your eyes, but it was hard to tell due to the salvia everywhere. The constant banging into his hard, while teeth hurt and your body was getting bruised up. Suddenly, the pink muscle underneath you rolled you next to his molars with your left arm right in top of one. Your eyes widened in horror and you looked up just as\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So good\u2026</i> Tsuna thought. <i>It tastes so good\u2026so succulent and meaty. Delicious\u2026meat\u2026taste\u2026inside.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Tsuna\u2019s turn to go wide eyed. At first he didn\u2019t quite know what happened, but then he heard you start screaming! You holler in pain as you looked to see Tsuna\u2019s teeth clamped down where your arm used to be. He had bitten it right off! It now laid between his teeth; crushed and mangled. You choked as you sobbed and your other arm gripped the bloody stump. He was really eating you\u2026chewing you up like any piece of food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna, however, didn\u2019t mean to do that. He was going to just swallow you whole and let his stomach deal with his troubles. But for a split second he had forgotten you were a human and bit down like he always did with tasty, soy sauce dipped meat. The usually gentle teen now felt his stomach start to twist as he broke out into a cold sweat. He dropped the chopsticks and brought one of his hands to his mouth. Your screaming was still going on\u2026what had he even crushed? Your leg? Your arm? An unimaginable amount of guilt started to weight down on the boy. He needed to spit you out now! Maybe he could still treat you; plus his saliva should be helping to control the bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026but then again, he could also taste your crimson blood as it dripped onto his tongue. The blood mixed with the soy sauce and created an amazing flavor that Tsuna wanted more of. He just couldn\u2019t help it; something deep inside him made him want to continue chewing and get more of that inside flavor. Besides\u2026maybe he would do you a favor by putting you out of your misery.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't take the sound of you shrieking in pain as your tiny arm was tossed down into the dark prison that was his stomach. Before you can feel even one more bit of pain, you black out in the hot, wet prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until a few hours later that you started to awaken. Your vision was really blurred. You could barely hear, but in the distance, you could faintly hear some kind of chirp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this... Heaven...?\" You somehow manage to choke out, very gently shaking your head. Then you can hear murmurs... They're somewhere nearby... After that, there's a dull click sound. You black out once more after hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good while. Hours passed, as you remained knocked out on what you figured was a soft, white cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you woke up again, everything pitch black. You managed to get the energy to sit up, and look around. \"O-Oh my god! Am I blind!?\" You think to yourself. You started to walk around, feeling your way around with your foot before taking each step. There were some ripples in this cloud, and each step was soft and squishy, the mateiral sinking under your every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was a light that blinded you. You tried to cover your eyes, but with one of your arms gone, you were only able to cover one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!\" You moan, falling on your back from the shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh! Hey!\" A voice called. There was a slight rumble as it approached you. You managed to sit up, and see a brown blue for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" The said. You could see movement coming from it as it spoke. As you vision focused, you saw that it was Tsuna. Instantly, your eyes widened as you backed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" You shout at him. \"Get away!\" As you did, you stood, and started to run to the other end of what you now saw was a bed. Certianly not a cloud. And this was no Heaven. If anything, it was Hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna crawled onto his bed, going after you. Soon, you were cornered, your back against his pillow. The only other choice was to jump off the edge of the bed. The giant-looking boy looked down at you. You looked back up at him. He was an intimidating force... Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe broke down in front of you, his adoreable brown eyes starting to well up with tears. \"I-I'M SORRY!!!\" He shouted. You have to cover your ears, or at least one of them, to keep from being deafened. \"I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!\" He went on, \"I never meant to bite off your limb! I wasn't even going to eat you! I-I just wanted to REALLY teach you a lesson, a-a-and...\" Tsuna couldn't even for the words anymore as he laid his head on the bed, bawling his little eyes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still pulled back, ready to fight or flee if needed. To see your tormentor in this state... How were you supposed to feel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up and down him, you finally feel at least a little bad for him, and rub his head. He sniffles, and sits back up, looking down at you. \"I-I'm really sorry...\" He repeats, looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... I-It's okay...\" You say nervously. With how emotionally unstable he was at his point, it was best just to swallow whatever pride you had and just accepted the giant's apology. Tsuna very carefully picks you up in his hand, and looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about your arm...\" He finally says, looking at the bloody nub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...\" You look at the place where your arm once was to see a blood smeared bandage. \"MY ARM!?!\" You shout suddenly, before remembering. The dark prison... Your arm being crunched right off... The sickly squishy crunch it made as it was clamped off your tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!!!\" Tsuna shouted out in desperately as he looked down at you in his hand. \"I felt really bad, so then I spit oyu out, and you were unconscious, so I wrapped you up in a paper towel to stop the bleeding and then I didn't know what to do, and I begged Doctor Shamal to come over, and he just made a SUGGESTION of what I should do, a-and...\" Tsuna started to tear up again as he looked down at you, the guilt simply racking him. \"I-Is there anything I can do?\" Tsuna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... This may just been your chance. You COULD ask Tsuna to set you free. Maybe even drop you off at his house. But... In truth... While this was probably the WORST day of your life, there was just something about today... It was exciting! Sure, you got an arm lopped off, but still! This was probably the most interesting day you've had since you moved here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you...</span></div></div>",

As soon as this new dying will bullet wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a little closer to Tsuna, to make sure he could hear you clearly. Shouting up your addresse, Tsuna had begun to put his socks back on to his feet. The boy picked you up in his hand, and started to head down to the stairs. Already out the door, you look back on this horrid household as a place you'd NEVER want to have to visit again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready getting comfortable, you look about as Tsuna has you gripped in his hand. Life might be a little harder as an amputee, but at the same time, there was always prostetic surgery... And besides, it was better to have one arm than none, right? Yeah...

He got too caught up in trying to help you that he never got to eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo top it all off, Tsuna's hand also started to quake. You felt a little tingling sensation, as you could feel a little more power filling your body! Slowly... Very slowly, you were starting to grow back to your original size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna looked down at you... His hunger was starting to take control of him as he had you gripped. He noticed you getting just a little bit bigger... He began to drool. He could easily down you right now... You could grow in his belly, making a nice, full meal out of you.

You can almost feel tears running down your cheeks as you finally make it home. Your heart is leaping for joy. There's such a knot in your stomach that you can't wait to get home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tsuna soon enters, he has to keep changing the position he held you in. He went from carrying you like an action figure, to holding you in both arms as if you were a teddy bear. Then he had to hold you as if you were a baby as you grew to it's respective size. By the time he reached your room, you were the size of a small child... with one arm. The bandages had long since torn off, but the wound had at least closed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... Should probably see a doctor for that...\" Tsuna chuckled nervously. You were about the size of Futa, and still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed. \"Yeah... It'll be a constant reminder of what you did...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna looked down, a little saddened at hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But I know you didn't mean to!\" You said suddenly, not wanting to see the little boy so sad. \"Please! Don't worry too much about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna looked at you, and gave a faint smile. It didn't make him feel better instantly, but it was still a start. With that, you give Tsuna a hug with your one arm. He hugs right back, smiling softly to himself. With that, the two of you say good-bye, and he's out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you return to your regular life, learning to deal with things with only one arm. You parents took you to a doctor, and later today, you're going to get fitted for a prostetic arm. All will soon be as it once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey!\" A voice called. You turn, and see Tsuna looking down at you from your sitting position. \"I didn't know you went here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle nervously as you look up at him. Back at your original size, you were a lot taller than he was. Part of you wanted to punch his face in for what he did to you yesterday. Another part of you wanted to reach out and become friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" You chuckle nervously. \"I've been getting a lot of attention since my arm went missing...\" You smile deviously at Tsuna. \"Any idea where it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna blushes furiously, and before he can reply, a voice came calling for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenth!\" It calls. Soon, Gokudera, a kid you recognized in your class before, comes up to Tsuna. \"Hey! Where have you been? We needed to talk to you ab--\" Before you know it, he was leading Tsuna away from you, leaving you in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, class begins, and you're back into your same old routine you started since you got here. Now, however, you were just greatful to be alive.</span></div></div>",

The glare, despite coming from this seemingly gentle kid, scared you a bit and made you back up a little bit. Tsuna noticed this and immediately placed his palm behind you so you couldn't back up any further. The soft skin against your back was nice, but it wouldn't last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't believe you!\" yelled Tsuna, louder than needed and causing you to cover your ears in pain. \"Do you know how many people have tried to kill me?! That note is probably fake, and you're just another mafioso!\" Before you could voice a protest, the hand behind you folded around you and trapped you. The giant's sweaty palm squeezed you just enough to keep you in place and cause a little discomfort. The hand shook a little as the future Vongola leader stood up and started walking around his room. After about a minute, the hand opened again and you were roughly dropped into a glass jar. You landed with a thud and cursed at the stinging pain. Thankfully, nothing seemed to be broken. You got up and rubbed your arm as you looked around. Tsuna towered over you and gave you one last glare before turning around and leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not in the mafia!!\" you screamed as you banged on the glass walls. Tsuna ignored you and left the room. Cursing again, you sat down and started to worry about what was going to happen next. This was not a good situation. Not good at all. </span></div></div>",

He\u2019d been attacked before, but his friends were always around or he\u2019d deal with it while in his Dying Will form. This time he was alone and Reborn was no where to ask for advice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh, what am I going to do? I can\u2019t just let him go; he might try and kill me again.\u201d he spoke to himself as he ruffled with his hair. \u201cI could just call somebody and let them deal with it. Why should I be concerned about mafia-related problems?\u201d Tsuna walked over to the phone and was just about to grab it when he stopped himself. \u201cBut\u2026I\u2019m supposed to be the 10th generation boss of the Vongola. I don\u2019t WANT to be, but everyone\u2019s counting on me. If I can\u2019t deal with just one assassin, how is anyone going to respect me?\u201d Tsuna pulled his hand back and began to calm himself. \u201cI\u2026I should deal with this myself. I have to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of self preparation for what he was about to do, Sawada marched into his room and right over to you. You were still sitting at the bottom of the glass jar and peered up at the giant boy. Hundreds of questions buzzed in your mind. What was he going to do with you? Was he going to be nice? Was there anyone else in the house? How long was this \u201cshrink bullet\u201d supposed to last? Were you going to live through this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, the mafia-boss picked up the jar and turned it over so you fell onto his gargantuan hand. Quickly you started to back away from his massive body, but a quick curl of the fingers stopped your retreat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it when people try to kill me.\u201d he indicated outright, an angry look pasted onto his boyish face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t trying to--\u201d you tried to deny, but Tsuna interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cObviously, everyone else failed.

If I let you go free like that, what\u2019s stopping you from returning in a few hours to finish the job. I have to teach you not to mess with me.\u201d Tsuna scratched his chin and thought hard. How was he supposed to punish this guy? He\u2019s never punished anyone in his entire life! He sat down on his bed as he continued to think, but no good ideas presented themselves. \u201cArg! This isn\u2019t my sort of thing! Maybe I should let someone else take care of it\u2026\u201d Tsuna sighed as he reached down and rubbed his foot through the rubber of his sneakers. You saw him do this from his palm and asked something you would defiantly regret. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you foot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing. I\u2019ve just been on them all day. I wish someone would-\u201d Tsuna\u2019s eyes went wide as he looked from his feet to your tiny form. A smile spread across his lips as he got an idea. Before you could understand what you had started, Tsuna placed you down by his feet and started to untie his sneakers. After slipping his feet out of them, he proceeded to peel off his white socks next. Once those were off, his feet were free and Tsuna let out a long sigh. \u201cFinally, my feet can get some room to breath.\u201d Tsuna wiggled his toes a bit before bringing both his bare feet down in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsuna? I don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to rub my feet, assassin. That doesn\u2019t sound too hard, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were flabbergasted at his words. Tsuna lifted his feet so his fresh, sweaty soles were exposed to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it right now, or else I\u2019ll make you give me a backrub instead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of giving this boy a foot rub at your size was humiliating, but the idea of rubbing his back was even worse! It would take forever! You immediately ran over to one of his feet and rubbed it vigorously. Your reach was limited, but Tsuna lowered his foot a bit to allow you access to higher areas. While you rubbed the sweaty foot, you had no choice but to breath the foul air around them. It was\u2026not as bad as you expected. Tsuna obviously had good hygiene and bathed regularly. The only reason his feet were smelly now was because they were cooped up in his shoes all day at school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gave the giant teen his foot rub, you looked past his gargantuan toes and looked him in the face. The young middle schooler had his eyes closed and a big smile on his face. Did this really feel that good, or did the idea of having so much control over you feel that much better?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes spent on each of his soles, Tsuna finally put his feet down on the floor and looked down at you, still smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat felt great! Thanks a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I had a choice. Can I leave now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna shook his head and responded, \u201cNot yet. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve learned your lesson yet. While you were rubbing my feet, I though up another punishment for you. How does spending some time in my _____ sound?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You wonder for a moment what he means, but soon get your answer when something big enters the sock. It\u2019s Tsuna\u2019s foot! The Vongola wiggles his toes in anticipation as he slowly puts the sock on. You don\u2019t try to avoid the foot and instead allow it to cover you. Tsuna\u2019s sole presses your body against the white cotton of the sock and soon your entire inch-tall form is covered in sweaty boy foot. You take a deep breath of Tsuna\u2019s foot odor and find the stench enjoyable. Why was that? This should gross you out, but you somehow find it pleasant. Was this some kind of side-effect of the Shrink Bullet? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Tsuna has his sock on, he props his foot onto his knee and inspects the bottom of his foot. A chuckle escapes his lips when he sees your small impression protruding from the sock. Having someone so much smaller than himself was starting to amuse Tsuna more and more. The middle school student lies down on his bed and relaxes, focusing on the feeling of your small body snuggling with his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really seem to want to be my servant, so I guess I\u2019ll forgive you for trying to assassinate me.\u201d Tsuna tells you. He feels you happily nod and kiss his foot, showing how much you\u2019ve changed from being in his presence. \u201cOhh, that feels good! Keep doing that.\u201d Tsuna closes his eyes and folds his arms behind his head. You obey your new giant master and continue kissing his foot.

It was so against his nature that it felt wrong to speak it. Nonetheless, the young mafia boss removed his hand and glared at you with angry eyes. He was really trying to be intimidating, though his sheer size was all it took to get you scared. You were so afraid for your life that you actually got to your feet and tried to climb over his fingers to escape. The giant Tsuna easily curled his hand into a fist and trapped you in the tight squeeze. Your one inch body was completely incased in his fist. His hand was all sweaty, probably from the nervousness he must be feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway\u2026\u201d Tsuna began to say. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided how I\u2019m going to do it.

You were shuddering far worse, though, since the giant had just decided to eat you! Tsuna\u2019s hand opened, revealing your sweaty and panting form. Without giving you a breather, his other hand came down and pinched you between his fingers. You were completely overpowered and your struggles were useless. The giant teen brought you up to his face, and started to sniff you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh\u2026you don\u2019t smell very good.

I\u2019d still rather not see you die. If something taste bad, you just add stuff to it until it taste better.\u201d Tsuna explained before trapping you in his fist again and exiting his room. You didn\u2019t know what he meant, but suspected you weren\u2019t saved from his ravaging stomach just yet. Tsuna entered his kitchen and placed you on the counter. He then reached for a knife, causing you to scream in fear and flee in the other direction. Tsuna chuckled and placed a cup over you, trapping you in darkness. You could still hear him outside of it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this isn\u2019t for you. Just stay put until I\u2019m done.\u201d It\u2019s not like you had much choice, so you sat on the cold floor and waited for you fate. A few minutes and several cutting noises later, the cup lifted up and was replaced with Tsuna\u2019s hand. The cute-faced boy took one last, pitiful look at you. \u201cSorry about this, but it is your fault for trying to kill me.\u201d Without a second thought, he dropped you onto the sandwich he was preparing. You landed in a mess of tuna and lettuce and tried to stand up. Before you got off your knees, the top slice of bread came down and pressed you into the grounded fish meat. To make it worse, the top piece of bread had mayonnaise on it which practically glued you in place. Your world shook and you knew Tsuna had picked up the sandwich. Fear and the will to survive took over and you struggled the best you could. The last thing you wanted was to be eaten by some mafia boss that mistook you for an assassin. You started to feel the back of your shirt peel away from the bread and hope filled your mind. Just seconds afterwards, the entire sandwich shook and made you gasp in surprise. Tsuna had just taken a bite of the tuna sandwich, thankfully not far enough to get you. You peaked through and opening and witnessed the young teen chewing, the audible sounds forcing you to picture yourself being masticated between his powerful teeth. You started to back away, deeper into the sandwich. The quake from before had dislodged you from the mayo and allowed you some movement. Your only thought being escape, you turned around and crawled as far and as quickly as possible. A loud gulp was heard behind you, followed by another shaking of the sandwich. You looked back in shock to see most of the sandwich was gone, either being chewed up in Tsuna\u2019s mouth or melting away in his belly. This was your last chance, you had to reach the end of the sandwich before Tsuna could consume the rest of his lunch. But then again, what would you do when you reached the end? The only thing you could do was jump and hope you survived. You started up your crawl again, the other end of your edible prison visible. You heard that piercing gulp from behind you again and quickened your pace, which was quite difficult seeing as you were already tired and the ground was made up of a fish product. You forced yourself not to look behind you at that gaping mouth of Tsuna\u2019s since it would probably freeze you in place and doom you. Tsuna got ready to put the last portion of his meal into his carnivorous mouth when\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're falling helplessly, your limbs flailing around a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs things seem they couldn't get darker, you finally get a spot of lucky. Onto the counter you fall, and on this counter, is a soft, squishy sponge. You hit it, cushioning your blow, and saving you from a concussion. You look up to see the brunette finish off his sandwich, munching it noisily as he did. Knowing him, he probably mistook the sound of the crisp lettuce as your bones crunching between his pearly white teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna finishd up the sandwich, licking his lips as he did. He turned about, and started to put away the bread, mayonaisse, and whatnot, not even bothering to look down at where you dropped. Grasping this moment, you dash behind the cup, hiding in the little shade that it provided for you. As Tsuna gets one last glass of water, he lets out a noisy burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! Excuse me!\" He said as he stood alone in the kitchen, before patting his tender, flat stomach. \"Sorry it had to end like that, little guy.\" He said, rubbing the spot, thinking you were in there. \"But I'm not gonna let you kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, Tsuna walked out of the kitchen, leaving you all alone. This was almost too good to be true. Tsuna thought you were dead! If you play your cards right, you could escape from this mad house! Just find a way down from the counter, around the bend, out the door, and across the lawn! At least then you'd be out of here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek out from behind the cup, to see Tsuna's hand, as it travels up the railing as he walks back upstairs to his room. Looks like the coast was clear. Slowly, you tip toe out from behind the cup, and look over the edge. Proportionatly, it looks like 100, if not 200 foot drop! Backing up, you scout the area to see if there's anything that can help you get down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a door slam open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenth!\" Someone shouts, and sprints up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right there!\" Another voice shouted, \"I'm gonna get a drink of water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick as your feet can carry you, you dash back behind the cup. Gradually, you hear the footsteps getting louder and louder as the person approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hey!\" The voice said. \"Here's a cup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat. They couldn't mean... THIS cup? The cup that YOU'RE hiding behind!? Time move at a snail's pace, as you see a large, squid-like shadow come over your secret base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cup is snatched up, your cover is blown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's this?\" The voice said, getting down closer to get a look at you. As you turn slowly, you see a tall male, with black hair, and light brown eyes. Unlike Tsuna, his persona seems to be much sunnier. You instantly recognize him. He's the star player of Namimori's baseball team, Takeshi Yamamoto. Unfortunately, you've never talked to him yourself... In fact, it's unlikely he even knew you existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...\" You manage to stammer, overcoming your mild fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Yamamoto pulled back a little. \"Hey! It talks!\" He pulled in closer, interested by you. \"What else can you do?\" He asked, smiling at you as he did. \"Do you know any tricks?\" He said, pushing another question. \"Oh! Hey! Are you one of those... uhm... Those one things... The... Lepren... Leprecious...\" He looked down, forgetting the little tidbit of folklore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you...</span></div></div>",

Are you a Leprechaun, little guy?\u201d the giant jock asked as he squatted down a bit so his giant face was leveled with the table. You took a few steps, having almost been eaten the last time a face had been this close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah\u2026that\u2019s me.\u201d you reply, laughing nervously. Maybe this guy was your ticket out of here! \u201cI\u2019m a genuine Leprechaun!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWooow\u2026awesome! Aren\u2019t you supposed to be wearing a green suit and hat, though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026well\u2026we stopped wearing those ages ago. Made us stand out too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh\u2026I see.\u201d Takashi grins toothily. He really believed you were a Leprechaun. \u201cThe myth I read years ago WAS pretty old. So why are you in Tsuna\u2019s kitchen?\u201d The baseball player looks to the side and thinks for a moment before turning his brown gaze back at you. \u201cAnd why were you hiding?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026you see\u2026sonny\u2026\u201d you mumble as you rack your brain, quickly coming up with a story to tell. \u201cThere I was, just minding my own business, when suddenly a strong gust of wind lifted me up and blew me in here! I\u2019ve been trying to find a way out\u2026and you big lads can be pretty intimidating!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, well I guess we seem pretty big to someone like you!\u201c Yamamoto chuckled as he looked at you carefully. His eyes observed the kitchen table, seeing that there wasn\u2019t any way for a small guy like you to escape. \u201cLooks like you\u2019re in a pickle. How long have you been stuck up there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026about\u2026two hours?\u201d you lie, randomly making up a number. The large swordsman is giving you a serious look and you begin to worry he might now believe you. Thankfully, his face returns to a bright smile and your worry lifts away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve been stuck up there for two hours? I\u2019m surprised Tsuna didn\u2019t notice you at all. Well, no worries, little guy! I\u2019ll bring you to Gokudera and him and the three of us will help you get back to your village\u2026or home\u2026or whatever you live in.\u201d The middle school student shrugs as he reaches a hand for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait! You can\u2019t show me to them!\u201d you shout just before the giant\u2019s hand reaches you. The gullible jock blinks a few times before retracting his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Because the more people who know about us, the more risk we\u2019re in! We have to keep our existence hidden from humans.\u201d you explain, looking up at the giant with worry. He probably thought you were worrying about the secrecy of your race, but in truth you were worried about being seen by Tsuna again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, I get it.\u201d the athlete folds his arms over his chest and nods. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta protect your pots of gold, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026yeah, that\u2019s it.\u201d You giggle nervously again. You hoped he wouldn\u2019t want a pot of gold in return, but he didn\u2019t seem to look like the greedy type\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha! If too many people found out about them, the economy would go out of whack!\u201d The giant muscle head smiled at you and suddenly grabbed you. Even though he was being kind, his strong fist held you firmly and it was pretty uncomfortable. Takeshi brought you up to his handsome face and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll just keep you in my pocket while I hang out with Tsuna and Gokudera.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait a minute!\u201d you shout, but Yamamoto has already stuffed you into his pocket. Prefect\u2026you should of just asked him to drop you off in front of the house or something! You lie down in the pocket and listen as the teen pours himself a glass of water and gulping it down. After sighing happily, you hear his feet stomp against the floor as he makes his way out of the kitchen. Before he reaches the stairs, however, he suddenly stops\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wait a sec\u2026\u201d Takeshi\u2019s hand suddenly reenters the pocket and he scoops you back out. You\u2019re held before his face again as he looks at you closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what\u2019s wrong?\u201d you ask, your voice shaky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really, I was just wondering\u2026why didn\u2019t you use any of your magic to escape?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-magic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, magic. You Leprechauns have magic, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s how you protect your gold, hide from humans, and other tricky stuff. You must have something that could get you off a table,\u201d The teen raises an eyebrow. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You suddenly feel really light like you were in an elevator and the \u201cfloor\u201d you were sitting on shifts. You tumble around for a bit before everything comes to a rest. You lay there in the pocket for a bit while you hear more shifting outside. You then start hearing Yamamoto\u2019s booming footsteps, but they aren\u2019t coming from below you anymore. They also seem to be getting farther away, so you quickly crawl out of the pocket\u2019s opening (which is no longer above you, but more to the side like a cave opening). You emerge into the light and shield your eyes; everything blurry due to spending a lot of time in the giant\u2019s dark pocket. You hear the sound of a door closing and you look behind you. After rubbing your eyes a bit you start to get used to the brightness again and see a closed door several yards away. You start scanning your surroundings and see that the pants you were in are now on the hard wood floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYamamoto?\u201d you call, looking around for the young giant. You don\u2019t see his hulking figure anywhere, which must mean he isn\u2019t in the room. Looking around some more, you notice a bunch of other clothes scattered around. A shirt, a pair of socks, shoes, boxers\u2026they were all the clothes Yamamoto was just wearing! Why did he\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the familiar sound of running water appeared in the distance. Someone was taking a shower nearby. You looked up a bit at all the giant furniture and began to understand. You were in a bedroom, but it wasn\u2019t Tsuna\u2019s. Yamamoto had stripped all his clothes off without a care\u2026you must be in HIS house now! Well that was real nice of him; being so nice to you and then dropping you on the floor while he bathed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t look very bright\u2026\u201d you mutter to yourself as you put your hands in your pockets and start walking around the room. Yamamoto\u2019s bedroom was surprisingly clean for a jock; the only stuff on the ground were the clothes he had just taken off. The room was decorated with baseball posters and several trophies. A wooden sword also hanged on a nearby wall, making you think Yamamoto was also interested in swordplay as well as baseball. He definitely wasn\u2019t like the jocks you had met at your old school. He wasn\u2019t mean and didn\u2019t pick on anyone; he was kind and smiled a lot. The only reason people call him a jock was because he seemed to be a sports fanatic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paced around the room for a while longer, taking in the breathtaking sight of Yamamoto\u2019s huge room. You never noticed before, but the ceiling was really high up\u2026and the bed looked like a cliff! You were so tiny compared to how you used to be\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were observing your surroundings, you suddenly heard the door open. It was then you realized the sound of the shower going had stopped. You look over to the door and see Yamamoto entering his room; a towel wrapped around his waist. The boy\u2019s hair and torso looked damp, but he wasn\u2019t dripping wet which meant he had dried off a bit. You gazed at the giant teenager with awe; despite being in middle school the baseball nut had a pretty impressive build for his age. He was already starting to develop abs and his chest looked pretty pumped. You were brought out of your daze when Yamamoto began stomping closer; his bare feet making the floor under him rumble. The teen picked up his pair of pants and dug through the pocket you were supposed to be in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh? He isn\u2019t there anymore\u2026\u201d Yamamoto mumbled as he dropped the pants and started looking over the ground for you. As he did, he stomped closer and closer to you, but you ran toward those dangerous feet and waved your arms. He knew what he was looking for, so surely he\u2019d notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Yamamoto!\u201d you yell up at the towering boy. Yamamoto doesn\u2019t seem to react to your voice and he starts prodding one of his ears with his finger. Crap\u2026he had water in his ears and couldn\u2019t hear you! Well, at least he could still see you\u2026</span></div></div>",

Soon, you felt yourself getting knocked up into the air with every step, making it difficult to keep standing let alone make any progress in any direction. Yamamoto stops for a second, his brown eyes still focused on the floor, scanning left and right. This was ridiculous! He should still be able to see you! An inch tall wasn't THAT small...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he took another step and his massive left foot crashed down directly in front of you, the toe inches from your face. The force of the wind from that simple movement washed over you, bringing with it the clean scent of soap mixed with the natural odor of an active young man's foot. It wasn't overwhelming but it was VERY male and VERY much in your face. You barely managed to keep your feet, your body getting launched what felt like a few feet into the air, stumbling back slightly. You looked up at the incredibly huge big toe in front of you, which was taking up most of your vision. Beyond it, Yamamoto's body stretched upward like a god's rising high, high into the sky, the ceiling light shining down on him as though from heaven, his muscled torso glistening slightly in the glow. You gulped and looked forward, your heart jumping slightly. You were eye level with Yamamoto's toenail...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...I thought I could see over it just a second ago...\" you mutter to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the toenail rises over your head! \"W-what the?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over your body in fear and see the ground is slowly growing closer, stretching out all around you, the humongous toe in front of you growing even MORE massive, the scent filling your nose and making you a little woozy. Up and out the tanned toe grew in front of you, the rest of Yamamoto's body becoming obscured by this single digit. You were truly becoming tiny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" You stepped back until you could see beyond the toe, Yamamoto's towering form stretching even higher above you. His eyes were still scanning the floor, but how would he be able to tell you from the tufts of sock lint and dust? You waved your arms and shouted again, but if your voice was a mere squeak before, now it was surely impossible to pick up at all. You ran back over to the toe and desperately measured yourself. Judging by how enormous it was you figured your height to be around...a quarter of an inch tall! You groaned and fell back against the toe. Things just kept getting worse and worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Yamamoto's voice bellowed out over the room, sounding deep and powerful even though he was just speaking in a normal tone of voice. You could feel it vibrating in your chest. \"Huh...guess he went for a walk or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamamoto certainly wasn't the brightest bulb but he was now your only chance at survival. You got to your feet and looked around. There had to be SOMETHING you could do to gain his attention...</span></div></div>",

Yamamoto\u2019s floor was practically spotless; save for the dirty clothes he had discarded. Even if you did manage to find a pencil or something, what good would that have done? You were so pathetically small that it\u2019d be impossible for you to even lift something like a pencil. However, you had to find someway to get the giant teen\u2019s attention, or else\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even start thinking, the toe next to you suddenly rose high into the air. You craned your neck and watched in awe as the naked giant above you took a single step forward. The massive foot of the titan passed over you, crashing down in the distance. The force of the footstep was unbelievable! It shook the floor you stood on and you were sent at least a foot into the air! As you laid there on your stomach, you watched Yamamoto walk toward his dresser; each of his footfalls tremendous in power. They no longer made you lose your balance, but you could feel the tremors that were send through the floorboards. You had to get off this floor before it was too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026get off the floor. Get off the\u2026that\u2019s it!\u201d you exclaim loudly. There was a way to get Yamamoto\u2019s attention! He was the size of a mountain\u2026which means you could climb him! Sure, it sounded like an impossible task, but what else could you do. Remaining on the floor trying to scream up at him will only result in a quick death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamamoto was currently opening his draws searching for clothes to wear. At that distance he would probably be finished dressing himself by the time you ran all the way over to him. Instead you set your eyes on his bed, which was close by. The sheets were hanging over the edge\u2026perfect! You could climb up that first and then jump to Yamamoto when he got close. You quickly ran over to the bed sheets and grabbed handfuls of the thick (to you) material. You weren\u2019t exactly an expert climber, but you had done some hiking in your old town. You took a deep breath and started scaling up the sheets as fast as you could. If someone knew where to look and looked closely, they might of seen your speck-sized form scampering up to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climbed for a couple minutes, not looking down but hoping you had made some progress. All of a sudden you heard what sounded like something falling the ground. You instinctively turned around and got a good look at Yamamoto\u2019s bare ass. The towel that was once covering him was now on the floor. Your face turned red and you quickly hid it in the bed sheets to avoid seeing anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese\u2019ll work!\u201d you hear Yamamoto say as he slips on a pair of boxers followed by some black cargo shorts. You continued your trek up to the bed, but your face was still blushing and you couldn\u2019t get the image of Yamamoto\u2019s firm, muscular ass out of your mind. This wasn\u2019t the time to be going gaga over your potential savior! He could also be your potential killer if you weren\u2019t careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd\u2026\u201d Yamamoto said as he fished through one of his draws; his torso still shirtless. \u201cI wanted to wear the red one today, but it\u2019s not here!\u201d The athlete folded his arms over his chest and glanced around his room. His eyes eventually fell upon the shirt on his bed. \u201cThere it is! How\u2019d it get there?\u201d The giant shrugged and walked over to it. You instantly heard the booming footsteps as they appeared, growing closer and closer to you each time. You turned around again just as Yamamoto stopped before his bed. You gazed up at the towering giant as he grabbed the shirt off his bed and brought it up to his face to smell it. He wondered for a moment if it was clean or not, but ultimately decided he didn\u2019t care and slipped it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s now or never!\u201d you say to yourself as you look for where you\u2019ll be jumping to. To your surprise, you discovered you didn\u2019t have many options! Despite all your effort climbing, you had only barely risen over Yamamoto\u2019s toes! It might be possible to jump onto his big toe and from there you could travel over the rest of his foot\u2026but you might also miss your mark and end up between his toes! How would escape if that happened? Deciding you didn\u2019t have a lot of time to think about if before Yamamoto moved on, you gulped to clear your throat and leaped off the sheets. It wasn\u2019t a long drop to Yamamoto\u2019s foot, but where were you going to end up?</span></div></div>",

Without wasting a single second, you dash forward, slipping and sliding on his toe nail, until you reached the skin of his foot. You climbed up on top of the cuticle and dashed along the bulbous part of the big toe, struggling over what amounted to a mountain of flesh (to your tiny size). Utilizing energy you didn't even know you had, you finally managed to reach the foot proper. At this point, with hundreds of feet of skin stretching to either side of you, you were far less likely to fall off. Your little heart beat inside your chest, your breath escaping you in harsh gasps as you laid perfectly still. You had completed the hard part of the mission. Now was the...actually equally hard, if not even harder, part of the mission: actually getting his attention. You groaned and looked up, Yamamoto's cheerful face just barely visible past his lean body, his shorts and shirt loosely hanging off his body. He looked so cool, calm, and in control. Too bad you knew just how spacey this guy could be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart jumps up in your throat as the mountainous teen suddenly starts moving, the foot you're resting on rising into the air before slapping against the floor with a resounding BOOM, the other foot following suit. There was literally nothing for you to hang on to, but, thankfully, Yamamoto had a straight step, his foot not tilting left or right. Every step still sent you flying into the air, only to crash back down on top of his foot and, after awhile, you were starting to feel dizzy. Soon enough, he stopped, allowing you to sit up and look around. Judging by the furniture, you appeared to be inside his living room. You looked behind you and saw Yamamoto sitting down, the T.V. flickering to life as he did so. You looked up at the screen, more gargantuan than any movie theater screen you had ever seen, and saw a huge man in uniform swinging a bat. Ah, so he was watching a baseball game and, judging by the scoreboard, it had only recently started. This was perfect! You had to use this time to try and get his attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the seemingly endless landscape that was his foot, you realized that getting his attention would be quite difficult. Bending down, you slammed your fists as hard as you could against the top of his foot, succeeding only in hurting your hands. It was like punching steel! Your tiny fists wouldn't make any kind of impression on Yamamoto. Massaging your knuckles, you notice his legs. When you were more normal sized you had always thought his legs were hairless, but now you could see several strands all up and down his legs. Apparently, these hairs were too small to be normally seen unless you were looking very closely. You sighed. Well, you could try and keep climbing. That seemed to be about the only thing you COULD do. In fact...you craned your neck back and saw that, sitting like this, you could very easily get up inside Yamamoto's boxers! You blushed at the thought but there was nothing perverted in your mind about this! That whole area was far more sensitive then any other part of the virile teen's body. If you could maybe get in there and bite him, you might stand a chance to get his attention! It was risky though...he might very well crush you while doing something as simple as scratch himself. But it was really your only choice at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath, and began running across his expansive foot, racing for your only chance at survival.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You ran over Yamamoto\u2019s bare foot as the massive teenager watched the baseball game, unaware of your presence. You occasionally looked up at his face high above to make sure that remained the case. Yamamoto was the most passionate when it came to baseball, so he wasn\u2019t going to miss a second of any game. You didn\u2019t have to worry about  him getting up in the middle of it. After what seemed like running a mile, you finally reached the Rain Guardian\u2019s ankle and leaned against it, catching your breath. The easy part was done, but now came the hard part. You looked up Takeshi\u2019s lightly haired leg, into the back shorts he worse, and at the boxers within. Your goal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what Yamamoto will think when he finds me\u2026IF he finds me.\u201d you mumble to yourself as you grab hold of two hairs to start out and start climbing. The hairs were like tree trunks in your hands and there were more than enough scattered over the middle schooler\u2019s leg for you to grasp onto. The hairs were thick enough so that whenever you needed to rest you could sit on one. The trip up Yamamoto was long and certainly not quiet. The loud sounds of the TV behind you sounded like you were right in front of a large speaker. Yamamoto occasionally made comments above you, but thankfully he wasn\u2019t the type of person to jump up and shout at the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sitting there on the couch, Takeshi would sometimes shift positions and cross his legs. A simple movement on his part was a huge deal on you. It felt like the entire world moved as the \u201cmountain\u201d you were climbing swayed left and right. You gripped onto the hairs tightly and pressed yourself against the teen\u2019s warm skin as the wind force tried to push you off. You waited until Yamamoto was still again before continuing your climb up the titan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you finally reached Yamamoto\u2019s kneecap and rested once again. Looking upward you found yourself just a few feet from the black cargo shorts. You decided to look around again before your vision was obstructed and notice the score board on the TV. A while had passed since you started climbing! Over an hour, in fact! Over an hour of climbing and you were only half done\u2026you groaned and rubbed your sore arms. You were so close\u2026you couldn\u2019t give up yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, fate decided to be kind once again. Yamamoto legs suddenly swung upward and you desperately grabbed onto the hairs at the last second. You thought the boy was standing up, but instead you notice gravity had switched and it felt like you were laying down on Yamamoto\u2019s skin. You blinked a few times as the leg came to a halt and slowly got to your feet. You glanced around and quickly discovered that Yamamoto was no longer sitting down on the couch\u2026he was laying on it now! You looked forward at Yamamoto as he laced his arms behind his head and kept his eyes glued to the TV. Apparently he was getting uncomfortable and decided to lay down\u2026perhaps he was planning on being here for awhile longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason was, this was lucky for you! You no longer had to climb; you could now run the rest of the way! You quickly switched into a sprint as you ducked under the Vongola swordsman\u2019s shorts and ran toward the boxers inside. Things got slightly darker inside, especially since little light filtered in through the black material of the shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still took you around ten minutes to cross Yamamoto\u2019s thighs at your miniscule size, but you finally reached the boxers. Wasting no time you got on your hands and knees and crept underneath the undergarment. The musky smell of male assaulted you instantly as you entered the larger male\u2019s private region; not even a shower could rid this area of its odor. It was even darker in here too, but you could just barely make out a large mass in front of you. It was huge like a hill and you couldn\u2019t see over it. It must have been Yamamoto\u2019s balls\u2026damn were they big! The powerful odor got stronger as you got closer, but you needed to get close if you wanted to get the giant\u2019s attention. Once you were up against Yamamoto\u2019s left ball sac, you made sure you wouldn\u2019t accidentally slip under the huge mass before you began punching it. Like you expected, the fleshy sac absorbed all your blows and Yamamoto didn\u2019t notice anything. You would have to give the giant a \u201cbug bite\u201d. You closed your eyes, leaned forward, and bit down on the sensitive skin of Takeshi\u2019s junk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second after getting a taste of ball sweat, Yamamoto shook and you fell backwards. Looks like he felt that! You grinned as light flooded in; Yamamoto\u2019s hand opened up the top of his boxers. Now comes the moment of truth\u2026would Yamamoto take the time to inspect the irritation, or just scratch it away? Would fate be kind to you a third time?</span></div></div>",

It was like huge living mountain, radiating a manly musk.<br>\r\n\"It's so big, I've got to get outta here\"<br>\r\nYou started climbing up. After awhile you reached his mountainous abs. You climbed each one using the space between each as footholds.<br>\r\nYou felt the sweat of Yamamoto's body dripping on you and covering you in slippery sweat.<br>\r\nAfter a long time of climbing you finally reached Yamamoto's nipple but suddenly you got pushed into it by Yamamoto's other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got pushed into his hard nipple. You got rubbed on it like a little speck of dirt caught between his fingers.<br>\r\nYour face being pushed into it getting a taste of his sweat. Suddenly the hand retracted but you were stuck on it so you were brought along for the ride.<br>\r\nThe hand wandered below, on the way you had a good long look at his dick. The hand brought you to his balls and stared fondling them along with you in between.<br>\r\nYou were rubbed on Yamamoto's sweaty ballsac. You were rubbed on each individual ball. Getting dragged across the sweaty flesh and getting a taste of his ballsweat.<br>\r\nYou were squeezed onto the sweaty flesh. Getting a whiff of Yamamoto's manly musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of being rubbed on the loose flesh of the ballsac for some time.<br>\r\nThe hand brought you to the fleshy pole that was Yamamoto's dick.<br>\r\nIt grabbed the shaft along with you in between. The hand started rubbing you up and down coating you with precum.<br>\r\n\"Yamamoto let me down from here!\" you tried to say but instead got a mouthful of precum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand just kept rubbing you up and down the meaty pole.<br>\r\nYou could feel hardness and heat of Yamamoto's shaft. The bulging veins circulating blood to keep the hard erection up.<br>\r\nThe sweaty hand squeezing you onto the sweaty, musky flesh of the dick.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, his muscular hand is squeezing me too hard, i feel like i'm going to be ground to pulp on his dick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily his hand brought him to the top of his dick and started rubbing the dick head.<br>\r\nGiving you a face full of precum and rubbing your face on the slit of his dick.<br>\r\nThe hand started to push you into the slit. You fell head first, the slit swallowing you up to you neck. <br>\r\nAfter a while your arms started going inside as well. After about 2 minutes of struggling you started to slip even more into Yamamoto's dick.<br>\r\nHalf of your body was already inside his dick you could feel the slimy walls all around you. It smelled like dry cum and piss.<br>\r\nYou could hear the rhythmic pumping of yamamoto's hand, the loud moans.<br>\r\nBecause of the Yamamoto's pumping your body slipped completely inside of his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was already halfway inside Yamamoto's cock.<br>\r\nThe walls squeezing you. You could feel Yamamoto's hand squeezing you  while he played with his cock.<br>\r\nThe precum gushing up the urethra coating you with Yamamoto's manly juice. <br>\r\nSuddenly you could hear something rumbling below. You looked down and saw an oozing hot white liquid going up the tube.<br>\r\n\"GONNA CUM!!!\" shoated Yamamoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot load carried you all the way to the top giving you a mouthful of the stick white substance that was Yamamoto's cum.<br>\r\nThe manly juice coating you and plastering you on Yamamoto's hard abs.<br>\r\nYour body was submerged in Yamamoto's cum, almost making you swim in the white puddle.<br>\r\nAfter a few more spurts, Yamamoto stopped and started to drift asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, I cant get out, Im stuck and worse im coated in his cum!\"<br>\r\n'YAMAMOTO!

You are so insignificant to the mighty Yamamoto that a minor shift in foot-placement from a single digit sends miniature vibrations to your puny body. A little shaken up from your new environment only left you with a sense of dread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in the world am I going to get out of this mess?\" You think aloud. \"Well, I guess I have to start somewhere.\" you whisper to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a little braver then before you slowly inch yourself closer to the summit of Yamamoto's toes. The closer you get the more details of the mammoth toe comes into focus. Minor embellishments such as groves and ridges of the toe are more prominent at this diminutive size. Finally, reaching the toe you gently place your hand on one of the smooth groves. A slight tingle sensitization shoots down your spine as you feel the warmth and mild sweet aroma radiating from the toe to your hand. It's finally dawn on you. The realization that this thing is truly alive and is completely unaware of your existence. Snapping out of your daze you muster up some strength and began to hit and berate the flesh of toe before you. You pour every ounce of strength you had in the blows and punches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.....you make it all the way here and not even a reaction from this colossal stud. *Grinding your teeth in disbelief and anger* \"How can I not even get a reaction from this guy\"? Lashing out in anger you lunge at a tender looking spot in the grove and bite down hard hoping that would get some sort of reaction. A loud rumbling noise can be heard as the huge toe recoils back slightly. Your bite has caused a subconscious twitch in his movement. Just as fast as the toe retreats it soon comes back at full force knocking into your puny body sending you flying back.<br>\r\nThe blow was painful but not fatal you lie on the ground with the wind knocked out of you and some minor bruising around your body. Gasping for breath you look up at the young teen laughing at your predicament. From this vantage point you are looking straight up Yamamoto\u2019s towel. You start to blush as you gaze up at young teen\u2019s unmentionables. Unintentionally, Yamamoto was showing you who the \"big\" man of the house was. Yamamoto is completely in control of your life and he doesn't even have an inkling of your whereabouts. The light around you slowly darkens as the Yamamoto bends down casting a shadow around you. You shriek in terror as you look up and lock eyes with the immense giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above your little world, Yamamoto was busy day dreaming of an upcoming baseball match he and the rest of the gang were planning on. He was completely unaware of your latest plight. Feeling a slight irritation near his big toe he subconsciously flexes his toe and gazes downward. Bending down slightly Yamamoto scans the floor and spots a little speck not too far off from his big toe.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tsuna had pushed the remainder of the sandwich into his maw and you were now looking at the outside world from inside his moist cavern. Your final exposure to the outside world ended when the mouth closed, throwing you into a world of darkness with the only light coming from behind Tsuna\u2019s cheeks. Immediately the tongue under you twitched and threw the sandwich chunk onto his left molars. When you felt your prison start to dissolve from his saliva and constant chewing, you bolted out from the mess of meat before the white teeth came down to crush you. You were finally free of the sandwich, but just ten seconds too late. You watched your former prison get completely destroyed by Tsuna\u2019s powerful jaws. He swished it from side to side, soaking it in salvia and getting it ready for its trip down the throat. It took all your consideration just to avoid being turned into mush like the sandwich, despite your doom already apparent. Soon you\u2019ll wish one of the teeth had ended your life right then. When the tuna sandwich could no longer be called a sandwich, Tsuna was ready to rid his mouth of it. You were exhausted from dodging the dangerous, white objects and couldn\u2019t move. The pink tongue flipped you and the remnants of the sandwich to the back of his throat. You screamed one last time before the throat grabbed a hold of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026DON\u2019T!!\u201d you yelled, but your voice was muffled by the sound of him swallowing. The bulge which carried the last of his lunch traveled down his throat and disappeared at the collar of his t-shirt. Tsuna sighed deeply and gave his flat stomach a few pats. All he knew now was that you were in his stomach. He hadn\u2019t known which of the three bites had contained you, nor if his teeth had killed you before your departure down his throat. He was saddened that it had to end like that, but at least he had a good meal out of it and he would never have to see you again. After gulping down a glass of water, he strolled casually out of the kitchen. A quick burp escaped his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clear liquid poured into his stomach and washed over your body, which was waiting silently for the end. Banging on the walls had bared no results, so you just leaned against the smooth flesh of his stomach as the acids churned you. Your clothes were drenched in saliva and acids and were beginning to peel away from Tsuna\u2019s inner juices. You just sobbed as your short life was eaten away by someone the same age as you. Your last thought was cursing the fact you ever moved here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed and Tsuna was in his room, laying down on his bed. The rest of the day had been spent hanging out with his friends and cleaning his room (by his mother\u2019s orders). He was just about to fall asleep when his stomach twisted and a swift fart was let loose. He\u2019d take a quick bathroom break before he took a nap. Walking into his family bathroom, the Vongola lowered his pants and boxers and sat down on the toilet. He wasn\u2019t even thinking about you when he grunted and dropped three or four medium-sized turds into the toilet water below. They were mostly made up of his breakfast and lunch, although some of you was present as well. Not including your skeleton, which was entombed in one of solid wastes and stripped of all meat. Tsuna didn\u2019t see it and simply wiped himself before flushing, the last evidence of his crime vanishing from his life forever. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tsuna sat up and rubbed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s fine, Gokudera-kun. No\u2026wait\u2026that\u2019s not right. Everything\u2019s fine\u2026sort of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew it! Are you in trouble, Tenth?! What do you need me for?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you see. I found an assassin in my room and--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he\u2019s gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to Tsuna\u2019s room slammed open, surprising you a second time after the loud crash from downstairs. You saw a new giant at the door: Hayato Gokudera. You recognized him from your new school as well. He hanged out with Tsuna a lot and came across as really scary, second only to Hibari. The white-haired bomb lover looked around the room with stern eyes. Tsuna came running up the stairs a few moments later, following him into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis place is a mess, Tenth! You must have had some struggle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Tsuna answered. \u201cThis is how it always looks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. So, you must have fought off the assassin yourself, right? You\u2019re amazing, Tenth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly\u2026he\u2019s still here. Right over there.\u201d Tsuna pointed to you in the jar and Gokudera\u2019s eyes fell upon you. You thought your heart would stop. It took Gokudera a few seconds to realized what was in the jar <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I get it now!\u201d shouted Hayato as he grabbed the jar and turned it over onto his hand. Your tiny body fell into his palm and was immediately enwrapped in his fist. The crushing grip began to hurt as you winced in his hand. \u201cSo, you thought you could use some kind of weird technology to shrink yourself and sneak into the Tenth\u2019s room, eh? You little punk, I\u2019m going to blow you to bits!\u201d With that, the Tsuna\u2019s right-hand took out a lit stick of dynamite and grinned evilly. Tsuna himself turned pale.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOO! Gokudera-kun, put that away!\u201d screamed Tsuna in fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, forgive me, Tenth! I was too wrapped up in anger!\u201d apologized the young male before putting out the explosive. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though. I have other ways of teaching this punk a lesson. Leave it to me, Tenth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna smiled nervously and nodded. \u201cOkay then. I\u2019ll be down stairs, tell me when you\u2019re finished. I\u2019d rather not be in here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, Tenth.\u201d Hayato waved at his boss as he exited the room and closed the door. His attention was redirected back at your tiny form, still struggling in his grip. \u201cNow, runt, it\u2019s time for you to learn what happens to those that threaten the Vongola! Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go easy on you just because you\u2019re such a small guy.\u201d You could only shake in fright, trying to think of some way out of this. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gokudera grinned at you evenly as he held you in the palm of his hand. You only shook in fear from his gaze and didn\u2019t even notice immediately that he was raising his other hand into the air and making a fist with it. You cursed mentally as you released he was planning on smashing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t! Please, Gokudera! Don\u2019t you recognize me?!\u201d you shouted up in a panic while holding your tiny arms in front of yourself for protection. Surprisingly, he did stop. He was looking at you closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRecognize you? Why the hell would I--\u201d he stopped himself as a light bulb clicked in his head. He put his giant face so close to you that it spooks you once again, causing you to throw your arms out a second time. The dynamite maniac just looked at you for a few seconds, his eyes blinking very few moments. Without warning, he gaped at the sudden realization. \u201cHold on a sec, you look just like that new kid at school. Erik, I think.\u201d Your face lit up as Gokudera remembered your name. Surely you\u2019d be off the hook now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026you\u2019re a mafia assassin?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSon of a\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m just a normal middle-schooler! I was just walking by Tsuna\u2019s house and someone named Reborn shrunk me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReborn-san?\u201d Gokudera seemed to know the name. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Why would Reborn-san\u2026\u201d he stopped and thought for a moment. \u201c\u2026well\u2026never mind. But still, you must be an assassin! I see you watching us all the time! You probably sneak into your target\u2019s lives and study them first!\u201d You gritted your teeth as you listened to the giant\u2019s accusations. It was true; you did look at Tsuna and his friends a lot\u2026but that was only because they were so weird! Gokudera was genius and a delinquent, Yamamoto could possibly kill someone with a baseball, and Tsuna lived in the household which endangered your life every time you passed it. All that\u2026and there was one other thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026Gokudera. Do you, maybe, LIKE Tsuna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant teen looked shocked by your question. He began to sweat and blush a little. \u201cW-what gives you that idea?! The Tenth is just the Tenth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re always so protective of him and always watching him. It looks to me like you have a crush on him.\u201d you explained as you thought back to all the times you\u2019d seen the two together. Gokudera, meanwhile, was becoming redder than a strawberry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-the Tenth is by boss! As his right-hand, it\u2019s my job to protect him and keep a close watch on him! That doesn\u2019t mean I have a\u2026a crush.\u201d explained the white-haired boy as he looked away. It was obviously true, but he wasn\u2019t going to admit it. Suddenly, a plan started to form in your mind. You were never much of a planner, but this kind of situation required a desperate plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll make a deal with you. I\u2019ll help you get together with Tsuna if you believe I\u2019m not an assassin.\u201d After the words left your mouth, you felt like it sounded  a lot better in your mind. There was no way he was going to agree to such a proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear it, shrimp.\u201d he replied almost instantaneously. You were amazed at his quickness, but also relieved. Gokudera moved his hand over to Tsuna\u2019s desk and dropped you onto it a bit roughly. He then crouched down so he could hear your deal clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, well\u2026\u201d you began to explain. \u201cI may not look like it, but I\u2019m a real love artist. I can help come up with the perfect date for you and Tsuna. After the day is over, you two will be a couple!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if we aren\u2019t?\u201d he asked, glaring down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-uh\u2026well\u2026you can get rid of me like a bug if you want.\u201d Gokudera smiled as he started to think it over. You hope he\u2019d agree, but he may also find you useless and want to get rid of you here and now. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few minutes of thinking, which were possibly the longest few minutes of your life, the explosive expert suddenly came to a decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, I agree to your deal. You\u2019ll help the Tenth fall in love with me or I\u2019ll squash you!\u201d demanded the teenager while he raised his fist to emphasize his point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay! Leave it to me.\u201d You chuckled nervously. This wasn\u2019t going to be easy, but it was your only shot. In truth\u2026you weren\u2019t really a love artist or anything like that. You just watched a lot of romance movies and read a lot of cheesy novels. Before you could begin to express your ideas, Gokudera snatched you in his hand and brought you over to Tsuna\u2019s bed. After depositing you onto it (again, a bit roughly), he sat down next to you and peered down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s begin. I actually thought up some plans for today, since everyone else is busy. It\u2019s the perfect chance to spend time with the boss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? So, what did you com up with?\u201d you asked, craning your head to look up at his face. If Gokudera already had some plans, this might not be so hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, first I thought taking him to a shooting range. A mafia boss has to learn to wield a gun, right? Then I thought about the gym. I go there every once in awhile, but always with that baseball nut. Next there\u2019s the movies, a classic spot for a date. There\u2019s this scary movie out I think the Tenth will really enjoy. Finally, since it\u2019ll be late by then, I\u2019d take him out for a hotdog. He really likes those. So\u2026what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at Gokudera in amazement. Was he serious? Really? This guy\u2019s hopeless\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026well\u2026it needs some work. Taking him out to eat is a good idea, but you may want to go to a fancy restaurant instead of a hot dog stand. The movie is also a good move, but Tsuna doesn\u2019t look like the kind of guy who\u2019d like a scary movie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d Gokudera scratched his chin as he thought. \u201cYou may be right. Last time he saw a scary movie, he was scared frozen afterwards for three hours straight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, really?</i> you thought before continuing the discussion. \u201cThe other two spots are definite nos. Who would take someone to a shooting gallery and a gym for a date?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you have any better ideas?\u201d Gokudera eyed you impatiently. You scooted a few inches away from him, as if his eyes were pushing you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven\u2019t explored Namimori a lot, so I don\u2019t know a lot of spots. I hear there\u2019s a festival going on in the park today.\u201d After saying this, Gokudera snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I forgot all about that! The Tenth said he really wanted to go, but I can\u2019t believe I forgot!\u201d the teen cursed as he slapped his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be really happy. I can\u2019t really think of any other date spots, though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better if you want to live!\u201d Hayato said with a threatening tone. You jumped and mumbled an ok. This guy was scary, but you could tell he really cared for Tsuna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026is there a public pool here?\u201d you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve been there a few times in the past. Do you think he\u2019d want to go there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a bit hot out today. I\u2019d think so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, okay. Sounds like he have a solid day planned. Let\u2019s see how the Tenth thinks about it\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Before you realized what was happening, the young mafiosi stuffed you into his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d you yelled in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw, don\u2019t yell! I don\u2019t want the Tenth to know I disobeyed him, so I\u2019m hiding you here.

You had just laid back when you heard the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGokudera? Is everything alright? You were yelling.\u201d Tsuna asked as he entered his bedroom. He saw, to his surprise, his friend sitting on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Tenth!\u201d came Gokudera, always happy to see his boss\u2019s face. Then he realized who\u2019s bed he was clumsily sitting on. \u201cAh! I\u2019m so sorry!!\u201d Tsuna watched as Gokudera jumped off the bed and began fixing any slight alteration in it, making it perfectly flat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry, Gokudera-kun. Um\u2026did you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, I took care of him. He won\u2019t bother you again, Tenth.\u201d assured the white-haired teen. It then dawned on him that he was deceiving the Tenth. He was disobeying him and lying to him at the same time! He began to sweat and bit his lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. Uh\u2026are you alright? You look pale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-fine\u2026I\u2019m f-fine, Tenth.\u201d replied the sweating boy. It was for the best, but Gokudera had to swallow all his shame. He had to severely punish himself later for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, can you stop sweating?\u201d you asked softly in his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to get really wet in here.\u201d Gokudera ignored you and decided to give the Tenth his plans for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, are you doing anything today, Tenth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, why?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I thought you might want to spend the day together.\u201d Tsuna\u2019s face turned white. Last time he went somewhere with Gokudera, they were kicked out of every place they went to because something was always blown up. He started to kindly decline when\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can go to that festival in the park, if you want.\u201d Tsuna\u2019s face lit up with happiness after Gokudera said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?! That sounds great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGokudera smiled. He liked it when the Tenth smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s also a little hot out, so we can cool down in the public pool too. I think they repaired it after that incident with water fight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don\u2019t think using bombs to attack people underwater counts as a water fight.</i> thought Tsuna, but nodded his approval nonetheless. It was really hot out, so some time at the pool didn\u2019t sound so bad. Hopefully Gokudera wouldn\u2019t try to blow it up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where do you want to go first?\u201d asked the Storm Guardian.

Let\u2019s go there first.\u201d Tsuna suggested. Gokudera almost immediately agreed with his boss and called him brilliant. Tsuna just chuckled at the compliment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t compliment him ever second!\u201d you whispered to the giant from inside his spacious ear. \u201cOnce in awhile is okay, but not after every sentence he makes.\u201d You heard Gokudera tsk softly so Tsuna wouldn\u2019t hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need to change and grab my bathing shorts. Do you need to stop by your house to get yours?\u201d the browned haired teen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need, Tenth, I have mine right here.\u201d Gokudera reached into his back pocket and pulled out a pair of swim trunks. Tsuna gave Gokudera a surprised and puzzled expression before mumbling an \u201cokay\u201d and heading up to his bedroom to change. Inside Gokudera\u2019s ear, you face palmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you carrying your swim trunks with you? Who does that?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m prepared for anything! I thought the Tenth might want to go to the public pool today so I brought this with me. Now I don\u2019t have to burden him by stopping by my place.\u201d Gokudera explained to you as he pushed his trunks back into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026okay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Tsuna came back down stairs wearing some shorts and a t-shirt. In one of his hands was a bright green pair of swimming trunks. The two males exchanged some words before heading out he door and into town. Along the way, you gave Gokudera some conversation ideas to use. The silver haired giant was reluctant to use some of them, but eventually gave in and was surprised at how interested Tsuna was in the topics. When the boys arrived at the pool, they were both laughing from a joke you told Gokudera. The day was kicking off to a good start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them entered the male locker room and, just as Tsuna had predicted, was completely empty. On a normal day it was filled with people changing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll change over here and you can change here, okay?\u201d Tsuna lead his companion to one hall of lockers while he walked off to a different one. Gokudera nodded as Tsuna disappeared from his sights. You began to listen as Hayato opened a locker and started to take his clothes off. A minute or two of rustling clothes later, the chain smoker cursed and you suddenly noticed his finger enter his ear. Before you could say anything, the gigantic digit picked you out of the ear\u2026along with a big glob of earwax. Gokudera held his finger up to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just thought of something, squirt. I can\u2019t put you anywhere.\u201d he told you. As you tried to unstick yourself from the earwax, you surveyed the giant\u2019s half-naked body and realized the problem. No matter where Gokudera put you, you would probably be swept away by the water once he gets into the pool. \u201cMaybe I can wrap some string around you and wear you as a necklace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019d be in plain sight\u2026\u201d you corrected him, finally freeing yourself from the glob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right. I guess you\u2019ll just have to stay here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you can handle this by yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here with the Tenth plenty of times! You\u2019ve been a great help so far, but I can do this by myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, just don\u2019t blow anything up.\u201d you told him, worryingly, as he put you inside his locker\u2026right next to his sweat-drenched shirt. \u201cUgh, why do I have to stay in here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you rather I put you here so you get sat on?\u201d Gokudera pointed at the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGokudera, are you alright? I thought I heard you talking to someone.\u201d came Tsuna\u2019s voice from behind a few rows of lockers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m alright, Tenth. I\u2019m all set so I\u2019ll be right over.\u201d the Storm Guardian called back as he rushed to join his secret crush. You heard the two talk as they exited the locker room and into the pool area. A few seconds later, you noticed that Gokudera had forgotten to close the locker in his rush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well. It\u2019ll be okay as long as no one\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish the sentence, you heard the doors to the pool open again and new footsteps enter the room. You cursed and hid underneath Gokudera\u2019s clothes, taking in the full smell of teen musk. As you listened to the noises outside, you could hear the faint sound of dripping water accompanying the footsteps. Whoever had entered the locker room must just be coming back from the pool\u2026</span></div></div>",

He looks at his pillow as he gets ready to lay down. Happening to look a little lower, he spots you... And sees you move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAH!\" Tsuna jumps back, nearly falling off his bed. \"Wh-What is that thing!?\" He stammers, looking at you from the foot of his bed. He's shaking just a tiny bit as he gazes at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! You!\" You shout, trying to get his attention again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this distance, all Tsuna hears is a loud squeaking sound. \"Aw man... What kind of bug is that!?\" He says to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a bug!\" You shout out, looking angrily at the boy. You start to move tword him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross! I-It's coming right for me!\" Tsuna shouts. He sprints out of the room, leaving you hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man...\" You look down, scratching your head. \"Where's he going anyway..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, Tsuna arrives back shortly after, carrying a piece of paper, while holding something behind his back. You just look up at him in confusion. He holds an edge of the paper out, and filps you onto it! You jump and roll onto the sheet helplessly as you're then lifted from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, now what!?\" You groan. Tsuna winces as he hears the strange squeaking noise coming from you. He sets you down on the table in the center of his room. You manage to get to your feet, only to see Tsuna weilding a large, brown object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that--\" Before you even have another second to think, Tsuna slams the large shoe down on you. You scream out in pain as you feel the giant object crunch your weak little bones into pieces. The paper is suddenly stained in a sickly crimson red. All you can do is moan painfully, your muscles having their final little spasm. Looking down at you, Tsuna sees you still moving, and slams the shoe down on you again, this time putting both of his hands and pressing the heel down on top of you. You make a few more crunches, uttering your last, weak and pathetic groan, as the heel grinds into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna lifts his shoe from you, and sees that your body is squished of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...\" Tsuna sighed. \"That was gross... I've never seen a bug like that...\" He said to himself. \"Well, at least it didn't splatter on my rug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna crumples up the paper. It makes a soft squishing sound, which frankly, makes Tsuna feel a little sick to his stomach. He then tosses it into the waste bin in his room, and hops into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A nice nap is what I need to forget all about this...\" He said to himself, pulling the fresh linen covers over himself. In a matter of minutes, the young Vongola heir is fast asleep, as your body is left to forever rot on a sheet of paper, a mere splatter of the former human you once were.</span></div></div>",

Four years ago your parents were killed by strange creatures called Akuma. You were rescued by a group of Exorcists from the Black Order and since then have always wanted to join them. One day, a man calling himself a General of the Black Order appeared before you. He presented you with your very own Innocence and offered you a place in the Black Order. You accepted without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving you directions to the main Headquarters, the General disappeared and left you on your own. After traveling many miles, you finally arrived at the HQ and were taken in by your new family. It\u2019s been two days since then and you\u2019re currently waiting for your new anti-Akuma weapon to be completed using your Innocence. Finally, the door to your room opens and in walks the chief officer, Komui Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Arnold. Your anti-Akuma weapon has finally been completed.\u201d announces the man as he hands you a small box. You didn\u2019t expect it to be so small, and got even more discouraged when you opened the box to find nothing but a ring. \u201cDon\u2019t let the size fool you. Innocence is very powerful, once you learn to control it.\u201d You thank him and he leaves you with a smile, closing the door on his way out. You inspect the ring in your palm. It\u2019s a simple silver band with a white jewel engraved into it. Shrugging, you put the ring on your finger and reach out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere goes nothing.\u201d you utter under your breath. \u201cInnocence, activate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jewel glows with bright light, covering the entire room in white. You cover your eyes until the light dims. You notice your entire body is now glowing with the same light. Slowly, the room starts to get bigger and bigger. At first you think you\u2019re making everything bigger, but then realize you\u2019re the one getting smaller. You stop shrinking at two inches and the white glow vanishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026this isn\u2019t what I expected. Maybe I need to control it better, then I may be able to do other stuff with it.\u201d You reach out your arm again and command the ring, but nothing happens.

But despite this, your only thought now was how easily Allen could crush you without knowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d muttered Allen as he looked around the empty room with a puzzled expression. \u201cI know I saw Komui enter to give him his anti-Akuma weapon. Where\u2019d he go?\u201d Allen scratched his chin with his arm, that at the same time, was his anti-Akuma weapon. His face lit up as he pounded that same hand into his other palm. \u201cI get it. His weapon must allow him to teleport! Or maybe turn invisible.\u201d Whatever it was, he was sure you\u2019d teleport back soon (or appear suddenly to spook him if invisibly really was your power). Allen decided to wait in your room in the meantime. He started to walk forward, oblivious to your small form on the ground in front of him.

You were about to run to the left, and easy enough task, when suddenly you noticed Allen was walking toward something else. A small, bronze trophy was lying on the floor in front of him. It was a 3rd place fishing trophy you had won a few months back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look out!!\u201d you shouted on impulse, but of course the giant Exorcist didn\u2019t hear you. Instead his foot stepped on the bronze prize and knocked him off balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Woah!\u201d Allen\u2019s foot slipped off the trophy and into the air. The young Britain tried to regain his balance, but only managed to lean himself forward for his decent.. Seeing the floor quickly approaching, he shut his eyes and braced for impact. Strangely, he could have sworn he saw James flash in front of his eyes before he shut them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched in terror as Allen\u2019s entire body fell toward you.

Only a half hour later did someone point it out to him in the hall, but he only though he had fallen on a bug or some kind of leftovers. The coat was discarded into the laundry when Allen took his next shower, the blood washed off like any other stain. The only other evidence of your being, a small blood stain on the floor of your room, was mopped up soon afterwards when you were declared to have defected. </span></div></div>",

The room you\u2019re in is dark, you can only make out a few feet around you. Within that field of vision was a giant Soul Eater. The white-haired boy gazed down at you hungrily. He was starving, and you were lunch. Bringing his handsome face foreword, he breathed hot air over your skin to warm you up. You weren\u2019t scared and you didn\u2019t struggle; you wanted this. Soul\u2019s lips parted and his slick tongue crept out. He dragged the pink muscle across your small form, from your crotch to your face. You moaned as you were covered in his saliva, feeling yourself harden. The giant teen above you chuckled evilly and licked him lips. The last thing you saw was Soul\u2019s gapping mouth, lined with his razor-like teeth, lunge toward you and engulf you in darkness. Your screams couldn\u2019t pierce the darkness and they carried over from the realm of sleep to the real world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up in a cold sweat. Your name was Lewis and you were 16-years-old. You cursed as you smothered your face with your hands. What was wrong with you? Monday you were stepped on by Kid. Tuesday you were sat on by Black Star. And now you were eaten by Soul. The dreams of your favorite anime characters aroused you, yet you woke up screaming in terror. You felt the wetness in your pants and carried yourself over to the bathroom to wash up before going back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night goes without incident. You wake up to find your parents have already left for work, so you fix yourself some breakfast and get ready for school. There are no bus routes around your area, so you\u2019re forced to walk several miles to school everyday. You don\u2019t mind it very much, as the exercise keeps your body in shape. You arrive at school and make it through the next seven hours of torture. Torture filled with boring lessons, annoying bullies, and horrible cafeteria food. Nonetheless, you leave the building with a few good test grades and another night\u2019s worth of homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, your life is so dull. It\u2019s as if your dreams are the only excitement you get\u2026even though they irritate you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way home, your usual path is obstructed by a traffic accident, forcing you to take an alternate route though a plaza of odd shops. One of the shops catches your eye: a magic shop. You aren\u2019t really saving the little allowance you get for anything in particular, so you decide to see if there\u2019s any little trinket you can get. You walk though the glass door and scan through the many jewels, emblems, rings, and other hocus-pocus. One item attracts your attention: a talisman with a moon-shaped crystal imbedded into it. Without thinking, you take it off the rack and examine it in your hands. Not three seconds later, the shop owner begins shouting at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, ya little punk! Can\u2019t you read the signs?! Don\u2019t touch the merchandise without permission!!\u201d screamed the grumpy old man. You clumsily put the item back and apologize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026how much is it?\u201d you ask the owner. The man grumbles under his breath before asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEight bucks. Would have been five, but then ya touched it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and decide to buy it anyway, not wanting to make the man any angrier. Before leaving with your purchase, you turn back to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo? It\u2026um\u2026makes your dreams come true. Yeah, now get lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and leave. Just another piece of junk to put in your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of the day goes on like always until it\u2019s night again. The talisman is thrown carelessly on your desk and you lay down on your bed, looking out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMakes my dreams come true\u2026ha. More like nightmares.\u201d you mumble to yourself before falling asleep, unknowing of the drastic changes you\u2019ve made to your fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you notice when you wake up is the feeling of your bed. It\u2019s different yet familiar. It also smells like feet. You open your eyes to see white material with some dark stains instead of your normal bed. It looks like\u2026a giant sock? You bold upright and look over the sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell? Is this another dream? No\u2026I can feel the sock\u2026this is real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou itch your skin from it being irritated by the rough cotton of the sock and look around. Your vision isn\u2019t completely clear yet, but you can make out random objects. A chair, a window, a door, a bed\u2026all giant sized. You couldn\u2019t be more than three inches tall. As everything became less hazy, you noticed you weren\u2019t alone. Lying on the bed was the owner of this room and the sock you\u2019re on\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's just...not possible...and yet there was a giant Black Star laying on the bed above you! You knew it was him from his spiky blue hair and the star tattoo on his right arm. From your angle you couldn't tell if he was awake or asleep and judging by the light outside it was either dusk or dawn. Looking around you notice there's no clocks in his room at all, not even an alarm clock of some kind. Evidently Tsubaki woke him up every morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and decide to try and figure out what's going on. Something made you shrink and transported you into another world, that much was obvious. This was also dangerously close to the dreams you've been having recently about Black Star, Soul Eater, and Death the Kid. You smack yourself in the head. That talisman actually worked. You doubt that crotchety old man even knew he had a genuine magic charm on his hands. Then again it's entirely possible he knew all along and expected this. But that's ridiculous. Things like that only happened in movies and comic books. The fact of the matter was, you were tiny, naked, and trapped in a foreign world. The best thing to do would be to get help. Since Black Star is the only thing around here that could possibly help you, you decide to try and contact him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this is easier said then done. You're not sure what it is that Black Star is doing up on his bed due to the angle but he hasn't moved for awhile. He's either really deep in thought or else he's sleeping. Judging from Black Star's personality you're going to assume he's sleeping. Unfortunately this meant that the only way you were going to get his help is to wake him up. The only way you were going to be able to wake him up is by climbing the sheets and actually physically attempt to wake him up. This would be a lot easier if he actually had a Japanese style bed which would be much closer to the ground. Come to think of it, why didn't he have a bed like that? You're not sure where exactly Death City is but since this is anime it makes sense that it would be Japanese styled right? You can't remember if they ever actually showed Black Star's room before so you can't ascertain whether or not he has a western style bed or a Japanese style one. Since the talisman did bring your dreams to life as it were and since you've can't remember seeing Black Star's room it's possible that your mind just filled in the blanks with something you were familiar with. Regardless, this is all very far from the point of what you're trying to accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long to reach the edge of the bed and luckily for you the sheets are hanging down low enough for you to climb. Grabbing the material in both hands you begin your climb up the side of the bed.</span></div></div>",

After taking a quick breather, you looked up and gasped. Sure, he looked giant from the floor, but up close he was just unbelievable. You couldn\u2019t admire him for very long, though, as that snoring was very irritating and you had to get him up. For your first attempt at this ridicules task, you walked over to the forest of his blue hair, grabbed as much of it as you could, and pulled. You pulled with all your might, but the giant meister never stirred. After a few minutes, if by your tugging or not, Black Star turned over onto his belly. With your hands still grasping his hair, you were pulled up and became entangled in the hair. It took a full six minutes until you were free and threw yourself onto the boy\u2019s back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the giant continued to snore into his pillow, you tried jumping on his back. It felt like solid stone under your feet while Black Star didn\u2019t feel a thing. Not giving up, you tried the same thing to the back of his neck. It was more sensitive here and the giant boy reached a hand up to itch the spot. You saw the giant digits coming and jumped off of him before the nails dug into his flesh to scratch it. You were still in hot water as Black Star\u2019s restless sleeping habits flipped him over again. This time his back was aimed on being on top of you. Not wanting to be squashed flat like in your dreams, you ran for you life as the gigantic mass approached. You just managed to escape the shadow as Black Star\u2019s muscular form sunk back into the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t even awake and he was dangerous! You couldn\u2019t believe someone as energetic as him was a heavy sleeper. You had to put and end to this, and you hoped the third time was the charm. Running over to his ear, you did the last thing you could think of: yelled. You yelled his name with everything you had. </span></div></div>",

When he was able to see clearly, he took notice that there wasn\u2019t anyone else in the room\u2026or at least no one he could see right away.

In a last ditch attempt at getting him to notice you you jump up and wave your arms around. The tiny movement is not lost on Black Star and his eyes fall directly onto you. He brought his face closer to you and you instinctively step back. Having someone that large suddenly focus all his attention on you made you feel anxious. You know that you need help to survive in this world until you find a way back to your own but you can't help but feel intimidated by Black Star's frowning, quizzical face. He studies you for a moment until he figures out what you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...some kind of bug or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face falls as you hear him say that. To a lot of teenage boys bugs are only good for one thing and you'd rather not travel down the same path as in your dreams. You frantically shake your head hoping he sees the slight movement. He does because he grabs you and brings you to his face. The sudden movement is dizzying and you fall over on his palm. He brings his other hand up and pokes you lightly. Of course, lightly to a powerful teen like Black Star was a rather forceful shove to you, forcing you onto your back. He brings you really close to his face, until you can feel his warm, slightly moist breath wash over your body. You can already feel your clothes moistening. His eyes suddenly widen as he exclaims, \"You're a human! But a really tiny one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly get to your feet and nod emphatically. He smiles down at you and asks, \"Are you a meister or a weapon? Or are you neither?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly explain your situation, realizing how crazy it sounds. Black Star listens and nods occasionally as you tell your story. When you finished he said, \"Wow, that's pretty crazy. Lucky for you a big guy like me was around to help you. With me on your side you'll get back  home in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving seen Soul Eater in its entirety you know that Black Star is enthusiastic and will do anything to protect his friends, but he's also a bit of a over eager show off. But you don't want to complain, especially after he so willingly decided to help you. Black Star tosses the covers off his body and stands up. You suddenly realize he's wearing nothing but his boxers, his hard muscular body almost entirely visible to you. You can't help but admire his physique. He catches you looking and grins. \"Impressive isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and he laughs at you. \"Yeah, being around me can be pretty intimidating I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks over to his dresser and pulls out a loose sock. \"I know this isn't much, but it's the best I can for now for a bed for you. When morning comes I'll take you to Shibusen. Lord Shinigami will be able to help you I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid the sock out on his dresser top and set you down on top of it. It smells forcibly of Black Star's feet but it's a bit chilly and beggars can't be choosers so you opened the lip of the sock and scooted inside. You hear Black Star lay back down on his bed and within minutes he's snoring again. You sigh and close your eyes, sleep coming eventually to your exhausted body.</span></div></div>",

Something you didn\u2019t get much thanks to those dreams. Eventually morning came over Death City and Black Star woke up. It only took a yawn and a few eye rubs before the energetic meister was wide awake and ready for the new day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that was a crazy dream.\u201d he said to himself. \u201cThere was a little tiny dude and he wanted my help. I put him in--\u201d Black Star trailed off as he glanced at his clock. \u201cSHIT!! I\u2019m going to be late! Why didn\u2019t Tsubaki wake me up?!\u201d Black Star sprung out of bed and quickly slipped on his usual attire. He put on one of his socks, but couldn\u2019t find the other. \u201cDamnit, where is it?\u201d He looked atop his dresser to find his missing sock\u2026the same one you currently slept in. Completely disregarding his dream, he snatched up the sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sleep was rudely interrupted as you tumbled to the bottom of the sock. You were still half-asleep and tried to collect your thoughts. You barely managed to before everything got dark and you looked up to see a giant bare foot entering the sock. You became overcome with fear and tried to run, but there was no place to go. Soon the wall of flesh that was the meister\u2019s foot fell upon you and pinned you against the sock. Your entire body was under his sole, save for you head which peaked out from between his toes. What was going on? Had Black Star forgotten the events of last night? Or\u2026had he fooled you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t have much time to ponder the question, as Black Star put his shoes over his socked feet and dashed out the door. You felt every step he took, his powerful body crushing you into his sole without notice. At first it was painful, but gradually got better as you got used to the pressure. You just hopped Black Star wouldn\u2019t stomp down or anything, or else your dreams would be reality.</span></div></div>",

You strain your ears to listen to their conversation, their voices muffled by sock and shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Soul, what are you doing outside? You're going to be late too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul snorted and said, \"There's no way I'm going in there! Maka's on the warpath since she barely got any time to study last night. I didn't study at all so I'm skipping today. I'll tell Sid-sensei that I was sick or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way he's going to buy that!\" Black Star laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's better than going in and failing, which is exactly what's going to happen to you if you go in there!\" Soul replied scathingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star stopped laughing and said, \"Good point. Think Sid-sensei will buy me being sick too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul shrugged and said, \"If we're going to get in trouble we might as well get in trouble together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that statement the study pressure on your body increased as Black Star continued walking. Your mind started wandering as Black Star and Soul walked through Death City. This whole surreal trip had all the makings of one of your dreams, sans the immediate death. You remember your dream of the previous night, the giant Soul eating you alive, your tiny body nothing more than a lump traveling down his throat before landing in his belly. Of course, you woke up before things got that far. You shiver as you realize that the man responsible for your death in a dream is walking with another guy who had killed you another night by sitting on you! All you needed was for them to run into Death the Kidd and you'd be surrounded by a trifecta of possible death. Of course, he would never skip class like the other two boys. But then again just last night you had talked with Black Star and he was completely nice and understanding. Perhaps purposeful death was something you didn't have to worry about. Then again, you could easily get turned into jelly by accident any second now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was so laden with these kinds of thoughts that you didn't realize Black Star had stopped walking.

Or perhaps he would just promptly forget about you and wash your remains off in the shower.

You were about to have the life crushed out of you after all, you were allowed to be distressed about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as these thoughts raced through your head, Black Star hadn't even made a move to increase pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, man!

After all the anguish you felt a few seconds ago, followed the by the immense relief, you were left feeling nothing but numbness. Apparently this was what all your dreams had been warning you about. You couldn't but bitterly think what kind of warning this was when you didn't even know getting transported to another world was possible. You felt Black Star lift his socked foot out of the shoe and felt yourself falling against his foot as he stood on one leg to take off his sock. Once the sock was removed he went to put his foot down again. Thinking fast, you manage to pull yourself on top of his toes so that his foot isn't crushing down on you. You look up and see both Black Star and Soul looking down at you with smiles on their faces, ready to crush the \"bug\" that was bothering Black Star. Well, this is your last chance at survival. If this doesn't work then you'll be as good as dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly get to your feet and jump up and down, waving your arms and calling out their names, trying to do anything and everything that would identify you as a tiny human and not a little bug.

Black Star nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis name\u2019s Lewis. He appeared in my room last night and I agreed to help him. I put him in my sock to sleep and then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026forgot about him?\u201d Soul raised an eyebrow. Black Star chuckled nervously and looked away from you in embarrassment. Soul sighed. \u201cMan, you\u2019re an idiot, you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star didn\u2019t bother retaliating. He was a bit worried about you and how you were doing. \u201cAre you okay, little guy? I\u2019m REALLY sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the giant that held you. You were glad he\u2019d found you, but still angry at him for forgetting about you in the first place. How dangerous was it going to be if you were in HIS possession.

I knew those tacos last night were a bad idea.\u201d he moaned as he put his drink down and got up from his seat. \u201cSorry guys, but nature calls. I have to empty out before filling up.\u201d And with that the ninja meister was gone, rushing toward the bathroom and almost knocking over another table. Soul just diverted his eyes form the scene and drank from his glass.  His crimson eyes drifted down to you, leaning against the salt and just waiting for Black Star to return. That muscle head didn\u2019t know the fun he was missing out on. It\u2019s not everyday you find a mini teenager in your room to do with as you wish, and Black Star chose to help the little guy. How boring. Soul continued to stare at you, who was turned away and gazing into the distance. A grin appeared on his face as he began to think up devious thoughts. If Black Star wanted to pass up this chance to be in control, that was his choice. Soul on the other hand\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe salt shaker you were leaning against disappeared as Soul moved it. You fell backwards and looked up in surprise. \u201cOops, sorry little guy. I was just making room for the food. Did I scare you?\u201d You didn\u2019t say anything and just shook your head. Soul was satisfied, but continued to look at you. \u201cSo tell me, Lewis. What do you think of Black Star?\u201d You regained your composure and stood up while answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s okay, I guess. He\u2019s nice and said he\u2019d help me.\u201d you told the giant as he listened, smiling unusually. Soul closed his eyes and thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d he said with his eyes still closed. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want to think about what would happen if you were with someone who wasn\u2019t nice\u2026\u201d The white-haired teen cracked one of his red orbs open, which gazed at you. A glint of malevolence was present in it and it made you uncomfortable. \u201c\u2026and had no intention of helping at all.\u201d Soul leaned down and his face got closer to you. You began to get a little scared and backed away, only to bump into the salt shaker that Soul had conveniently placed. Soul\u2019s face as so close that you could probably touch it if you dared to. \u201cThat would be terrible, right?\u201d Soul whispered, his hot breath washing over you and making you even more fearful. Both his eyes were open now and he smiled widely with sharp teeth so white you could see yourself in them. The next few seconds felt like hours as neither of you moved an inch, until finally Soul broke the tension. </span></div></div>",

Since you're going to be my new plaything, I need to make sure he thinks you just ditched him. So in the meantime, I need a place to keep you where you won't cause me trouble.\" He then lowers you down to... &lt;insert choice here&gt;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had finished hiding you sufficiently, feeling you wriggling against him and enjoying his dominance over you, he saw Black Star return from the bathroom, \"Oh man, that was rough. But nothing the great Black Star couldn't handle!\" Soul then looked up at Black Star, with an irritated look on his face, \"I'm sorry, Black Star. But that little guy you were taking care of. He started saying how he didn't want some weak and pathetic little kid taking care of him, and he managed to escape before I could catch him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star's attitude turned from leisurely joy to immense anger, \"Who the hell does that little bug think he is!?

Your arms were no match for even one of his toes let alone his whole foot. You situated under the appendage in such a way that your face was poking out between his big and second toe, the skin between the toes pressing against your chin. Your body was under extreme pressure as the sole of his foot and the ball of his foot pressed against your stomach and chest. It was hard to breath, not to mention the air was stifling hot and stale, your little lungs working hard to draw in any air. The stench of Soul's foot filled your nostrils, a smell of pure manly dominance that pushed against you and made you feel even more inferior. You truly were a bug and Soul could crush you as easily as anything. You laid, docile for now, underneath your new master's massive foot and just waited to see where this all ended up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, on the other hand, was having a great time. With every other step he took he could feel your body getting compressed under his sole. It made him feel huge and powerful, your whole life entirely in his hands. All it would take to end you would be slightly more pressure on his foot. A quick stomp and grind and you would be gone. The idea of having so much power over a human made him start getting hard. He laughed to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if only I had another one for my other foot I'd be in business...\" he muttered to himself with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that Soul?\" Black*Star said, walking a few paces ahead of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind, I was just talking to myself.\" Soul said, hands in his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star laughed and said, \"You shouldn't talk to yourself Soul!

Things you wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent thanks to your minuscule size. However, as long as Black Star was around, Soul would never have the chance. He needed to ditch his friend somehow if he was going to have any fun with his new plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Soul, you feel like having a race?\u201d Black Star asked, turning his head and smiling at Soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Soul raised an eyebrow at the sudden question. \u201cWhere did that come from so suddenly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, scrawny!\u201d the meister shouted before he suddenly picked up pace and began running. \u201cI\u2019ll race you to the other side of town!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wait a minute!\u201d Soul started running after the blue haired teen, but it was useless. With a shout of \u2018yahoo!\u2019 his friend disappeared in the distance. Soul sighed and scratched his head. Now he was going to have to chase after him\u2026or did he? This was perfect! While Black Star ran to the other end of the city, he would head back home and be alone with you. Until the muscle head found out he had been ditched, you\u2019d be all to himself. With a toothily grin, Soul put his hands back in his pockets and started walking the opposite way. \u201cSorry about this, Black Star. I found something else to amuse myself with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul strolled down the streets toward the apartment he shared with Maka. When he reached the building, he went inside and scaled the stairs to his floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost home, little guy.\u201d Soul muttered to you as he reached the floor his apartment room was on. He unlocked his door, went inside, and immediately headed for his bedroom. Once there, he sat down his bed and started removing his shoes. When both of his sweaty, bare feet were free he looked inside the shoe you were supposed to be in. To his surprise, you weren\u2019t there. The albino teen started wonder if you escaped, but that was impossible! He felt you under his foot when he walked through the door. Wait\u2026under his foot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul quickly plopped one of his legs on his knee and checked his sole. Sure enough, there you were, stuck to his foot by his sweaty sole. Soul chuckled with amusement before peeling you off his foot and bringing you up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a nice ride?\u201d he asks, chuckling evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou jerk!\u201d you yell, writhing wildly in his grip. \u201cBring me back to Black Star!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to go back to Black Star?\u201d Soul asked as he laid down on his bed and held you above his face. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, kid. He looked like he was really pissed off at you when I left him. If he ever sees you again, it won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare hatefully at the giant demon weapon. Thanks to him, the one person you could trust thought you had used him. You might be able to convince Black Star that Soul was lying, but that wasn\u2019t going to happen if you never see him again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d you asked fearfully. Your fear makes Soul smirk widen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly? I want to eat you. You look like you\u2019d taste really good.\u201d Soul licks his lips tauntingly and chuckles, blowing hot air your way. Even though his breath is warm, you shudder as if it was cold. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t do that, though. There\u2019s only one of you and once you\u2019re gone that\u2019s it. I better use you as much as I can.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Soul drops you onto his chest and you fall on your stomach. When you try to stand up again, Soul\u2019s large hand comes down and presses you against his body. He takes pleasure in watching you struggle under his much larger hand as you attempt to free yourself. He has so much control over you and that control is intoxicating. </span></div></div>",

You could barely move let alone lift the hand off of you, not to mention that you were worn out from being trampled by Soul's sweaty foot. You had to suppress the need to shiver as you heard Soul's colossal heart beat rhythmically underneath you. Normally a sound of that nature would be soothing to you, but now all it reminded you of was the sound of tribal drums, bringing you closer to a sacrifice. Soul noticed you sweating and grinned, \"You don't have to be worried you know...as long as you do exactly what I say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up into his blood red eyes situated above his shark like grin and nodded slowly. You didn't trust yourself to speak right now. You were completely under Soul's control. In a...well, heartbeat, he could crush you flat against his shirt. He wouldn't even have to try. It would be a good idea NOT to piss him off. You were just going to have to wait until an opportunity arose to escape. There were a lot of sympathetic people in this world. Getting to them might be difficult, but staying with Soul was definitely out of the question. Suddenly, he grabbed the back of your shirt and lifted you into the air above his grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, the more I look at you, the more I want to just eat you.\" A line of drool trickled down Soul's chin. He licked his lips and stuck out his tongue, dangling you above his cavernous maw, hot air blasting out at you in intervals. The huge pink muscle came out and ran over your body, starting at your feet and licking all the way up to your face. A few licks was all it took to get you completely drenched. Soul moaned a little, his eyes closed. \"Wow...you really do taste good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought you even lower, your feet and legs entering his mouth. You started struggling, fear evident on your face as you got dangerously close to those razor sharp teeth. Soul closed his lips over your lower half and began to slowly suck, savoring your taste. Your heart started to beat faster. This wasn't good. What is Soul suddenly decided you'd make a better snack than a toy? You could get sucked inside and then it would only be a short trip down his esophagus into his belly. You'd be melted down and then turned into nothing but fuel for the giant teen's body. Soul sucked on you for a few minutes before opening his mouth and pulling you back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame there's only one of you.\" Soul said, looking disappointed. \"It would be great to have a bunch of toys...some snacks...some sex toys...\" He grinned as he said that last one. \"Man...just having you in my hand like this, so pathetic and powerless, really gets me hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped you on top of his jean clad bulge and pressed you against it. \"You'd have your work cut out for you. Not only is my dick bigger than you, but I can get really horny. Pleasuring me is a full time job. You'll find that out soon enough though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and picked you back up, many more evil ideas running through his head as he looked you over.</span></div></div>",

You were stripped naked in it\u2026right before Soul ate you. What if he got a taste of your bare skin and it drove him over the edge? You might not leave his mouth this time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul chuckles at your feeble attempts to wiggle out of his hand. He\u2019s soon gripping the bottom of your shirt and slowly tugging it upward.

It\u2019s just about to make its last ring when Soul picks it up and brings it to his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d he says, his tone showing slight irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, this is Sarah Scarlet from Death City Library. I\u2019m calling because our records show that a Soul Eater Evans borrowed a book from us three weeks ago. The title was\u2026let me see\u2026\u2019Cooler Than Cool\u2019 by Patrick Sten. It was due yesterday and we request you return it today to avoid a late fee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat book\u2026\u201d Soul glances over at the living room table and spots said book lying facedown on it. \u201cOh, right. I\u2019ll return it right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, we\u2019ll be expecting you.\u201d replied the woman before the line went dead and Soul placed the phone back on the receiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re heading back out, little man.\u201d Soul says as he brings you up to his grinning face. \u201cAfterwards, we\u2019re heading right back here to have some more fun. You better be prepared.\u201d Soul cackles and shoves you into his shirt pocket. He grabs the book off the table and head straight out the door. As he walks out of his apartment and down the sidewalk, you\u2019re shivering in his pocket from pure fright. Soul was clearly a sadistic and cruel teenager. You knew you weren\u2019t going to last long at this rate. The way Soul looked at you with those hungry eyes\u2026he really wanted to eat you, no matter how much he told himself he couldn\u2019t. Eventually his primal need for food would overcome him and you\u2019d be in for a one-way trip to the weapon\u2019s gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t borrow this from Shibusen\u2019s library.\u201d the white haired male said to himself as he looked over the cover of Cooler than Cool. Shibusen has a much larger variety of books, but they also had a very strict return policy. The last time Soul had returned a book late there it had taken all of his birthday money to pay the late fee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Death City Library was very close to Soul\u2019s apartment, so it only took about ten minutes to reach it on foot. The shark toothed teen walked through the buildings double doors, located the return desk, and id what he had come here to do. As he turned around to head home, he suddenly stopped and gazed into the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay as well see if they have the sequel while I\u2019m here. That WAS a pretty cool book.\u201d With a new objective in mind, Soul heads deeper into the library to search for another book to rent. \u201cHehe, and while I\u2019m reading it, you can rub my feet or something.\u201d Soul pats you through his pocket, making you cringe at the thought of rubbing his sweaty, odorous feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Soul found the section of the library that had the last book he borrowed, he immediately began searching for its sequel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it was called Cooler Than Ever Before\u2026\u201d Soul mumbled to himself as he looked through the book shelves. While he was searching, a certain loud and obnoxious voice grabbed his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey, hey!! Where are you Soul!?\u201d shouted the familiar voice of Black Star. Soul\u2019s eyes bulged out of his head as he looked past the book shelf and saw his blue haired friend at the library\u2019s doorway. One of the library employees approached the meister and kindly asked him to lower his voice. That was a very bad idea, as shown when Black Star grabbed the man by the collar of his shirt. \u201cNo one tells Black Star to quiet down! I can be as loud as I want!!\u201d Black Star tossed the man aside and walked into the library. He was clearly pissed that Soul ditched him, but how had he found him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh crap.\u201d Soul cursed as he hid behind the bookshelf. \u201cIf he finds me, it isn\u2019t going to be cool at all. I better find a place to hide\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

You knew that Soul had fed Black*Star some lies about you using and dumping Black*Star so there was a good chance he wasn't going to be in a very good mood when he saw you again, but you felt like you could convince him that Soul had be lying before. There was no guarantee that he wouldn't step on you the second he saw you, being not only hot headed and impulsive, but also an idiot. However, if you stayed with Soul there was more than a good chance that you were going to end up dead, probably by digestion. You were about to stick your head out and start shouting and waving when Soul's hand stuffed a small ball of tissue down over you, forcing you to the bottom of the pocket. He had crumpled it in such a way that you couldn't dislodge it, or even move it. It was incredibly frustrating! Even tissues were stronger than you now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was glad to see Black*Star dash to a different section of the library, still shouting all the while, despite the fact that librarians and other employees were all starting to follow him around, trying to get him to settle down and be quiet. This gave Soul ample opportunity to slip away, looking for a good place to hide. He passed by general stacks, children books, contemporary fiction, classical fiction, adult fiction, all the public stacks. They were all too obvious. Black*Star would eventually search all these places. He couldn't hide in the bathroom either. He'd definitely check there. Soul was about to give up finding a hiding place in the library when he passed by a door that had the words \"Employees Only\" stamped on it in all capitol black block letters. Soul experimentally tired the knob and was pleased to find it wasn't locked. He slipped inside this room and closed the door behind him, locking it. If nothing else it would hold off Black*Star. Soul, now afforded a few minutes of peace, looked around the room. It seemed that this room was designed a lot like the main part of the library, with two floors stuffed with books. Soul walked over to the nearest stack and started looking at the titles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah...what is this?\" He muttered to himself, looking over the leather bound book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe title of it was written in some kind of unknown language (unknown to him anyway) and when he opened it, the book was filled with illustrations of various transformations, each apparently brought about by some kind of magic. This was a book on witchcraft! What was something like this doing in a public library? He put it back on the shelf and looked at the other others. They were all books of magic and witches, each one detailing various accounts of spells, potions, and incantations that various witches had used over the centuries, from the newest witches who first started displaying magic, all the way back to the head witch and her first spells. It was amazing, but ultimately boring since Soul couldn't read a single word in any of them. Heading up to the second floor, a glint of sunlight reflecting off of a glass case caught Soul's attention. He walked over to it and was surprised to see a book much like the others on the shelves, but in English! The cover read \"Magick of Desire\". Intrigued, Soul transformed his arm and slowly cut a hole in the case. He pulled out the book and opened it to the first page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those who read these pages, learn the spells to make your greatest desires a reality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul grinned. That sounded like fun. Too bad he wasn't a Witch. Spells could only be performed by Witches after all. He continued to read the page and his eyes widened as he happened upon a very interesting sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These spells are not restricted to those with Witches blood. Any human or weapon, with sufficient practice, can learn cast the spells within.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's evil grin grew wider as he looked into the table of contents. This might be just what he was looking for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud pounding suddenly echoed through the room. \"Soul! Are you in there? If you are get out and face me like a man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul groaned. He didn't have time for this. He tucked the book under his shirt and quickly put a random book in the case, covering the hole back up. He looked around and saw a back exit. Nice. Now he could make a clean getaway. The door led to an alley behind the library. It only took a few minutes to reach his apartment again. Once safely inside his room, Maka still at school, he sat down at his desk and opened the book. He scanned through the contents again, looking for a spell he could use to make his dream of owning a bunch of little slaves a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what kind of spell does he find?</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t tell me no one\u2019s ever thought about-AHA!!\u201d Soul grinned like an excited child as he quickly turned to the 108th page of the book. \u201cBingo! The Enlargement Spell.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the page was an illustration of two people. One was supposedly a normal person, while the other was gigantic. The normal one only reached up to the giant\u2019s ankle. The scheming weapon eagerly started reading the spell\u2019s description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis spell will turn even the smallest of people into one who towers over all. They will be granted immeasurable strength and power. Your enemies will kneel before you as you decide their fate. Take caution, however, as this spell comes with a heavy price. Once grown, the caster will have an unquenchable hunger. A hunger for destruction. A hunger for sex. A hunger for consumption.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe. Sounds perfect.\u201d Soul whispered as he continued reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy consuming the bodies and souls of others, the caster will continue to experience growth. The limits of this growth is unknown, as the only known user of this spell fell off a cliff shortly after consuming his entire village. The earth that his village was built on could not support his new weight and he and his home vanished into the planet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026what an idiot. I\u2019m not going to make that mistake.\u201d Soul looked further down the page and spotted a group of nonsense words. This was most likely the incantation. Underneath that were instructions on how to prepare the ritual. Soul took a few moments to mutter the incantation under his breath until he was confident he was saying each word correctly. Magic was dangerous stuff; one mispronounced word could ruin everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, bug, take a look at this.\u201d Soul reaches into his pocket and takes you out. You\u2019re tossed onto the book and ordered to read. Even though the words are huge to you, you understand the gist of what it says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoul, this spell is too dangerous! You can\u2019t use it!\u201d you yell at him. Your words put a sour look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do!\u201d Soul angrily shouts at you before snatching you and the book up. \u201cThis spell is going to turn me into more than just a teenage weapon! I\u2019m going to become HUGE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul cackles evilly and carelessly drops you onto the floor. You land on your butt and yelp . As you caress your behind, you watch Soul stomp over to his closet and look through it. After a few seconds, he comes out with a piece of chalk which he uses to draw a circle on the floor. In that circle he draws all kinds of symbols and markings that mean nothing to him. All he cares about is that they\u2019re going to make him a giant. Once he\u2019s finished, he stands in the center of the circle and looks back at the book to see what else he needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI drew the circle, next is\u2026ah crud. A blood sample.\u201d Soul sighs heavily. \u201cWhy is there always blood involved?\u201d Soul turns one of his fingers into a blade and carefully pricks the tip of one of his fingers. He winces as the liquid, as crimson as his eyes, leaks from his finger and drips to the floor. After three or four droplets have hit the circle, he puts the finger into his mouth and coats the cut with saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow for the incantation\u2026\u201d Soul goes through the words once last time in his head. Meanwhile, you\u2019re running over to him and waving your arms wildly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoul! Please stop! You don\u2019t have to do this! You can do anything you want with me; you don\u2019t need to make everyone else your slave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Soul has lost complete interest in you. You\u2019re just one tiny human\u2026.he wants more. He wants everyone in Death City. Perhaps\u2026everyone in the entire world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVestago infinitus. Mea dir o fa. Elope\u2026draka!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the words have been spoken, the circle underneath Soul starts to glow white. The light starts to move, as if it\u2019s alive. It centers around the drops of blood before shooting up and reacting with the blood\u2019s owner. Soul drops the book (narrowly missing you) and allows the light to surround him. This was it\u2026the intoxicating feeling he was getting whenever he looked at you. He was about to experience it like never before. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watched in a mixture of horror and fascination as the white light engulfed Soul completely, hiding him from sight behind a veil of pure white light. You shielded your eyes as the light became unbearable to look at. After a few minutes of this, the light suddenly shut off, leaving only Soul standing in the circle, all the careful symbols gone from the chalk circle as though Soul's body had absorbed them all. Soul had a look of pleasure on his face as he looked over his body. No immediate changes were apparent. He seemed to be the same old frightening teen weapon as he always had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for this was simple. Soul was experiencing nothing but euphoria inside his body, the magic stretching and strengthening his muscles and bones, preparing them for the surge of growth that was fast on its way. The incantation worked in such a way that modesty would be preserved, so his clothes would grow with him. He had kicked off his shoes before he came into his room, so his bare toes were wiggling against the cold wooden floor, a grand tingling sensation starting there, flowing through his soles and up his legs, pooling in his groin, stomach, and chest, flowing down his arms and into his very fingertips, the last sensation traveling like a spike to his brain. At that spike his eyes went from being half lidded in pleasure to being shot wide with energy and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clenched his fists, the power building up inside his body, slowly pushing his limbs out, stretching them longer, his height slowly increasing. He chuckled to himself, watching as his greatest desire became reality before his eyes. With a slight surge, he grew a couple more feet, his head nearly at the ceiling, his bare feet slowly advancing on your position. His chuckles grew into full fledged laughs, his voice becoming more booming as he grew more, his head slamming into the ceiling. This cut off his laughter sharply, plaster bits raining down on the ceiling, nearly squashing you several times, large cracks radiating out from where Soul's head had struck. He bent over slightly and rubbed the top of his head. \"Dammit...stupid low nine foot ceilings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down, his back against the door, his growing feet sticking out in front of him. He sighed in relief...and then surged again, his feet breaking through the opposite wall, his head slamming into the ceiling again. He couldn't help but laugh as he slowly filled the room. \"That spell was pretty potent! Totally cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Soul was enjoying his expanding body, you were dodging falling debris, furniture, and massive Soul body parts. You had nearly been crushed into paste by a toe that several times your body size. Luckily for you, Soul's gigantic and still growing feet had punched sizable holes in the wall. Thinking fast, you dove out through the hole, landing on top of Soul's foot. You carefully walked over to the skin between his big and second toe and looked down. The street was still very far away, and several people had noticed that a giant pair of feet and legs had suddenly appeared through the wall of an apartment building. With another surge, Soul's arms appeared on either side of the building, sounds of massive wreckage clearly heard from within. This surge allowed Soul's feet to plow into the ground, making it much easier for you to jump onto the ground. Soul's growth went through one more powerful surge, sending his entire body bursting out of the building, the remnants falling around him into rubble. Soul grinned and got to his feet, brushing the dust and debris off like nothing. He got to his feet and crossed his arms, looking around at the gathered people. He licked his lips, his stomach growling. \"Guess that's the unquenchable hunger. Time to get even bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a single step forward and grabbed a fleeing man, lifting him up to his drooling maw. He carelessly tossed the man into his mouth, swallowing him down, his body and soul making him grow even bigger. He laughed and said, \"This whole city is a buffet waiting to happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the average people of Death City, Soul was a powerful giant, their puny bodies standing no bigger than his ankles. To you, Soul was a massive got of unbelievable proportions. The only good thing about this was that he was ignoring you completely. He were less than a speck to him after all. There was nothing you could do for now except slowly watch Soul grow bigger and stronger. What else could you do? Unless...maybe Black*Star could help you! It was worth a shot! Running as fast as your little legs could carry you, you started searching for Black*Star</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To the people of Death City, it had happened so quickly. One moment they were going about there daily lives. Heading to work, hanging out with friends, or just doing some shopping. It was a typical weekday. The next, a giant Soul (who many of them had seen around town and even knew) emerged from his apartment without a single warning. Those that lived in the same apartment had just moments before their homes were pushed aside by the growing weapon. Some were crushed under his mass, others were buried under the rubble. Few escaped in time, but they weren\u2019t safe. They became aware of this the moment Soul picked up that defenseless man and ate him. He was just the first of many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even leaving the vicinity of his ruined apartment, Soul looked around and spotted his second victim. It was another man, this one attempting to hide behind a building. What he didn\u2019t know was that Soul was big enough to see over the building. The red-eyed pianist grinned and lifted his foot over the building. With one quick stomp he tore through the roof of the building and destroyed it from the inside. The man screamed as he dove forward; his hiding some literally exploding behind him. Still dazed, the man didn\u2019t even have time to stand up before Soul reached down and grabbed him. He brought him up to his drooling mouth and smiled toothily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can run, but you can\u2019t hide, little man.\u201d Soul said before he slowly opened his maw wide. The man shrieks as he sees what awaits him; a wet cavern and a slick tongue ready to welcome him. Soul tosses the man into his mouth, slams his jaws shut, and sends him to his stomach with a loud gulp. At his current size these people were still large enough to require a bit of effort to swallow whole. Thanks to his career as a weapon, however, Soul had become used to forcing large things down his throat. He enjoyed the struggling man slide down his esophagus just as much as he enjoyed a soul. When the man dropped into his stomach, Soul noticed his soul was instantly extracted form his body and fused with his own. The slight burst of power made Soul grow about an inch or two bigger. The man\u2019s now lifeless body was left to melt down in his digestive acids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmh\u2026you guys taste just as good as the bug did.\u201d the giant complimented as he scanned the ground for his next meal. At the corner of his eyes he spotted someone running into an office building. Soul put on his signature shark grin and stomped over to the building. \u201cStop trying to hide, bugs! You need to feed me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenage giant stood over the building and squatted down. He peered into one of the windows and smirked when he saw several frightened humans cowering before his large, red eye. Soul tauntingly opened his mouth in front of the window to show the people the inside of it. He pointed into his mouth before standing to his full height and giving the onlookers a good view of his stomach. He patted his belly a few times to complete the message; they were all going into his mouth and feeding his hungry belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout anymore foreplay, Soul gripped the roof of the office building and used all his strength to pry it right off. He was amazed at how easy it was; it was like ripping cardboard! After tossing the sheet of metal and stone away (which crashed into another building) Soul looked down into the building and smirked at all his tiny snacks. There were about ten huddled together in there, all ready to be plucked and eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for gathering in one place, guys!\u201d Soul exclaimed. \u201cMakes it easier for me!\u201d The giant weapon looked over the group as he tried to decide which one he would eat first. His eyes finally rested on another man, this one younger and looking like a college student. Soul licked his lips and reached for the man. He seemed to know he was first and tried to escape, but Soul easily grabbed him by the back of his shirt and raised him to his face. His red eyes studied the older male and he licked his lips again. \u201cI can tell you\u2019re going to be a good one. I think I\u2019ll savor you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Please don\u2019t\u2026please don\u2019t kill me, Soul! Don\u2019t you recognize me? I\u2019m\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Soul didn\u2019t give him the chance to finish. He didn\u2019t care about the man\u2019s identity or his connection with him. He was hungry and wanted to get bigger, so this man was going to help him. Soul quickly threw his third victim into his mouth and closed his jaws tight. Instead of gulping him down like the other two, he took a moment to suck on the man\u2019s body and toss him around with his tongue. He moaned in delight and just wanted to keep the man in his mouth a little longer. However, his rumbling stomach demanded food so with a single movement Soul threw his head back and swallowed the man whole. The other members of the group watched in horror as the man became nothing but a bulge in Soul\u2019s throat that disappeared into his shirt. Soul rubbed his stomach and burped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDelicious.\u201d Soul closed his eyes and relished in the feeling of his body expanding another inch. He opened them again and peered down into the building. There were still nine tasty snacks all ready for him. They may as well of been on a silver platter. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Watching those nine humans scurry like caught mice, helpless before his immense power, gave Soul a heated feeling deep in the pit of his stomach. He could easily see himself having some...fun with these humans, but right now his hunger for food was greater than his hunger for sex. Plus, it wouldn't be long before Shibusen saw him or caught on to what he was doing. If he was going to deal with a group of pissed off Meisters and Weapons he at least wanted to be big enough to assure that, no matter how many of them attacked, they still wouldn't be able to hurt him. Luckily, he didn't anticipate much force. Some of them would probably still think of him as their old friend Soul, instead of the new god Soul that was being born. He grinned as he thought of that. He had never considered himself a god, or as a man who would surpass god (like certain other people did) but now that he was actually able to do it...he liked it. After all, these pitiful bugs truly were under his control. His will decided if they lived or died. He had the power to pass righteous judgment on them...or just eat them because he felt like it. It was all a very cool situation. A situation he was going to take full advantage of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before any of that could be done, he needed to take care of his hunger pains...and those nine little humans would be a good start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Soul had been doing nothing but stare at them, his thoughts elsewhere thinking of godhood, the humans in the building had been desperately trying to escape. Unfortunately, the building had begun to collapse after Soul pulled off the roof. The entrances and exits were all demolished or blocked by fallen debris. The windows were in much the same shape, with Soul standing in front of the only row. Even if they did jump out and somehow manage to land safely, they would be right at Soul's feet. Not a much better prospect than where they were now. One woman had been desperately attempting to move rubble away from the door when she suddenly felt a huge wet drop fall on her, covering her in liquid. She screamed and looked up, only to see Soul's dripping maw directly above her! Before she could so much as scream again, the jaws closed around her and Soul lifted himself out of the building, rearing his head back and swallowing the woman whole. Another lump moved slowly down his throat before disappearing in his shirt. Soul grinned and the littles panicked, scrambling over themselves, trying desperately to escape. It was amusing to Soul. He watched them for awhile before reaching back inside and randomly selecting his next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA younger man was caught by Soul and lifted up his mouth. The boy had seen Soul before, awhile back. He had been hanging around with Black*Star and he had remembered thinking that Soul looked kind of goofy, with his bright white hair, yellow jacket, shark teeth, and red eyes. He had instantly dismissed him as just some kid. But now, here he was being brought slowly up to that same kid's face, those \"goofy\" red eyes glaring at him in amusement, his shark teeth displayed in a wide grin. Looking at those shiny, dripping white teeth, the teen could easily see his terrified reflection. Slowly, Soul's mouth opened and a gust of hot air blew the teen's hair back. He began to shake uncontrollably as he stared into the wet, dark cavern ahead of him, the uvula dangling carelessly over a deadly drop into the acidic pit that was Soul's stomach. Soul tilted his head back, dangling the boy over his mouth, his long, wide tongue rolling out like a depraved parody of a red carpet, welcoming the boy to his ultimate fate. Soul lowered the boy until he was on his tongue, then let him go, his tiny body sliding down it, past his lips, past his teeth, the tongue rolling back inside, the mouth snapping shut with a sharp *click*. Soul rolled the teen around on his tongue with a look of bliss on his face before swallowing him whole, just another snack for his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the teen, it was pure hell. He was tossed and rolled around on the weapon's tongue, bashed into his teeth and tonsils before a great sucking sensation pulled him down the throat, the muscles there squeezing and massaging his body tightly as he was moved inexorably down, down, down until the esophagus opened wide and dropped him into the stomach. The light here was dim and red, the heat unbearable. He was already starting to sweat as he stumbled around half digested food and, more disturbingly, what appeared to be human bones, the acid of Soul's stomach stripping flesh away in seconds, far faster than a human digestive system ever could. There was suddenly a dull thumping sound emanating from one wall, a dark shape suddenly appearing there. Soul was patting his stomach before going back for more. The teen seemed to have been dropped down here in a lull between digestion as no acid was stinging his skin. He wandered around, trying to think of anything he could do to free himself before death took him. As he was thinking, a loud plunking sound was heard as another human met his or her fate inside the stomach. That seemed to stimulate it, as acid and other juices suddenly started dripping and flooding the stomach. The teen barely had time to scream before the great rush covered him, pulling him under, his flesh already being burned away to power Soul's body. He quickly died from the shock, his body breaking down until only his soul remained, which instantly bonded with Soul's body, increasing his size once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul licked his fingers and dove back in, grabbing two at once this time. He smirked at them and said, \"Let's see if I can swallow you both at the same time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word he tossed the two in his mouth, swallowing them, hard. They moved slowly down his throat, and he had to swallow hard a couple more times, but they eventually went down. He sighed and wiped his drooling mouth. \"Better get bigger before I try that again. I don't want to choke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour left. He grabbed them all in his hands and watched them huddle together, staring up at him in fear, their lives in his hands. Sticking out his tongue, he slurped them up, once by one, swallowing each one as they entered his mouth until nothing was left. Soul burped loudly, putting his hands together. \"Thanks for the meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned and started hunting again, looking for more humans to devour.</span></div></div>",

Actually, \u201csearching for Black Star\u201d meant blindly wandering around the streets at the pace of a bug while constantly dodging the feet of Death City\u2019s many inhabitants. By some miracle you managed to avoid several sneakers, a few sandals, and even a couple bare feet. You collapsed onto your back and gasped for much needed breath. As you did, you looked backwards and discovered that you had barely made any progress at all. Soul\u2019s ruined apartment was still in sight, although the white haired demon himself seemed to have disappeared deeper into the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is hopeless!\u201d you shout as you slam your fist against the brick road. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going or where Black Star is! He could be anywhere! Maybe I should just lay here and wait for someone to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you alright?!\u201d came a loud voice in front of you. You instantly perked up and turned to where the voice had come from. There, standing tall and proud like always, was the blue haired meister himself. He was helping a young woman to her feet after she had fallen over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes\u2026I\u2019m alright.\u201d the woman replied, smiling at Black Star. \u201cSomeone just tripped me during the panic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can walk, right?

Thank you so much!\u201d the woman exclaimed before nodding and dashing out of sight. After making sure the girl got away safely, Black Star turned his attention toward the rising smoke in the distance. The muscular teen grinned and cracked his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to find out who\u2019s attacking and punch their faces in!\u201d Black Star shouted before he started making his way forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Black Star!!\u201d you shout from in front of the teen. The assassin somehow hears your voice and glances down at the ground. It takes a few seconds but his eyes eventually fall upon you. You had hoped for his signature smile, but you instead got his signature angry glare\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou!!\u201d Black Star shouted before he stomped toward you and roughly snatched you off the ground. His gloved hand held you firmly before his eyes with an almost crushing grip. It was uncomfortable and not the gentle touch you had remembered. \u201cI\u2019m surprised to see you alive! Now I can teach you a lesson for calling me a weak little kid!! Get ready for pain, little bug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait a minute!!\u201d you scream before Black Star can start whatever torture he had planned. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken! I never said any of those things! Soul kidnapped me and lied to you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you calling my best friend a liar?\u201d Black Star asked, not seeming to get any less angry by your plea. \u201cI should slug you for that, however that\u2019ll probably flatten you!\u201d Black Star paused for a moment before grinning toothily and clenching his free hand into a fist. \u201cThen again, maybe that\u2019s not so bad\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen to me, Black Star! Soul isn\u2019t as nice as he\u2019s lead everyone to believe! He\u2019s cruel and sadistic and he\u2019s currently rampaging through the city!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I know you\u2019re lying!\u201d Black Star replies. \u201cSoul can barely fight by himself. He\u2019s not capable for causing this much destruction!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe used some kind of spell from a book to turn himself into a giant! He\u2019s killing people, Black Star! I saw him eat two people already, but who knows how many he\u2019s eaten since then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou honestly expect me to believe you? Soul\u2019s evil\u2026he used a magic book to become a giant\u2026and now he\u2019s eating people? You might be able to fool some people with that, but not the great Black Star!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me\u2026then look for yourself! You won\u2019t be able to deny the truth when you\u2019re staring right up at it!\u201d you tell him, getting slightly angry at Black Star\u2019s ignorance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I will!\u201d Black Star replied before he roughly stuffed you into his shirt pocket and ran toward the destruction at max speed. \u201cOnce I see you\u2019re lying, you\u2019re going to get it! BIG time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star truly thought his friend was a good soul. He never thought anything strange about his shark-like grin or his blood-red eyes. He was about to get a nasty surprise\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a bit deeper into the city, Soul was just swallowing his twentieth human snack. He felt the man glide smoothly down his throat before dropping to his stomach. The giant pianist rubbed his belly and burped long and proud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, they just keep getting better and better.\u201d Soul commented as he scanned the ground for his twenty-first victim. As he was doing this, something interesting caught his eye. A human was running on the ground, but he wasn\u2019t running FROM him. The human was running  toward him for some reason. When the boy, who appeared to be a few years younger than himself, reached his feet he started banging on his big toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou giant bully!!\u201d screamed the boy as he banged his fists against Soul\u2019s toe. \u201cYou ate my dad! Give him back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul blinked and stared at the frantic kid for a few seconds before he broke out into a sinister smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, was that guy your dad?\u201d Soul asked before he reached down and grabbed the boy. He was wearing a hoodie, so Soul\u2019s fingers grabbed the hood and lifted him up by that. The boy watched as he was lifted off the ground and raised past the giant\u2019s huge body until he reached his face. As he dangled there, helpless, he started kicking and punching at Soul\u2019s face, but his strikes just couldn\u2019t reach. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, kid, you can join him\u2026as a part of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul slowly dragged his tongue over his lips before giving the boy a big grin. The boy looked at his terrified reflection and started to tear up. The last thing his father had told him was to run\u2026and he hadn\u2019t obeyed. Because of that he had watched his own father get eaten and now it looked like he was to follow. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Mmm...you're going to taste amazing little snack!\" Soul said with an evil grin, slowly lowering the boy towards his open mouth. His tongue slapped out like the welcome mat to Hell, the cavernous mouth surrounded by razor sharp teeth. The boy began to sob, rubbing his hands against his eyes as he saw his own demise swiftly approaching. Just as his tiny feet touched Soul's tongue, Black*Star arrived on the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soul! Wh--what's going on? What happened to you? What are you DOING?\" Black*Star shouted in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul growled and clenched the boy in his fist, glaring down at Black*Star. \"You completely ruined the moment you idiot! Not cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The moment? You were going to EAT that kid!\" Black*Star accused, pointing dramatically at Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Told you!\" You whispered angrily into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star ignored you as Soul rolled his crimson eyes and said, \"So what if I was? Look at me! I'm huge now! The people of this city are nothing more than snacks to me! So unless you want to join him in here...\" He pointed at his growling belly. \"...you'd better shut up and stay out of my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star couldn't believe his ears! His friend, the one guy he had always hung out with, skipped school with, ate with, and fought alongside was a murderous monster all along! All it took was a little size before he showed his true colors. Black*Star clenched his fist and said, \"Okay...I get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed and said, \"Woah, really? I thought for sure you'd put up more of a fuss than that. Maybe you're not so dumb after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white haired giant lifted the still sobbing boy to his mouth again and tossed him in the air. Opening wide he positioned himself under the boy. A blue streak darted over the open maw and caught the kid, safely depositing him on a nearby roof. Soul growled angrily again and said, \"You dumbass! Now you've made me angry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star smirked and said, \"Good! Now I'm going to kick your ass and make sure you never harm anyone again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul slammed his fist down on top of Black*Star as he boasted, smashing him through all five floors easily. With another swing of his arms he collapsed the building on top of the energetic meister. Soul then snatched up the boy and tossed him into his mouth, swallowing him whole. He sighed and said, \"Tastes even better after a struggle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hands into his pocket and started walking away in search of more food. He hadn't taken any more than five steps before the rubble of the building began to shift and move. Soul glanced back and smiled. \"Looks like you're still alive! Good, I was worried you'd go down too easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around as Black*Star jumped out of the rubble, laughing wildly.\"Like a collapsing building could stop the mighty Black*Star! Now I'm really going to cut loose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul dug his finger into his ear and said, \"You know you don't have Tsubaki right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star blinked a few times before he said, \"Ah...HAHAHAHA! I don't need Tsubaki to beat you down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe charged forward and pulled back, punching Soul as hard as he could. His fist landed on Soul's big toe, the skin rippling a little at the punch. Soul sighed and pulled back his toe, flicking Black*Star backwards several feet from the simple movement. \"Man...this is getting boring...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's stomach growled fiercely. \"I'm done playing with you Black*Star. If you find Tsubaki come back and give me a better fight. I need to get some lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started walking away again, smelling the scent of frightened humans scampering away into hiding. He grinned and licked his lips. The hunt was on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star, however, was way too tenacious to just give up after that! He ran forward again and jumped up, pummeling any part of Soul that he could. Soul sighed, more exasperated this time, and snatched Black*Star up in his hand. \"You're really starting to piss me off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squeezed Black*Star, hard, and suddenly smirked at him evilly. \"You know...you'll make a good toy for me. I'm going to keep you as I grow bigger and bigger. It'll be fun to see you shrink right in front of me Mr. Big Man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star gritted his teeth and shouted, \"No way! I'm no toy! The great and powerful Black*Star won't be subdued so easily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stuffed Black*Star into his pocket, shoving him deep into it, sticking him against some old chewing gum. \"Yeah, yeah, just stay quiet until I'm ready for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul cracked his knuckles and looked around. This low traffic area was getting dull. He needed a much bigger snack to whet his appetite.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Black Star safely secured in his pocket, Soul was all set to continue his feast\u2026courtesy of Death City. He glanced around a bit to make sure there weren\u2019t any tasty snacks left in the general area before he moved on, blowing right through the buildings in his way. As the giant walked, his hand came up to his stomach and rubbed hit soothingly. He could feel it rumble and churn as it worked on the poor boy Black Star had failed to save and apparently demand more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy there; more food\u2019s on the way\u2026\u201d Soul told his noisy stomach as he caressed it and stomped toward the downtown area. Along the way he kept his eyes peeled for any stragglers he could snack on as he walked. As luck would have it he found several on the way; they tried hiding or running from him, but Soul didn\u2019t even have to chance his course to snatch them up. Most of them were picked up, tossed into his mouth, and swallowed before they even knew what hit them. By the time the giant weapon arrived at his destination, he had grown another few feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was in the more densely populated area of Death City now. Hundreds of people crowded the streets as they tried pushing through each other on their way to freedom. They all heard Soul coming and turned their heads to see the giant teenager coming their way; crimson eyes fixated upon them. Soul licked his lips hungrily as he eyed them all. The population increased their struggles to escape, but were making pour progress. In a matter of seconds Soul was upon them, the giant stomping two giant feet in the middle of the ground. Over a dozen potential snacks were flattened, but Soul didn\u2019t care. There were plenty more where they came from\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm\u2026time to pig out!\u201d Soul announced as he squatted down and reached a large hand toward the ground. Soul scooped up a handful of people and, without bothering to stand up straight, started plucking one snack out of his palm at a time. He flicked them into his mouth and tossed them around for a bit before tilting his head back and swallowing. With the first one traveling down his esophagus, Soul didn\u2019t waste any time in snatching up the second victim and introducing her to his mouth. He pushed the woman between his lip and sucks her into his mouth, tasting her for a bit before gulping her down. \u201cAhhh\u2026you all go down so smooth.\u201d Soul commented as he smirked down into his palm. The victims he held screamed and pleaded with him, but that\u2019s all they could do. They watched, terrified, as Soul picked them off one at a time. They prayed not to be chosen next, but in the end they were all consumed eventually. When the last person he had grabbed, an unlucky teenager, was in his stomach Soul turned his attention back to the crowds of people below. His snacking had earned him several more feet in height; the hundreds of people watching helplessly as the giant male became even larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026who\u2019s next on the menu?\u201d Soul asked, licking over his pearly white teeth. He gazed into the crowd to see if he could spot anyone especially delicious. They all seemed irresistible, however. Boys and girls of all ages; they were all succulent humans with healthy souls that would make him bigger. Soul decided to screw choosing and took a different approach. He opened his carnivorous mouth wide and starting inhaling. The people were shocked when they found themselves being lifted off their feet and sent hurtling toward Soul\u2019s mouth by the sheer force of the suction. The giant suppressed his laughter as he watched a dozen or so snacks fly into his mouth helpless. Eventually Soul snapped his jaws shut, stopping the suction and causing several people still in midair to fall to the ground below. Soul moved his slimy tongue around, rolling his mouthful of snacks around and getting all their tastes on his tongue. The innocent victims shrieked as they were drenched with salvia and slammed into Soul\u2019s teeth, his cheeks, and each other. Soul knew he\u2019s choke if he tried swallowing them all at once, so he used his skillful tongue to slip one person at a time to the back of his throat to be swallowed. They all watched as one by one they were sent to their door; their screams being the last thing anyone heard. Among the people in the mouth was a lone child; screaming for his parents who were no where to be found. He too was eventually swallowed down like all the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Soul had swallowed the last one on his tongue, he grabbed his stomach and burped loudly. His stomach worked on overdrive to digest all the people and Soul watched himself get bigger and broader thanks to all the souls. While he was still growing, Soul grabbed another handful of people; but only a few this time. The giant stood to his full height and brought the handful of three or four people to his eyes. One of the captured ants, a young man, tried pleading with Soul\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Please don\u2019t eat us! We\u2019ll do anything!\u201d begged the man as he squirmed between Soul\u2019s tree-like fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to eat you. I think I\u2019ll give my stomach some time to digest before I snack on anymore of you people; but you bugs can help me satisfy another hunger of mine\u2026\u201d Soul replied before he smiled toothily and chuckled darkly. Perhaps the man and the others in his hand were in for a fate worse than being eaten alive\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul marched deeper into the city, his gut rumbling for more food as he walked. Due to the way Death City was built, Soul found himself walking downhill as he made his way to the busier sections of the city. Looking into the distance, Soul saw the wide desert that surrounded the city. He chuckled when he thought about all the people trying to evacuate. There was only one bridge connecting Death City to the rest of Nevada, and everyone would be trying to cross that bridge at the same time. They\u2019d all be crowding the streets looking for a way to escape\u2026easy picking for Soul. In fact, the giant weapon only had to walk for a minute before he spotted a street packed with panicking civilians. Soul grinned and stomped over to them. It was snack time again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside Soul\u2019s pocket\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrrrr, this is ridicules!\u201d shouted Black Star. \u201cI\u2019m the great and mighty Black Star! I won\u2019t be done in by some chewing gum!\u201d Black Star thrashed and struggled, but the sticky pink gum would not release him. The meister grunted and used all his strength, puffing up his muscles and bringing them to the point where his veins started to show through his skin. Even though he was putting in enough effort to lift a boulder three times his size, he still couldn\u2019t seem to free himself from some giant gum. Every time he pulled an arm back, it would snap back into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon of a-!\u201d Black Star muttered at the seventh failed attempt. Soon the sound of screaming came from outside, followed by Soul nosily feasting. The giant albino stuffed his face with one tasty morsel at a time, swallowing each one whole by the sound of it. Black Star\u2019s face twisted into something that combined the emotions of despair and anger. His best friend was killing innocent people and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it! All the blue-haired ninja could do was watch as his pocket prison slowly became bigger. The gum he was stuck to also enlarged, slowly enveloping his body. \u201cWhat the\u2026why is the gum growing too?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know why.\u201d came your squeaky voice as you popped your head out of Black Star\u2019s shirt pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell spill it out\u2026\u201d Black Star tilted his head and looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026Soul\u2019s clothes also seem to be growing, so I think everything that was caught in the growth spell grows along with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d muttered Black Star as his limbs slowly sunk into the growing chewing gum. \u201cToo bad that doesn\u2019t help me escape! It\u2019s just making it harder!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a minute, studying the large meister\u2019s situation, before replying, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you use Soul Menace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoul Menace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! You have a massive soul wavelength, right? So you can use Soul Menace to drive your soul wavelength right out of your body and into the gum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026that\u2019s not a bad idea, little guy! You\u2019re pretty smart. Alright, sit back and watch this!\u201d Black Star closed his eyes and focused his soul wavelength into his arms. He then forced it out of his body in a single pulse, disintegrating the gum around his arms. He did the same with his legs and torso, freeing himself completely and allowing him to roll to the bottom of the pocket. \u201cYahoo! Take that, chewing gum!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice job, Black Star!\u201d you praised as the assassin placed his hands on his hips and laughed. \u201cNow we just have to get out of here and find Tsubaki!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star looked up at the opening high above and smiled. \u201cNo problem!\u201d The energetic teen grabbed onto the wall of the pocket and began scaling up it. That beating Soul had given him didn\u2019t seem to have much of a lasting effect, since Black Star was climbing out of here at top speed!<br>\r\nOutside, Soul was toying around with a young couple in his palm. He poked and prodded them with his finger, showing them how bigger his finger was compared to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, look how big I\u2019ve gotten! Before I could barely swallow two of you. Now\u2026\u201d Soul tossed the couple into his mouth and swallowed them whole. \u201c\u2026you go down smooooth.\u201d Soul burped mightily and waited for the couple\u2019s souls to bond with him. When they eventually did, Soul felt himself get a tad bit bigger\u2026but not by very much. \u201cHeh, it take a lot of you pathetic bugs to make me bigger. I wonder what would happen if I consumed a more powerful soul\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul looked around, surveying the area, taking in all the little bugs that were still attempting to escape. It was really quite amusing. Soul was getting tired of just eating these appetizers though. He wanted to eat something REALLY tasty. He drooled slightly as he thought of eating a soul that was rich in spiritual power, something that he could really enjoy. Souls like that were stockpiled in the dozens at the Academy, but he wasn't quite confident enough to try to take that on just yet. Especially since Lord Death was there himself. Soul knew he was capable of taking on the students, but Death was a whole other game. He wasn't going to go after him until he was good and ready, namely, with all of the citizens, Meisters, and Weapons of Death City in his gurgling belly. First things first...he needed to find an isolated Meister and their weapon. He patted his pocket, unknowingly knocking Black*Star back down to the bottom of the pocket, much to the blue haired assassin's frustration. Soul knew he could easily swallow Black*Star but he wanted his friend turned bug to see the outcome of all this. He needed someone else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as though on cue, a bolt of lightning crashed down on Soul's head, singing his hat, but otherwise causing no visible damage to his giant body. Soul looked up in annoyance and grinned when he saw Ox dropping down on him from above, wielding Harvar in Lance form. \"Perfect! You'll both do nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stepped aside, shoving his hands coolly in his pockets as Ox crashed into the ground, lightning radiating around from where Harvar was slammed into the ground. The bolts raced over and under Souls' bare feet but only managed to cause a slight shock, like touching metal after building up static. It was barely annoying. Soul laughed and said, \"Wow, not even Meisters with weapons stand a chance against me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOx, a determined look on his face, charged forward and buried the lance into Soul's soft foot, causing him to wince at the pin prick. Blood trickled out of the wound and Soul got a pissed off expression on his face. \"Alright...that was just uncool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Soul and Ox fought, Soul never taking his hands out of his pockets, Black*Star found himself trapped under Soul's enormous fingers, pinned down at the bottom of the pocket. \"Oh dammit! This sucks!\" He leaned forward and bit the finger as hard as he could, hoping that Soul would shift his fingers, even a little bit. He was out of luck. The constant lightning assaults from Harvar kept Soul from feeling the incredibly minor nipping at his finger. You crawled out of Black*Star's pocket and assessed the situation. Things weren't looking good...and if even Black*Star couldn't move Soul's fingers, what chance did you have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, Soul was grinning as he batted aside Ox's attacks. It was too easy! It was like he was playing with a bee. Sure he was fast, and sure his attacks stung a little, but it was ultimately just a game to the giant weapon. Every attack, every variation on his regular attacks, everything he threw at Soul, Ox watched fail. This wasn't good. He had come here outside of all orders after Kim had broken down. Apparently one of the people Soul had eaten had been a close friend of hers. Seeing his love in tears he disobeyed Stein, Sid, and every other authority figure in the school and rushed out to bring the monster to justice. He was starting to sweat now as he realized that every single one of his attacks, no matter how devastating they were to the human body, were nothing compared to Soul. He was now above the average human. He had one last trick up his sleeve. An attack he had been working on in secret with Harvar. It combined offense and defense into a single powerful attack! He held Harvar out in front of him and lightning instantly began to dart out of the lance, surrounding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stopped moving around and watched, wondering what the strange boy was planning on doing now. He smirked as he saw the lightning form into a tight ball around Ox, looking solid and impenetrable. He took a step forward and leaned down. It turned out that the ball was surging and crackling with lightning. Suddenly, the ball rose up and smacked Soul in the face, shocking him and, at the same time, piercing his skin. He took a step back, shocked at the sudden ferocity he felt in the attack force. He touched a hand to his face and pulled it away. Blood. He glared at the ball that was dancing around in front of him. Before he could make a move, it attacked again, slamming into his body from all directions, moving faster than he could follow with his eyes. Soul pulled his hands out of his pocket and really concentrated, waiting....waiting....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the ball slammed into his chest, his hands darted up, grabbing the ball and holding it still. He could feel the lance stabbing hundreds of times into each hand, drawing blood and shocking his system all the while. Still, Soul held on, slowly bringing his hands closer together. The ball began to warp and distort, unable to stand up to the power of Soul's mighty hands. Ox and Harvar put up a valiant effort, but, soon enough, the ball shattered around them, leaving both boys a drained mess in Soul's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...you guys put up a good fight.\" Soul said with an evil grin. \"But not good enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second though Soul popped the teens into his mouth and swallowed them easily. Soul patted his stomach and started whistling, moving on his merry way to look for more snacks. He had only taken a few steps, however, when a surge of energy shot through his body. He stopped dead, his eyes widening as he felt like power, raw, unchecked power, was overflowing his body. Both Ox and Harvar's souls were big enough that, when materialized, could cover their whole bodies easily. They were enormous compared to the average, hand held souls that Soul had been eating before. The difference was staggering! Within seconds his body had blown up larger, his bare feet tearing through the streets and slamming into buildings as Soul began to tower over the city. His arms smashed through the tops of the buildings, the sleeves of his jacket growing just a bit tighter, his whole body thickening as well as growing taller, his already slightly defined muscles growing more defined. His clothes were slightly tight on him as his growth stopped, with the bugs now standing easily half as tall as his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...and that was just from TWO souls!\" Soul said, looking around at the much smaller city, the buildings standing no larger than his knees at the highest point...at this part of town anyway. \"Once all of Shibusen is in my belly Death won't stand a chance! Looks like I'll be dining on god tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed and continued on his way, feeling much more energized after his meal. So many souls, so little time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Each catastrophic step Soul took brought untold destruction to the city. The red eyed giant laughed at the chaos he was making just by walking. He was bigger than everything in the city now; save for Shibusen itself. The school was still a ways away, but Soul would get there eventually. The god-like teenager decided he was just going to take his time and enjoy the ruin he was bringing his former home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Soul trekked he took notice of a street in front of him that was full of people trying to get away. Once the city folk noticed Soul\u2019s deafening footsteps and looked up at him, they stopped their fruitless escape attempt. Many of the humans had seen the colossal Soul only minutes before, but now he was even bigger! They also noticed the teen looked more broad than when they last set eyes on him, making him even more of an intimidating sight. Soul smirked amusingly as he gave the city below one last footfall before coming to a stop. The albino giant gazed down at the littles below with a look one would give a bunch of ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all stopped running\u2026\u201d Soul observed as he looked over each terrified face, somehow capable of spotting ever detail on them as if he was inches from them. \u201cDid you finally realize there\u2019s no running from THIS anymore?\u201d Soul grinned toothily as he flexed his arms. The sound of tearing could be heard inside his jacket, but not visible rips could be seen yet. If those muscles got any bigger, though\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-he\u2019s going to eat us\u2026\u201d a woman stated as she started backing away from the towering god. Despite her voice being a whisper and that few people in the crowd had heard her, Soul himself had heard her worry loud and clear. It would appear that not only was his size and muscle mass increasing, but also his senses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t fret, little gal,\u201d Soul said as he put his arms down. The scythe weapon slowly picked his right foot up and brought it over to the crowd. All the people watched in horror as the impossibly huge foot raised down chunks of debris as it positioned itself above them. It blocked out the sun as it hanged above them; chunks of smashed building and concrete still visible between the folds of the boy\u2019s sole. \u201cYou little humans no longer do anything for me. I need more powerful souls now; you specks are just in the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Soul stomped his foot down as hard as he could. Needless to say, all the people caught under the sole died instantly. Those that had been outside of the foot\u2019s shadow weren\u2019t saved either, however. The people nearby were picked up my the impact shockwave and hurled into buildings at high speed. Others further away found the ground beneath them opening up and they fell screaming into darkness. Soul cackled like a maniac as he watched buildings around him collapse just because of one stomp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis power is too cool.\u201d Soul said to himself as he walked over the crater he had made. \u201cI should of done this a long time ago! Who needs to be a weapon when you can be a god?!\u201d Soul licked his lips as he thought about eating more meisters and weapons and becoming even bigger. There was no rush, however, Shibusen wasn\u2019t going anywhere and Soul felt like satisfying some other \u201chungers\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Meanwhile, in Shibusen\u2026*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is horrible\u2026\u201d Marie uttered as she watched the events unfold on the large screen before her. The Death room was currently occupied by five figures. There figures were Professor Stein, the two female death scythes, Spirit, and Death himself. They were watching Soul\u2019s endless rampage on a large television screen summoned up by Death. The masked god of death was currently sitting in an eerie-looking chair while sipping from a glass of tea. Due to his mask, no one could read his expression or how he was drinking that tea\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Death, we can\u2019t let this continue!\u201d Yumi spoke up as she tipped her glasses and faced her superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chat would you have me do, Yumi-chan?\u201d Death replied as he took another sip from his glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026Lord Death, I\u2019m confident YOU could teach that brat a lesson! So\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will not be doing combat with Soul just yet. It\u2019s not the right time\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but Lord Death! Innocent people are being killed by-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Japanese death scythe was silenced by a motion of Death\u2019s hand. \u201cThis city has become rather dull lately. Plus, it was the citizens of Death City that chose to live here. They believed they\u2019d be safe in the same city Shibusen was located in; I bet they never expected it would lead to this kind of disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut..\u201d Yumi muttered, but stopped when Spirit put a hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLord Death has made up his mind, it\u2019d be pointless to speak further.\u201d red haired weapon stated. Yumi bit her lip and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere must be something we can do\u2026\u201d Yumi stroked her chin as she tried to come up with a plan. \u201cThe students are getting uneasy. We know Soul must be heading this way, but we can\u2019t risk evacuating everyone. They might try to break off from the group and challenge Soul\u2026we can\u2019t have another Ox and Harvar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStein, who had remained silent through the whole ordeal, was flipping through a small notepad when he spoke up. \u201cAccording to the information we\u2019ve gathered, Soul was seen sneaking out of the Death City Library with a book in hand. Shortly afterwards he grew and started causing havoc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think that book has something to do with this?\u201d Death Scythe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do. If we can recover that book from the remains of Soul\u2019s apartment we may be able to find a way to counter this new power of his.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it could take hours to search through all that rubble!\u201d Marie replied, imaging all the death and destruction Soul was causing with each second that ticked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a better plan?\u201d Stein asked as he took a puff of his cigarette. \u201cWould you like to throw all of Shibusen at him and hope for the best?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026I\u2026\u201d Marie bowed her head and said nothing more. Stein pocketed the notepad and made his way toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll start forming a search team. We\u2019ll head out as soon as we\u2018re ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well. I\u2019ll remain here with Lord Death.\u201d Maka\u2019s father replied as he looked back at the screen. If Soul did make it here and tried to attack Death, he would be here to fight along side him. That wasn\u2019t the only reason he wanted to remain in Shibusen, however. \u201cMaka\u2026I can\u2019t even begin to image what you\u2019re feeling right now.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Maka...are you sure this is a good idea?\" The dark haired weapon was following close behind a short girl with pigtails, looking incredibly nervous as the pair sneaked around a hallway in Shibusen. Lord Death had ordered all students to remain in the auditorium, the biggest room in the building, and not leave for any reason without an escort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course this is! I'm not going to let Soul keep doing...what he's doing!\" Maka was unbelievably angry. She refused, point blank, to accept that her friend and partner Soul would do something like this. It HAD to be Kishin or Witches magic controlling him, making him do things he would never do! She fought back tears at the believed torture her friend was enduring and said, \"We have to save Soul! You know Black*Star is out there somewhere too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki nodded and said, \"Yes of course. You're right! We can't just sit back and let this continue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two quickly made their way through the halls, Maka using her soul sensing abilities to avoid any teacher or adult that was patrolling the halls. It took a long time, but they eventually made it to the outside of the building. However, the gates surrounding the school were now closed tight. \"Okay...we're going to have to go over the gates!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they'll see us!\" Tsubaki argue, looking nervously at all the big empty space in the school's courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wont' see us! Use your Smoke Bomb Mode!\" Maka explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....here I go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsubaki transformed into a smoke bomb and Maka grabbed her and threw her against the ground. Since their souls were not aligned properly Tsubaki was only able to let out a single column of smoke, stretching from the door of the school, to the gate. It was enough to keep the two students hidden, however, as they leaped over the gate and into the city proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the wreckage of Soul's house, Stein and a small force were currently searching through the remains of Soul's house. Not only did they have to contend with the rubble from Soul's own apartment building, but he also had to deal with the surrounding buildings, which had collapsed and added their rubble to the mess. Not to mention it was perfectly possible that the book would be damaged beyond repair if they even managed to find it. It felt like a wild goose chase to almost everyone involved, but in the backs of their minds they knew they had no other choice. A rumble suddenly was felt through the area as, far away, Soul stomped out some more buildings and probably people, his bone chilling laugh echoing across the city. Time was most certainly of the essence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all of this was going on, Maka and Tsubaki were quickly making their way to Soul's location. It wasn't exactly hard to find him, since he stretched up higher than every building except Shibusen. Tsubaki was starting to get even more nervous, seeing how enormous Soul looked. They had been told he was a huge giant but actually SEEING it was a completely different experience!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Maka...are you sure we can do this?\" Tsubaki asked, voice quivering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! We have to!\" Maka replied, looking around for a good, tall building around Soul to climb. If she could get close enough she could begin to start talking some sense into him! \"There!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to a rather large office building that managed to stretch up to just above Soul's knees. It was the best they could hope for. The two female students rushed over to the building and ran inside. It was one of the few not totally decimated by Soul. He was making his way over to it though, so it wouldn't be standing for long. The elevator was in working condition so they took it all the way up to the roof. Once there, Maka ran to the edge of the building, cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted, \"SOOOOOOUL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, his hearing sensitive to every whisper, turned his head and saw Maka waving her arms at him. He grinned and walked over to the building, crouching down so he was face height to the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two. Pretty impressive huh? And I'm only going to get bigger!\" Soul grinned and Tsubaki nearly fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka stayed strong and shouted, \"Soul! You idiot! What do you think you're doing? This isn't like you at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul waved a finger and said, \"Guess you didn't know me as well as you thought you did Maka! I've always been like this. There's just never been an opportunity to show it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're eating HUMAN SOULS! You're going to turn into a Kishin!\" Maka insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I won't!\" Soul argued back, his smile disappearing. \"My soul is staying just the way it is! This whole thing was brought on by a Witch spell so it's totally different than an average human just eating souls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka turned to Tsubaki and whispered, \"Hear that? Go back to Shibusen and let them know about the spell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed and said, \"I can still hear you just fine Maka. And no one is going anywhere except in my stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out and grabbed Maka in his fist, the girl caught totally off guard by Soul's speed and dexterity. She struggled to free herself as Soul Slowly brought her up to his drooling mouth. \"Mmm...you're going to be a great snack Maka!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaka screamed and struggled, desperate not to get eaten by her once caring partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast Soul!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stopped the movement, just as his hand was about to toss Maka into his gaping mouth and frowned at the building top. Black*Star was grinning up at him, holding Tsubaki in weapon form out in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh jeez...not this again. Why can't you just give up and watch like a good slave?\" Soul asked, shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mighty Black*Star is no man's slave! I'm going to beat you into submission and make sure you never hurt another person again!\" The energetic assassin shouted, getting ready to attack Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark toothed weapon grinned and lifted Maka up to his mouth. \"Hope you don't mind if I have a pre fight snack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Black*Star could react, Soul dropped Maka into his mouth. He swished her around inside and grinned as he tilted his head back...and swallowed! Black*Star and Tsubaki could only watch in horror as Soul so easily dispatched what they thought was his closest friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's IT!\" Black*Star shouted, his temper rising through the roof. \"You will PAY for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul licked his lips and put his hands in his pockets, waiting for Black*Star's best.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAlright, Tsubaki, Soul Resonance!\u201d Black Star shouted as his weapon morphed into her Uncanny Sword form. He held the black blade up to his face as the two\u2019s souls started to synchronize. Black lines appears over Black Star\u2019s body as it started radiating a powerful soul wavelength. A pillar of visible energy emerged from Black Star and shot into the sky. The power he was emitting was impressive; it might even be enough to rival Soul\u2019s\u2026for right now. \u201cI was going to just put you out of commission, Soul, but now I\u2019m really going to kill you!!\u201d the blue haired ninja yelled a she fought back the tears that were forming in his eyes. He couldn\u2019t believe things had gotten this far. If he did survive this battle; things were never going to be the same again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star leaped off the building and flung himself at Soul. Tsubaki crackled with black energy as he got ready to swing at the giant\u2019s midsection. Before he could even touch him Soul gave off a powerful pulse of energy. His soul wavelength was enough to reverse his attacker\u2019s direction and send him flying backwards. Black Star did a flip in midair and landed on the same building he started on. He watched as Soul looked down at himself and grinned. The giant pulsed with power a few more times before he started growing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeeeaaah! I can feel it!\u201d Soul exclaimed as he clenched his fists and watched the city get further away. His expanding bare feet tore through any remaining buildings like they were made of Styrofoam. Black Star had to hop to another rooftop before the one he was standing on collapsed. Soul\u2019s toes, formerly twice as big as a person, were growing to become the size of small homes. Soul\u2019s maroon pants started to rip and tear at the thighs as his leg muscles grew bigger, harder, and stronger. Black Star (who was now staring Soul\u2019s crotch instead of his stomach) could see that every part of Soul was growing; even the monster tucked away in those pants of his. The albino god felt his arms muscles thicken and become more detailed. A quick flex tore his sleeves at his biceps, revealing those two hills of perfect, round dominance. His pecs grew behind his jacket, making themselves known by pressed against the yellow and black fabric. The top button on the jacket popped off and Soul\u2019s top opened a bit, revealing just a tease of that sculpted chest. The bottom of the jacket rode up a bit, allowing a bit of the weapon\u2019s eight-pack to be shown to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like my clothes are having trouble keeping up with the growth!\u201d Soul said as he flexed his arms behind his head, tearing the jacket some more at the shoulders. \u201cOh Maka\u2026I feel closer to you than EVER!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026\u201d Tsubaki whispered in a choked up voice. \u201cMaka\u2026she\u2019s already been\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold it together, Tsubaki.\u201d Black Star said as he clenched the blade\u2019s hilt tighter. \u201cMaka\u2026she was doomed the moment Soul got his grimy hands on her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked down at Black Star and smirked devilishly. The smug look on his face was enough to make Black Star charge forth with his neck attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShadow*Star!\u201d Black Star commanded as he took up a fighting stance. His shadow was then possessed by Tsubaki and sprang to life. Large tendrils of darkness wiped out at the giant, smacking into his body with crushing force. The blows were enough to split buildings, but Soul just kept his muscled arms relaxed behind his head and took them all. Black Star kept up the assault for an entire minute, but the toll the Uncanny Sword was having on him forced him to stop. He observed Soul and grinded his teeth when he realized he hadn\u2019t even make a cut in Soul\u2019s clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that it? I barely f-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShadow*Star: Gathering Cutter!!\u201d Black Star shouted, not giving the cocky giant a chance to finish. The tendrils once again formed out of Black Star\u2019s shadow, but this time they wrapped around Soul\u2019s legs, waits, and arms. They were meant for restraining the target, but the giant Soul could easily move his arms despite the restraints. What\u2019s more; Tsubaki was trying to pull Soul closer to them so her partner could deliver a fatal blow, but Soul didn\u2019t even notice the effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are weak.\u201d Soul said as he grabbed one of the shadow tendrils. The titan pulled on the rope, easily dragging Black Star off the roof and toward him. Without giving the assassin a chance to counter, Soul punched him in mid air. Black Star was hit square in the chest with one of Soul\u2019s knuckles. The blow was so unbelievable that the teen blacked out the moment he was hit. He was in an unconscious state as his body spiraled through several buildings before hitting the ground hard, forming a crater. Soul stomped over to the place he had landed and waved away the smoke. To his surprise, the meister was standing on one knee, Tsubaki implanted in the ground for support. A trickle of blood dripped from his lip and his body was bruised all over. The black lines that had formed on his skin were also gone. \u201cHmmm\u2026well I guess you aren\u2019t that week. Your soul would probably make me shoot right up, too bad I\u2019ve already decided to keep you around. Your little toothpick on the other hand\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star grunted and pulled Tsubaki out of the ground. He got back into a fighting stance and glared up at Soul hatefully. He thought about giving the toe in front of him a deep cut, but feared Tsubaki might just break in half from the attempt\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlack Star\u2026we should retreat! He\u2019s too strong for us\u2026we need help!\u201d Tsubaki pleaded, her strained voice showing that she had also taken some damage from the blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can take him! I haven\u2019t even started to use my most powerful techniques!\u201d Black Star said as he held Tsubaki up to his face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlack Star! You can\u2019t! If you use the Uncanny Blade again in this state, your body won\u2019t be able to take it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much was going on that one thing remained forgotten: you. Your tiny form was tucked away in Black Star\u2019s pocket. You had heard everything that had happened and was scared out of your wits. You held onto the inside of the pocket and hoped Black Star would be smart for a change and run for it. He couldn\u2019t win this battle\u2026Soul was HUGE. You had been too afraid to look at the behemoth due to your own diminished size, but you could tell by his thunderous footsteps and his booming voice that you were less than a grain of sand to him! Oh man\u2026if he ever found out you were still alive\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Y-You're right...Tsubaki. We need...to run for now!\" It was obviously causing Black*Star no end of distress to have to admit this. Soul heard the assassin's defeated voice, tinged with shame at what he was forced to do. \"Ha!\" Soul said, grinning down at the blue speck and his sword. \"What makes you think I'm going to let you get away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smoke bomb mode Tsubaki!\" Black*Star shouted, Tsubaki forming into a ball in his hand which was quickly tossed to the ground. Soul blinked and sighed. \"Really? That the best you can do? How uncool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe billowing smoke filled a large part of the area, shrouding the buildings and street in darkness....unfortunately it was all pretty much useless since Soul's senses had been sharpened to an uncanny degree, allowing him to see Black*Star's running shadow in the smoke. He grinned and leaned down, effortlessly grabbing the ninja in his huge fingers. Despite the fact that Black*Star could take residence inside one of Soul's toes, Soul was able to hold him with an infinite care so as not to crush him. Along with increased senses he received an increase in the ability to control his body as well. Soul brought Black*Star up to his crimson eyes and smirked. \"Just think...I used to be as small and pathetic as you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed, his huge mouth opening, air rushing out and over Black*Star, the gigantic cavern taking up all of his sight. His eyes took it all in, the rows of razor sharp teeth, the glistening tongue that could so easily pin and subdue him, the dank, black hole of his throat, the pulsing fleshy walls of his inner cheeks and back of his throat, the dangling uvula...it was like looking into the gates of Hell. Soul slammed the gate shut, his trademark grin filling Black*Star's view instead. \"Now...you won't be needing THIS anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe plucked Tsubaki out of Black*Star's resisting hands. Black*Star screamed as he reached out for his partner, the sword turning back into a young woman as she was dangled over Soul's maw. \"BLACK*STAAAAAR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TSUBAKIIIII!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star's body shook with rage, sadness, and a twinge of fear as Soul dropped Tsubaki, screaming, onto his tongue and easily swallowed her whole. \"Aah...friends make the best food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP! YOU DAMN MONSTER! I'LL KILL YOU!\" Black*Star shouted, struggling in between Soul's fingers in a fruitless attempt to escape. Soul laughed mockingly and held Black*Star up to his eyes again. \"Settle down you little spaz. You're not doing anything except being the sole witness to the birth of a new god! So just sit back and enjoy the ride....or I might forget where you are and \"accidentally\" mix you in with a bunch of my snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star glared up at Soul but didn't say a word. The only reason he didn't say anything was because if he stayed close to Soul he'd have a better chance of finding some weakness, ANY weakness, to take down the towering weapon. Unfortunately for Black*Star, Soul HAD no outstanding weakness any more. The only way to take him down would be finding the book that did this to him...and even then there was no guarantee of a cure! Soul rubbed his crotch a little and said, \"Man...I'm starting to feel pretty active down there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned at Black*Star and said, \"Found your new carrying case!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? NO! You've gotta be kidding!\" Black*Star shouted, the fingers now holding the back of his shirt. Soul pulled open the waistband of his pants and briefs and said, \"Relax, I showered today. Have fun down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, he dropped Black*Star into his pants, the tiny assassin screaming all the way down before he landed in the field of white hair. Soul snickered and let the band go, snapping it against his waist as he felt a familiar surge of energy. \"Ah...growing again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul waited happily for the change and was disappointed as he only grew slightly larger, his body adding MAYBE a story or two to his height. It was barely noticeable. \"Man...Tsubaki turned out to be a total dud! Totally uncool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicked a building over sullenly, looking around for more food. His belly was already starting to rumble. He started wandering back toward his house to see if he missed anything over there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any luck yet?\" Stein shouted out from atop the rubble, his lab coat tossed aside as he searched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing yet sir!\" various people shouted from all over the wreckage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Remember, keep a look out for anything that looks remotely like a book, paper, or anything that has writing on it! The book might have been destroyed in the wreckage!\" Stein ordered. \"Yessir!\" came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! Bad news!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what is it now?\" Stein asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soul has been spotted in the area! He's coming this way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright people you know the drill! Get ready to fight Soul if it comes to that, but try to avoid conflict if possible! For now, hide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone scattered, hiding themselves amongst the rubble as Soul's hulking frame appeared over the hill. His massive foot landed directly in front of them, his big toe inches from Stein's hiding place.  \"Huh...\" Soul said, his voice rumbling intensely over them. \"Looks like most of the city is abandoned... I can't believe I used to live here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed and lifted up his foot, preparing to stomp it down on his once spacious apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the foot descended, Stein and his group broke from their hiding spots and ran to avoid it. Soul laughed even harder and put his foot down away from the wreckage. \"I thought some ants might be hiding out!\" Soul cracked his knuckles. \"Time for some more fun!\"</span></div></div>",

His feet were so massive, however, that the group could barely surround half of one foot without spreading out too much. Soul observed closer and noticed all the people wore similar clothing and were carrying guns. Soul\u2019s smile started to fade as he realized they were all just humans\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, just a bunch of human bugs employed by Shibusen.\u201d Soul sighed as he put his hands in his pockets. \u201cI don\u2019t need your pathetic souls anymore, but I guess I can have some fun crushing all you!\u201d Soul snickered as he got ready to lay waste to the foolish scout group. Before he could take the first step, he noticed someone odd in the group. One figure stood out from the rest and, although he was like an ant to Soul, he could make out that familiar screw in his head. \u201cNo way\u2026Professor Stein?!\u201d Soul\u2019s red eyes seemed to gleam as he squatted down to get a closer look at the tiny meister. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d come out here! Shibusen should of just served you to me on a silver platter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoul, stop all of this!\u201d Franken Stein shouted up at the smiling giant. \u201cHas madness completely consumed you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadness?\u201d Soul blinked for a moment before erupting into laughter. \u201cHahaha, no! This isn\u2019t the power of madness; it\u2019s my own raw power!\u201d Soul demonstrated this flexing his left bicep, showing off its peak and all the natural power that was contained within. \u201cI\u2019m not insane or anything. I\u2019m the bigger one, so it\u2019s only right I act like it! You wouldn\u2019t care of you squashed a bug in your lab, would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoul\u2026! What you did to Harvard and Ox\u2026only someone consumed by madness would betray their own friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFriends? Those two? Don\u2019t make me laugh\u2026now Maka, SHE was a friend. And a tasty one too.\u201d Soul licked his lips as he rubbed his stomach, remembering how good it had felt when he ate his former meister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You\u2026ate Maka?! You ate your own partner?!\u201d Stein clenched his fists with rage, but Soul\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup, and now I\u2019m going to eat you!\u201d Soul boomed as he thrust his hand toward the Shibusen teacher. Stein was more than fast enough to dodge the hand, jumping out of the way as it crashed into the ground. When the giant removed his hand he saw a bunch of debris, several mangled humans, but no Stein. \u201cMissed\u2026\u201d Soul clenched his fist, crushing the everything in it to dust. He started scanning the ground again for Stein, but his vision became obstructed when a bunch of flashing lights exploded in his eyes. Soul put a hand up to his eyes and glanced down to see several scouts firing lasers at his face. \u201cLittle pests\u2026\u201d Soul muttered as he stood up to his full height and raised one of his feet over the group. He brought it down slowly, but it as so massive that the puny humans could never hope to avoid it. The white haired giant pressed his foot into the ground and felt several pops under his sole. He swiveled is foot back and forth, smearing them into nothingness. The other human employees watched as Soul raised his foot again, revealing a mess of debris stuck to the bottom. The smashed remains of their comrades were no where to be found, however. It was like they never even existed\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d Soul asked as he shifted his foot, overtaking several more humans without noticing. He scanned the ground for more ants, especially Stein. A few were hiding behind the towering titan, debating on whether or not to flee or stay and die like their comrades. Suddenly, Stein jumped out of his hiding spot and cracked his fingers, his soul wavelength surging around them. Soul noticed Stein, but only after he had thrust his palms into his big toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoul Menace!\u201d the powerful meister cried as he forced his power into Soul\u2019s flesh. The amount of power he had used would of torn Soul apart at normal size, but now it only felt like the giant had stubbed his toe on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d Soul yelped as he took a step back, crushing those humans that were hiding. He brought his foot up to his chest and started rubbing his toe. His crimson eyes glared down at Stein, who glared right back up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay for that, ant! Don\u2019t blame me if I crush your legs or something; I just need you alive before I consume your soul!\u201d Soul reared his fist back and threw it at his former teacher. Once again Stein jumped over the fist long before it reached the ground. Soul was expecting this, however, and delivered a jab to Stein while he was in mid air. The scientist crashed into a nearby building, prompting Soul to reach in after him and take out his dazed form. \u201cGotcha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul brought his fist up to his face and plucked the ant-sized Stein out of it. The most powerful meister in Shibusen was now held between two fingers before a massive red eye. Soul\u2019s booming laughter filled his ears as he was brought closer to that mouth. The titan opened his mouth and licked over his shark-like teeth. The pearly whites glistened with perfection, capable of cutting through even diamond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can feel it\u2026your soul is going to make me HUGE, professor!\u201d Soul giggled happily as he thought about how he should consume Stein. Toss him into the air and catch him? Lick him off his palm? Just pop him right in? This was a special moment, after all. Maka\u2019s soul was nothing compared to what Stein\u2019s was going to do for him. He might even tower over Shibusen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye, teach! I\u2019d say it was nice knowing you, but I\u2019d be lying.\u201d Soul chuckled darkly before opening his jaws wide and getting ready to drop Stein in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d Soul froze for a moment and glanced around. Did he just hear someone call him kid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten pretty big\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Soul closed his mouth and looked around for whoever was talking to him. That voice\u2026it sounded familiar. Soul scanned over the ground and the building tops, but all he found were a few leftover humans crawling away. Then he realized\u2026the voice sounded like it was coming from right next to him. Could it be from\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Soul could finish his thoughts, he felt something slice into his ear. The giant\u2019s eyes widened and he howled in pain. He brought his hands up to his ear (dropping Stein in the process) and covered the wound. His eyes were full of loathing now as he looked down to where Stein had landed and saw another figure land next to him. The figure was male, had red hair, and part of his elbow was transformed into a black scythe. The man glared up at Soul with two emerald eyes and the look showing he desired but one thing: Soul\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpirit\u2026\u201d Stein muttered, catching his breath after his near death experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe most powerful meister and the most powerful weapon\u2026\u201d Soul, despite his injury, grinned wide. \u201cI guess snack time\u2019s over! Time for the main course!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul lowered his body slightly into a defensive posture, not taking Stein and Soul as lightly as he had Maka, Tsubaki and Black*Star. They were just as tiny but they were capable of putting up more of a fight. They had both, separately, already caused him mild pain and discomfort and, compared to every single other human being that had attempted to attack the god like Soul, that was quite an accomplishment. They were even more dangerous together. His crimson eyes watched as they darted back and forth, making use of the rubble around them to make sure that Soul couldn't get a clear view, moving so fast across the land it looked like they were appearing and disappearing at will. Soul chuckled, amused at their antics. To him, this was still just a simple game. To Stein and his weapon...it was a life or death struggle to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul kept his defensive position for a few minutes, but when Stein refused to actually ATTACK him he slowly stood back up to his full height and rubbed the back of his head, his muscular arm ripping his sleeves more from the simple movement. \"Man...you guys are too boring! At least Black*Star tried something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped forward and suddenly fell to his knee, the ground cracking, splitting apart, and shaking as the full weight of the massive weapon hit the ground. Stein barely managed to leap into the air to avoid the tremors, though he had to raise Spirit equally as fast since Soul's fist suddenly fired at him with the force of a thousand cannons. Stein grunted as he tried to hold Soul back, but was unable, his body traveling swiftly through the air. Within a few seconds he would crash into the ground with nearly lethal force if he didn't do something...FAST! Using Spirit, the meister managed to hook the weapon between two of Soul's fingers, swinging underneath his fist, stabbing Soul in the arm and dragging a huge gash along it, slowing his descent until he crashed lightly on his feet onto the ground. Soul bellowed in rage, grabbing his arm. They had cut deeper than he thought they could! Blood spattered on the ground as he rose back up to his full height. This wasn't a game anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to Stein and Spirit's soul resonance, they were perfectly in tune fighting Soul, increasing their power enough to do significant damage to the so called god. Soul ripped off his sleeves, revealing his thick arms, tying the material around his arm to keep the blood from flowing. \"Alright you little bugs! That's it! No more Mr. Nice Guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul lifted up his foot and slammed it, hard, into the ground, causing it to shake and warp even more than before, buildings and streets alike falling into the crevices as the ground split open. This made things even more difficult for Stein to move around in. Several holes and chasms were littered across the landscape, forcing him to constantly jump around to make any distance. Soul watched his movements carefully, then, as Stein leaped over a particularly large chasm, he lifted his foot up and slammed it down on top of him. Stein was slightly slower this time, his left leg getting caught by the massive foot before he could fully dodge. He gritted his teeth, trying to avoid screaming in pain as his leg was shattered. Lifting up Spirit, he stabbed Soul, deep into his foot, causing Soul to jerk his foot back up, launching the professor into the air and up towards Soul's face. Soul moved on pure instinct, bringing his hands up and slamming them together like he was swatting a bug. Stein was prepared for this and turned Spirit side ways, stopping the killing hands inches from his body. Gathering his energy into his hands, he slammed one against each of Soul's palms and shouted, \"Soul Menace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat felt like two bee stings slammed into Soul's hands, forcing them apart, Stein grabbing Spirit again and aiming a slash at Soul's chest. Soul jerked his body back and to the side, the scythe's blade only managing to rip his jacket slightly. Growling in anger, Soul slammed his fist against Stein again, moving faster than the teacher could deal with, Stein only managing to clear his whole body except for his left arm which was promptly smashed against a building and Soul's enormous fist. Stein crumpled to the ground, half of his body maimed and worthless. Using Spirit as a crutch he managed to get to his feet, though his options were now severely limited. Before he could even begin to move, Soul's massive feet appeared on either side of him, the gigantic teen lowering himself so he was crouching over his former teacher. \"You're lucky I need you alive teach. Otherwise you would have already been dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe changed one of his arms into a blade and said, \"See? I could have sliced you up before you knew it was coming!\" His arm turned back to normal and he reached down snatching Stein by his unbroken arm. Using the finesse he recently gained from his new senses, he crushed the man's arm, forcing him to drop Spirit, whom Soul swiftly snatched up. He held each man in a different fist, bringing them both up to his huge face. \"You two definitely put up a good fight! But now you're going to give me the biggest spurt I've had yet! See Shibusen over there? Thanks to you two, I'll be able to take it on with ease! Thanks a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and tossed Spirit into mouth first, slathering the weapon in saliva before gulping him down. Soul sighed and turned his attention to Stein. \"Now you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to worry about Stein fighting back anymore so he took his time. He held the broken man in his palm and slowly stuck his tongue out, running it all over Stein's body. When he had fully appreciated the man's unusual taste, he licked him up into his hot, steamy mouth, running him over the sides of his razor sharp teeth, coating him in so much saliva he couldn't move. With a practiced flick, he was launched into the air, bumped into the uvula, and dropped down, down, down the dark, slimy throat. Soul burped a little and looked around, eager to see how huge he was about to get!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul could feel the two men struggle against his digestive system. Despite their beaten and worn bodies, they still put up a fight, but in the end they were just delaying the inevitable. The struggles ceased as their physical forms were broken down like everyone else and their mighty souls fused with Soul. The albino titan planted his feet firmly on the ground as he felt newfound power build up in the middle of his stomach. He closed his eyes and grinned as the power exploded outward like a bomb, wiping out everything around Soul like an invisible hand. Buildings that once stood around Soul\u2019s feet simply vanished; Soul now stood in a circular area of dirt and debris. It wasn\u2019t over yet; a second burst of unfathomable power came from Soul and buried into the ground, creating a sizable crater right there in Death City. Then came the growing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul licked his lips as he watched his point of view get higher and higher. His feet started filling the crater he had formed as he grew like never before. Any people that had somehow survived watched their new god ascend even higher. Those that thought Soul couldn\u2019t get any bigger and scarier were proven horribly, horribly wrong. None of them ran, however. There was no way they could escape someone so huge now; they wouldn\u2019t be safe anywhere in the city\u2026and soon the entire world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI used to think this city was big,\u201d Soul said to himself in a loud, booming voice. The growing god stepped out of the crater, his barefoot slamming into the city and causing the ground to explode under his heavy power. The other foot caused equal destruction as several miles of civilization was wiped out in an instant. \u201cBut it\u2019s really pathetically small!\u201d Soul laughed as he looked down on his former home. The god turned his attention to his jacket as his growing muscled made mincemeat out of it. His favorite jacket started falling to the ground below, but Soul felt no sadness over it. The perfect abs and mountain sized pecs that became fully visible when the last of it disappeared was Soul\u2019s new fashion. His god-like body would have been perfect if it wasn\u2019t for that scar across his chest, but oh well. Soul always did think the scar was cool\u2026it just made his hulking form more sexier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, poor Black Star,\u201d Soul chuckled as he flexed his bicep. The makeshift bandage he had previously made popped off as he did this, revealing that the wound Stein had just given him was already closing up thanks to the mad doctor\u2019s own soul. \u201cHe spent his entire life shaping his body and I\u2019ve surpassed it in every way after just a few hours of stuffing my face!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Black Star, Soul only remembered the blue haired meister when he felt his dark red pants getting uncomfortably tight around his thighs. \u201cOops\u2026better get him before he\u2019s crushed!\u201d Soul dug his hand into his shrinking pocket, tearing it open as he did, and enclosed his small prisoner in his fist. He brought the fist up to his young face and opened it. There, in the middle of his palm, was the ant-sized Black Star. The ninja still looked broken over the death of his partner, but he could still acknowledge the growing palm around him and the sinister red eye that was staring at him. He shivered in fright as Soul moved his palm a little away from his face, allowing his former friend to see the entirety of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, Mr. Big Man?\u201d Soul asked as he watched Black Star shrink in his palm, just as he said he would. \u201cI\u2019m bigger than Shibusen now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star\u2019s mouth quivered at the sight and sheer power Soul was emitting. He was nothing but an ant to the weapon now\u2026he had no choice but to admit that! There was no opportunity for his cocky, big ego to show itself here. Black Star had only one thing to say right now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What are you going to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Soul titled his massive head a bit and smiled amusingly. His crimson eyes glanced over at Shibusen, which the white haired weapon could now look down at no matter where he stood in the city. His eyes fell back onto Black Star. \u201cWorried about the rest of your comrades? Don\u2019t be\u2026they\u2019ll all end up in my stomach too, along with the other Death Scythes and even Shinigami himself! There\u2019s nothing you can do about it, so just accept it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star gritted his teeth. He didn\u2019t want to accept that, but the way thinks looked\u2026it was the only likely conclusion. Shibusen hasn\u2019t made any attempts to evacuate and it\u2019s too late to start them. If the most powerful Death Scythe was defeated, what chance did the others have? There was still Shinigami-sama\u2026but did he even stand a chance now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Black Star worried about he fates of his comrades, Soul was thinking about more important things: like his pants. They now looked like a shredded pair of shorts and they were hugging around his muscled thighs. They\u2019d eventually tear off, but Soul couldn\u2019t wait nay long. He gripped the fabric and tore it off with ease, tossing the ragged clothing aside. The only thing Soul wore now was a pair of blue boxers with bones all over them.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul just couldn't get over how huge he had become...and this wasn't even the end of his size increase! So long as he had souls to eat, he'd keep right on growing. And when the souls ran out? Well there was always...other hungers he could satisfy. Speaking of which..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down passed his palm and saw his tight boxers growing tighter. His sheer size, the power he exuded over Black*Star and the entire city, and the knowledge that no one could ever hope to stop him, was starting to get him VERY excited. Surely nothing would make Black*Star feel smaller than being forced to crawl over his dick like a truly tiny pest, trying to get him off...his cock head gently poked through the hole in front of the boxers, slowly revealing more and more of itself as Soul's thoughts continued down this line. But that would come in time. There was no reason not to ride these feelings for awhile. He had all the time in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Black*Star, first I'm going to give you a new name! Black*Star is the name of the man who will surpass god right? Well, now that I'M god, there's no way you'll ever be able to surpass me, so you don't deserve that name anymore. Instead, I'm going to call you...Bug*Star. Heh, at least I'll call you that until you get too small to even be a bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star felt his cheeks burn with humiliation. It wasn't bad enough he was completely at the mercy of a monster like Soul? Now the giant weapon had to reduce even his humanity? And broadcast it to everyone who was still alive in Death City? Talk about torture...unfortunately, the meister had no IDEA what torture really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Are you listening? Answer your god!\" Soul bellowed, his voice blasting over Black*Star's body, the power of it filling his body and making it shake from the sheer force. Black*Star trembled uncontrollably, falling to his knees. Soul laughed and said, in a quieter voice, \"How pathetic. Do you know how totally uncool you look right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star got to his feet again, his face looking slightly sweaty as he muttered, \"W-What do you want me to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, thanks to his enhanced sense, heard Black*Star clear as a bell. \"I want you to say you're grateful for your new name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star looked almost defiantly up at Soul. \"Thanks for my new name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed and rolled his eyes. \"You can do better than that. Say \"Thanks so much for my new name Soul-sama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star visibly spit on Soul's palm and said, \"Like hell I will! I don't care how much bigger you are than me! I'm not going to lay down and just take your abuse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stared at Black*Star for a moment before snorting and laughing at the bug like man's defiance. \"I should have known you'd say something like that. You never were very smart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snatched Black*Star up between his fingers and lifted him up in front of his face. \"Maybe I should just eat you now after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuck his tongue out and licked all over Black*Star's body, a musky, manly taste lingering on Black*Star's skin. \"You ARE pretty tasty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star felt a thrill of fear run through his body. Soul said he wasn't going to eat him! That's one of the reasons he felt so safe being defiant! This wasn't supposed to happen! Soul lifted Black*Star up over his head, his mouth opening wide. \"Well...bottoms up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! NO! PLEASE DON'T EAT ME!\" Black*Star shouted out in panic. \"THANK YOU SOUL-SAMA FOR THE NEW NAME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul gripped Black*Star in his fist, grinning down at him. \"Hah! I knew that would work! You really too dumb to live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star's fear was slowly replaced by rage. He struggled to escape, his face pressing against one of Soul's fingers, trying to bite it, to do ANY kind of damage to Soul's body, but failing. Seeing the bug struggle only fueled Soul's erection. \"Mmm....I'm getting pretty excited about all this you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star immediately stopped struggling, looking horrified. Soul grinned and said, \"Don't worry you won't be going down there...yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought Black*Star closer to his chest and said, \"First things first. Let's see what's stronger, Bug*Star or God's Pecs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Black*Star could question what Soul meant, the hand opened up and he felt his body getting pressed tight against the palm as it rushed toward the living wall of Soul's chest. With a yell quickly cut short, Black*Star was smashed against the enormous muscle, the hand pressing him against the slightly pulsing skin. Dazed, he was barely aware as Soul slowly pushed him towards the cleft between each slab, slipping his tiny body in between them. With a slight flex, they were pressed tight on either side of Black*Star. Instinctively, the meister pushed his hands against each one. Soul responded by relaxing slightly, the pecs moving aside enough that Black*Star had to keep his hands pressed against them or risk falling out from between them. \"So, let's see if you can handle this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his pecs shoved together again and Black*Star barely managed to lock his arms into place, his arms straining to keep the pecs from flexing fully and turning him into a tiny red stain on the muscle. The pecs alternated flexing and relaxing, Black*Star's poor body constantly having to adapt to the force that was placed on it. Within minutes he was sweating, his arms trembling. Soul snickered as he watched as best he could. \"Better not slack off! I'd hate to crush you accidentally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star gritted his teeth and kept focus, not allowing himself to relax even slightly. Soul kept this torture up for what felt like hours, but was really only about ten minutes. Eventually he got bored and relaxed his pecs fully, Black*Star's tiny body falling down, down, down, into Soul's waiting palm. Soul tsked and said, \"Man, I can't believe a loser like you thought you could ever do stand against me. Remember when you tried to fight me and I ate your partner? Too easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star felt the rage reawaken within him, jumping to his feet even though his body was feeling incredibly sore. \"SHUT UP! I WON'T LET YOU TALK BAD ABOUT TSUBAKI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul grinned and gripped Black*Star in his fist again. \"Good to see you still have so much energy Bug*Star! Let's see...what should I do next with you?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026how should I make little Bug Star feel even more like a bug?\u201d Soul scratched his chin as he looked at the tiny meister trapped I his gargantuan fist. \u201cI really do want you down here\u2026\u201d Soul glanced down at his thickening cock, which was more than just peaking out of his boxers now. Black Star couldn\u2019t see the god\u2019s cock since his fist was blocking his vision, but had a good idea where he was looking. \u201c\u2026but to be honest, your struggling against my pecs really excited me!  I want to see how you fair against my other muscles!\u201d Soul grinned widely; Black Star almost capable of seeing his reflection in those pearly whites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t think I like the sound of that.\u201d Black Star muttered, gulping audibly. He watched as the massive weapon looked down at himself and flexed different parts of his body. His calves, thighs, abs, biceps, glutes\u2026.he seemed to want to pit each one against the tiny Black Star. He even looked down at his meaty pecs and bounced them; wondering if a rematch was possible. Eventually Soul made his decision; which he conveyed to his little toy by smirking at him and giving his bicep a nice, hard flex. The veins in his arm bulged so hugely that Black Star thought they\u2019d burst!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s decided! It\u2019ll be Bug Star against God\u2019s Bicep! Do your best, small fry.\u201d Soul said before grasping the blue haired boy between his fingers and carrying over his large, thick arm. He stretched the arm out and relaxed it before dropping Black Star right where his arm would bend when he flexed. Even though he wasn\u2019t flexing yet, Black Star was unable to look past his former friend\u2019s bicep! It was like a mountain to him already!   The ninja stood up and looked around Soul\u2019s arm. He couldn\u2019t even tell he was on an arm\u2026he was just too tiny to make out any recognizable features besides the obvious bicep behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady, Bug Star?\u201d came Soul\u2019s booming voice from above. Black Star looked up to see Soul\u2019s smiling face looking down at him. \u201cGet ready to struggle for your life\u2026again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Soul slowly started to raise his arm up. Black Star gaped as the long landscape before him seemed to rise up like a tower; it took a few seconds for him to realize the space between the bicep and this new \u201ctower of skin\u201d was getting smaller by the second! The meister backed himself up against the bicep, but it began to enlarge and push him forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCraaap!\u201d Black Star shouted as he turned around to face the bicep\u2026just as the incoming wall of skin (as well as the hard muscles behind it) slammed into his back and forced him against the bulging bicep. Upon instinct, Black Star pushed his hands against Soul\u2019s huge bicep. Not a second later, a jolt of pain erupted through his arms and Black Star was sure they were gonna snap! He had used so much strength keeping back Soul\u2019s pecs that his arms still felt like jello! He couldn\u2019t hold back Soul\u2019s bicep with them; they\u2019d snap like twigs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Black Star? I don\u2019t feel any resistance.\u201d Soul stated as he watched Black Star\u2019s miniscule body disappear under the fold of his muscles. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna crack like a nut at this rate!\u201d Soul laughed and continued putting the pressure on Black Star; seemingly uncaring if he really did crush him. If he was really this weak\u2026he didn\u2019t deserve to watch his ascension into godhood!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta\u2026hold it\u2026back\u2026\u201d Black Star grunted as his face started turning red. The tight space between Soul\u2019s arm and bicep was becoming really hot\u2026and his arms were going to break if he didn\u2019t replace them with something fast. The young meister looked over himself and his eyes fell upon his legs. Thinking fast, Black Star thrust his legs against Soul\u2019s bicep and pushed against it with his lower body. His legs were just as strong as his arms and he hadn\u2019t tired them out at all during the previous \u201cfight\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed and Black Star seemed to be doing well enough, but his legs were starting to get tired and Soul wasn\u2019t easing up on the pressure at all. Pain coursed through his thighs and the teen gritted his teeth in agony. The space got smaller and smaller despite putting all his strength into his leg muscles. Black Star was getting cramped\u2026if his feet happened to slip he\u2019d be crushed instantly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoooul! Get me out of here!\u201d Black Star cried, sweat dripping from his body as he panted for air. For a few seconds it looked like Soul wouldn\u2019t be showing mercy and really was going to turn Black Star into bloody meat! However\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose you did good enough.\u201d Soul replied as he stopped flexing and relaxed his arm. The pressure vanished and Black Star collapsed right then and there. Now his arms and legs both felt like jello\u2026he couldn\u2019t move at all. Soul tilted his arm and let his pet roll off the arm and into his palm once again. He brought it up to his crimson stare and chuckled. \u201cI knew you were tough! Anyone else would have been flattened! However\u2026I WAS only using about 5% of my strength!\u201d Soul snickered at Black Star\u2019s shocked expression. It was true\u2026if Soul really did want to crush Black Star, he could do it with no effort whatsoever! \u201cAnyway, that was fun. I\u2019m still interested in how you\u2019d do against other muscles, but I think the chances of you coming back from a round 3 are pretty slim\u2026\u201d Soul glanced over his Bug Star\u2019s weakened body. He was just laying there on his palm, his sore limbs spread out. \u201cLet\u2019s get to the main event, shall we? You can still do this much in your state, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star groaned in defeat as he burrowed his face into Soul\u2019s palm. He didn\u2019t know exactly what Soul wanted him to do\u2026but knew it wasn\u2019t going to end well. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bruised, sore, and totally humiliated, Black*Star knew what was coming next and though the prevalent feeling in his tiny body was exhaustion, he still felt a twinge of fear as Soul slowly moved his open palm closer to the ground, stopping at about waist height. Turning his head, Black*Star could see the very edge of Soul's erection as it slowly moved up and down, freely and totally exposed to the cool evening air. As Soul slowly tilted his palm, Black*Star was able to see more and more of the monster come into view. It was a magnificent sight to see! Thick and long, Soul's cock jutted proudly out from his waist, the base surrounded in a thicket of fluffy looking white pubic hair. Veins as thick as the ones in his arms snaked over the shaft, pumping the enormous amount of blood necessary to keep it erect, a monument to his manliness. Soul licked his lips, his heart already starting to pound faster in anticipation. He knew that Black*Star was a tiny little thing but with his advanced senses he would still be able to feel every pathetic wiggle as the bug like teen tried his hardest to please him! His stomach was starting to growl a little again but such was his focus on the coming pleasure, Soul completely ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack*Star could feel his mouth run dry as he felt his body slip down Soul's palm, tumbling head over heels down it until the palm was completely vertical. With a frenzied scream, Black*Star tried to force his body away from where it was headed: directly down Soul's slit! With the force of will that had helped him out of many tight situations before, Black*Star lifted his arms up and caught himself, half of his body still dangling over the sheer fall directly down into Soul's body. The teen's tiny bare feet kicked against the sensitive urethra of the gargantuan weapon, causing his whole body to shudder, a moan escaping from between his lips. \"Ooooh man bug boy...You really throw yourself into this thing don't you? Don't get too excited or you'll get lost inside me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled as he watched Black*Star frantically pull himself clear of the slit, flopping onto his back just beside it. Sweat was already pouring down his face in streams, making his clothes cling uncomfortably to his body. For you, still \"safe\" inside Black*Star's pocket, it was unbearable. The sheer amount of heat caused you to pass out. It was probably for the best. There was really nothing at all you could do anyway. Before the worn out meister could even catch his breath, Soul's massive finger flicked the head irritably, forcing Black*Star onto his front, his face buried in the soft, musky flesh of Soul's head. \"Hurry it up! I don't have all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's voice held a deep rumbling note to it, like distant thunder. There was a note of threat behind it. Black*Star knew that Soul had told him he would be kept alive to see him continue to grow bigger and stronger, but that in and of itself was not a guarantee that Soul would keep to that line of thinking. His mind was in a duel with itself. This was torture and he might be better off dead, but knowing Soul, that death would not be quick and painless. Eventually, the desire to live won out, a small scrap of hope still alive in his chest as he thought of Shinigami-sama and the other teachers. Surely somehow, anyone, might be able to help...Pitifully, Black*Star stuck his tongue out and began to lick Soul's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's frown slowly turned into a satisfied grin, his head moving back as he felt every little lick, the pleasure he craved coursing through his body. \"Not bad...Have you ever done this before?\" Soul laughed as he sat down, his ass not only decimating a large section of the city, but sending tremors through the ground that caused even more damage over wider spread areas of the city. Black*Star ignored Soul, focusing on his task. The sooner the god like weapon cummed, the sooner this humiliation, this <i>part</i> of his humiliation, could end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's moans vibrated through his body, his pleasure telecasted to whoever was still alive in the city, especially to those inside Shibusen who were still monitoring him. Almost everyone inside the school was watching Soul's display, mouths agape, not expecting in their lives to ever see a titanous horny teenager jerking himself off in the middle of a the city. Soul had been unwilling to let Black*Star have all the fun. His meaty hand wrapped around his shaft and began to pump, the platform on which Black*Star was sprawled now shaking violently back and forth, like he was in a hurricane, making it harder to concentrate on his task. It didn't help that Soul's massive muscular body was directly in front of him, rising up like a living wall, making him feel even smaller and more insignificant. Soul's bare feet clenched, his toes obliterating buildings and streets as he lost himself in the throes of pleasure, sweat beading slightly on his body, falling off in drops big enough to cause minor flooding in the streets. Even just pleasuring himself was a natural disaster to the remaining populace of Death City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's body tensed, and Black*Star felt a rumbling deep underneath him signaling the end of his labors for now. Soul had been immensely turned on by his actions today, everything from growing, eating, humiliating Black*Star, destroying the city, it all had filled him with a lust that kept him on the peak of a sexual high. It didn't take long to finish himself off. With a louder, more intense moan, Soul erupted, thick stringy ropes of cum blasting forth from his slit, flying high into the sky before plummeting back down to earth with the force of an explosion. Buildings, streets, homes, apartments, stores, people, everything that was directly hit by Soul's cum was vaporized completely. These destructive globs landed all over the city. Wherever they didn't hit, the sheer amount of cum easily flooded the streets, leaving behind a wasteland of white covered ruins, the sun setting with only Shibusen still standing. Soul chuckled, his softening dick leaving Black*Star in danger. With a casual flick, the tiny meister flew off Soul's cock head and landed safely within the pubic forest. He got tangled in the smaller hairs, the musky sweat otherwise gluing him safely in place. \"I guess you can rest for a bit Bug*Star.\" This was about as merciful as Soul was likely to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stretched his arms up above him, his legs doing the same. He sighed and scratched his abs, looking down at the pitiful school between his feet. \"Mmm...still have to take care of you people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to get up when he suddenly felt a tense power course through his body. He looked confused at first, but then remembered the book. Sexual hunger was still hunger and he had sated it...which meant just one thing! With an evil laugh that echoed throughout the city, Soul grew even bigger! His massive thighs ripped apart his boxers, leaving him completely naked, his whole body stretching up higher and wider, his massive flaccid cock moving closer and closer to Shibusen. When the mammoth organ was just a few feet from the front of the school, Soul stopped growing. All of Death City was becoming more and more like a model to him, the people going from ant size, to something even less than that. Without his godly senses they would be nothing more than tiny specks scurrying around his gigantic toes. The school, once a huge, proud symbol of power in the city, was now smaller than Souls' dick, looking far less impressive from his perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this is beyond cool! Nothing is going to stop me now! Not like anything was ever going to stop me before!\" He flexed his massive bicep, grinning a feral grin down at the school. \"But there's no reason to rush things...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was already almost fully set and it had been a long day. It's not like the school was going anywhere, so why not rest for now?</span></div></div>",

You were shivering and couldn\u2019t seem to stop yourself. The sound of a chair moving alerted you of the other giant\u2019s return, who sat down and spotted your shivering form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re shivering.\u201d Black Star said with some concern in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s cold. Winter wasn\u2019t too long ago.\u201d Soul spoke up, hiding a smile. All your anger toward Black Star seemed to wash away and was replaced with irritation toward the sly weapon. Irritation and fear, and the fear prevented you from saying anything. You really were in no position to anger either of the titans before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. The table\u2019s just a bit cold\u2026\u201d You lied, turning away from both the giants\u2019 gazes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, okay. The food\u2019ll be here soon, so that\u2019ll warm you up.\u201d Black Star said before resting his elbow on the table and waited for their meals. A few minutes later, the waiter approached their table with a plate in either hand. Both plates were filled with breakfast food, since it was still early and you and Black Star had skipped that meal. Soul\u2019s breakfast had been nothing special, so he welcomed this second serving with a drooling mouth. You watched as a small mountain of eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, toast, English muffins, and tater tots were placed on either side of you. It was like a breakfast heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore digging into the meals, Black Star broke off a few small pieces of ham and toast and placed them near you. The small amount was, to you, more than you got everyday at breakfast. Just before you dug into a crumb of toast, you were distracted by obnoxious sounds coming from around you. It was Black Star and Soul eating. Their forks picked up several things at once and stuffed them into their mouths to be loudly chewed and swallowed. Black Star was the worse, who even used his hand every now and then to stuff a slice of toast or a muffin into his hungry maw. The way his eyes were closed and how he hardly put any time into savoring his mouthfuls made you wonder if he even knew what he was putting into his mouth half the time. Why was it that anime males almost always seemed to have awful table manners? For once you were glad you were shrunken; at least no one was giving you any odd and annoyed glances. You just ate silently, trying to ignore the two Shibusen students as they worked on their meals. </span></div></div>",

You figure he felt bad about scaring you earlier and was trying to make amends with you. Well that was just fine with you. You were a forgiving kind of person. You walk over to the fork and try to pull the egg off but it's stuck on there pretty good. You step onto the tines of the fork and slowly pull the egg off. When you were at the very edge of the tines Soul suddenly slammed his hand down on the raised end of the fork and you were launched into the air! You flew a short ways into the air before spinning over a few times and landing on the soft fluffy pile of eggs on Soul's plate. He grins down at you evilly and just as you were about to shout at him he presses you deeper into the egg pile until you're hidden from sight. Throughout all this Black Star has remained blissfully unaware of your plight mostly because he was concentrating on his own plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped down in the hot darkness, the smell of eggs all around you, you can't help but worry what Soul has in store for you. He couldn't possibly be thinking about eating you...could he? Suddenly the eggs start moving around and you look up to see Soul with a forkful of egg and sausage bringing it into his huge gaping maw and chewing it up slowly. You knew he was doing this for your benefit. He swallows and you can see the bulge travel slowly down his throat a look of pure bliss on his face. Thinking fast you try to move and find it to be surprisingly difficult. The stupid eggs were thick enough to hold you in place despite your thrashing. Soul's fork descends again, scooping up eggs that were dangerously close to your position. Again he eats them slowly, obviously enjoying himself. Luckily that last forkful removed enough eggs for you to move. You quickly make your way to the edge of the plate. Unfortunately just before you reach it a pile of eggs land on top of you, pinning you to the plate. Soul had knocked over the eggs in order to trap you again. Struggling there's nothing you can do as you feel the metal tines of the fork slide underneath you and lift you up into the air. Your shouts are muffled by egg and you can only watch in horror as Soul opens that razor edged pit of doom and slowly inches the fork towards it. Within seconds you're inside the moist cave of Soul's mouth, his tongue pushing aside eggs until finding you. The tongue pushes you into the pocket of his cheek while he swallows the eggs until you're the only thing inside his mouth. The tongue then carries you back into the center of his mouth and tastes you, licking your body all over, soaking you to the skin with saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thought left on your mind, which was a whirling buzzing whiteness of fear, was, was he going to eat you?</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t want to be swallowed and die. You didn\u2019t want to be a part of this cruel, sinister giant of a boy. And you certainly didn\u2019t want to become his crap. On the outside, Soul just couldn\u2019t stop tasting you. Oh how much he wanted to swallow you and make you a part of his breakfast. You were just so delicious. However, the fact that it would be incredibly hard to explain to Black Star where you\u2019d disappeared to was too much of  a hassle. It was enough to get a taste of you., plus the scare he was giving you was a nice bonus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the tongue move under you, and your first thought was it was going to throw you into the back of the throat. Thankfully, Soul\u2019s jaws opened and you were spat out into his hand. The red-eyed menace looked over you and smiled with satisfaction. You were covered in his saliva and scared shitless. Perfect. Using his napkin, Soul quickly wiped you clean of his drool and any egg that may have clung to you. Then he simply placed you back on the table, all while Black Star remained oblivious. You stared up in terror, not know what to do next. You wanted to run over to Black Star\u2019s plate and tell him everything, but you couldn\u2019t. You saw Soul put a finger up to his lips and make a soft hushing noise before mouthing the word \u201csoon\u201c, all while looking down at you with those intimidating eyes. You turned your gaze away and just sat on the table by your crumbs of food. You weren\u2019t hungry anymore, so you remained quiet while the two giants ate their meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes passed until the both of them finally finished. Their plates were bare and their stomachs full. Black Star leaned back in his chair and patted his slightly bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, that was\u2026*burp*\u2026really good. Do you always come here?\u201d Black Star asked his friend, who had an equally bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes. Maka keeps telling me I need to eat more. There\u2019s no better place to pig out than here.\u201d Black Star nodded in agreement before looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how was it? Are you full too?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah. I don\u2019t think I could eat as much as you guys, but I had my fill. Thanks.\u201d you answered, smiling up at him. He returned your smile and said it was no problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you just thanking him?\u201d Soul asked. \u201cI\u2019m helping to pay for the food too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut he\u2019s the one that gave me some. You didn\u2019t give me anything.\u201d you spat at him. You could tell he didn\u2019t like that by the look in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. I gave you some of my eggs, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silent air seemed to cover the table. Soul was eyeing you with sick amusement, while you were glaring at him with anger. The awkward silence was broken by Black Star, who didn\u2019t really understand the tension between you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026are you two alright? Am I missing something?\u201d he asked, looking back and forth between his two companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s fine.\u201c Soul reassured. \u201cLet\u2019s pay for the food and go do something else.\u201d </span></div></div>",

Along the way, Black Star asked where you were and Soul replied that you were safe and sound in his pocket. The clueless Black Star had no idea Soul was lying and you were currently suffering under his smelly foot. Soul\u2019s grin got a tiny but wider each time he stepped down on you and felt you squirm under his sole. Black Star never noticed anything wrong, as his friend always had that creepy grin on his face\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Soul and Star reached the entrance to Death City\u2019s park. Good timing too, as Soul\u2019s grin was reaching its limit. Black Star put his hand son his hips and gave Soul a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Soul, how about a race to the other end of the park? It\u2019ll help us digest.\u201d Black Star said as he slammed his hand against his stomach where several pounds of egg and meat were still digesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr it could help us puke it up\u2026\u201d Soul replied sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a smart ass! Are you game or what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine. Sounds like fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, in that case\u2026readysetgo!\u201d Black Star blurted out quickly before taking off like a bullet, Soul taking off a second later. It wasn\u2019t long before Black Star, the more athletic and physically fit of the two, ran ahead and left Soul in the dust. The white haired pianist didn\u2019t really care, however. He knew he didn\u2019t stand a chance in a race with Black Star, but for once he didn\u2019t care about winning. He knew that with every step me took, you were being pounded into his insole again and again. His running combined with the hot atmosphere of the park took its toll on Soul body, making the teen sweaty like crazy. Heat built up in his shoe as his feet began sweating, covering you with his perspiration. Your eyes began to tear up as the smell got worse by the second, going from horrendous to unbearable. Any fresh air in the shoe was quickly being eaten up by pure stink. If this continued, you may just pass out\u2026or worse, suffocate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about eight minutes of nonstop running, Soul finally reached the opposite entrance to the park. Even though he wasn\u2019t as fast as Black Star, he was still a pretty good runner and made it there in half the time it would take a normal person. The red-eyed Weapon collapsed on a nearby bench to catch his breath. As he sat there, panting like a dog, he glanced around for his friend. Surely he had gotten here before him, so where was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did that muscle head run off to?\u201d Soul asked himself as looked around, half-expecting him to jump out and attack him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp here, slowpoke!\u201d came a familiar voice. Soul looked up to see Black Star hanging from a tree branch and doing pull-ups. \u201cYou took so frickin long I decided to do some exercises while I waited.\u201d The sleeveless ninja hurled himself off the tree, did a mid air flip, and landed flat on his feet. Soul clapped sarcastically and rolled his eyes. Black Star took a seat next to his friend and relaxed. You weren\u2019t the only one who was being tortured with the stench of a sweating teen; Soul felt like he had just entered a football team\u2019s locker room. He tried plugging his nose, but that didn\u2019t seem to do anything against the Meister\u2019s heavily sweating form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to rest somewhere else\u2026\u201d Soul mumbled as he got up and walked away. Black Star mumbled his own response but suddenly dozed off. Apparently, he was more tired then he thought\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul Eater Evans made his way into a secluded part of the park near some trees. The trees provided some great shade and Soul happily plopped himself against one. Now that he was alone, he could play with you some more\u2026 </span></div></div>",

He couldn't imagine being your size and being trapped in there with his foot on a day like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Soul lowered his face towards the opening of his shoe, he peered in, spotting you lying right where he had left you...though you weren't moving much. At first Soul thought you were dead and panicked, \"Crap crap crap! I killed him with my foot! Star'll have my ass!\" he thought while still holding his breath and going a bit pale at the thought of Star's wrath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he saw your leg twitch a little. He took his face away and replaced it with his fingers. He reached into the slimy inside of the shoe and plucked you out by your ankle. He brought you up to his face, he was breathing now and caught a whiff of you. \"Wow.....little dude smells just like my feet!\" Soul muttered to himself. He noticed you were pretty beat up. He started panicking again. \"If Black Star sees you like this I'll never get to play with you again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Soul's brain hatched a wicked idea. He grinned evilly, showing off his razor sharp teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul tip-toed over to Black Star, quickly catching a whiff of the blue haired meister's sweat and B.O. He grimaced, not wanting to touch him even to shake him awake. But his addiction to playing with the tiny you overwhelmed him and he touched Star's sweaty shoulder and shook it. \"*snooooreee* Muh....Leeme 'lone!\" Star said as he rolled over in the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed and kicked Black Star in the butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! What the heck was that for!?\" Black Star said sitting up and rubbing the sleep from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed, trying to hide his excitement. \"Star....I have something to tell you about that shrimp of yours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When he was with me he was making jokes about you....Mean jokes....He called you names and I was just trying to stick up for you...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star frowned. \".....Go on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul grinned inwardly, he had him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I kinda.....punished him by putting him in my shoe during the race.\" Soul said sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Black Star just stared at Soul for a moment. At first Soul thought he was thinking of a way to kick his ass for putting his little friend in his shoe, but was soon corrected. Black Star suddenly erupted into laughter, falling onto his back and rolling around in the grass. Soul\u2019s signature grin returned to his face; his plan was a success. Black Star got to his feet and wiped a tear from his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026that must have STUNK!\u201d Black Star exclaimed while glancing down at Soul\u2019s shoes. \u201cI\u2019d feel sorry for him, but he deserves it for cracking jokes about me! No one jokes about the BIG me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt did stink. It was so bad, it knocked the poor guy unconscious.\u201d Soul explained as he brought his fist before Star\u2019s eyes and opened it to reveal your immobile form. The Meister peered closely at you, chuckling at your beat up appearance. He took a big sniff, almost strong enough to lift you off of Soul\u2019s hand! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, he reeks! Let me see him.\u201d Black Star snatched you out of Soul\u2019s hand and brought you up to his face. \u201cYou really had me fooled, bug. After I was all set on helping you, you go and make jokes about me behind my back.\u201d The blue-haired assassin began shaking you roughly, uncaring of any harm he might bring you. \u201cWake up, little punk! I\u2019m speaking to you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star continued to shake you like an action figure until he heard you groan. He stopped waving his hand around and watched you stir awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026what happened?\u201d you asked as you opened your eyes and adjusted them to the light. You winced at the pain from your bruised body. \u201cI feel terrible\u2026Soul, please don\u2019t hold me so hard, it\u2019s starting to-\u201d You stop when you notice that the one holding you is not Soul, but Black Star. \u201cBlack Star!! Thank god! You wouldn\u2019t believe what Soul did to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already heard. He put you in his shoe with his sweaty foot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo he told you? It was horrible! I thought I was going to be crushed a few times, and the smell was unbearable! I thought I was going to suffocate in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t die, little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you had, I wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to punish you too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026wait, what? What for?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think? You thought you could make jokes about the guy who\u2019s going to surpass God and get away with it? Tough luck, shortly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-? But, I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Your eyes widened and you turned your head to see Soul grinning at you. He was clearly trying to suppress his laughter, but Black Star was too busy glaring at you to notice.  \u201cNo, Black Star! He\u2019s lying to you! I never said any of those things!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Why would Soul lie to me? He and I are good buddies, right Soul?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou betcha!\u201d Soul replied before the two teens bumped fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you say, Soul? Wanna show this jerk who\u2019s boss together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds cool.\u201d Soul looked down at you and grinned sadistically. You couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. Black Star, the one person you though was your protector in this world of giants, was against you! All because of HIM. This was very, very not good!</span></div></div>",

I can\u2019t do that with this guy; he\u2019ll probably die with one punch!\u201d Black Star explained, excited about showing you your place, but not quite sure how to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUse your brain for once, idiot. You\u2019re like a god to him. A big, sweaty, smelly god\u2026with big feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh, I see. Big feet, eh?\u201d Black Star grinned down at you as evil thoughts began filling his head. You watched, terrified, as the muscular teem sat down on the grass and placed you down on the ground before proceeding to take one of his shoes off. Upon instinct, you spun around and tried to run, but Soul was quick to block your path. The pianist sat down opposite of Star, creating a deafening boom as his butt made contact with the earth. \u201cMake sure he doesn\u2019t go anywhere, Soul. We wouldn\u2019t want him escaping punishment.\u201d Star said as he pried off his left shoe, exposing his socked foot. His feet were so sweaty and foul that you actually saw how the sock had become dirtied just by being around them. The Meister saw you staring at his foot and smiled. \u201cYou know all about my foot, bug. I bet that\u2019s why you made jokes about me; because I made one mistake and left you in my sock. You should have just left things alone, because now you\u2019ve made an even BIGGER mistake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star slipped off his sock, releasing a gust of smelly air as he did. For a moment, you thought you saw the stench rise from his bare foot. You sniffed the air and caught scent of a familiar smell. You turned around just in time for Soul to bring his foot down on you, pinning you under it. You pleaded to Soul, but the cruel teen just smothered you with his steamy foot as he worked on getting his other foot free. Soon, Black Star had gotten both his feet free of their containers and asked Soul to bring you over to him. Soul gripped your small body with his toes and lifted you into the air. You were deposited onto the grass between the two giants, and as soon as Soul took his foot away, you were engulfed in the shadow of Black Star\u2019s foot. You looked up at the foot as Star wiggled its cheesy toes in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star slowly brought his foot down upon you until the ball of his foot touched your nose. As soon as it did, your eyes bulged out of your head and you shouted in horror. Before you could get away from the unbearable smell, Black Star stomped down on you and pinned you under his gigantic foot. He cackled evilly as he rolled you under his sole like a ball, covering you with sweat and dirt. The smell was horrifying\u2026much worse then this morning. You felt a moment of relief when he took his foot away, but it lasted just a second because his other foot came down to smother you some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t hog him.\u201d Soul stated, prompting Black Star to take his foot off you and use his big toe to flick you in Soul\u2019s direction. Soul ordered you to stand up, which was difficult for you to do. When you finally managed to push yourself to your feet, Soul positioned both his feet on either side of you and slammed them together. You were squashed between both his soles as he began grinding them together, causing you excruciating pain. As Soul continued to rub his feet together, he wiped his forehead with his sleeve and looked to see it soaked with sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand this heat\u2026Black Star, do you think anyone would mind if I took off my shirt?\u201d Soul asked, pulling on his collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead. I don\u2019t think there are many people here besides us.\u201d the blue haired Meister replied. Soul glanced around to see that he was right and proceeded to tug his yellow and black jacket over his head. Once it was off, he tossed it aside and leaned back with a sigh of relief. His lightly muscled torso glistened with sweat in the sunlight. Black Star glanced over at his buddy and snickered. \u201cYou should really hit the gym more often, Soul. You\u2019re starting to get scrawny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Soul spat. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to take yours off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, this is nothing. You should see me after my daily workout!\u201d Black Star laughed and then suddenly realized something. \u201cHey wait, I just remembered! I didn\u2019t put any deodorant on today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wonder you smell like moldy cheese.\u201d Soul fanned the front of his face as he caught a whiff of Star\u2019s B.O. He then realized the smell wasn\u2019t coming from his friend\u2026it was coming from him! Soul lifted his arm and took a sniff of his pit. \u201cUgh! Looks like I forgot too\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026why don\u2019t we put some on right now?\u201d Black Star grinned at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking ab-\u201d the weapon began to say, before he noticed Black Star was staring at his feet. With a wicked smirk, Soul opened his feet up and plucked you out. At first you thought the punishment was over, until Soul tossed you though the air and you landed in Black Star\u2019s palm. His tree-like fingers wrapped around you as he brought you to his grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour punishment\u2019s just started, squirt! You thought my feet were bad, just wait till you get a load of this!\u201d the ninja lifted his other arm up, exposing his damp armpit. Your face twisted into one of repulse and horror and you began squirming madly in Black Star\u2019s fist. Unfortunately, the trained Meister had more strength in one of his fingers then you had in your entire body. You could do nothing but watch as Black Star moved you under his arm and pushed you into the sweaty pit. You screamed at the first hint of B.O. hitting you nostrils, causing some sweat to enter your mouth. You choked on the liquid, but this didn\u2019t stop Black Star from moving you up and down his skin. Tiny blue hairs pricked your body as you were dragged all over the sweaty teen\u2019s armpit. Star removed you from his pit after several seconds and moved you into his other sweaty hand. You breathed in the fresh air while you could, because you were soon plunged into the other pit and smothered with male musk once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Black Star was finished applying his deodorant, he tossed you back over to Soul who caught you with his left hand. Smirking down at you, he said, \u201cYou ready for his, little man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head and tried to stop him, but like Black Star before him, Soul lifted his arm over his head and pressed you against his pit. Your eyes watered as the body odor made its way up your nose and everywhere else on your shrunken body. Soul wasn\u2019t as bad as Black Star, but at this point you couldn\u2019t tell the difference. Soul used you to soak up the sweat under both his arms before he was finished with you. You lied their, totally defeated and humiliated, in Soul\u2019s grip. The white haired, crimson eyed male stared at you with not one hint of remorse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo my feet alone can knock you out, but the stench of both of us still leaves you conscious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he said this, your eyes rolled into the back of your head and you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, when you came to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Against your better judgment you inhaled, and your body seemed to convulse. It was a sour reeking odor, and you recognized something familiar in the tremendous stench. You forced yourself to take another small sniff, and your memory jarred, You remembered being in Star's sock and smelling something similar to this, and you definitely remember being foot tortured by him and having his foot shoved in you face and smelling it! You guessed you were in his sock which was in his shoe, yet you weren't being pinned down, you were surrounded by two walls of greasy flesh that once in awhile closed in on you from both sides and pinched your face between them. Shoving your face forward into a pile of unrecognizable mush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark in here, but you knew you were between Black Star's toes, and you knew what that mush between his toes that he kept forcing your head into was, it was his toejam! \"Gross...\" you choked out as his toes pinched your cheeks together, making you pucker your lips and make you seem as though you were kissing his toejam. Your lips were covered in the gunk, and your cheeks were filled up so that you looked like some sort of toejam chipmunk ready for toejam winter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were forced to swallow the mixture of lint, sweat, and who knows what else before you were forced to kiss his toe crotch again. You weren't being crushed underneath any of his weight for some reason, he didn't seem to be standing or sitting down. You tried to move your arms to try to stop his toes' attack, but they were glued to the cotton material of the inside of his sock by all that dried sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of your prison, Black Star was doing chin ups in the gym, he wasn't too concerned about his exercise today as he was making himself as sweaty and smelly as possible for more fun with you! Soul sure knew how to have fun! He was glad they were friends, He was even nice enough to tell him about the little jerk talking about him! What a guy! \"I'll show you.....little....punk!\" Star said getting angry at you as he kept squeezing you into his toejam again and again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Soul had had his turn with you, he made Star promise to come find him when they could have more fun with the shrimp together, in the meantime, Soul was devising more ways to use their gargantuan bodies to torment you.</span></div></div>",

He kicked off both his shoes and then tugged off his left sock (the one that didn\u2019t have you in it). He brought the dingy sock up to his nose and took a big whiff of it. Instead of recoiling back like Soul might, he smiled in contentment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, nice and raunchy. That tiny jerk must really regretting his decision now.\u201d Black Star laughed before tossing the worn out sock over his shoulder and tugging off his right one. Before doing so, he made sure to grip your head tightly between his cheesy toes. He discarded the sock brought his foot up to his chest. There you were, trying desperately to free your head from his meaty toes. The assassin laughed at your helpless situation before grabbing you by your kicking leg and dangled you before his face. \u201cHey there, small fry. I felt you wiggling down there! I was beginning to think my foot killed you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou adjusted your eyes to the light and looked around. Despite everything being upside-down you could tell you were inside of a gym. The smell of musk was all around you, mainly coming from the huge teen hold you. You also noticed that Soul wasn\u2019t anywhere to be found\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlack Star, you have to listen to me! Soul\u2019s lying to you; I never said anything bad about you! I forgave you for leaving me in your sock!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star\u2019s face twisted with anger as he spun you around and gripped you tightly in his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you calling my best friend a liar? Don\u2019t you know when to stop talking trash about people bigger then you? I think you WANT to be pummeled!\u201d Black Star made a fist with his other hand threatened you with it. You trembled in fear and whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026I didn\u2019t mean\u2026I just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up already! I\u2019m tired of hearing your squeaky little voice!\u201d Black Star shouted at you, unintentionally blowing stinky air in your face. His breath wasn\u2019t the worse of his problems, however, as Star quickly raised one of his arms and slapped out against his pit. Hard. The impact was enough to knock the wind out of you, and it didn\u2019t get any better as Black Star began rubbing you into the flesh. Once you stuck to his pit like glue, he took his hand away and lied down on the workout bench. You couldn\u2019t see what he was doing, since your face was stuck to his hot flesh. You could only hear him grunt as he grabbed hold of the weight and lifted it into the air. When he brought it down to his chest, his bulky arm squashed you into his armpit. His muscles were so hard\u2026it was like being stuck between a rock and a hard place. Every time he raised the weight up, you would be given a second of fresh air before his arm came back down again pressed hard against your back. You tried pleading with him again, but all this did was force some sweat down your throat. You were lucky your nose and mouth weren\u2019t completely pressed against his skin or else you would have suffocated or drowned via his perspiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star pumped iron for a whole ten minutes. He sweated so much during those minutes that a small pool of his body fluids began to form under the weight bench. His messy hair became soaked and his black shirt clung firmly to his torso, leaving little to the imagination. When he was finally done he put the weight down, sat up, picked up a nearby bottle of water, and gulped it all down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh, what a rush!\u201d the exercise nut exclaimed as he crushed the plastic bottle in his hand and tossed it into the recycle bin on the other end of the room. He grabbed a towel off the floor and wiped his face with it, but when he removed it he found it soaked as if he had dipped it into a pool. \u201cHehe, looks like my sweat is too much for this wimpy piece of cloth!\u201d</span></div></div>",

He peeked in there and saw you of course, he had momentarily forgotten about you. He looked from his armpit to the cloth and got a nasty idea. He set the cloth down on the bench and sat down next to it, he peeled you out of his armpit and set you down on the cloth. \"Dry off.\" He said trying to hide his smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no problem obeying that order! You used the dry areas of the cloth to dry yourself off. Once you were finished you looked up at Black Star, who smirked evilly down at you and snatched you up. \"H-Hey! What are you-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't have a chance to finish as Star brought his sweaty foot up and started rubbing you all over it. First he got the heel, then the sole, then the dreaded cheesy toes. Once both feet were done, he dried you off roughly with the towel, then rubbed you into his armpits. He was chuckling loudly, thankfully the gym was deserted due to school still being in session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce both pits got your treatment, Star set you down on the towel and began to put his socks back on.

He took a sip from a soda he had just bought; it was the perfect thing to help him cool down. He arrived at the front of the city\u2019s gym and glanced over the stylish signboard. \u201cThat guy is something else. A hot day like this would make any normal person want to relax in some air conditioning or visit the pool, but not him. He\u2019d rather hit the gym and sweat till he floods the place!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul pushed himself through the glass doors and made his way into the building. He walked through some doors until he reached the area Star said he\u2019d be in. As soon as he entered, he caught whiff of the meister\u2019s inhuman body odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! This is definitely the right room, no doubt about that.\u201d Soul muttered to himself as he glanced around the room. He spotted Black Star, the only person there. He was standing and Soul could clearly see that he had worked up one hell of a sweat. \u201cHey, Star, what are you doing? Where\u2019s the pipsqueak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU FUCKING PIECE OF FILTH!!\u201d Black Star suddenly shouted, making Soul jump back in surprise. Shit, had he figured out that he was being lied to? \u201cI\u2019M GONNA CRUSH YOU LIKE A BUG!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul figured out he was talking to you and glanced down at the floor to see you shivering in fear. Black Star already had his bare foot raised over you and ready to end you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d you beg like a little child who\u2019s upset his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop talking!\u201d Black Star yelled, glaring at you with murderous intent.

Prepare yourself, because I\u2019m about to turn you into toe jam!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, whoa!\u201d Soul walked up to Black Star and touched him on the shoulder. He immediately regretted this, as he drew his palm back to see it covered with slimy sweat. \u201cWhat happened? Your yelling really isn\u2019t cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis ungrateful bitch talked back to me! ME! He called me sick and said I stink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you do stink\u2026\u201d Soul muttered under his breath. \u201cSounds like our little buggy friend said something he shouldn\u2019t have. I agree, Black Star, you should crush him like the bug he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you agree, now watch what happens to those that insult the BIG me!\u201d Black Star smirked down at you and got ready to stomp down with all his strength. Soul knew that if he did that, he wasn\u2019t just going to crush you, but also cause massive damage to the gym\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, Black Star. We\u2019ve barely had him a day and you want to crush him already? We won\u2019t be able to toy around with him anymore, and I\u2019ve thought up a bunch of new ways we can humiliate him. Put your foot down and lets come up with a way to punish him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star sighed and relaxed his foot. \u201cFine, but you better hurry up and think of something good, or else I\u2019m turning Mr. Bug into Mr. Mush!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul began to get nervous and began thinking of a way to punish you severely without killing you. If Black Star made a giant hole in the floor, he\u2019d be the one who got stuck with the bill\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at Black Star\u2019s feet, you continued to stare up at the giant, intimidating teen with pure fear. He was really going to crush you, all because you lost your temper. You didn\u2019t want your dreams to become a reality. You thought about the dream you had where Black Star sat on you. His ass had crushed you so easily\u2026and now that could really happen! The smell of male sweat was the least of your problems in this gigantic world!</span></div></div>",

He whispered something in Star's ear who nodded as he listened to what was being said. Once Soul was finished Star had a big wicked smile on his face. \"I think the first option would work great.\" Star said as both the giant's eyes slowly turned down to little you shivering in fear down at their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star reached down to pick you up, you thought he was going to crush you and ran off in the opposite direction. Your path was blocked by Soul's shoe! Who just grinned down at you and plucked you up himself. \"You're gonna pay for running away like that, shrimpy!\" Soul smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul tucked you safely in his pocket, he wasn't going to torture you...yet. Black Star slipped his socks back on and put on his shoes. \"Ready for our basketball game Soul?\" Star said loud enough for you to hear in his friend's pocket. \"Hell yeah!\" Soul said slapping Star a high five. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were horrified at the possibilities of being made to play basketball with these giants. Were they going to work up a sweat for you or use you as a ball? You had no idea. But you found out soon enough when the two boys entered the gym's outdoor basketball court. The sun was still blazing hot in the sky, perfect conditions for a game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul took you out of his pocket and carelessly dropped you onto the court. You weren't hurt very bad, but you scraped your elbow a bit. You then heard a thumping sound, it made your ears ring, it was coming from behind you. You turned around, and just inches away from your head Star was dribbling an orange basketball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shi-\" You yelped before jumping out of the way as the boys began their game...What a nightmare!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A nightmare indeed. All around you were the constant booming being caused by the giants\u2019 feet or the giant basketball bashing against the concrete every second. Like the teens above you, you had to constantly move or face extermination via their stomping feet or the ball. Soul and Star were mostly focused on competing against each other and only occasionally glanced down to see whether you had been crushed under their heavy power or not. By some stroke of good luck, you remained alive for the first ten minutes of the game. There were a few close calls, though. You couldn\u2019t count the number of times that basketball had almost come down upon you, missing you by mere inches. You felt like you were playing a video game where your character had to dodge a giant orb of doom while moving around the level. Unlike a video game, you only had one life and then it was GAME OVER. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime out, Black Star.\u201d Soul said after seeing his friend score another point. He wiped some sweat off his brow and sat down on the court. \u201cI need to catch my breath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, scrawny! We just got started!\u201d Black Star replied as he spun the ball on the tip of his finger. Despite having just worked out, he didn\u2019t appear as tired as he should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be ready in a minute.\u201d Soul scanned the ground around him and spotted you directly next to him. You had seen that the giants were taking a break and sat down yourself to nurse your scraped elbow. Soul smirked and snatched you up before you could notice. \u201cHey there, shrimpy. Enjoying your punishment? It\u2019s really dangerous down there, I bet. You could be crushed just like that!\u201d Soul warned, snapping his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t put me back down there! I\u2019ll go anywhere else, just not there!\u201d you plead, not wanting to end up a stain on the court that would just be washed off the next time it was cleaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this is supposed to be your punishment, shrimpy. The danger is just part of it! \u2026however, since you said anywhere\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stuck out his right foot and began taking off his shoe. When he finally pulled it off with enough force, his sweaty foot was released and a breeze happened to blow the stench toward you and him. The both of you made a disgusted face\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, those reek! They seem to get smellier each hour\u2026\u201d Soul comments before shoving you into his shoe. He presses you firmly against the sweat soaked insole, forcing a bit of the sweat to make it way into your mouth. You don\u2019t have time to gag, as Soul quickly shoves his foot back into his shoe to once again trap his hellish smelling foot. He stands up, pressing you deeper into his shoe. You hiss in pain, not only from the pressure, but also from the sweat that brushes over your scrapped elbow. It stings and there isn\u2019t a thing you can do to stop it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d Black Star asks, not noticing his friend stick you in his shoe. He thought you were still scurrying around the basketball court. The blue haired meister actually hoped you got smashed under the basketball; it\u2019s what you deserve, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, bring it!\u201d Soul shouts before the two continue their game. You endure every step Soul takes just like before. You might be getting pounded into submission every second, but at least you weren\u2019t going to die\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026at least, that\u2019s what you thought at first. This wasn\u2019t like when Soul was just walking down the street or racing in the park. He was really pushing his body to its limits in order to beat Black Star, unconsciously putting his weight on his right foot numerous time. The first time Soul jumped to block one of Black Star\u2019s shots, you felt his entire weight come down on you and compress you into the shoe. Then, the second time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAHH!!\u201d you scream in pain as one of your ribs crack under the pressure. The pain, the stench, the feeling of warm sweat dripping over your body. Soul knew that this was going to be a nightmare for you, whether you were on the court or in his shoe. \u201cSoul, please stop! You\u2019re hurting me!\u201d you try screaming, but Soul is incapable of hearing you over the sound of his dribbling. He rushes past Black Star and tosses the ball into the hoop, scoring another point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBullseye!\u201d Soul exclaims while stomping down with his foot, pressing his sole against you again. A drop of sweat drips down his sole and makes its way into your mouth. You tear up a bit as you choke on the foul tasting liquid and are forced to swallow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul and Black Star play for another twenty minutes, both scoring right after the other. They\u2019re both great players and anyone could win. Who was going to win wasn\u2019t the important question here, however. The important question was\u2026were you going to survive this?</span></div></div>",

Man....I'd hate to be him right now!\" Star said holding his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul grimaced and nodded as he held his shoe up, ignoring the odor, and reached in and plucked out you. Amazingly you were still conscious, just a little beat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there! How was it?\" Star asked with a cheery smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quivered in fear and didn't answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey shrimp! My friend Black Star here asked you a question!\" Soul said lightly shaking you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Star, and answered. \"It was,\" Suddenly an idea came into your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if you told them you liked it, and they didn't think it was fun anymore to torture you with their feet? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Soul asked impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was.....cool!\" You say trying to force a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul and Star looked at each other in wonder. Soul had a feeling you were up to something, and he had a notion of what it was. So he tucked you in his pocket for a minute, and he and Star spoke quietly to one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it, he likes it now?\" Star asked bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid! He's trying to trick us so we won't do it anymore!\" Soul whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's eyes got big and then he glared at Soul's pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a plan on how we can break him and catch him in his lie.....Then we can punish him even worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul grinned toothily and took you out of his pocket, he held you in his palm and informed you, \"Since you apparently like the smell of our feet now...You wouldn't mind giving them a good rub would ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were horrified, but you tried to stay strong and go on with your plan. \"S-Sure!

If he really does like our feet now; he can have the best for last!\u201d Black Star exclaimed, flexing his toes eagerly in his shoes. Those pair of shoes were the only things that were containing Black Star\u2019s reeking feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul placed his other shoe down and stretched both his feet out at you. You took a step back as his smelly feet got closer. This movement was caught by Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you stepping back, bug? Don\u2019t you think my feet are cool?\u201d Soul asked while wiggling his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026yeah. They\u2019re really cool. It\u2019s just\u2026the smell of both of them is overwhelming. Can I perhaps rub one at a time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsk\u2026fine.\u201d Soul spat as he took one foot away and held the other over your head. \u201cGet rubbing, shrimp!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t have to be told twice. You were all too familiar with these feet after being pulverized under them for so long. It didn\u2019t take much to make you to press yourself against the sole and start rubbing. The weapon\u2019s foot was hard under your touch, but also sweaty and damp. The smell burned your eyes line onions and the heat being emitted from sole was making you sweat yourself. How could anyone actually like this? Regardless, they seemed to be believing your act\u2026you couldn\u2019t stop now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul relaxed on the bench while watching you like a hawk. He knew you were trying to fool him, so he knew you were currently in pain and only trying to hide it. He also noticed something else while watching you\u2026he really enjoyed looking down at you from way up here. It was an intoxicating feeling of power! On the other hand, when you glanced up a few times at him, you felt puny and insignificant. At your size, Soul could dominate you with nothing but his cold stare! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for the other one.\u201d Soul announced as he tore his foot away from your hands and replaced it with his other smelly friend. You immediately got to work again, obeying Soul\u2019s commands to \u201cGo faster!\u201d or \u201cHarder!\u201d Soul still didn\u2019t seem satisfied with your humiliation, however, and moved his foot down a but so you were rubbing the area just below his toes. The sharp teethed teen grinned as he curled his toes around your head, squeezing it a little. You became startled by this and began to writhe. \u201cStop squirming and keep rubbing!\u201d he shouted, squeezing a little harder to make you stop and get back to work. While you rubbed, he occasionally rubbed your head between his toes and even forced your face between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it my turn yet?\u201d Black Star asked, tapping his foot impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few more minutes\u2026\u201d Soul replied while he had his head leaned up against the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it really feel that good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah. It feels awesome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrrr\u2026I\u2019ve had it!\u201d Black Star growled and pushed Soul right off the bench. As the white haired weapon fell to the ground, you felt a tug on your head and you were brought along with him. Black Star took Soul\u2019s position and smiled down where you used to be. \u201cHey, where\u2019d the shrimp go?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem, Black Star!\u201d Soul yelled as he rubbed the back of his head. \u201cYou could of just asked me to move!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! The great Black Star asks no one for permission! If someone\u2019s in my way, I just push them aside! It doesn\u2019t matter who they are, may it be man, woman, child, or God himself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul glared angrily at Black Star. He was his best friend, but sometimes that superiority complex of his could get out of hand. While Black Star looked down at Soul smugly, he spotted you kicking wildly with your head still caught between Soul\u2019s cheesy toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are! Soul, hand him over!\u201d Black Star demanded, pointing at you. Soul looked down at you and then back at Black Star. Was he serious right now? First he pushes him away like trash and then he demands something from him? You, who could hear everything, wondered how Soul could put up with Black Star for so long. </span></div></div>",

This was the typical Black Star on a typical day. Nothing to be surprised about. Soul tossed you at the bigger teen and you watched the huge body of Black Star quickly approaching. You thought Star would catch you in his sweaty palm, but for some reason he did not. Instead, he simply watched as you smacked against his hard chest face first and rolled down his shirt to his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw\u2026\u201d you groaned as you rubbed your bruised nose. You felt like you had just run into a rock wall. You look up to see Black Star grinning down at you like a playful god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, not there, little man. You belong a little lower\u2026\u201d Black Star jokes as he plucks you off his crotch and deposits you back on the ground. You wince in pain as you land on your ass, but Black Star is already removing his shoes and socks and doesn\u2019t notice your pain. As you finish nursing your bruised but, Black Star finished taking off his footwear and stomps both his large feet on either side of you. The resulting quake knocks you back to the ground, hitting your head against a pebble. You\u2019re getting bruised and battered, and the torture hadn\u2019t even begun yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a nice treat for you, little man.\u201d Black Star says as he lifts both his bare feet off the ground and places them in front of you. You gag at the smell and cover your nose with both hands. The smell is beyond horrific\u2026as if Black Star\u2019s feet are possessed and you\u2019re smelling the evil. \u201cWhy are you covered your nose? Get over here and rub the feet you love so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d you mumble. \u201cOne foot at a time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t order me around, pest!\u201d Black Star shouts, glaring down at you. Soul, who\u2019s seated himself next to Black Star, gives you a look as if to say \u201cJust do it before he blows his top\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reluctantly approach both feet, which are side by side, and reach out one hand to rub the left one. You plan on rubbing one for a few seconds before switching to the other one, but you don\u2019t even get to rub for two seconds before Black Star\u2019s shouting again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re really starting to piss be off, shrimpy! Use both hands! Stop being so frightened or else I\u2019m gonna crush you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper and release your nose, allowing Black Star\u2019s foot fumes to burn the inside of it. You place one hand on each of Black Star\u2019s soles and begin rubbing vigorously. Your eyes are tearing up so much from the stench and sweat that you can barely see in front of you. Both of the gods see your miserable state but don\u2019t say a thing. They know you\u2019re putting on an act to trick them and play along for a little longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, you were right, Soul. This feels great.\u201d Black Star said as he stares down at you with half-opened eyes. Like Soul, he felt a sense of superiority when he looked down at your pathetic form. He was always feeling superior, but this was different. He was really lording over someone like a god. This was much better then being the nice guy and trying to help you. He was actually glad you had decided to make the mistake of cracking jokes about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a great little foot slave, little man. I think we\u2019re going to give you a reward for this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are?\u201d you ask as you continue to rub his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are?\u201d Soul asked, bewildered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Since you seem to have a fetish for our feet, you can be smothered by all four of them at once!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-?\u201d You eyes bulge out of their sockets. All four of their feet\u2026smothering him at once?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, little man? Don\u2019t you like the idea? You should, since you love our feet so much! Of course, if your lying about liking them\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026then we\u2019ll have to punish you even more.\u201d Soul finishes Star\u2019s sentence, understanding his friend\u2019s plan. You were now going to have to admit your lie to them, or keep on acting and experience ultimate foot torture. Being smothered under and between their sweaty feet\u2026the very thought made you sick to your stomach. That amount of foot stench could very well be toxic! But if you admit you\u2019re lying, they\u2019ll get angry and punish you!</span></div></div>",

Taking in all that foot odor may carry some risks, but upsetting the teenaged titans carried even greater risks! They might just punish you with a quick stomp, ending your puny life under their moist sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m not lying! I love your feet and I\u2019d love to be smothered by them!\u201d you plea, getting on your knees before the two gods. Soul and Black Star grin at each other and then at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Let\u2019s get started!\u201d Soul announced as he snatched you away from Black Star\u2019s foot and brought you back over to the basketball court. His meister friend followed behind and watched as you were dropped onto the hot, black court. It was fairly cloudy out, so the sun had not been beating on the court all day. You were thankful for that, since if it had been you\u2019d probably of been burned severely! As you pick yourself off the black tar you suddenly feel the earth shake as Black Star takes a seat nearby. His muscular ass created such a loud boom when it hit the ground that you were surprised it hadn\u2019t formed a crater! A similar boom shook the ground behind you as Soul seated himself on the court, grinning wickedly down at you the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s not waste any time, little man! Here come the feet!\u201d Soul exclaimed as he brought both his bare feet into view. You watched the white haired weapon wiggle all ten of his toes and he slowly brought the feet toward you. You turned around just as Black Star did the same, his slightly larger feet ready to plow into you like a bulldozer. At the speed they were going you could of run away, but for the sake of keeping your lie believable you simply stood there and waited. After what seemed like hours to you, the four feet hit their target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened in horror as your body was compressed between four walls of hard, sweaty skin. The two teenagers snickered with enjoyment as they began the smothering. There was so much pressure being forced upon your body that you couldn\u2019t even tell where it was coming from! All you knew was that you were surrounded in sweaty, smelly flesh. You started to wish you could go back to rubbing their feet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, can you feel him squirming?\u201d Soul asked his buddy as he curled his toes around your head, smearing your messy hair with his toe filth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! He must really enjoy it in there.\u201d Black Star replied as he pressed his soles into you harder. The pressure was unbelievable, but you gritted your teeth and tried not to scream. This was supposed to be your reward, therefore you couldn\u2019t show any signs that you disliked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the count of three let\u2019s pull are feet apart.\u201d Soul said, looking up at Black Star. The assassin nodded in response, but didn\u2019t look up from the mess of four feet before him. \u201cOne\u2026two\u2026three!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue the two males tore their feet apart. You felt the sticky wall in front of you painfully peel away from your face, but your back remained stuck to someone. Through weary eyes you look up at the giant who\u2019s foot you weren\u2019t stuck to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like he got stuck to your foot.\u201d Soul said as he lowered his face to Black Star\u2019s sole, seeing your miniscule body glued to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess he loves my foot more!\u201d the sweaty boy states as he stands up, putting all his weight on you. A small cry escapes your lips as the muscular meister stands on you. Soul also stands up, but keeps his eyes on you as his friend slowly grinds you against the black tar. After a couple minutes the teen gets bored and scrapes you off his foot, leaving you laying on your back and looking up at their towering forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, runt\u2026\u201d Soul started to say as he squatted down with his arms resting on his knees. The look he gave you\u2026the way those red eyes seemed to just stare through you. You knew something was up\u2026</span></div></div>",

It was always like this, Black Star was always acting all high and mighty and ordering everyone around, and normally, Soul would just shrug it off and comply with his best-friend\u2019s demands nonchalantly, but today Soul didn\u2019t feel like obeying the loud teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you! Why should I hand him over when it was my turn in the first place?\u201d Soul yelled at Black Star. \u201cYou should have just asked me for your turn with the squirt!

He looked at Black Star, expecting him to start yelling his lungs out, and noticed that the teen was just standing there, perfectly still. Black Star was looking down at the ground, his eyes hidden by his blue lashes, anger radiating off him in waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul gulped at the heavy, tense atmosphere that filled the basketball court. He had never seen his friend like this before, it was starting to get on his nerves and, although Soul would never admit it, it was scaring the crap out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlack Star\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlack Star I-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul winced at Star\u2019s icy tone; he had never heard his friend talk like that. Black Star walked to where Soul was laying on the floor and glared down at him. Even though Soul was regular sized, looking up at Black Star in all his muscled glory still made him feel puny under the meister\u2019s gaze, and it made the assassin look nothing short of a vengeful god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Soul, you\u2019re gonna wish you never talked back to me, cause from now on you\u2019re going to be my obedient little bitch, and I\u2019m gonna make you like it.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to forgive us right away.

Lets hope it stayed that way\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what now?\u201d Soul asks, taking a seat on a nearby chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was planning on asking Shinigami-sama if he could help, but then we got sidetracked. Let me just wash up a bit and we can head over to Shibusen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, Black Star! Did you forget? We skipped out on school! If we head over there now, Shinigami-sama\u2019s going to give us both a Shinigami Chop! That really frickin hurts! Let\u2019s just stick with the plan and wait until tomorrow.

Tomorrow I promise I\u2019ll take you to see Shinigami-sama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly nod. \u201cOkay\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now, before we head out of here, I really need to hit the showers!\u201d Black Star was about to put you down when he noticed you were soaked in just as much sweat as he was. \u201cI bet you really stink\u2026and these clothes look ruined.\u201d The teenage ninja glances over to his friend. \u201cHey, Soul, there\u2019s a toy shop a few blocks down from here. Can you go pick up something for him to wear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You mean\u2026like doll clothes? No way! A guy like me can\u2019t be seen buying doll clothes; that isn\u2019t cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Soul, it\u2019s the least you could do for putting him through all that stuff. Just say it\u2018s for Maka or one of her friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, fine, but you\u2019re paying me back.\u201d Soul replied, clearly displeased with the idea of simply walking into a toy shop at his age. You watched the white haired weapon exit the room, leaving you alone with Black Star once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, little guy, how about we get you washed up? It\u2019s be like you were never smothered with our feet or stuck up our armpits!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t remind me\u2026\u201d you mutter as Black Star heads for the locker room where the showers were. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Black Star reached the gym\u2019s locker rooms, he moved over to the area where the sinks and showers were. There were five sinks, two of which looked pretty dirty. Black Star chose one of the remaining three and placed you down on the edge. You and Black Star just stood there, staring at each other, for several seconds. Why was he just standing there? Was he waiting for something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? Aren\u2019t you going to undress? You\u2019re not going to take a bath in your clothes, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? But\u2026you\u2019re\u2026I\u2019m\u2026\u201d You stuttered and started to blush. The blue haired meister saw this and started bellowing with laugher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be shy, Lewis! We both have the same stuff, right? Yours is just smaller\u2026\u201d Black Star joked, but noticed you were still reluctant to take off your clothes. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t force you. Take a bath with your clothes on if you want.\u201d Black Star reached a hand over you and turned the nozzle of the faucet, releasing a stream of warm water into the sink (which was plugged). After that, he turned around so his broad back was facing you and walked away. While he was gone, you stood there and realized he was right. You couldn\u2019t take a bath in your clothes\u2026especially these sweat stained garments. Therefore, hoping you could undress and get into the water before he got back, you started pulling off your shoes and socks, followed by your shirt. It was hard getting the damp article off you, since it was clinging to your skin. When you finally did get it off, you immediately started unbuckling your jeans and slipped those off. Now you were only in a pair of black boxers, but when you started to pull those down\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m back! Got a few things for ya.\u201d Black Star approached the sink just as you lowered your boxers down, showing him your little, bare bum. \u201cSo, you decided to undress after all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face turned even redder as your spun around to face the giant assassin. You saw his eyes travel downward a bit and he started chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, guess you\u2019re REALLY small, eh little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-bastard\u2026\u201d you cursed as covered up your crotch in embarrassment. Black Star continued to snicker, but placed three items down as he did. The first was a tiny piece of soap, probably broken off from a whole one. To you it was plenty big, though. The second was what looked like the cap to a shampoo bottle with a tiny glob of shampoo inside. Finally, Black Star placed a towel to the side to be used when you were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything\u2019s here, and it looks like the water\u2019s ready!\u201d Black Star turned off the faucet just as the sink filled to the brim. You saw him make a motion with his hand, as if to say \u201chop in\u201d. You gladly did so and lowered your nude form into the warm water. A deep sigh escaped your lips as the water soothed your heated skin. Already it seemed like the water was washing off all the sweat and stink\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, time for me to take my shower!\u201d Black Star exclaimed as he started to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d you shout, stopping him. He turns around and looks at you, puzzled. \u201cCan you\u2026can you stay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Black Star raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy? I thought you wouldn\u2019t want me around after what I did to you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you\u2026but I don\u2019t want to be left alone. What if someone comes into the bathroom while you\u2019re in the shower? They could find me and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it, I get it.\u201d Black Star walked over to you and kneeled on the floor. His large arms (which still looked sweaty and pumped from his workout) rested themselves on the skin while Black Star rested his chin against those. Once you were sure he wasn\u2019t going to leave you, you started your bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you sank under the water for a couple seconds to wet your hair. Once it was soaked, you reached for the cap containing the shampoo\u2026only to find that it was out of reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it.\u201d you cursed, knowing you\u2019ll have to get out to grab it. To your surprise, however, Black Star pushed the cap toward you with one of his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere ya go, little buddy.\u201d Black Star says, smiling. You silently thank him before reaching into the cap and taking out the glob of shampoo, which you used to scrub your hair. As you did this, Black Star noticed that you were a pretty good swimmer. While your hands worked on your hair, your legs kept you afloat. Once you were done spreading the shampoo around, you planned to dive back under the water to rinse\u2026until Black Star scooped some water into his palm and poured it over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey!\u201d you shouted with surprise as your hair was rinsed for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I wanted to help. Oh, looks like there\u2019s still some more in there.\u201d Black Star took another handful of water and, much to your annoyance, poured it over your head again. You felt so vulnerable\u2026like a small child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d you tell the muscular teen before you grab the nearby piece of soap and start cleaning your body with it. Thankfully, Black Star never asks if he can clean you himself\u2026that would be weird. After you\u2019ve scrubbed your entire body, you felt the most clean you\u2019ve ever felt since coming to this world. It made you really happy and you just sat back against the edge of the sink and closed your eyes. You planned to just rest your eyes, but you ended up falling asleep instead. Your body slipped away from the sink and floated on the water\u2019s surface. The warm feeling all around you was heavenly, and the entire time Black Star was watching you carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke, you discovered that\u2026</span></div></div>",

After pulling your shirt on, Soul gently picks you off the sink and lets you stand on his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do they fit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I guess.\u201d you respond, still not completely comfortable with talking to Soul yet. It was hard to get over all the things they had done to you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you and Soul heard the shower clicking off nearby. One of the shower stalls opened and out walked Black Star, wearing nothing but a towel wrapped around his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh, that was refreshing!\u201d Black Star exclaimed as he trotted out of the shower. When he spotted you in Soul\u2019s hand, he gave you a smile. \u201cHey, Lewis! Did you have a nice bath?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah\u2026\u201d you quietly say as you turn your head away from Black Star. Even though he didn\u2019t mean you harm, the sight of Black Star\u2019s naked, muscular torso sent chills down your spine. He was incredibly intimidating and made you feel even smaller and weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what now?\u201d Soul asks his meister friend as he leans against the bathroom wall. Black Star finishes drying off his blue hair and responds while opening his personal locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should head back to Shibusen and ask Lord Death if he can help Lewis. That\u2019s what I was originally going to do\u2026before I got sidetracked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou realize that once Lord Death figures out we skipped class, WE\u2019RE the ones that are going to get punished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Black Star says as he pulls a black, sleeveless shirt over his torso. The top was identical to the one he always wore. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we deserve it, though? We did a lot of bad things to Lewis\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t think getting chopped to death is cool\u2026\u201d Soul replies as he shivers at the thought. \u201cLet\u2019s try and come up with an excuse for our absence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two teens start discussing how they\u2019re going to avoid punishment. While they talk, Soul slips you into his pocket and the two of them head out of the gym towards Shibusen. As they walked, you laid there in the large pocket and hoped Death would be able to help you. If he couldn\u2019t\u2026what was going to happen to you?</span></div></div>",

He felt like an animal ready to consume live prey. Leaning back in his chair, Soul continued to suck and lick your rich tasting body until a trail of drool dripped down his chin. Black Star, who noticed Soul\u2019s blissful state in the corner of his eye, stopped stuffing his face for a moment to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan. Soul. I know it\u2019s good, but it looks like you\u2019re getting aroused from the taste.\u201d he observed, pointing his fork in Soul\u2019s direction. \u201cJust swallow already.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSoul snapped back into reality and glanced at Black Star. Time to do away with you, he guessed. He tilted his head back and you fell toward the back of his mouth. With one big gulp, you were swallowed and dragged down into the stomach. The muscular walls of the esophagus squeezed you down the tube mercilessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026it\u2019s so tight.\u201d you managed to mumble. After a long period of forcing you down his gullet, Soul\u2019s body deposited you into the hot stomach where all his food goes to digest. You land in a pile of partially melted eggs. Or was it sausage? You couldn\u2019t tell. You staggered over to his stomach wall where you could hear the steady rhythm of his heartbeat and the muffled noises from outside. You were about to slam on the wall and demand to be let out, but the hole above you where you came through opened again with a squelch as chunks of chewed up food poured down upon you. You tired to run to dodge, but a pile of ham and eggs buried your left leg and forced you to the ground. Acid splashed against your face and you could already feel it start to tingle your skin. You screamed and tried to pull yourself free, but the weight of the rest of Soul\u2019s meal was too heavy. More eventually came and buried the rest of you under mush, save for your head. That was drenched in what you believed was apple juice. Giving up hope, you just laid there on the stomach floor in defeat. You could feel your body and the chunks of food around it start to succumb to the acids. It was getting harder to breath, either because your lungs were being crushed or the fumes of the digestive acids robbed you of any clean air. Your last thought before you slipped into unconsciousness was the memory of your last dream. This was similar, but you weren\u2019t waking up this time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul\u2019s plate laid before him empty. He rubbed his bloated stomach and belched loudly. \u201cBest breakfast I ever had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got that right.\u201d Black Star said from across him, picking his teeth with a toothpick. He glanced down at the spot where you were supposed to be and just now noticed you were missing. \u201cHold on; where\u2019s Lewis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft, damn guy must have been fooling you. He must have only hanged out with you until you gave him a free meal, then bounced. So uncool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star, being the gullible guy he was and unable to come up with any other reason, believed his friend\u2019s lie. \u201cThat scumbag! How dare he trick me! If I ever see him again, I\u2019ll have HIM for breakfast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul just grinned toothily as he patted his stomach. </span></div></div>",

I wonder what it\u2019s saying\u2026\u201d Black Star said. He wasn\u2019t really putting any effort into trying to hear the little bug on his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was in your sock, so it\u2019s probably telling you to wash your feet more. Did it stink a lot, little bug?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star chuckled. \u201cYou thought they smelled bad, huh? Well that\u2019s not very nice. You need to learn to respect the feet of a god.\u201d Black Star wiggled his toes, making you lose your balance and fall down. As the two boys laughed, the blue haired meister shook you off his foot and onto the hard pavement. Your body hurt from hitting the ground and your struggled to get back up. Suddenly, you noticed everything darken as you were consumed in a shadow. You looked back in absolute fear to see the bottom of Black Star\u2019s other foot above you; this one with the shoe still on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is what happens to insects that don\u2019t respect me, both your size and mine! I crush them under my foot!\u201d he yelled before slowly bringing the shoe down. Closer and closer it got until both the smirking faces of the boys were blocked by it. You felt the hard leather of the sole press against your back and you knew you were done for. The weight forced you to the ground until your face was pressed against its surface. Still the pressure increased and pain shot through your body. You started to cry and beg hysterically, but hearing your pleas was no longer possible for the boys. The last thing you heard was Black Star\u2019s voice. A voice that seemed to come from an almighty deity above. A deity that lacked the brain power of the average human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye-bye.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star felt the resistance under his shoe vanish. He swiveled his shoe back and forth, hearing a few more crunches before lifting it away and inspecting the bottom of it. He smiled and showed your remains to Soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mess with the BIG me or you\u2019ll end up like this, understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul rolled his eyes and continued walking. \u201cPut your shoe back on and come on. I\u2019m starving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!

Still confused about the ordeal, you just shout for help. \"Heyyy! Uh, Dr. Stein?!\" He sits up some on the bed, having most likely laid down to rest his eyes for a moment after some work. He glances around, eyes narrowed, ears perked to detect the intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Down here!\" You wave your arms, jumping right by him on the bedsheets. His head lowers and his gaze angles ever so slightly in your direction. You can't see his expression behind the glare on his glasses, unable to tell if he sees a person or a pesky insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Stein was reasonable and figured the odds of a talking cricket were slim. His hands descends over you and snatches you up quickly, bringing you up to his face. \"And just who are you?\" He asks, his voice a bit too loud for someone your size. You shout back your name, which is replied with by yet another query. \"How did you get here? And just how do you know me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that makes you pause. How were you to even tell him the truth? You were magically shrunk and teleported to his room, which just so happens to also be part of a fictional universe where you come from? He brings you a bit closer, waiting for an answer.There really wasn't anything else to say than that, though, so you digress the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few awkward moments of silence after your tale is told, Stein bursts out in laughter. \"Shrunken, huh? And from another universe?\" His grin is a bit unsettling, but maybe that was just how he smiled.

He leans in and states, \"So, I guess you're asking fro me to come up with a way to change you back and send you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking up some, as his voice is a bit too loud so close to you, you eagerly nod your head. \"Yeah, I think it's best if I get back before I'm missed, y'know?\" Back before you're missed? You think that over. Was your life back in 'reality' really all that great? Wouldn't it be better...if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you wanna go back?\" The doctor asks, seeming to know your doubts. After seeing the uneasy looks on your face, he chuckles and adjusts the screw once more, \"I mean, I could use a little help around here from time to time. Not too much help, I mean, but just enough. It'd be like having a little lab rat--er, assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now it's really tempting to stay. Getting to be at the aid of one of your favorite anime characters?

I already have plenty of ideas in mind...\" Trying to think optimistically about the plans, you ponder it. I mean, when you woke up, you were right at his feet anyways. Maybe a shower could do. He extended his hand to you expectantly, waiting for you to step on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing one foot in front of the other, you find yourself in the palm of the scientist's hand, a thought which sort of excites you, but you try to hide that. \"Yeah! I-I mean, if you don't mind, that is.\" He chuckles and carries you into the bathroom, setting you on the counter and holding up a finger to tell you to wait a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter turning on the shower, the drops raining down, he pauses, looking from you to the shower and back. \"Hmm...Now that I think about it, it might be kind of difficult to hold you and wash myself at the same time.\" He switched the mode, and the water rushes out of the faucet below. \"Hope you don't mind baths. And, um, hope you can swim. Wouldn't want you drowning.\" He tosses his coat aside and then proceeds to take of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" you seem flustered, but shake it off. What were doing, gawking like that?! Besides, from what you'd read, Stein wasn't someone to show much true emotion, even stating at times he couldn't feel such things, so you knew not to take it that way, right? \"Um, o-of course I can swim, heh heh.\" You watch as he starts to undo the pants, but then turns to you. \"Well? Are you going to bathe in your clothes?\" After staring dumbfoundedly for a moment, you reply, \"Oh, uh, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple wordless moments later, and you're awkwardly exposed right in front of the giant, who is already in the bath now. He extends a hand to you, just a foot away on the counter. Once again, you climb on, wondering if he can really see anything of yours when you're at this size. He keeps his hand hovering under you, but lets you tread the water for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, the doctor actually looks rather calm. Then again, you'd read the manga and seen the series over and over, and know that he isn't all that insane, which is good for you. The other thing that takes your attention are the scars that trace over his body. \"So,\" he says, \"How much do you know about me?\" You ponder whether he's secretly a midn-reader, but toss aside the paranoia and just answer the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um...you're a mad scientist, so to speak.\" That stuff from the forums and internet and your own knowledge and inferences pop into your mind, and you ramble on, You're prone to dissecting things. Kinda craz--er, I mean, subject to madness, at one point, after the whole, uh, madness keishin thing. Good meister though, able to make Spirit into a Death Scythe, and good at managing your soul wavelength.\" You chuckle, adding, \"You're probably my favorite character, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis emotion, which isn't blocked by a glare of glasses since those have been set aside for the bath, seems rather amused, actually, maybe just a bit suspicious. He playfully splashes you, which is more like the little mini-tidal-waves at big splash or some other waterpark. \"Seems you've done your research.\" He reaches for the shampoo, lathering his hair as he continues, \"That's good. You'll be useful, at least. I was actually considering dissecting you if you didn't work out.\" He laughs, and you nervously join in, although part of you takes that with some fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a dab of the shampoo on his index finger, he guides you over with the other hand, and pokes your head, getting it coated in hairwash. You rub that in yourself, dunking your head under quickly to get it out afterwards. \"Let's see...\" Stein thinks, sinking a bit into the water, \"What else to study about you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thinks, you find treading water that is practically like a lake to you becomes rather tiring. But his hand is over back by him. Casually, you swim over until you're at his chest, climbing on and resting. You look over your shoulder up at him, and find him looking back at you oddly. \"Oh, uh, sorry, Dr. Stein,\" you chuckle, \"Just got tired of, heh, not drowning.\" He didn't mind, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, he replies, \"Oh, that's fine. I was just thinking.\" He leans back, permitting you to recline on him. Stretching and yawning, you move up a little more. Of course, your own mind was now wondering what he was thinking about. I mean, this was Stein you were talking about. If he's plotting something, it couldn't end well for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moves suddenly, causing you to slip off and back into the water. Stepping out, he grabs a towel and wraps himself in it. You swim over to the edge of the bath, but find you can't climb up it. \"Uh, S-Stein?\" You call, heart skipping a beat, hoping he hasn't forgotten you, hoping you didn't make a wrong move. He holds up his hand, telling you to wait a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, he returns, wearing pajamas with stitches on them, as well, and then reaches in and grabs you, placing you in a washcloth. \"I don't think I have anything small enough for you to wear,\" he says, \"But If you want, I could probably stitch something together. You laugh at his joke, and he laughs back, whether he gets it or not, as you dry off with the cloth. \"That's fine, I'll just sleep in my clothes.\" After slipping back into your clothes, you get back in his hand and you both enter the bedroom again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got to get up early in the morning, so get some rest.\" He lets you off in the little shelf he'd converted into a room for you. He also wraps around a bit of rope(well, string, really) around a nail that leads down right above his bed. \"If you need anthing, just climb down and let me know, alright?\" He smiles assuringly, \"I'm a light sleeper, don't worry.\" You nod, and he lays down in his bed, which carries the same staple-stitched pattern as the rest of his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing into your own bed, your drift off to sleep, barely hearing him wish you a goodnight, but mumbling back a response, before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jolt awake, a cold sweat on you, panting heavily. Another dream. You look around the room. And sure enough, it's still your bed...within Stein's room, that is. But you'd had another dream. This one, of course with Stein. You start to wonder...maybe you should tell the scientist...but what good would that do, other than bother him in his sleep? After mulling it over, you...</span></div></div>",

Your name is David, a typical fifteen-year-old who loves action. Your favorite kind of action was DBZ action. Everyday you\u2019d watch Dragonball on TV and wish you could be like the characters in it. Strong, cheery, and carefree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday you ran to your room in time to catch the newest episode, but when you clicked on your TV you were met with a surprise. The TV screen turned completely white. Your first instinct was that it was in the middle of a scene, but you soon changed your theory when the TV itself began to flow. Thinking it was going to blow or something, you made a dash for the door just as an explosion of white light engulfed the room and you along with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few minutes later that you came to. You opened your eyes and immediately noticed something was different. The room was unfamiliar in both shape\u2026and size. Everything was huge and you estimated you couldn\u2019t be larger than two inches tall. Before you could think about your next course of action, a set of booming noises appeared behind you. You turned around to see the feet of a giant walking casually in your direction. You recognized the feet, as they belonged to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Needless to say you were nervous about what the superpowered kid would do to you when he got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry men! There's no way he'll get past the other guys!\" You say trying to encourage your small squad, who look like they're about to run away in fear just from hearing the noises of the fight. \"B-But captain.....He took out everyone General Red put out for him! Even Tao Pai Pai! It's hopeless we're doomed! Run away!!\" Screams a boar like soldier, who you promptly shoot on sight before he can ruin the operation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That goes for all of you!\" You growl as the soldier's body falls to the floor. \"I've got a secret weapon in store for that brat!\" You say as you hold up a small pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But I heard bullets don't-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fool! This is no ordinary pistol! This is a shrink gun designed to look like a regular gun, so I can catch him off guard!\" You yell just as the kid smashes through the floor using only his hard head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone's eyes go wide as the kid, without hesitation, devastates your entire squad until only you are left. But just as he is about to come for you, you fire the shrink gun. However the sneaky brat pulls out a red stick and somehow sends the beam back at you like he is hitting a baseball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beam hits you, and suddenly you see everything, including the damn kid, getting much bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the light is gone you find yourself face to face with a pair of gigantic shoes! You strain your neck to look up at see the boy grinning down at you childishly. \"Heh heh! Didn't expect that did you! I don't know how you got so small but I think I'm going to keep you!\" He says and snatches you up. You struggle in the iron like grip of the boy. He really is strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are one of the bad guys, So it's only right that I should punish you until you learn your lesson!\" Goku says as he stops to think about how to punish you. You gulp and shiver at what this gigantic kid could have in store for you.</span></div></div>",

He seated himself on the hard, metallic floor of the room and casually began slipping one of his giant shoes off. The kid seemed really relaxed, despite being in the middle of an enemy base. After getting the shoe off, he let out a long sigh as he wiggled his toes. \u201cThat\u2019s much better. I haven taken my shoes off in awhile. Why did you have to make this base so darn big?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku started to move you to his bare, dirty sole as you struggled fruitlessly. The boy\u2019s natural strength combined with his size made it so your struggles didn\u2019t even resister to the boy. Before long, you found your helpless body being shoved against the sweaty foot and dragged back and forth. You were giving Goku a foot massage, whether you liked it or not. Your face was pressed completely into the soft skin, forcing you to smell nothing but his reeking boyfoot. After awhile, Goku dragged you up to his toes and pushed your tiny head between his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, smells nasty, doesn\u2019t it? I hope you\u2019re learning your lesson.\u201d You screamed a response, but it was muffled by the kid\u2019s toes. Finally, Goku removed you from his foot and carried you to his face again. \u201cWell, that\u2019s all for now. I better get out of here before they send reinforcements.

Once you landed on the squishy insole, you realized how big of an athlete Goku had to have been to be so strong. And that revelation was backed up by how much his shoe stunk, it had to have been worn for quite a long time to have absorbed the very essence of the boy's funky foot. <br>\r\nYou had to cover your mouth and nose at the same time with both hands once you inhaled inside there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the light was blocked out and you looked up to see none other than the gargantuan toes of your oppressor coming into the opening. You screamed, unintentionally taking in some of Goku's funky foot odor at the same time, and ran opposite the opening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDead end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around only to be caught between the cheesy toes of a boy less than half your own age. From your chest down your body was engulfed in some sort of cream cheese like stuff that seemed to ooze out from the skin between the brat's digits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Goku stomped his foot a few times on the floor, making sure that you weren't underneath his foot and secured safely between his toes.

Despite being neatly tucked between his toes, you were constantly tossed face-first into the toejam of the kid\u2019s foot. It didn\u2019t help that there was practically no light and the only thing you heard was the earth shattering boom each time Goku\u2019s feet hit the ground. Occasionally you heard commotion outside as groups of unfortunate guards made fools of themselves by getting in the boy\u2019s way. They would have better luck trying to top a steamroller. After kicking the 20th guard in the face (and you feeling the poor man\u2019s nose shatter behind you), Goku came upon a large room with a few of the Dragon Balls nested on a pedestal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, found them!\u201d Goku laughed as he ran toward the golden objects. Suddenly, he felt a presence above him as he hopped to the side, just as a large mech landed with a loud boom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, missed the brat!\u201d cursed the soldier piloting the mecha. The mech, which Goku thought looked like a giant toaster with a head, pointed at the young boy. \u201cThis is as far as you get! I\u2019ll avenge my fallen comrades and defeat you, boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I have no choice.\u201d Goku said as he readied his fighting stance. The giant mech rushed at Goku and swung one of its metal arms at him. Goku ducked under the blow and kicked the arm from underneath, flinging it off its body like it was connected with glue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn you!\u201d cursed the pilot again as he pointed his other arm at the kid, which sported a laser gun. Goku yelped as he dodged the lasers and started running around the room. \u201cHahaha, run you little brat, run!\u201d While you were rooting for your underling, the increase in Goku\u2019s speed wasn\u2019t helping your condition. The shoe were shaking so much that you were afraid you might dislodge from the toe cheese and end up under the boy\u2019s foot. If that happened, you were doomed in the next second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Goku would end the battle before that happened. Dodging one last laser, the super-powered child jumped high into the air and began charging his signature move. The soldier noticed the sudden buildup of energy and attempted to flee. Unfortunately, the constant use of his laser gun had left his mech with no energy left to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, shit! No, ssssstttooooppp!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHA!\u201d Goku unleashed the Kamehameha wave, hitting the mech right in the bull\u2019s-eye and rocketing it through the wall to parts unknown. Goku landed back on the ground and wiped his forehead of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew, that was fun.\u201d Goku giggled as he strolled over to the pedestal and grabbed the Dragon Balls. After all that hard work, he had earned his prize. You on the other hand had earned a mouthful of the kid\u2019s sweat and a loss of dignity. Anyway, Goku was about to leave when\u2026</span></div></div>",

Goku looked down at his foot and laughed. \"Ha ha ha! There you are! You look funny!\" He giggled some more before he picked you out of his toejam.

He was grinning innocently, like you were a new toy he'd found.<br>\r\nKnowing how strong this kid was to have beaten what you took to be Black outside the shoe. You picked a piece of toe crud off your uniform and hesitantly stuck it in your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed it right back out. It tasted foul and sort of burned your tongue. Goku however wasn't happy about this at all. \"Yo! Whats the big idea!? You're a bad guy, and I'm punishing you....You can't do that!\" Goku scolded you. <br>\r\nHearing the slight agitation in his voice, you slowly put some more in your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou somehow managed to swallow this piece, Goku's filth went down your throat. It felt slimy and gross going down. All this time Goku was smiling at you, knowing that what he was doing was going to pay off in the end and show you the error of your ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever when you came to the last bite, you found you couldn't do it. So, plucking up your courage, you flung the piece of toe cheese at Goku. It barely registered to him, but he knew what you were getting at.

The pool of acid and mush began to rise around you and while the smelly sack of muscle contracted and pulsated, throwing you all about and leaving you unable to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis five minute dilemma over, the legendary monkey boy Goku continued on his way finishing up what was left of the Red Ribbon base. With each leap, kick and punch he not only took down Red Ribbon soldiers but his gut sloshed around speeding up the breakdown of one of their commanders. Those goons might have been humiliated, being beaten by a child but it was nothing compared to what you were suffering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t sure how long you remained conscious. Perhaps you died instantly and this extended experience was your mind imagining your fate. Whatever the case when you finally lost consciousness you unfortunately had complete clarity on what was to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother base of bad guys defeated Goku left behind smoking ruins. He was thanked by the locals and offered a meal that he would pile on top of your liquefied remains. After his reward he once again set off to meet Bulma and Krillin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed the bulge in Goku\u2019s gut, refreshed from his reward would slowly shrink until, with a deep gurgling the slurry was pumped into his duodenum. Goku felt this emptying of his upper gut but paid it no mind, merely placing a hand on his lower belly. After all this happened every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour remains spent hours being squeezed with rest of the food through the small intestine. Millions of tiny villi sucking any and all nutrition out of you and the surrounding debris before moving you on to waste disposal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was slightly roomier in Goku\u2019s large intestine, not that you could comprehend it. Thankfully you also had no way to smell the crap that his bacteria was working hard to produce. As you sludged further along, water was reabsorbed from you until you were a stinky brown log. You were bathed in foul wind rushing past you to be expelled by the boy. From your position you could hear the kids every prrrrttt and childish giggle at the stinky wind you gave yourself to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you reached the end packing the monkey boys rectum as huge length of poop.

What no one watching the boy fly through the sky knew was that the remains of a man were steadily filling his rectum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely Goku began to feel the tell-tale signs of nature\u2019s call. Occasionally he would drop his pants mid-flight and release a stream of urine on whatever happened to be below him. However on this occasion he felt a more substantial amount of waste eager to exit and so decided to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Nimbus had even settled to the ground, the monkey boy leapt off holding his crotch. \u201cI gotta go\u201d he said to no one in particular before rushing to the nearest tree. In a split second his pants were on the ground and he was aiming his boyhood. Goku pursed his lips and frowned for a second before the valve was released and a strong stream of golden pee struck the tree leaving a dark trail down the bark. He released a massive sigh of satisfaction as his stream died down before shaking the last drops of urine from his wiener.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku always took pleasure in simple things and the act of relieving himself was no different. The lazy smile on his face turned into a slight grimace as his lower gut released a squelching gurgle, signalling that he wasn\u2019t done with his release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot bothering to dig a hole or move somewhere more comfortable the half-naked boy immediately squatted in a sitting position, his toes clenching with a comically determined look on his face. The low growl of his bowels signalled your plea for release. Seeing no reason to deny his basic instincts Goku released a cute little grunt and began to move his bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough your remains along with his last meal nearly filled Goku\u2019s rectum there was still a large amount of gas preventing your exit. So upon the monkey boys first push a loud trumpet like \u201cPrrrrtttttttt\u201d sounded, announcing your re-entrance into the world outside a boy\u2019s gut. Goku giggled at the noise his rear had sounded. You knew that generally kids, particularly little boys found flatulence funny but you were amazed at the enjoyment Goku got from every one of his bottom burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan that stinks\u201d Goku muttered holding his nose, \u201cand it\u2019s about to get stinkier\u201d, he felt the brown log you had been converted to pressing against his butthole. With another clenching of Goku\u2019s guts you finally began to slide out his anus coated with a healthy amount of mucous. Eventually the tip of the turd touched the ground and Goku noticing this, clenched his butt pinching off the log and letting it fall to the grass with a quiet plop. Another quick burst of wind and a grunt later, the second loaf began to ease out, followed by another. Finally the deed was done and small pile of turds lay steaming on the grass, already attracting flies.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He stuck out his tongue and pressed your ant-sized body against it, giving you nice big lick that covered you in sticky saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst rule: Never talk back to your master.\u201d You groaned at the disgusting feeling that covered your skin. However, Goku was far from done. Taking a seat on the floor, he spread his feet apart and pushed you into his left sole. The saliva acted like glue and stuck you helplessly against the rough skin of Goku\u2019s foot. The smell from before irritated your nose, but this would soon be nothing. You watched as Goku brought his other foot toward you and began to squeeze you between them. You groaned in pain at the tremendous pressure the giant was putting on your poor body. He started rubbing his feet together, creating a squelching sound as the saliva glued you to both soles. You were being covered in spit and foot sweat and could only endure it. After several minutes, Goku finally stopped and separated his feet. With a popping you were released and stuck upon the older man\u2019s right sole this time. He only giggled at the state you were in and peeled you off his foot. He then got back up and held you in front of his face to get a better look. \u201cMan, you look terrible.

The light, your only comfort in this torture, was robbed of you when Goku put his arm down and trapped you in a very smelly darkness. You just waited in the tangled mess for Goku\u2019s next move. </span></div></div>",

The hairs were wound tight around your arms, legs, and torso, holding you effectively hostage. Only a sheer amount of movement would have any chance of dislodging you now. Not to mention you were somewhat glued to the older mans' skin thanks to all the sweat. The smell was something else altogether. After a few minutes the smell was so ingrained in your nostrils and so soaked into your body you got used to it. You could feel movement all around you. You knew Goku was moving around somewhere. You wondered how long he intended to keep you in here and what he was planning on doing to you afterward. What kind of plans would a child like adult like Goku have in mind? If he got bored of you what would he do? Your life was entirely in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, light flooded your prison as Goku lifted his arm up in a punching motion. Within seconds the light disappeared again as he brought his arm back to his side. The movement you had been feeling earlier was getting steadily more intense as Goku continued his sparring workout outside. Unlike Vegeta he lacked a gravity room so he had to be content with just going over his moves and occasionally battling with Gohan, Goten, or both at once depending. To make up for the lack of such equipment, however, he was as intense as he could possibly be. This was bad news for you as you slowly started getting sick with all the movement. Worse, you could feel new beads of sweat forming in the nest of hairs, sliding down the hairs and soaking into your clothes, hair, and skin, some of the salty liquid even fell into your mouth. You gagged at the sharp salty taste and cough a few times. The heat was, if possible, worse than the sweat. You were overheating to the point that it felt like you could pass out at any moment. Passing out would have been a god send for you but unfortunately every time Goku lifted his arms a blast of freezing wind assailed you, waking you up and supplying you with fresh air before plunging you back down into the manly stench of the adult Saiyan you were trapped with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought you couldn't bear it any more Goku stops moving, his body glistening with sweat in the sun. He lifts up his arm and looks at you, laughing at the state you're in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm impressed you're still conscious! I'm really working up a sweat! Do you like the smell or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay silent knowing that answering either way would probably get you into trouble. Goku just laughs again and says, \"Well, since you're awake we can go on to the next thing I have planned!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what it could be. You brace yourself as Goku says</span></div></div>",

Refusal would mean certain doom at your petty size. Hell, it would mean doom even at normal size! Therefore, you gulped and slowly approached Goku\u2019s giant foot. While keeping you nose as far away from the fetid sole, you placed your hands onto it and started rubbing. You weren\u2019t surprised to find the feet rough and hard, like a wall of steel. You felt kind of sorry for all the faces that had gotten kicked by this master of martial arts. Putrid man sweat dripped from his skin and over your arms. Almost like a second skin, the sweat covered the entire expanse of his foot. You hated it and thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse, until your giant master spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, I can hardly feel you down there! Use your entire body if you have to.\u201d he commanded from high above. When no change was felt, he spoke again. \u201cI said I want to feel you down there, bug! Did you hear me?!\u201d Sensing the anger in his voice and fright controlling you, you immediately threw yourself against the foot so your entire body was pressed up against it. You rubbed against the steel-like wall again and again, almost submerged in the sweat. It reeked like nothing you\u2019d smelled before. You\u2019d smelled yourself when you were sweaty and your socks too, but this was the sweat of a full grown, muscular adult. It was a whole other ball game. You could only cry into the sole as Goku sighed and relaxed, enjoying his foot rub. Your tears were invisible, as your face was completely drenched in sweat. Your clothes were also soaked, like you\u2019d just taken a dive into the pool with them on. After what felt like hours to you, Goku told you to stop and you gladly did. \u201cThat was great, kid. Good job. Now\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

The movements of is foot are too erratic and it feels like he\u2019s always moving. In addition, you hear what sounds like fists constantly connecting with something. The rate of is perspiration is also ungodly high. There\u2019s so much salty sweat dripping from his foot that you feel a pool of sweat start to form underneath you! His boots seemed to absorb most of the sweat, so you didn\u2019t have to worry about drowning, but the smell\u2026oh the smell. It was suffocating! Suddenly, without warning, you feel Goku\u2019s foot impact something hard. The weight on top of you increases for a split second and the wind is knocked right out of you. If Goku wasn\u2019t holding back on that kick, you would surely be dead right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! Dad, that hurt!\u201d a teenage Gohan (from the Cell Saga) said as he held his gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but you were wide open. What did I tell you about making sure you give your opponents zero time to counter?\u201d Goku told his son. He glanced down at his boot and wiggled his toes, making sure grind your head between them. He wondered if he had held back enough, that shrunken kid looked pretty frail. Maybe he should check\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now I\u2019m going to pay you back with a blow twice as hard!\u201d Gohan shouted at his dad as he zoomed right for him. Goku had no time to check up on you and readied himself for the charging teen. Back in his boot, you felt like you were on some kind of carnival ride from hell. Goku was constantly moving his foot to dodge Gohan\u2019s attacks, block them, and deliver a few well aimed kicks. If you weren\u2019t being pinned down by his gargantuan foot, you would probably be all over the place. Instead, you just got REALLY dizzy. Maybe if these were normal martial artists, it wouldn\u2019t so bad, but these were NOT normal martial artists. These were sayians who possessed enough strength to toss a battleship and enough speed to outrun a bullet train. It was a miracle you hadn\u2019t been crushed the moment the fight started. Perhaps Goku was so skilled that even while fighting Gohan, he could still hold back enough to not hurt you? At least not severely hurt you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two family members sparred for about a half hour before they stopped to rest. Both of them were covered in sweat and sported a few bruises here and there, but nothing serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how did I do, dad?\u201d Gohan asked, wiping some sweat from his brow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, son. You got in a few good shots. You\u2019ve gotten really powerful.\u201d Goku replied, giving his son a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks! I\u2019m glad we can train like this when mom\u2019s not home. She\u2019d kill me if she found out I wasn\u2019t studying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku chuckled a bit. He was really proud of his son. Not only was he an amazing fighter, but he also possessed a lot more intelligence than he himself would ever have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, dad\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, son?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Goku then pulled his foot out of his boot with a suction cup like sound as all the sweat stuck to his raunchy foot. Gohan wrinkled his nose at the foul smell and blushed when he realized it was coming from his father's foot. Goku saw his look and giggled, then reached a hand down into the depths of his stinky footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou count your blessings that Goku's mighty Saiyan foot didn't smash you like the bug you are.

To make his point, the titan brought you down to the foot you had gotten to know so well and began rubbing you all over it. The top of his foot, his sole, and even his toes\u2026sweat from all over his foot clung to your body. You whimpered as he did this, still not believing that your loyalty to DBZ was rewarded with this. How could the characters that you had practically worshiped treat you like this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour despair did little to stop Goku as the sayian wasted no time in prying off his other boot to continue the torture. Soon he was giving that foot the same treatment, all while his son simply watched and did nothing to stop him. When Goku finished rubbing you between his last two toes, not even five seconds went by before you were roughly tossed over to Gohan and introduced to the teenager\u2019s bare feet. They weren\u2019t as bad as his father\u2019s, but that was saying very little. By the amount of sweat this kid\u2019s sweat glands gave off, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he went through several pairs of shoes a month! Only the fighter\u2019s personal combat boots could survive so much sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both of Gohan\u2019s feet were sweat free, you were carelessly dropped on your stomach. You had not the energy to run or even stand up, so you just waited for one of the titans to pick you up again. When no god-like hand reached for you, you forced yourself onto your back just in time to watch Gohan finish slipping his gi over his head and tossing it onto the ground somewhere. Both of the boys\u2019 shirtless, toned figures were in plain sight now. It really did look like you were staring up at a couple of might gods. Gohan smirked down at you before reaching for you and grabbing you into his strong hand once more. He brought you up to his face and grinned at you once more before raising one of his muscular arms into the air and shoving you into his pit. The smell was ten times worse than his feet and you screamed in terror. Your shouts were muffled by his armpit hairs and you received a mouthful of pit sweat for your troubles. You heard both titans laugh at your humiliation as you choked on perspiration. After about five minutes in Gohan\u2019s pit, the young teen tossed you high in the air and caught you in his other hand before thrusting you into his other armpit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, this is so much fun!\u201d Gohan said, grinning widely at his dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you\u2019re having fun, but don\u2019t forget I still have two pits he needs to clean!\u201d Goku raised one of his broad arms and released such a foul stench that even Gohan could smell it from a few feet away. The teen took you out of his pit and was about to hand you over to Goku when he noticed you weren\u2019t moving. Dangling you by your leg, he examined your minuscule form and noticed your hair and clothes were drenched in sweat. Your skin was bright red and your eyes were rolled to the back of your head. Your mouthed was gaped open with a trickle of drool coming from it. At first the boy thought you were dead, but a quick poke caused you to twitch a bit, meaning you were still breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess he couldn\u2019t take any more sweat, dad. He\u2019s out like a light.\u201d Gohan stated, showing Goku your unconscious body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, that\u2019s a shame.\u201d Goku pouted, folding his arms over his bare chest. \u201cI guess he just couldn\u2019t take the combined sweat of two sayian males.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple more hours pass before you snap out of your sweat-induced coma.

Just in time too! Chi-Chi came home and was furious to not see Gohan studying. After she had scolded him and put him to work, she turned on her husband and informed him that he had eaten all their food. Goku was sure he hadn't eaten that much though.

He felt bad that Chi-Chi discouraged martial arts to their son. But at least they still had their secret training sessions. Goku walked into the house with the food and set it all on the table. He noticed Chi Chi was frying some rice, \"Good, The rice is almost done, now I can get started on the potatoes and the steak.\" Chi Chi smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku loved Chi Chi's cooking, but hated the wait. He'd have to have something to distract him from the hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku then remembered you still stuck in his armpit. He told Chi-Chi he was going out for a bit to train.

You continued to lap up your dinner as Goku felt his own stomach growl. Looking around, he noticed they were directly under an apple tree. Using his fist, the Sayian smashed the base of the tree and caused all the juicy morsels to fall down to earth. Without moving an inch from his sitting position, Goku caught five apples in his hands while the rest fell around him. He began stuffing each apple into his mouth whole and swallowing them after just a few bites. You heard Goku\u2019s noisy eating and looked up to see him devouring the fruit. It mad you desire a nice, plump apple\u2026not this disgusting filth. Goku glanced down to make sure you were still eating and you went back to consuming the accumulated dead cells and sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes, Goku finished swallowing his tenth apple and wiped his mouth with his sleeve. \u201cThat made a good snack!\u201d he exclaimed, patting his stomach. He looked down at you to see how you were holding up. Your queasy expression told him \u201cnot so good\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoku\u2026I\u2019m getting full.\u201d you mumbled, feeling all the toe jam you had eaten upset your stomach as it tried to digest it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFull, eh? Well, I guess we\u2019ll have to save the other toes for tomorrow.\u201d Goku said with a smile, picking you out of his foot and placing you on his palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen are you going to let me go? I\u2019ve learned my lesson\u2026\u201d you tell him, playing along with his false idea that you were an intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever! It would be cruel of me to let you fend for yourself. You might get eaten by a bird or something! Instead, you\u2019re going to live with me and Gohan as our own personal pet slave.\u201d Goku explained to you before putting his finger up to his lips. \u201cBut we\u2019ll keep it a secret from Chi-Chi, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?! But Goku, I\u2019ll never survive! I almost died a few times today alone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my fault, kid. You just need to toughen up. I\u2019m confident that eventually you\u2019ll be begging to smell our B.O.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip and looked away from Goku\u2019s colossal face. Actually begging to be around their smelly bodies? It was difficult to picture\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, there\u2019s still some time left before dinner\u2019s ready, so let\u2019s continue. We\u2019ll do some training next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTraining?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, training. We need to start toughing you up if you don\u2019t want to end up squashed someday. To start\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

You gulped and had a good idea what this meant, you began running in the opposite direction of where Goku was sitting, you heard him chuckle under his breath as he intentionally missed you by mere inches. He slammed his foot down behind you, sending you sprawling forward into the tall grass from the gust of wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had shakily got up when a shadow fell upon you and you shook off the pain in your bruised elbows, and began running again. Unknown to you, Goku wasn't even trying to step on you, he was intentionally missing you by a few inches just so he could be entertained. He wasn't about to kill you and deprive himself and maybe his son of entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery soon you were too tired to run anymore, you lay there on your back gasping for breath as Goku's foot hovered over you ominously. \"Aren't ya gonna run?\" Goku asked in puzzlement. But you just lay there and sweated and panted, completely beat. <br>\r\n\"Oh well...that's enough training for a weakling I guess.\" Goku said, ignorant to how he was berating you when you were down. But you didn't really care, let him call you whatever he wanted, just please.....a rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku for the first time saw how tired and beaten you were and realized he didn't want to end his fun yet. To the childlike adult this was all a game, he wasn't even realizing how bad he was hurting you. He had never known any humans except Bulma to be so small, and that was because she had a special watch....So it was obvious this guy had somehow gotten ahold of Bulma's watch, probably by stealing it, and was gonna do bad things with it! So he needed to be punished and humiliation at the hands of a sweaty saiyan god was a just one in Goku's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Goku seeing you all battered and beaten, not wanting you to die but to be punished further and maybe then he would consider letting up on the punishment....just a bit. He took you into the house where Chi-Chi was filling bowls of soup.</span></div></div>",

The child-like sayian leaned over one of the bowls and took a deep sniff. He was about to grab it when Chi-Chi slapped his hand away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Goku! Go wash you hands first, and tell Gohan supper\u2019s ready.\u201d Chi-Chi ordered her muscle head of a husband. Goku sighed and obeyed, leaving the kitchen with a frown. He made his way upstairs where the bedrooms and bathroom were and opened the door to Gohan\u2019s room. His teenage son was sitting at his desk, his nose still buried in a book. \u201cGohan, Chi-Chi wants us to wash up before dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, dad.\u201d Gohan replied, practically jumping out of his chair and dashing past the older man. The two sayian warriors walked into the bathroom where they took turns washing their hands. As Gohan was drying his hands, he noticed his father\u2019s pocket jiggle a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey dad, your pocket\u2019s moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, almost forgot about him.\u201d Goku said, laughing as he reached his damp hand into his pants pocket and took you out. He brought you over to Gohan, who was thrilled to see you again. The boy saw that you looked pretty tired and beaten up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what did you do to him, dad?\u201d Gohan asked our of curiosity, not worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just training him a little. He needs to toughen up if he wants to survive being our slave. Right now he\u2019s pretty weak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated being called weak, but you knew it to be true. Compared to these two muscular giants, you were nothing. You just laid there in Goku\u2019s hand as the man described to his son the \u201ctraining\u201d he had put you through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like fun! I can\u2019t wait to give him some of my training. Lets hurry up and eat so we can play with him some more!\u201d Gohan said to his dad before running out of the bathroom and down to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGohan, no running in the house!!\u201d Goku heard Ch-Chi yell. Your giant master chuckled and was about to leave the bathroom when he suddenly got an idea. He gave you a playful grin before kneeling down and undoing his right boot. You watched his slip his large, sweaty foot out of the boot and then lower you to the opening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, not again!\u201d you scream just as the large man drops you into his smelly footwear. You get to your feet and look up to see Goku smiling down at you. His boyish face is soon blocked by his bare foot returning to its boot. You know you can\u2019t escape it, but you still run as to avoid being mowed down by the giant. Once you reach the dead end, you turn around just as Goku fits his foot completely into the boot. You get caught between his big and index toes and cringe as you feel toe jam stick to your clothes. Goku wiggles his toes, grinding you between his massive toes. You cry out in pain as the toes compress your body, threatening to squash it like a grape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his boot retied, Goku heads back to the kitchen where Gohan is helping his mother set the table. Goku takes his seat next to his son and the two begin eating loudly. Chi-Chi just sighs as her boys\u2019 lack of manners and eats her own soup calmly. Dinner lasts about five minutes and in those five minutes Goku consumed twenty-four bowls of soup, Gohan fifteen, and Chi-Chi one and a half\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, that was delicious, mom!\u201d Gohan said as he patted his full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour cooking is great, like always, Chi-Chi. Maybe a bit more meat next time\u2026\u201d Goku said a she picked some beef out of his teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat\u2026now I have to clean this up\u2026\u201d Chi-Chi muttered to herself as she looked over the mess the two males had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey mom, can I go play with dad now?\u201d Gohan asked, excited about playing with their new slave some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you finish your studying?\u201d the woman asked, making Gohan cringe a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026sorta\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorta? That\u2019s not good enough, young man! I want you to finish all your studying before you do anything else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan sighed and replied, \u201cRight away, mom\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Goku quickly peeled you off and tossed your greasy form to his son. Who caught him and groaned, \"Eww...he's all sticky!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahahaha. Well....See ya later Gohan.\" Goku said popping his boot back on and closing the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan looked at the door for a moment, perhaps wondering if his mom was going to come in, then he looked down at you and got a smirk on his face. \"Hm hm hm....You ready for some fun little guy?\" </span></div></div>",

You look up expecting to hear him say he was kidding... but he just smirks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the giant boots and pull one by the heel with all your strength, but you just end up falling on your butt. Gohan snigger\u00b4s as he watches you fail. Humiliated, you pick yourself up and try again. This time you pull so much you manage to get it off his foot. It tumbles to the ground and you move on to the other boot. You repeat the same process, this time however it lands on top of you and squishes you beneath. Gohan erupts in laughter again. You slip from under the boot and crawl to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay slave get to rubbing\" said Gohan as he opened his book again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed once again at how little your master seemed to care about your well-being.

Pretty gross I bet, heheheheheh!\" Goku said as he stretched out his leg and untied his boot before pulling it off with that familiar sucking sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh.\" Goku sighed as he felt the cool breeze blow on his hot foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crossed his foot over on his knee and took off his other boot, he looked down at your pitiful form and admired the job his foot had done on you so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squinted in the sunlight, having been trapped in smelly darkness for so long, it was still smelly with your body trapped between Goku's toe crotch.

Your body is pressed up against it as you start licking that wall of smelly, sweaty flesh. Your small tongue is barely able to lap up any sweat on the gargantuan sole, but Goku doesn\u2019t seem to care. Just the sight of you at his feet in such a pathetic state is enough to please him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to smell too. Let that foot odor take you over\u2026\u201d Goku grins as you obey him and take big whiffs of his raunchy foot. The smell almost makes you gag and you groan. Several seconds of licking and smelling later and your eyes are burning and tearing up. Goku\u2019s foot odor is just so powerful at your size, and the sweat you were being forced to lick up was making you pale and sick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going a pretty good job, shrimp.

The look on Goku\u2019s face isn\u2019t one of disappointment, but pure annoyance. As if a bug had just been found in the house and he was wondering how to deal with it. \u201cListen, shrimp.

When your little body is entire covered with foam, Goku rubs <br>\r\nyou in his armpit, just like a live soap. You can feel all the sweat and the stench of that place, being hit <br>\r\nby his thick hairs. The oil invades your body and you can't scape from the stench and the water torture.

You <br>\r\nexplores his big dick and even his ass hole, in a torment mixed with the irritation, reek and water. Then he <br>\r\nraises and rub you in every single part of his body.

You <br>\r\nthought your punish never will end, but then sudden, you felt for some reason, a strange warm in your body. <br>\r\nThen your tiny body begins to shine, just as a ray of hope. You feel how slowly your height grown and part by <br>\r\npart, your arms and legs take form. Goku dropped you in the water, watching how you becomes bigger and bigger.<br>\r\nYou thought that now you would be able to escape, but then, when you believes that you will recover your <br>\r\nnormal tall, the shine stopped. Sadly, you was still too small (no taller than a kid).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Oh no, what happened!? -you exclaim-. I'm taller than this...<br>\r\n-Woah, what does this mean?... you can change your size?<br>\r\n-No, this is not right... this still being a wrong height<br>\r\n-Well, i don\u2019t care; you still too small, so i will end with your punish.<br>\r\n-What?!<br>\r\n-Yeah, now i have a new plan for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith strength, he makes you fall on the floor of the bathroom. Then he walks to you, laughing and thinking in his new idea. You try to raise up and take the door, but then just appear the enormous Goku\u2019s dick in front of your eyes. It still flaccid, but even then was so big, at least for your little body. Without asking, he introduced his fingers in your mouth, <br>\r\nmaking open it. And then, you feel the big penis crossing your throat. Goku applies more pressure <br>\r\nuntil you swallow all of his large penis. Then, with the genital in your deepness, you feel how slowly <br>\r\ngrown inside of you. The veins around the dick, turns fat and alive, making the penis duplicate its <br>\r\nsize. The saiyain\u2019s cock begins to destroy all the cavity in your mouth, touching every part of the walls of the <br>\r\nthroat. Goku puts both hands in your nape and makes pressure, exclaiming: \u201cyes, that is... nice job shrimp, <br>\r\ndeeper\u201d... Your master forced you to sucks until his balls and you have to eat them in your mouth too. The <br>\r\npubic hair feels annoying between your tooth, but even trying to escape from the torture, the hands of Goku <br>\r\ndon\u2019t let you go and his legs are around your head. His dick makes bigger and bigger and you just can\u2019t breath or <br>\r\ncontain that enormous dick. Then with a violently gesture, Goku uses his hips to introduce every drop of <br>\r\nsemen in your throat. Its feels warm and sweet, with a strange sensation of syrup. You vomit part of it, but the <br>\r\nmostly you have to swallow for breath again. Then you see your master sitting on your chest, with an evil smile. He <br>\r\nused his dick to drawn with his sperm on your face, getting fun of your suffering. Then he raise and with his <br>\r\nfeet, he stepped on your head and draws again with the semen and his toes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t-Now you will obey. \u2013says, applying pressure.<br>\r\n\t-Yes... \u2013you stammered.<br>\r\n\t-Well,  guess i have to hurry, Chi chi will <br>\r\nbecomes mad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe goes out from the room, as your body lies down in the puddle of sperm, with no reactions. You can\u2019t move or talk. The punish was so hard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought you was alone, but then...</span></div></div>",

Until he lays down on his bed and his ballsack, with you attached to it, falls down. His large fleshy balls are on either sides of you forming a beanbag-like chair that your laying down on. His dick is straight above you, forming a roof as well as sandwiching you between his dick and his ballsack. His large member pins you down, against your whole body, from how large it is, you estimate that you can't be bigger than 1/2 inch. (I don't recall if it was previously stated) His penis looks 100 ft tall from your point of view. With his balls on both your sides you only choice is to shimmy downwards on your back or push his dick off you. \"There is no way I'm gonna push a FUCKING SKYSCRAPER off of me,\" you think outloud.

This movement provided you a release from the sweaty confines of Gohan's gi, as his left leg raised fresh air was able to enter the garment. The downside this movement was the fact that you were knocked flat on your back when he raised his leg, leaving you lying prone beneath a crack. Now with light flooding through his pant leg, you could see clearly the pucker nestled between the cheeks of his bubble butt.

So all you could do was stare at the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Giant then spoke \"HI, UM LITTLE GUY ARE YOU OKAY\", you had to cover your ears from the volume of the kid's voice even though he wasn't yelling, his normal voice alone made your eardrums want to explode. The kid's eyes widened when seeing you cover your ears and when realizing his voice caused he lowered it to a whisper \" oh sorry mister, I didn't mean to hurt you, oh here let me help you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan then moved his enormous finger right next to your ant sized body. His finger, which was his pinky, easily dwarfed you by 12 ft and for a second you thought he was going to crush you. You flinch but then see him stop and see a glow form around his finger. Your eardrums start to feel much better and now the ringing in them has stoped. \" Oh my god\"! Was the only thing you could say at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but just look in aww at the child and think that this is God, thee God from the bibal. His power, his muscular body, his Enormous size, and the fact that he healed you made you believe that this was God. The only thing that made you sceptical was the fact that this was a child, and when you thought of God, you would have always pictured a man. Still, you just went with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Giant locked on with your eyes and gave you a warm friendly smile \" are you felling better now sir\" you were lost in thought and did not answer causing the half sayian to look at you in worry. He then tried waving his hand in your face \" hello, mister are you all right\" he again got no response. Gohan was getting even more nervous and then he got an idea, he headed to the river next to him, grabbed the water and dumped it on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got you out of your trance and you then looked to see \"God\" looking at you with a big smile. Letting out a sigh, gohan, remembering to lower his voice tried talking to you again \" sir, are you okay\" you then looked at him and said \" oh, yes yes, thank you my Lord and savior\". Gohan's nerves went down and he let out a big wave of breath, hitting you and knocking you down in the process \" phwe, thank goddess I thought for a second you- wait did you just call me lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get on your knees and bow \" yes I did is that a problem\" \"God\" looked at you curiously with a hint of confusion in his eyes. You look up at him and say \" I'm sorry if that has offended you, should I call you God, your official name\". The boy's eye brows move up and he gives you a strange look. Your about to talk but your \"God\" interrupts you \" sir, are you ok, maybe I should get you a doctor?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan thinks about it and decides to try to tell this shrunken being that he was no God. He gives the man a kind smile, which he did to make sure that he wouldn't scare him and then spoke \" sir, I don't know if you hit your head to hard or if your scared, but for one, I'm no God, I'm just a kid, and two, don't worry I'm not gonna hurt you. The man looked at gonna again and because of Gohan's biology he had supervision, allowing him to see things that are really small. He sees the man start to laugh like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan's face turned to worry and he gently said \" mister are you\" then the man fell into unconscious. Gohan then let out a epp and looked around in panic. \" What am I gonna do, what am I gonna do, what am I gonna DO, WHAT AM I GONNA DO!\" Gohan checked the man or teenager now that he got a closer look, to see that he was still breathing. Gohan then thought an idea but there was one problem, his mother. \" if mom sees him, she'll freak out, got to hide hide him somewhere\". Gohan thought about some places and then looked at his rear. He looked at the boy and then at his butt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan, gave the kid a sympathetic look and said \" sorry little guy, can't have my mom finding you\". He then opened up his purple pants and dropped you in. His pants were tight so luckily the boys body was wedged in his cheek, making gohan shiver a little. He then walked, with his hips swaying from side to side, praying that his little passenger will be all right.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gohan felt guilty and quickly thought of an excuse to get out of the conversation \" I have to use the bathroom, sorry mom\". Gohan quickly ran to the bathroom and closed the door. He then opened his pants and grabbed his little friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenager from the look of his face started to scream, loud enough to the point that even chi chi could hear it. Gohan put his finger to the boys mouth and gave him a little shush. Gohan then whispered \" hey, take it easy ok, just breath slowly.\" The boy did and when he looked calm down enough Gohan put his finger away from the boy. Before they could say anything there was a knock \" Gohan, are you OK, do you need help\", Gohan looked at the door and quickly said \"no, I'm fine mom\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" then what was with the scream.\" Gohan replied with \" bad gas\" chi chi quickly said sorry and left, so her boy could do his business in peace. Gohan let out a sigh and looked back at his hand only to see the tiny boy gone. Gohan let out a shocked gasp and looked at the ground thinking he dropped him, but out of the corner of his eye he saw the boy on the counter running. Gohan was about to pick him up, but then figured he would only scare him more, so he decided to talk to him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThadd, the shrunken teen was looking for a way down the counter when the shadow of the humongous boy covered him. He looked behind and saw the boys head looking at him with a expressionist face. The Giant looked at him and whispered \" please, for the last time, I'm not going to hurt you, and I'm sorry for putting you in my, well you know, I just couldn't have my mom see you, she would flip out, he sighed, just come onto my hand and I will help you, OK.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan gave the little guy, the most charming smile he could give and Thadd couldn't help but trust the kid. With a smile and a voice so gentle, maybe this WAS a nice giant. So Thadd climbed into Gohan's hand and gohan being the ever so thoughtful boy, kept his palm open so his little passenger could get comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan couldn't help but chuckle a little, having someone so tiny on his hand felt Great. It felt like being a parent, except he was thousands of feet tall compared to the human in his hand. Gohan got to his room, shutting the door and sat down on his bed letting the shrunken teen be on his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, why don't you tell me about yourself.\"</span></div></div>",

The half sayian then kicked off both his shoes and plopped himself on the floor. He grabbed one of his feet and inspected its underside. A smirk crossed his face as he saw you glued to his sole, face first. Boy did you look pathetic\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you enjoy the ride?\u201d Gohan asks you before he grabs your head between two of his meaty fingers and lifts you to his gigantic face. You still didn\u2019t know much about this giant teen, but you could tell by looking at his arms and chest that he must have been pretty strong. He could probably squish your head like it was nothing\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026you look even younger then me. How old are you anyway, kid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t remember.\u201d you reply, avoiding eye contact with the intimidating sayian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t remember anything! I don\u2019t know my name, my age, or why I\u2019m this tiny! Nothing makes sense\u2026\u201d you start to sob while Gohan just stares at you. For a moment you hope that he feels pity for you, but that hope is stomped on and crushed when he starts barking with laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please! Do you honestly think I\u2019ll believe those crocodile tears? You\u2019re nothing but a lousy criminal and I\u2019m going to show you how I treat lousy criminals!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan brings you down to his floor and drops you. As you sit there, you watch as the giant gets to his feet and raises to his full height. He continues to look down at you sternly; not a speck of pity in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCriminals are getting younger everyday. It\u2019s a real shame.\u201d Gohan says to himself as he folds his arms over his chest and glares down at you. \u201cI don\u2019t care how old you are! No one tries to hurt my family and gets away unscathed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t know how to respond. You don\u2019t even know what to think. Was Gohan right about all this? Were you just some lowlife criminal that deserved to be punished? No, that couldn\u2019t be! You weren\u2019t a bad person\u2026were you? There was no way to be sure\u2026argg, this was so confusing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you didn\u2019t have much time to decide who you were, as the familiar pressure once again came down on you and pressed you against the floor. Gohan had casually stepped on you and was now rolling you under the ball of his foot. You screamed for him to stop, but the giant teenager was showing no mercy. In his eyes, bad guys like you were scum. He always wanted  to punish a criminal himself, and now he\u2019d have the chance. He continued to roll you under his foot, bathing you in warm sweat. You could only close your eyes while enduring the smell and humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of this, Gohan finally lifted his foot off you and allowed you to breath fresh air. You were sprawled out on the floor, gasping for air and covered from head to toe with male sweat. You weakly stared up at Gohan and wondered if that was the end of your punishment. As you would soon find out; your punishment was just starting. </span></div></div>",

But as you looked to your left you saw the king lay dead against a wall with a bleeding hole through his heart. You also didn't see Frieza anywhere, but being the DBZ buff that you were, you knew he had been chopped up into pieces and blown away by Trunks. You noticed he had transformed back from Super Saiyan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you felt a warm hand engulf your torso.

Your fears turned out to be true, however, when Trunks lowered his hand to his boot and quickly dropped you into the leather boot.

If you could reach the end of the boot, you might have a chance. Unfortunately, you were just too small and slow to escape the older male\u2019s gargantuan foot. You watched the toes pass you overhead as trunks pinned you under the ball of his foot.

You got a nose full of the sweat lingering at the bottom of the footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, you could make out the voices of several DBZ characters. Most of them were praising trunks and congratulating him on his victory. It was an important moment in Dragonball history and you wished you could see it first hand. Instead, you had to listen to their muffled voices while being kept secretly under the moist foot of the newcomer. You tried to scream, hoping one of them would hear you, but was quickly silenced by Trunks who put some pressure on you.

As he begins walking again, however, the raunchy smell overcomes you and you pass out between Trunk's slick and sweaty toes.<br>\r\nYou awake again as the footsteps weaken and realize you have come to a complete stop.

He placed both his bare feet flat on the floor directly in front of you and flashed you a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s the deal, bug boy: I have ten toes that have been stuck in my footwear for days. I want you to lick out the toejam from between each and every one of them.\u201d Trunks commanded, wiggling his toes in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! But--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts! You will do as I say or I\u2019ll squash you between my toes instead. You want that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, sir!\u201d You yelled up at him, getting the message and running over to the first set of toes on his right foot. Trunks spread his toes for you and you got your first glimpse of his toe funk. It looked repulsive and you were going to lick it up? You stared at the filth for a few seconds, hoping Trunks would say he was just joking. Instead, the young time traveler grew irritated with your stalling and tapped his left foot against the floor. The tremors created from the simple movement threw you off balance and you fell face-first into the toejam. Trunks gripped your body tightly with his toes, intending not to release you until you did our job. Giving in to the giant, you stuck your tongue out and lapped up the gunk. Your tongue quickly felt like it was burning and your stomach, which was receiving the \u201cfood\u201d, didn\u2019t like it either. After a minute or so you had finished and Trunks released you so you could move onto the next space. You reluctantly did so and repeated the process. These two toes contained even more toe cheese than the other two, but you could only obey your master and lick it all up. You cleaned out this cleavage; six more to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued with your job, you started to catch quick glances at your surroundings. You appeared to be in a bed room somewhere. You saw a bed, dresser, a door, and a couple windows. The shades were closed so you couldn\u2019t tell if it was night or day. Looking up at Trunks, you noticed he had removed his jacket at some point. He was now only wearing his black muscle shirt, which clung to his body and showed off his defined torso and arms. The son of Vegeta was resting the back of his head on his arms and had his eyes closed. You didn\u2019t think he was sleeping, so escaping would probably turn out bad for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you had reached his other foot, the task became less trouble for you. Was it because these toes happened to carry less toejam than the others, or were you starting to get use to the smell and taste? Nonetheless, you breezed through the remaining spaces between Trunk\u2019s toes. Finally done, you pulled yourself out of Trunk\u2019s sweaty toes and collapsed on your back. Your body was covered in a mix of Trunk\u2019s perspiration and your own. When Trunks felt you stopped licking, he looked down and smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice job, squirt. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d pull through. Ready for some more fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d you weakly mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t catch that, sorry.

Trunks opened his mouth wide and dangled you over it, laughing at your erratic movements. He finally dropped you in and clamped his mouth shut. His tongue lapped over you, causing all his saliva to cover you completely. After about two minutes, he pulled you out and asked \"did you enjoy your bath, bitch?\" <br>\r\nWithout waiting he dropped you on his now dry, yet still smelly sock.<br>\r\n\"Im gonna need you dry if youre gonna do well in the next challenge...\" he said evilly. After patting you dry with the musky sock, he removed his black muscle shirt to reveal a sweaty torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for my rank pits, kid?\" he asked. Without waiting for a reply, he shoved you into his left armpit. The rank odor immediately overcame you, as you tried to scream. This only made it worse, as all of the sweat and stink from his armpit was forced into your mouth. Trunks clamped tightly to make sure you couldnt escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for the work out slave?\" He whispered to you, hoping youd realize how much sweatier his pit would become after a good work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe work out seemed to last forever, as you merely sat there aborbing Trunks' pit sweat.

Then what seemed like an earthquake to you, as Trunks dropped on his butt to the floor. He took off his left boot, then his right, with a ginormous sigh of relief. He was wearing socks this time, which clung to his soaked feet and looked dingy and gray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wiggled his socked toes as he stretched out his legs to extend his sweaty clothed feet to you. His feet were on either side of you now. So much heat, so much smell it made you feel queasy, all from this teenage super saiyan's raunchy toes. He flexed his socked toes. \"Come on kid, don't make this harder than it has to be...Be a good slave and smell my feet.\" Trunks grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smell them!? W-Wouldn't you rather have a massage?\" You stutter. You can already smell the scent of his overworked saiyan feet, and by all means you do not wanna smell them of your own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks' grin grew wider. \"Nope....Get sniffing runt!\" Trunks ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and dragged your feet towards his giant left foot. Apparently you were taking too much time for the giant, and he proceeded to scoot his foot closer and closer to you until your face unknowingly touched his sock. You were given quite a shock at this, and unfortunately took a breath through your nose. You doubled over and gagged as Trunks laughed loudly above. It was horrendous, but you knew he couldn't have bathed at all during the long trip from his time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good enough,\" Trunks snarled as he scooted his feet closer, \"I want three sniffs each foot. Then you can take off my socks and lick my bare soles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked at how cruel the son of Vegeta was. First sniffing his socked feet, then licking the sweaty bare soles!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever your will to live was more valuable to you than foolish pride, so you sighed and re approached the sock.</span></div></div>",

You still have another foot to sniff\u2026then you gotta lick \u2018em!\u201d Trunks reminded you while he flexed his socked toes in anticipation. You wobbled over to his other foot and leaned against it. It\u2019s soft material gave you some comfort, but you knew it wouldn\u2019t last as you took the first deep sniff. You felt some sock fuzz clog your nose and you started to sneeze, trying to get it out. Maybe smelling it that close wasn\u2019t a good idea. You gave the sock two more sniffs from a safer distance so only the smell entered your nose. It was more than enough to turn your face green and make you want to vomit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job, runt. Now you have to pull my socks off so we can get to the licking!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced over at Trunks enormous feet and then back at Trunks face. He wasn\u2019t really expecting you to take his socks off\u2026was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, you can do it. You look like a strong kid. Here, I\u2019ll make it easier.\u201d Trunks stated as he pulled both his socks down to his heels. The rest you would have to do. You hesitated for a moment before making you way toward one of his feet and gripping the end of his sock tightly. Taking a deep breath (complete with foot odor) you pulled with all your might. It was like pulling a cart full of boxes full of concrete bricks! You could do it, but was incredibly difficult and you were making slow progress. After pulling the sock a couple inches off, he were forced to let go and caress your arms. It felt like you were going to pull them off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake your time, I got all day.\u201d Trunks said as he rested his chin on his knuckles. You took a few minutes to rest before you continued to pull he sock off. The rank odor of his feet didn\u2019t make the job any easier, but you knew it had to be done or else you were dead meat. After a while and a few more breaks, you gave the sock one last tug before it slipped off the giant\u2019s toes. You were flung backwards and the sock covered your entire body. Trunks laughed hysterically as he watched you try to escape from under his sock. Not wanting you to suffocate under his odorous footwear, he plucked the sock off you to reveal your panting and fuzz covered body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s one sock, little man. One more to go.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned in pain as you forced yourself off the floor and toward Trunks\u2019 remaining socked foot. Since the last ordeal had sapped your strength, it took twice as long and twice as many breaks until you had this sock off. Not wanting a repeat of before, you pulled this sock off slowly and carefully as to not become trapped under it. Once it was off, you fell onto your back to rest. Your body was covered in your own sweat and your arms were useless for the time being. You were glad Trunks didn\u2019t want a foot rub\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice job, kid. Now for the licking.\u201d Trunks placed both his bare feet next to you and wiggled his toes tauntingly. You wanted to protest and beg Trunks for a respite, but one glance at the titan make you bite your tongue. The sight of his shirtless, godly form towering over you was far too intimidating. One wrong word and he might smash you into a pulp with his finger! You had no choice but to obey, forgetting your pride. </span></div></div>",

Now instead of those boring old action figures , I have a real live tiny guy to play with!\u201d Trunks said reaching a massive hand to you.<br>\r\nYou were in shock, so it was HIM who did this to you!? Of all people it was Trunks!?

What else would you be? But I guess you need some training so you get used to me.\u201d <br>\r\nYou yelled up at Trunks the whole way to his room, which was messy and filled with toys. You knew from watching the show that this kid was spoiled rotten, you would much rather be in the hands of someone gentle and kind like Goku. <br>\r\nTrunks sat down on his bedroom floor with you in his lap. You glared up at the titanic kid as he got comfortable.  He kicked his boots off, revealing two dingy, sweat soaked socks.

Once I was at the park, and a dog was pissing on a tree. Mom said that was how dogs marked things with their smell to let other dogs know that it was theirs. Goten is always wanting to play with my stuff, maybe if I mark you with MY scent he\u2019ll know to stay away from you!  Hehe!\u201d Trunks chuckled evilly as he stripped off his socks, revealing two very linty and very sweaty bare feet.<br>\r\nTrunks wiggled his bare toes as he placed you down at his feet,  the smell got considerably stronger once you were close to them. As those big plump toes wiggled overhead, bits of wet lint fell on your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew this was going to be hellish\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was wearing a red, sleeveless gi with the Turtle School's emblem on the chest. You didn't want to get stepped on but your legs wouldn't move, you were in awe at the young man before you. Luckily his foot passed over your head and he sat down on a bench behind you. <br>\r\n\u201cWhew\u2026.I did my best\u2026.But I guess that Hero (Shen for you subbies <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> ) guy was stronger than he looked.\u201d Yamcha said to himself.  However, you couldn\u2019t help but see the faintest hint of regret in his eyes. Regret that he wouldn\u2019t even be runner up, he\u2019d never have beat Goku though. <br>\r\nHe always was a greedy one that Yamcha, his thief days may have been behind him, but he would never outgrow his love for money. <br>\r\nWhile you were thinking these thoughts, you failed to notice that Yamcha\u2019s eyes were locked directly on you. Lucky for you, you were just large enough to be noticed as a small human instead of for a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Yamcha said as he checked to make sure no one was looking, and swiped you off the floor. <br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey!\u201d You yelled in surprise as you were lifted up to Yamcha\u2019s boyish face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026.Are you for real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! I\u2019m a person!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026.a tiny person. Wait\u2026.This is too weird. I bet you could fit under my shoe!\u201d Yamcha said, and decided to do just that! He set you on the ground before him, and pinned you underneath his shoe. \u201cAck! Get off me! This hurts!\u201d <br>\r\nYamcha grinned, he got another idea. He had always wanted someone to wait on him hand and foot. And Puar wasn\u2019t gonna do it obviously, besides Puar was his friend, he wasn\u2019t gonna do that to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like you fit the bill though! Yamcha smirked as he lifted his shoe off you and picked you up lightning fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha flicked his long hair out of his face, \u201cHmph\u2026screw this joint. I\u2019ve found something much more interesting!\u201d <br>\r\nYamcha stuffed you into his pocket and caught a cab home. Nobody knew where he\u2019d went, but assumed he was sore for losing and decided not to stay and watch the rest of the 23rd WMAT<br>\r\nOnce Yamcha was at the hotel where they were staying, he went into his room, placing a do not disturb sign on the door knob. <br>\r\nYamcha took you out of his pocket and placed you on his chest as he lay down on the comfortable bed. You were a bit shook up from the way you were being treated, wasn\u2019t Yamcha supposed to be a Z Fighter? A good guy? <br>\r\nAs you felt Yamcha\u2019s chest rise and fall beneath your body, he suddenly sat up and you tumbled onto his crotch. \u201cHeheheh\u2026And you haven\u2019t even bought me flowers or anything yet!\u201d Yamcha guffawed. <br>\r\nYou blushed as Yamcha leaned forward and began to fiddle with something out of your sight, he sighed a long sigh after he was done, and a foul smell reached your nostrils. \u201cMy feet are soo tired after all that fighting at the 23rd, think you could help me with that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamcha grinned as he plucked you off his crotch and tossed you to the end of the bed, where his very smelly and very sweaty and overworked feet were waiting and wiggling.<br>\r\nYou landed between Yamcha\u2019s feet, you looked on both sides of you. There was a sweaty sole to the left, and a sweaty sole to the right.

Start rubbing, little man!\u201d Yamcha commanded as he relaxed back on the bed with his muscular arms folded behind his head. You continued to stand there, glaring up at the larger man. Your fists were clenched with anger. If he thought you were just going to be pushed around, he had another thing coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I won\u2019t rub your gross feet! Get someone else to do it; I\u2019m out of here if you aren\u2019t going to help me.\u201d you shouted at him, surprising the older man a bit. You turned your back to the giant and waltzed on over to the edge of the bed. Hopefully you\u2019d be able to slide down the comforter and be on your way. You never got that far, however, because you suddenly found yourself in the middle of a shadow. Before you could even turn around, something huge and smelly slammed into your back and forced you flat on your stomach. The large object, which was Yamcha\u2019s foot, smushed you into the soft bedding and made you yelp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, lil fella! You can\u2019t just walk away after I told you to do something.\u201d Yamcha chuckled and, with you still pinned under his sweaty sole, dragged you away from the edge of the bed. \u201cDo you know what I could do to you, little man? I could crush you like a bug just for saying no to me\u2026or maybe make a little snack out of you!\u201d The young Z Fighter grinned and slapped his hard stomach with one of his hands. This made you cry out in fear and squirm harder, not wanting to end up a snack for this man\u2019s gut. Yamcha picked his foot off his bed and brought it to his handsome face. You were stuck to the mighty sole thanks to all the sweat; a sight that made Yamcha laugh hysterically. After getting control over himself again, Yamcha peeled you off his foot and dangled you in front of his face. \u201cI won\u2019t do that just yet, though. This is a rare opportunity and I want to make the most out of it! Instead I think I\u2019ll, just this once, rub my feet myself\u2026but using you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t really understand what the giant martial artist meant, but you soon found out when he brought you over to sole you had just been smothered by. Before you knew it you were smashed against the damp, hot foot and rubbed face fist into it. Your muffed shouts were ignored as the much larger male used his meaty hand to drag you back and forth along his overworked foot. You squirmed and wiggled, but Yamcha\u2019s fingers made sure to keep you in your place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh\u2026that feels good\u2026\u201d Yamcha spoke as he rubbed you over the top of his foot. The skin of the foot was solid like a rock and the muscles underneath were full of power. You imaged all the people Yamcha must of kicked in the face with them and now you were getting up close and personal with them. It didn\u2019t hurt as much as being kicked in the face, but it sure wasn\u2019t comfortable. The sweat and heat of the foot washed over you, dampening your clothes and burning your nostrils. You groaned for him to stop, but he only tossed your minuscule body into his other hand so he could work on the other foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was Yamcha doing this? Didn\u2019t he see you as a human? A human child, for that matter? Who knew the guy was cruel enough to take advantage of someone\u2019s size like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust think, little man. If you had obeyed me, you would of only had to touch my foot with your hands. Now you\u2019re getting the full treatment! Bet you wish you hadn\u2019t been so na\u00efve, eh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular young fighter bellowed with laughter as he dragged you over his heel. You weren\u2019t squirming anymore, already seeing how futile it was. Yamcha was already superhuman to begin with; you didn\u2019t stand a chance of fighting back at your pathetic size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you make a pretty good sweat rag, little man.\u201d Yamcha said as he brought you up to his face. Your body was weak from the exposure to his smelly feet, but you were still conscious and capable of listening to him. \u201cI think I\u2019ll do this again sometime. In fact\u2026\u201d Yamcha grinned deviously. \u201cMy feet aren\u2019t as sweaty as they used to be, but they\u2019re still pretty hot. How about you cool them down with\u2026say\u2026your tongue! Yeah!\u201d Yamcha giggled like a little kid as he imagined you licking his big feet. \u201cIf you don\u2019t\u2026I\u2019ll keep using you as a sweat rag. The rest of me is still pretty sweaty!\u201d To prove this to you, Yamcha raised his free arm over his head to expose his glistening, hairy armpit. Your eyes widened as you realized he was threatening to put you in there if you refused again. He wouldn\u2019t do that\u2026not Yamcha. He was a good guy! Using you to rub his feet was just an unfunny joke\u2026he wouldn\u2019t put you in that stinky hell\u2026right?</span></div></div>",

You take a moment to survey your surroundings; it appears you\u2019re both in a dingy, dimly lit apartment. 17 is probably hiding out here while he uses the world as his playground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, bud, here\u2019s the deal,\u201d he says firmly to you, not raising his voice. You snap to attention. \u201cYou do what I want, when I want, how I want it done, no questions asked, and you\u2019ll speak only when I say you can.

With your small, fragile body gripped in his strong hand, 17 maneuvered you behind him. You could only watch as you were carried to the rim of 17\u2019s blue jeans and with a thrust you were being shoved underneath them. You couldn\u2019t help but grunt in discomfort as the larger male forced your form behind his tight jeans and boxers. The cruel boy didn\u2019t even bother to loosen his belt to make it easier; he wanted you to suffer as much as possible. After about a minute 17 had finally gotten you tucked where he wanted you. He pulled his hand free of his pants and looked behind him with a sly smirk. A small, human shaped bulge was visible on his left butt cheek; moving ever so slightly. \u201cThere we go, just where a bitch like you belongs. Now\u2026be a good bitch and kiss my ass.\u201d Barely giving you enough time to process the command, 17 reached behind him once more and pressed two fingers against your back. You once again grunted in agony as the mighty android pressed your body deeper into his warm, muscular ass. The pressure just two of his fingers was putting on you was life threatening; you were gonna be crushed already! Not wanting that to happen you quickly puckered up and gave 17\u2019s bare, hairless ass a kiss. As soon as your lips touched his skin the giant android chuckled and removed his digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky boy. It took you four whole seconds to follow my command; I was gonna crush you on the fifth.\u201d The partially cybernetic giant folded his arms across his chest and stood there while you got to work. With your body still being crushed into his butt via his tight clothing, you repeatedly kissed your new master\u2019s ass again and again. You could barely move, so you had to kiss the same spots multiple times, but this didn\u2019t seem to bother 17. No matter where you kissed, you got a nice taste of the young man\u2019s ass sweat. A couple minutes of this passed before 17 got bored of standing around and decided to move. You knew immediately because the firm butt cheek you were pinned against rubbed against the boxers each time the giant took a step. This meant you too were given a painful rubdown, but you tried to endure it and kept on kissing. You didn\u2019t want to stop for even a moment or risk angering the impatient cyborg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the walking only lasted a short while. Unfortunately, 17 immediately followed this by sitting down. Pain shot through your tiny, weak form as 17 sat down on the couch. You felt his godly weight press down; your limbs spread outward and unable to move an inch. You couldn\u2019t even move your face anymore as it was pressed into the android\u2019s sweaty skin; your lips now permanently kissing it. Outside, 17 took a sip from a can of soda and flipped through some channels on the small television in front of him. Occasionally he would \u201creadjust\u201d his position; bouncing his ass a bit on the couch cushion or rubbing it from side to side. Every motion brought more pain as your normal human body was pushed to its limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how does it feel, pipsqueak? Being under another man\u2019s ass and kissing it?\u201d 17 asked as his eyes never left the TV screen; he wouldn\u2019t even give you the honor of his full attention. \u201cIf you want to live you won\u2019t utter one complaint. Unless you want me to find another slave to clean your remains off my ass, that is.\u201d The male android laughed, amused with himself, before relaxing back and enjoying the power he had over you. </span></div></div>",

The massive pressure that had been forcing your lips against the flesh of his ass lightened, and you were able to pull away for a time. The discomfort and rubbing starts as you realize he\u2019s walking again, and it\u2019s a considerably longer walk than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s no way for you to tell, but 17 has left the apartment and is going to his (stolen) car in the parking lot. It would be much easier and quicker for the cyborg to just fly to his destination; the only reason he isn\u2019t is because it\u2019s more torturous for you to be pressed between a car seat and his sweaty backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, although 17 hasn\u2019t said anything yet, you know instinctively that you\u2019ve already gone far too long without pleasuring him. To change things up just a bit, you switch from kissing his cheek to licking it, which he seems to find satisfactory. You\u2019re soon pressed flat against 17\u2019s skin for a second time as he fires up his car and drives to the video arcade for some amusement. You try to move your tongue to continue licking, or at least to avoid giving the android the impression you\u2019re slacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a torturous ride, you finally get to the arcade; 17 gets out and starts walking yet again before he stops at last in front of a machine. You lick his ass with extra vigor as soon as the motion stops, hoping to keep your master in a good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t really hear it, but something moves inside 17\u2019s stomach after a while. He\u2019s only partially cybernetic after all, and has a working digestive system\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As 17 pounded away at the arcade machine he suddenly felt some movement deep within him followed by a gurgle from his stomach. The young, cruel man knew what this heralded and it made his lips curve into a smirk. You were still being a good lil bitch as you licked away at his ass, but you were about to find out 17 didn\u2019t reward good behavior. You were simply keeping yourself alive so he could bring more horrors into your pitiful life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes passed and 17 felt an uncomfortable pressure in his rectum. A respectable person would run to the bathroom for some privacy or at least go outside, but this android didn\u2019t give a fuck. Without looking away from his game, the teenage menace slightly lifted his left leg. At the same time you heard what sounded like air hissing nearby. It was 17 passing a silent fart, but you didn\u2019t know this until the stench came your way. Not only did the putrid odor of the fart pour into your nostrils, but it made its way into your mouth as well. Instantly your eyes rolled into the back of your head and your shrunken body started convulsing. The horrifying smell of the gas was amplified tremendously due to your tiny size; you were finding it difficult to hold onto sanity as 17\u2019s fart dominated your senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed and the gas within the cyborg\u2019s pants finally seemed to be dissipating\u2026until the giant man lifted his leg once more and ripped a second fart. This one was certainly not silent as almost everyone in the room turned to look at 17. The black haired sadist showed no embarrassment or anything; he just continued to press the keys of the arcade machine like nothing had happened. Meanwhile, behind his tight jeans, you were once again suffering an odorous hell. An odorous hell that smelled of rotten eggs! In an effort to keep out the stench you pushed your face against 17\u2019s ass. You would much rather smell his sweaty bare ass than his digestive gasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! If you\u2019re gonna do that, go somewhere else!\u201d shouted another customer; a young man that looked around 17\u2019s age. The android\u2019s only response was a second-long glare to the loudmouth. The nasty glare was enough to make the man gulp and quickly turn back to his own machine. When 17 looked back at his, however, he was met with the Game Over screen. It was the fifth time the words decorated his screen and he had had it. His reaction time was superhuman, but this game was a cheating bastard. All interest lost, Android 17 drew back his leg and kicked the game machine. The single blow obliterated the machine, as well as the wall behind it. As everyone around him gaped in disbelief, 17 casually made his way to the exit. Before leaving, however, the teen released one more loud fart into the building before disappearing from sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later 17 was back in the driver\u2019s seat of his car, but before he turned it on he got an idea. He leaned forward and reached a hand into the back of his pants; feeling around for your miniscule form. You were still weak and disoriented from the last fart, so you didn\u2019t see the giant\u2019s hand coming for you. When those thick fingers finally touched you, however, you couldn\u2019t help but breathe a sigh of relief. Was he finally taking you out of this hellhole? </span></div></div>",

As you looked up at 17 with his menacing smile, and he at you with your terrified floating form, you started to get an idea of what this giant had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, an <i>idea</i>. The reality was that he was going to make this a tad worse than the scenario your imagination had cooked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n17 retreated from the bathroom and a short time later you heard the refrigerator door open. Following its closure was the sound of a microwave starting up. A couple minutes after it shut off, the sadist returned, holding a plate with three tacos. A fourth was already in his hand and was being chewed on. It looked really good, all dressed up like it was, but the cyborg had a look of disgust on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, I hate old taco meat. But it certainly has a way of helping a guy through boring afternoons. Especially when he's got someone to share the ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sinking heart you realized this cyborg's game. And you could see in his eyes that he knew that you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, bud,\" he said as his gullet sucked down the first taco completely, You didn't think I was going easy on you at day one, did you? I mean, I can take my sister's jabs and insults, but I can't have her thinking I've gone soft, can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you didn't respond, his face hardened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I?\" he asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you answered weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right,\" he said, moving on to the second poor taco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited in terror as he down the second. When he started on the third, a monstrous gurgle came from his stomach. He clutched it in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, am I gonna have to start this thing early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited, and another, more thunderous gurgle broke the silence. He doubled over slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" Holding the plate with the two surviving tacos in one hand, he used the other to grab the back of his pants and boxers an yank them down just enough to expose his bare ass. He sat on the toilet immediately, cutting off all light. The first thing you heard was a deep, resounding, wet trumpet of a fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPTTTTTTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n17's reaction was a mixture of a chuckle and a sigh. Then he grunted. \"Hnnngg...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world was suddenly consumed by a brown spray that stank to high heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, jeez!\" 17 eclaimed, pulling his pants further down so as to spread his legs, \"I ate a little too much this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SPPLOOOOOOOOOORRRRPPPPPTTT SPPRRRRRTT SPPPPRRRRRTTT</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spray turned into a downpour, and from a downpour into a waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack, this burns!\" the giant whined, \"Never mind going easier on <b>you</b>, I should have gone easier on myself. Ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n17 continued to eat and shit, and soon...</span></div></div>",

Speaking of which of which you saw the purple furred anthro cat laying underneath a large tree which you assumed might that he was taking a nap at the moment. You knew that the lightly muscled cat might be able to help you get back to a normal size since you knew that you must have shrunk since you knew that if you got close him that the giant cat would truly look like a deity compared to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you started to walk through the grass towards the sleeping god. But while you did this you quickly came to a stop since you remembered that Lord Beerus oculd get anger very quickly.

If you would him up would the purple furred cat be anger with you and just kill you then and there? On the other hand though maybe he might actually feel sorry for you and try to help you. Or maybe if he couldn't maybe you could just stay with him and Whis, who you noticed didn't seem to be around at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breathe of air before you nodded your head and decided on what you were going to do.

But while you looked around at these similar and yet somehow different forest like area you failed to notice that you were engulfed by a large shadow. And once you did realize this you quickly turned around and saw a giant sized (to you at least in current size) dark furred anthro wolf who was wearing a red scarf around his neck. Along with this you saw some tape like bandages wrapped around his arms like what he had seen other fighters do in the real world. He also was wearing a belt with black pants and brown shoes. This made you realize that you the person in front of you was none other then Universe's 9 Bergamo of the Trio De Dangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing this you found yourself swallowing a lump in your throat as you looked up past his well muscled body which was covered in a lighter blue color fur which went up to his face. And when you looked at his yellow eyes you saw that he was giving a curious look when he said out loud to himself, \"What is a tiny human doing out here? And further more how did he get so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Actually I'd like to know that myself. Because one minute I was in my room at home. And then suddenly I showed up here, and from the looks of it I've somehow shrunk too.\" You replied, before you were grabbed by the blue furred wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this happened this happened you slowly brought up until you close to Bergamo's face. You then saw him give you a confident grin as he told you, \"Well young man, I can't really figure out how this might have happened to you either. However, it would be against my better judgement to just leave you here alone. So you'll be coming with me. But do not worry for as long as you're with Bergamo, The Crusher, you'll be safe from any enemies you might have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did your best not to jump with joy upon hearing Bergamo say that you'd be safe with him. However, you then remembered about his two younger brothers. However, you didn't want to say something that might cause the well muscled anthro fighter to not turst you. And so you worded your question carefully when you asked, \"Say Bergamo, I don't mean to pry. But do you live by yourself? Or do you live with other people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he answered your question you felt Bergamo stand up to full height while move his fingers closer to you so that you would remain in his open palm.

Although in the back of your mind you tried to remain calm as from the anime you knew that when Bergamo told his younger brothers soemthing both Lavender and Basil listened to him. But what if the blue furred anthro wolf had to leave to go somewhere? Whad would happen then. Although you suddenly found yourself putting those worries to the side when you found yourself being pushed against the wolf well muscled chest when you hear him jump into the air and then fly off to wherever his brothers were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as your surroundings were nothing but darkness you heard the wolf's voice when he said, \"Apologizes for shoving you into my chest like this, little human. But I'd rather not risk losing you while I fly to where I and my brothers are staying at right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that you really couldn't answer the wolf. And evne if you did you knew that he must likely wouldn't have been able to make it out that well. So you decided to just wait until he landed which actually happened to be within a few minutes. And once he had landed you felt Bergamo slowly move you away from his chest to which you found yourself blushing from being so close to the wolf fighter's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this thought was quickly moved to the side when you heard two voices as they called out in unison, \"Big bro, you're finally back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon hearing this you looked and saw two other anthro wolves heading your way. Once was covering in golden fur with only some white fur on the bottom part of his muzzle and some white fur fluff that covered his chest who was wearing overalls that you knew was Lavender. And right next to him was Basil since he was covered in red fur with some white fur on the bottom part of his muzzle along with some fur fluff that looked like a goatee of sorts and the middle part of his midsection. You also knew it was him since he wasn't wearing that much clothing other then a pair of boots, gloves, and cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once they had landed in front of their eldest brother you saw their golden eyes fall onto you while Basil asked, \"Hey Bro, what's with that little human in your hand there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why'd you bring him back with you?\" Lavender spat out, with a hint of annoyance in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This small human is in my hand because he needs to be protected. And I brought him back with me because I offered to care for him until a way was figured out to return him to his normal size.\" Bergamo answered back, with a serious expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that right? So are we going to have to go get those Super Dragon Balls from the sixth and seventh universes then?\" The red anthro wolf pondered, while he crossed his arms over his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To your surprise you heard the blue furred wolf let out a chuckle before he replied, \"You know what, that's exactly what we're going to do. At least two of us will do taking part in that mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only two of us? Why don't all three of us go and just leave the human here by himself?\" The golden furred wolf remarked, to which you saw him glare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your relief though this did not go unnoticed by the leader of the Trio De Dangers as he told both of his younger brothers, \"Don't glare at this human like that, Lavender! Because like I said his under not only my protect, but all threes of us. And no matter which one of us is chosen to stay behind with him. I expect him to be treated gently and with care. Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand, brother.\" Both Basil and Lavender replied at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had done this you then found yourself looking up at Bergamo when he asked you, \"So now that we have a plan set the only thing left is for you to decide which one of the three of us will be caring for you human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I understand.\" You let out, as you placed a hand underneath you chin to think things. And after taking a few minutes to think over all of the pros and cons (along with keeping in mind of which one of the Trio De Dangers was your favorite) you looked up at Bergamo and added, \"I think I'd like to be taken care of by......</span></div></div>",

But maybe along with that the little human wants to live his life on the edge too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright aht's enough you two!\" The eldest brother snapped, which caused the two to lose their grins in an instant.

But after staring at the giant fox for a moment you found yourself widening in shock upon realizing that Majora from Universe 4 was standing in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, since you knew that he was blind you wondering how he knew that you had shrunk. This prompted you to think a bit fore you asked him, \"Excuse me, but how did you know that I had shrunk? Can you see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you heard the anthro fighter let out a light chuckle before he replied, \"No, of course I cannot see you for I had lost my eyesight a long time ago. However, I was able to determine that you were smaller then the average human since my ears heard the sound of small footsteps. And your scent was not as strong due to your smaller size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. I-I'm sorry about asking such a question.\" You told Majora as he walked up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he did this you watched him sit down in front of you while he dismissed your comment with a wave of his right hand when he remarked, \"Please don't worry about it. For that is the normal question I get asked upon meeting new people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that makes me feel a little better.\" You replied, before you saw the giant fennec fox was.....</span></div></div>",

Fullmetal Alchemist, one of his favorite anime, was being remade into another anime series. It was still a few months away, but you could only jump for joy. To celebrate this event, you decided to dig out your Fullmetal Alchemist DVD collection and watch the series from scratch. Unfortunately, your return trip from lala land was greeted by the realization that you had knocked over the computer screen in your joy. Cursing, you picked it up and checked to see if it was still working. It wasn't. You cursed again and tried hitting it, like your dad always did. The screen flickered and you thought you'd fixed it, until a loud buzzing noise and flashing multi-colored lights told you otherwise. The display made your head hurt and soon you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up leaning against something. It felt hard and rough, like a shoe. You soon realized it was a shoe. Jumping back in surprise, you took notice to the giant room around you and the figure that stood just above you. At just two inches tall, the figure looked like a god to you. Pass the giant's legs and chest, you discovered it was...</span></div></div>",

He wasn't wearing his usual red coat, only the black shirt that was usually under it. The giant teen had an annoyed expression on his face, something that didn't come as a surprise to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al, did you find it yet? At this rate the store will close!\" he yelled into the room next-door. A younger, more gentle voice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute. I know you left your wallet somewhere around here. Why don't you look for it?\" You recognized the voice as Ed's younger brother, Alphonse. \"Aw, found it! You left it in your dirty pants pocket.\" The door swung open and the human form of the Elric brother walked in with a leather wallet in his hand. You wondered why he was human and not a suit of armor, but didn't ponder the answer for very long. When Ed's brother walked in, Ed swung his foot around and unnoticeably bumped you with his shoe. The light impact set you flying several feet (to you) away from the Elric brothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, Al. Just take it over to the grocery store and pick up a few things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I have to go, big brother? It was my turn last time, plus it's Sunday.\" he wined. \"You know it's going to be really busy and I'll be gone for hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your head after it hit the wooden floor hard and gazed up at the two brothers. They were both facing each other and you could compare their titanic sizes. Despite being a year younger, you noticed that Al was taller by a few inches. \"I know, but after the incidence last month I don't think they want to see me for awhile...you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlphonse only rolled his eyes and mouthed a silent reply before leaving with the money. Ed waited until his brother was gone before falling onto the couch and relaxing. There was nothing like a couple hours of pure relaxation. Ed's eyes suddenly looked over at your direction while you stared into those golden orbs that you believed were staring at you. </span></div></div>",

Only when he got up from his seat and crouched down in front of the object did he find out it was a tiny human around his age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, what the hell?\" Edward eyes gave you a curious stare that you somehow found intimidating. Maybe it was his face being so close, who knows. It definitely wasn't a normal sight. You only raised your hand slowly and mumbled a hello. The alchemist neither responded nor gave any indication that he heard you. Instead, his auto mail arm came around and pinched the back of your shirt. He then stood up to his full height and brought your little form in front of his handsome face. He grinned slyly as he looked at you. \"Looks like you're having a bad day. Feeling a bit <i>small?</i>\" You gave him an angry glare, but again he seemed to ignore you except for dropping you onto the palm of his human hand. \"So what's your story? Some accident with alchemy or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried telling him your story and how you got here, not really thinking that the teen probably wouldn't understand what you were talking about. But once again Ed was seemingly focused more on the fact that he had a shrunken human in his hand then anything said shrunken human had to say. Evil and sinister thoughts flooded Ed's mind...he just felt like being a bit <i>bad</i>. His thoughts were shown in his grinning face, which only made you frightened.  </span></div></div>",

The sound of the boot making contact with the floor distracted you for a moment, so you didn\u2019t see Ed slip of his sock with a quick motion. When you turned your head back to the giant teen, you saw the sight of Ed\u2019s gigantic sole coming down on you. You tried to run, but only managed to turn around before the foot hammered you in the back. You were pushed against the soft mattress. \u201cAhhh\u2026that feels good.\u201d Ed sighed, as if he simply put his foot down to relax it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-Ed!!\u201d you screamed up at him. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t--mmmph!!\u201d you weren\u2019t able to finish as the elder Elric pushed you harder into the bed. If the bed wasn\u2019t so soft, you surely would have been crushed like a pancake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I said you were to refer to be as \u2018Master Elric\u2019? Did you forget already, shrimp?\u201d Edward moved his foot so his big toe was directly above your head. Using that single toe, he began putting pressure against the back of your head. \u201cSay it right before I pop your head like a grape.\u201d You wanted to cry, but the pain left no room for tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmaspher\u2026Elrif!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd laughed at the sound of you trying to speak.

He removed his big toe from your head, allowing you to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM\u2026Master Elric!!\u201d you yelled up to him. Your body was hot from being under his bare foot and you hope the giant would let you go soon. Ed instead gave a shrug at your obedience before covering you with his sole once more. This time he began rolling you under it, covering every inch of you in foot sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll take a lot more than that to convince me, little slave. Keep it up, though.\u201d Ed began scratching his chin as he thought up your next act of obedience, all why rolling you under the ball of his foot. </span></div></div>",

Despite having to reeking terror off your body, Ed was still hovering it over you like some dangerous predator. You looked at it for a few seconds before looking past it and into Ed\u2019s grinning face. He had his arms folded over his chest and was looking straight at you, as if waiting for a show or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Master Elric?\u201d you said up to him in a confused voice.

My foot gave you a good rub down, now he wants some love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but\u2026what am I supposed to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd rolled his eyes, beginning to get a little annoyed.

Just make me feel good and BIG.\u201d Ed closed his eyes and laughed. So this was all just to stroke his ego? You had no choice, since defying him wasn\u2019t an option. You carried yourself back to his foot and looked over it. You got closer and instantly felt the smell radiating off it. Trying to ignore it, you started rubbing his sole with your tiny palms. His sole was rough and covered in grime, which you could feel slide between your fingers like mud. It wasn\u2019t so bad, once you got use to the smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat feels good, keep going. Don\u2019t be shy.\u201d you heard him speak as the young alchemist relaxed on his bed. Making Ed happy was probably the only thing you could do right now that might benefit you. You got even closer to the foot and began rubbing higher while also licking the places you\u2019d already rubbed. It tasted just like you thought: sweaty like a very active teenager. Ed must have felt you licking because he started moan from the feeling. He was mumbling something you couldn\u2019t hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, your hands started to get sore and your tongue felt like it was about to fall out.

The alchemist still had his human arm raised into the air, letting the foul stench of his pit seep out into the air. Ed must have noticed this as his grin visibly widened to signal his decision. Without warning, Ed took the hand he was holding you with and slapped his exposed armpit, making a quick, squishy sound. Your tiny, two inch form made it easy for you to get stuck on Ed\u2019s sweaty skin. The blonde, sweat-covered hairs entangled themselves around you as your clothes stuck to Ed\u2019s pits like glue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComfortable?\u201d Ed asked with a laugh.

It was time Roy showed Ed how superior Ed was to him. And Ed had just the thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you still don't respect me!?\" Ed thundered from his chair. Roy just grunted as he tried to push Ed's gigantic odorous foot off of him. \"How do you like my new human foot colonel? It's nice and sweaty just for teensy weensy you!\" Ed said as he increased the pressure on Roy just a bit. Not enough to break bones or anything, but to cause him to be in more pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had it with you Mustang. It's time I got some respect from you. And I've got just the way for you to show you how low you are compared to the great Fullmetal Alchemist!\" Ed said smirking evilly.</span></div></div>",

With your limbs back, that title no longer makes sense. How about the \u2018Amazing Tiny Alchemist\u2019?\u201d Roy laughed to himself, even while Edward was applying pressure on him.

I\u2019ve had it with you!\u201d Ed shouted as he removed his foot from Mustang and replaced it with his hand, grasping the Colonel roughly. The young alchemist hopped out of the chair and over to one of his discarded boots. Without saying a thing, Ed stuffed the shrunken alchemist into his footwear. Roy immediately got to his feet and rushed for the opening. He was too slow, however, as Ed\u2019s bare foot blocked his only exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap\u201d. Roy cursed as he made a 180 and darted to the other end of the shoe. Ed\u2019s toes wiggled as his foot slowly crept into the black boot. He gave the bean sprout colonel plenty of time to reach to toe section of the boot, since then the only thing he could do was watch fearfully as the giant\u2019s foot got closer and closer. Eventually, the toes reached Roy and pushed him under them. The Flame Alchemist\u2019s upper torso was caught between two toes while the rest of him was smothered by Ed\u2019s sole. Outside, the elder Elric grinned as he felt the little bug caught between his toes. He wiggled them and forced Roy\u2019s face between them, making him smell his cheesy toes. After getting both feet comfortably into his boots and forgetting about his socks, Ed started to leave Mustang\u2019s office. His entire foot was weighing down on Roy, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about accidentally crushing him. As he made his way through the military HQ, he laughed. His laugh was full of victory and pride. He ignored the personnel that gave him weird glances and strolled out of Headquarters toward home, laughing the entire time.</span></div></div>",

The shrunken colonel immediately tried to escape, darting away from the titanic Elric brothers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill being disobedient, even after all that? You\u2019re a tough nut to crack, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d Ed said calmly as he lifted one of his bare feet into the air, ready to slam it down on the fleeing \u201cfire ant\u201d. Before he could make a move, another foot descended and hit the State Alchemist square in the back. The foot belonged to Al, who grinned at his success. Using his toes, the younger brother grabbed Roy and brought him over to Ed\u2019s face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cLooking for this?\u201d asked Alphonse with a cheeky grin. His brother grinned back and laughed, blowing hot air at Mustang. Al brought Roy back to the floor between them and dropped him. Before Roy could make another escape attempt, another foot smacked him in the back. This one was Edward\u2019s, who began rubbing him into the floor. Al asked his brother what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaking sure he sticks. See?\u201d Ed lifted his sweaty sole off the apartment floor, which now had a shrunken Mustang glued to it. His sole was facing Al, who just stared at the colonel for a few moments before understanding what Ed wanted. Lifted his own foot into the air, he aimed and slammed it into Ed\u2019s foot. For Roy, it was no longer about being squashed between a foot and the floor, but two sweaty feet at the same time. He was being crushed from both sides and could barely mutter a word. The brothers started rubbing their former superior against each other\u2019s foot, covering him in foot sweat and odor. After about a minute or two, they pulled away with a sick popping noise. Roy was still stuck to Ed\u2019s foot, to Al\u2019s disappointment. Ed scraped Roy off his sole and onto the floor again. Both brothers apparently were apparently thinking the same thing as they both got their feet ready. Roy barely had time to open his eyes, which he shut during the entire ordeal, before he felt himself being crushed once again. The two Elrics had covered Mustang with their feet, rolling him between them as if they were little children again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, he\u2019s like a toy.\u201d Al stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe IS a toy. OUR toy.\u201d corrected Edward. They continued rolling Roy into a ball for several minutes before they decided to release him. Roy was red in the face and panting heavily. He stilled seemed to be able to stand, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure we won\u2019t accidentally kill him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not. He was once a high ranking alchemist before he became our slave. I\u2019m sure a little sweat isn\u2019t going to snuff him out. In fact, he probably wants more.\u201d Ed smiled toothily, his little brother following. Roy muttered numerous threats under his breath as he weakly stabilized himself.</span></div></div>",

He wouldn\u2019t even be able to breath if that was the case. But it wasn\u2019t like Ed was worried about losing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his brother had taken a seat on the couch and taken out his pocket watch to time the event, Al began. He gave Roy a scary smile before lifting his left armpit and brining Roy underneath it. The colonel struggled pitifully until he was inches in front of Al\u2019s pit. He could smell the B.O. radiating off ir and grabbed his nose in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlphonse Elric! Put me down now or--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr what? You\u2019ll punish me?\u201d Al laughed before stuffing the colonel into his armpit. The immense amount of sweat stuck to Roy like slime. Al took his hand away and Roy slowly started to slide down his skin. Before he got very far, Al used his index finger and smush the one-inch man deeper into his pit. He swiveled his finger back in forth, as if smearing a stain off his body. The colonel was helpless and humiliated. After a couple minutes, Al pinched Roy off his armpit, switched hands, and repeated the ordeal with the right pit. This time, however, he used his palm to slap his pit repeatedly. Every hit caused the flesh around his pit to ripple a bit and splash greasy sweat everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Al, stop that!\u201d shouted Ed as he threw an arm out to shield himself. \u201cYour getting your sweat all over the room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like it wasn\u2019t already everywhere.\u201d responded Al, who looked down at the small pool of sweat that had dripped of his torso during the last few minutes. Al obeyed his brother anyway and spent the last few moments of the first five minutes rubbing Roy into his pit with his palm. Ed told his brother that the first five minutes were up. Alphonse peeled Roy off his pit and got ready for the next half of his turn. </span></div></div>",

Al decided the conversation had ended there and place Roy on the ground. The colonel, like always, made a mad dash in the opposite direction. Al\u2019s booming laugher could be heard above him as he ran, following by the booming sound of his bar feet hitting the ground. One stomp shook the floor and knocked Mustang onto his stomach. Before the State Alchemist could get up, he felt the familiar pressure on his back. Al pinned Roy against the floor and continued to apply pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is for yelling.\u201d said Al as he pressed Roy firmly against the wooden floor. \u201cAnd this\u2026is for your fleeing habits.\u201d Al began rolling the colonel under the ball of his foot, getting every inch of the man\u2019s form acquainted with his sole. This continued for a few minutes until Al stopped. The floor appeared wet from the boy\u2019s perspiration, and Roy looked beat. These teenagers were going to kill him with their odorous bodies. \u201cAnd this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all Al, times up.\u201d Ed announced as he got up off the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!

The younger Elric picked up his shirt off the ground and put it back on before taking a seat on the couch. Roy cracked an eye open and looked straight up into the smiling face of Edward. A hand soon blocked his sight as he was picked up and brought to Ed\u2019s face. The older Elric lifted up his arm, the same arm that had once been automail, and took a big sniff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah. This is going to be great. If I remember correctly, these limbs have been in the Gate just as long as Al\u2019s body. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been washed in some time either.\u201d Ed gave Roy  a sadistic, evil look.

I got something good for you planned, colonel.\u201d Ed said as he held Roy tightly between his fingers. The man had given up struggling and just remained limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever\u2026just hurry up.\u201d Roy mumbled in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that? I didn\u2019t heat you. Oh well, I\u2019m just going to get started.\u201d Ed sat his butt down on the floor with a sudden and loud bang, spooking both Roy and Al. The Fullmetal Alchemist gave the shrunken man his hand on final smirk before dropping him between his two readied feet. As the colonel watched, Ed rose a single foot over his body and brought it down ever so slowly. Roy didn\u2019t even try raising his hands to stop the sole and just let it fall on him. The sole hit him and pushed him flat against the floor. Ed then began to roll Roy under his foot in a circle. Ed was in such a power drive that he bit his lip just to help contain himself. It felt so good to have the man he despised so much under his foot, defeated and broken. He knew that if he kept doing this, Roy\u2019s joints may eventually get pushed out of place. He stopped and lifted his foot a few inches off of Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you hear me, bug? I\u2019ll tell you what. If you call me Master Edward, I won\u2019t torture you any more. How does that sound?\u201d Rot didn\u2019t say anything at first and looked weakly at Ed. Being rolled under his foot had left him on his stomach, so he had to strain his neck to look the younger male in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026M\u2026m\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm? What was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM\u2026m-make me\u2026shortly.\u201d Roy smirked and spit in Ed\u2019s direction. Ed\u2019s face became enraged. His eyes dilated and looked like they were about to pop out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026going to murder you!\u201d Ed shot up to his full height, never taking his hate-filled eyes off the colonel. Using his big toe, the blond alchemist gave the tiny alchemist a gently nudge. The simple nudge was enough to fling to colonel, a few feet away and onto his back. Not wasting any time, Ed stomped over to the fallen man and placed his foot down on him hard. Roy screamed in agony as Ed started to crush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother, stop it!\u201d Al screamed as he ran over to Ed and grabbed his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re going to kill him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d was all Ed said he continued to press down on the man under his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on\u2026go splat already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDIE!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBROTHER!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd woke up and almost fell off the bed. Al was standing over him and had to step back to avoid colliding with his brother\u2019s head. Ed looked around as if he was in the middle of a battlefield. His face was covered in sweat and he was breathing heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026I just got home and I cam to check on you. Are you okay?\u201d Al asked, a look of concern on his face. Ed looked back at him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026fine. It was just a dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026I\u2019m going to go put this stuff away.\u201d Al said before exiting the room with the bags he was carrying. Ed scratched his head and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan\u2026I really have anger issues.\u201d he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can say that again.\u201d came another voice. Ed looked shocked and this time, did fall out of his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! Damn it, what was that! Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIN YOUR STINKIN ARMPIT WHERE YOU PUT ME!!!\u201d you yelled up at him. Ed lifted his flesh arm and looked at his armpit. There you were, still glued to his pit and apparently forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shit, I forgot about you. How long were you in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were sleeping for about a half hour\u2026so just that long. Can you get me out now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Ed peeled you off his sweaty pit and brought you to his face. \u201cYou were sure in there for awhile. You don\u2019t look that bad either. Maybe you got used to it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d you responded with a shout. You weren\u2019t sure if you were telling the truth, though. Ed shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you should. You\u2019re still my slave, remember? I might put you in there for entire nights if your bad.\u201d Ed grinned, similar to how he did in his dream and before dreaming. It may not be Roy, but this shrunken stranger wasn\u2019t bad either. The question is\u2026what should he do now? He got a lot of ideas from that dream...</span></div></div>",

His dream had showed  him how much more fun he could have with a shrunken person if he had other people in on the secret. He couldn\u2019t hide the little guy from Al forever, so why not just show him now? Maybe they could start that stinky contest for real!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Al! Come over here, I want to show you something!\u201d Ed shouted across the room as he got off the floor. His younger brother opened the door connecting to the kitchen and peeked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, brother? I haven\u2019t finished putting the groceries away.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget about that, I have something a  lot more interesting to show you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl sighed and entered the room, forgetting about the stuff he had to put away. The younger Elric approached his brother and stood in front of him; a few visible inches taller than him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what is it, Ed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd opened his fist and motioned Al\u2019s attention to the object in it. Al thought it was a bug before he got a closer look. His eyes widened in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that\u2026is that a\u2026\u201d Al stuttered in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, it\u2019s a tiny human. Cool, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool? That\u2019s awesome! Where\u2019d he come from? How\u2019d he get so small?\u201d Al asked, his eyes lighting up like a child at Christmas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know. I just found him here in this room. I\u2019ve been treating him like my slave ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, looks like it.\u201d Al replied as he looked over your minuscule form. Your skin was beat red and your clothes looked like you went swimming in them. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much. I just left him in my armpit while I slept.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must have been hell for him. I haven\u2019t seen you take a shower in weeks. Plus, you never use deodorant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk! You haven\u2019t bathed since you got your body back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I\u2019ve just been preoccupied with a lot of other stuff. Boy,, this apartment is really going to stink up if we don\u2019t get cleaned up first\u2026\u201d Al worried as he sniffed the air, getting a hint of both the boy\u2019s B.O. mixed into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but before we do, why not use this guy to find out which one of us smells worse?\u201d Ed suggested as he waved you in front of Al\u2019s face by your arm; much to your discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow? Is he going to rate our stench?\u201d Al laughed at the thought of you being a judge in a stench contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? I just had a dream where we had a contest, but I woke up before a winner was decided.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a weird dream. How does the contest work?\u201d Al asked as he continued to study you. You hated being looked at like a toy of some kind; but what else were you at this size? Hardly a person\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we each get ten minutes with him. During those ten minutes, you get do whatever you want to him so he can experience the odors of your body. In my dream, we just used our feet and armpits\u2026but why stop there? You can make him smell your butt and even your breath if you want. Whatever it takes to win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that sounds like fun! You have some pretty weird dreams, big brother, but I don\u2019t mind if you make up stuff like this! Hurry up and give him here so we can start!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa there, Alphonse! I don\u2019t remember saying you could go first. I think the eldest should go first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair! You got to spend over an hour with him! Let me have him first!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they were fighting over you like siblings who fight over a toy. These two were going to make your life hell\u2026you just knew it. </span></div></div>",

Al looked disappointed, but didn\u2019t put up much of a fuss. He\u2019d get his turn eventually. Alphonse just waked over to the couch and plopped himself down on it. At least he\u2019d get a show to watch. \u201cAnd keep and eye on the clock, Al.\u201d With that said, Ed placed his full attention on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, little guy, to get started\u2026why don\u2019t you get reacquainted with my pit?\u201d Ed asked as he held you in his automail arm and raised his flesh arm over his head. You shook your head and mentally screamed \u201cNo\u201d. Ed ignored the look of desperation on your face and stuck you under is arm. He began furiously rubbing you into the lightly aired armpit. It was different from being trapped in his pit; this time you were being forced into the sweaty area by a force unimaginably stronger than you. After a few minutes of smelling nothing but Edward\u2019s reeking pit, the teenage menace took you out and brought you to his grinning mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike that? Well, you\u2019ll love this.\u201d Ed wasted no time and gripped his gut with his hand. You watched as Ed\u2019s face started to twist oddly and his cheeks began to fill with air. Before you realized what was about to happen, the elder Elric unleashed a monstrous burp in your face. It was like a gale force wind which would have blown you across the room if you weren\u2019t being held tightly in Ed\u2019s fist. With you arms trapped in Edward\u2019s fist, you were unable to plug your ears, nor cover your nose. The sound of a mighty foghorn assaulted your poor ears as the smell of who-knows-what from the depths of Ed\u2019s gut blew into your nostrils. When he was finally finished, you were left temporarily deaf and your nose was on fire. \u201cWow, that must have lasted a good minute! Must have been the hot peppers I had for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward didn\u2019t take the time to study your condition as he dropped you onto his fleshly foot. The impact didn\u2019t hurt as much as it would have if you hit the floor, but it still caused some pain strike your back. Ed lifted his foot and rolled you off it so you were flat on the ground. Your hearing started to come back and your nose didn\u2019t feel like it was full of hot coal, but none of that mattered since Edward wasn\u2019t finished yet. You watched as Ed raised his foot and let it fall upon you. You felt your body compress under the ball of his foot and tried to scream, but only got a mouthful of the boy\u2019s sweat. The liquid made you cough and splutter. Ed heard your negative reaction to his foot and responded by rubbing your face into his sole. Before long you were giving Ed\u2019s foot a good rub with your face. A few minutes later, you face was finally free, but the remainder of your body remained under Ed\u2019s foot. You looked up and saw the alchemist\u2019s face grinning down at you. You were about to scream up at him until his toes gripped your head and forced your head between is toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet a load of my toe jam, slave. Don\u2019t you just want to eat it up?\u201d Ed bellowed with laughter as he continued to rub your face into the filth of his toes. A couple minutes went by and Ed released you from the tortures of his foot. You breathed in some fresh air and tried to wipe the grime from your face. All you wanted to do was get away from the evil teen, so you began to crawl your way away from his towering form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going, slave? There\u2019s still my butt left!\u201d Ed said as he started to reach for you, a sadistic grin plastered across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Ed, but time\u2019s up.\u201d Al interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Already? Darn it!\u201d Ed cursed as he pulled his hand away and stood up to his full height. He looked back down at you. \u201cOh well, there\u2019s always later. He\u2019s all your, little bro.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward strolled over to the couch as Al got up and began stomping over to you. </span></div></div>",

He had taken his shoes off during Ed\u2019s turn, so his sweaty feet slapped against the rug. You could tell by the grin on his face that he was trying to intimidate you. It was defiantly working\u2026you never expected human Alphonse to be so scary. Then again, even the most innocent child would become frightening if they were a giant. You tried crawling away from the approaching feet, but you were too late. Al was soon upon you and lightly stepped on your small body, pinning it to the floor. You squirmed desperately, but it was pointless before the blond giant\u2019s power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, little guy. A little stink never hurt anyone.\u201d Al said as he flipped you onto your back and hovered his bare foot inches from your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak for yourself\u2026\u201d you muttered under your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to win this contest, so start sniffing my foot!\u201d Al ordered as he gave you an intimidating stare. You had no choice, you had to obey. If you didn\u2019t willingly smell his foot, he was going to press it down on you and force you to do it. So, with your body laid out under Al\u2019s looming foot, you closed your eyes and began taking deep whiffs. The terrible odor made you gasp in horror, which caused some of the stale stench to flow down your throat and burn it. You coughed and spluttered, making Al move his foot to check on you. \u201cYou okay, little guy? Don\u2019t breathe in too much at one time, okay?\u201d Al smiled kindly, as if he was giving you life saving advice. Maybe he was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had recovered from your coughing fit, Al replaces his foot with his other one and tell you to smell this one. You so some, but take smaller sniffs this time. The smell is still terrible and disgusting, but at least your not choking on it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so much fun.\u201d Al comments as he folds his arms over his chest and just watches you smell his feet. Perhaps a normal boy would find reading or sports fun, but for Al, it was making a tiny person smell his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have five minutes left, Al.\u201d Ed warned as he relaxed on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap, five minutes have already passed! I was having so much fun I lost track of time.\u201d Al quickly took his foot away and you were allowed a few seconds to rest. During those few seconds, you watched Al grab the collar of his shirt and pull it over his head. He tossed the damp shirt away and stretched his arms into the air. \u201cAhh\u2026that feels good. I can feel the breeze coming through the window..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gaze up at the giant with awe, you can\u2019t help but think that he looks pretty good for his age. His muscles are well developed for a fourteen-year-old, sporting some nice arms and a developing six-pack. Before you note anything else about his godly appearance, you suddenly find his sweaty hand wrapped around you. Al brings you up to his cute face and smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike Ed said; I haven\u2019t bathed at all since getting my body back. This is really going to stink\u2026\u201d Al lifts his arm up and you brace yourself for what\u2019s to come. Al swiftly pushes you into his lightly haired pit, immediately soaking you with pit sweat. He begins dragging you up and down the hot skin, transferring as much of his sweat onto your body. \u201cI didn\u2019t put deodorant on today either; we\u2019re all out. I should have bought some when I went shopping\u2026\u201d Al muttered to himself as he uses you like he would any stick of deodorant. After rubbing you into the pit for awhile, he switched hands and wiped you into the other one. Unlike Ed, Al had two stinky pits to torture you with. Both smelled the same; like pure, teenage male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Al removed you from his pit, he dangled you before his eyes and looked you over. You were soaked with both of the brothers\u2019 perspiration. Their body fluids had really taken their toll on you, leaving you weak and smelling like musk. Al still wanted to win, though, and had one last thing he wanted to do with you. The question was, did he have enough time?</span></div></div>",

Ed and Al looked at each other, then back down to your quivering form. \"Hide him quick!\" Ed whispered as he went to open the door. Al looked around for a hiding spot, then an idea struck him. He lifted one foot out of his shoe and took off his sock. You could practically see the odor steaming off his raunchy foot. Al quickly dropped you into the crusty bottom of the sock before pulling it over his odorous foot again and popping his foot back inside the shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd opened the door to see none other than Roy Mustang. \"Um....Can't you see this is our day off, Mustang?\" Ed grumbled to his superior officer. Mustang sighed, \"I've got an assignment for you Fullmetal. Get your clothes on and come down to central.\" Mustang said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd noticed he was wearing nothing but a pair of boxers and his tank top. Not only that but he had a hard on which could be seen sticking out from behind the blue boxers, stiff as a board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd blushed and put a hand over his erection, \"Yeah....I'll come down when I'm ready!\" Ed said angry about being interrupted by his most hated superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just finish whacking off before you do put on some clothes, Can't have you roaming the halls of central with juice all over your  jacket. Heh!\" And with that Mustang got the door slammed in his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nerve of that guy! Coming into our apartment and insulting me!\" Ed said as he stomped over to the bed and lay down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's shortstuff?\" Ed mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my sock under my toes!\" Al said with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smiled at his little brother. \"Since I have to go, you can play with him for awhile until I get back.

He pulled on his boots, Al noticed, Without slipping on socks. Ed was never one to wear socks much, which led to his feet stinking due to the overworn boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Al's sock in his shoe, you were experiencing hell. His foot wasn't as bad as Ed's due to him being somewhat more cleaner than his big brother. But it still stunk like hell, the linty crud between his toes engulfed your face as he squeezed your head between his big and second toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl's eyes were fixated on his shoe. Where his toes were wiggling happily, almost like they were excited to have a tiny, helpless little man to absorb Al's sweat and stink. Ed said goodbye and left.

Ed really couldn't hate Mustang more than he did that moment, the short jokes and sarcasm were one thing. But to interrupt his quality time with his brother, especially when there was a tiny slave and a contest involved! Ed sighed and put his arms behind his head as he walked, Not really noticing the stench that seemed to seep up to his nostrils, even through the jacket his stench could be smelled, mixed with an aged version of his B.O. that had become ingrained into his jacket. Ed was never one for bathing regularly. But it wasn't so bad that he would get any people to wrinkle their noses at him yet. He always made sure to bathe before it started to interfere with his work and become embarrassing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today Ed had two things on his mind concerning hygiene. He had a tiny man to torture and a contest to win. That and he hoped to gross out the colonel and cause him to lose that famous composure. Who knew B.O could be so empowering? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ed mused over the thought of the colonel being smoked out of his office by his stink, Ed got an idea. That dream of his, in which Mustang shrunk and was at the mercy of his toes. It might, just might be possible to make his dream come true! Ed dashed off at full speed towards central, before he found out what Roy wanted, he would have to pay a visit to central's library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had found what he wanted in the library, he looked at his watch and nearly fell out of his reading chair. He had been here for nearly an hour! Ed closed the book and left without putting it back on the shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd took a deep breath and hoped that his plan would work, if not, he might get in serious trouble and even lose his place in the military. Ed gripped the doorknob, opened the door, and stepped inside Roy's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Fullmetal. You're fashionably late.\" Mustang said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smirked, \"Oh you're gonna be so sorry you ever crossed this alchemist.\" Ed thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a seat...\" Mustang said, Ed took a seat on the sofa at the side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd simply smiled widely as Roy went on a roll of short jokes. Ed simply grinned back and kept telling himself, \"You'll get yours, You'll get yours...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mustang could start on the next short joke, Ed reached into his pocket and pulled out a bottle of soda, still cold and still with the bottlecap on it. In truth this was a mixture Ed had made himself, following all the guidelines in the book. Long story short, he came up with what he believed was a shrinking formula. He simply had to clap his hands when all the ingredients were in place, and he had the solution to his Mustang problems!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirsty?\" Ed said waving the bottle in Mustang's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustang licked his lips, he was suspicious of this sudden and weird turn of events. Usually Ed would scream his head off when Mustang made fun of his height. But he was quite thirsty....And his thrist overpowered his suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd gave him the bottle and Mustang realized he didn't have a bottle opener. \"Oh! How could I forget!\" Ed said pulling a bottle opener from his pocket. \"Whats this about Fullmetal?\" Mustang said taking the opener.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd pulled his own bottle of soda out of his pocket, this one was untainted of course, he knew because Mustang's bottle was clear, and Ed's was green. Mustang looked confused, \"Unless of course you don't think you can drink it faster than me!\" Ed said, knowing Mustang was too proud to not accept a challenge, especially a challenge from a kid who didn't know what he was talking about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustang glared and uncapped his bottle, As did Ed when he was passed the opener. Mustang had already sucked down the entire bottle by the time Ed lifted his to his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustang set down the bottle and stood up. \"There, now can we get back to the matter at-\" Suddenly Mustang realized his face was level with Ed's chest. Ed crossed his arms and smirked. \"Alright you little bastard, what did you do!?\" Mustang shouted before having Ed's hand come over his mouth. \"Shut up and shrink!\" Ed grinned as he said this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustang was getting smaller by the second. Soon he was the exact height of the boy back at the apartment. Mustang looked up fearfully at the teenager who now towered over him...</span></div></div>",

The colonel just glared right back up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you did, Fullmetal, but reverse it! Now!\u201d Roy yelled up at the towering teen. He was a bit scared, but refused to look weak in front of this brat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, colonel, but I didn\u2019t look up how to reverse it. Not that I\u2019d want to\u2026\u201d Ed smirked wider as he bent down to untie hi black boot. Roy continued to shout curses at him, but the giant just ignored every word and slipped his bare foot out of its confines. Ed silenced the smaller man with a quick stomp, pinning his superior against the rug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet off me! I order you to take this god-awful thing away!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, Mustang. You don\u2019t like my feet?\u201d Ed asked in an innocent tone as he wiggled his toes in the man\u2019s face, smearing it with moldy toe jam. \u201cGet used to it, because you\u2019re going to be servicing it for a long time! Just like in my dream.\u201d Ed gripped Roy\u2019s head with his toes and lifted the man off the floor. Roy\u2019s screams were muffled by the teen\u2019s big toes, only becoming clear again when he released him over the opening of his boot. Roy landed in the hard leather and immediately noticed how awful it smelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you ever wash these?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, because you\u2019re always on my back about this and that! Think of it as your fault, Colonel Bug.\u201d Ed began to lower his bare foot into his boot. Roy looked up in horror and made a mad dash for the end of the footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get away with this, Fullmetal! This isn\u2019t one of your sick dreams! The military will notice I\u2019m gone and they\u2019ll look to you first, Edward! You\u2019re going to pa--!!\u201d Roy\u2019s threats were silenced when Ed\u2019s toes pushed him against the boot and gripped him tightly around the waist. Ed retied his boot and kicked it around a bit, making sure Roy was nice and snug before exiting the office. Roy felt every lift and drop as Ed walked through the halls of the HQ. The force of one step knocked his face between Ed\u2019s toes, greasing his face up. When Ed got out of the building, he was practically humming with joy. Is dream was a reality; Mustang was his. The man who had always insulted him and bossed him around was about to feel what it was like to have someone bigger control you. He wasn\u2019t worried about the military, nor the possibility that the shrinking was only temporary. His good mood wouldn\u2019t be ruined that easily. </span></div></div>",

Ed smiled at the thought of Al enjoying himself, his brother enjoyed a good break from everything he\u2019s been through. When Ed reached the door, he opened it to be met with the foul smell coming from the room. Instead of hopping back like any normal person would, Ed just sniffed the air with satisfaction. His eyes drifted to Al, who was barefoot and laying down on the couch with his eyes closed. Near his feet, you were giving the younger Elric a nice foot rub as the blond boy giggled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re having a good time.\u201d Ed spoke suddenly, surprising Al who sat up instantly and accidentally kicked you onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother! What are you doing home so early?! I was just starting to have fun!\u201d Al wined, having hoped to spend a bit longer alone with their new slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026you see\u2026\u201d Ed glanced down at his boot where Roy was still confined. Of course he would show him to Al; there was no reason to hide him. The colonel had poked fun at Al on several occasions, and he bet anything his little brother would enjoy some payback just as much as he would. Still, it was best to wait until later. There was still a contest to win, and they didn\u2019t need any more distractions. \u201cSomething came up. I\u2019ll tell you about it\u2026after we finish this contest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl smiled toothily and replied, \u201cSounds good!\u201d before looking down at you and pinning you against the floor before you could try and escape again. Ed walked over to his brother and sat down next to him, looking down at you and eager to watch what his bro had in store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t we talk about this?\u201d you asked, trembling underneath Alphonse\u2019s toes. \u201cThe contest is already ruined!

Your eyes widened and you shook your head. \u201cWell then shut up and take it like a man. He\u2019s just my little brother; how bad could he be?\u201d Ed patted Al on the back, who smirked down at you with an equally evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you thought that hour was bad, you haven\u2019t seen anything yet!

Smoke could be seen rising through a smoldering hole coming from the toe section of his boot. The whole was getting bigger, for inside Ed's nasty boot Roy was snapping his fingers as fast as he could. Ed of course, had forgotten to take Roy's gloves away before he put him in there. Now Ed hopped on one foot, much to Al's curiosity as he held you under his lint covered foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd pulled the boot off his human foot and dropped it onto the floor. Thankfully the burns on his foot weren't too bad. It wouldn't have even registered that much to him if Mustang hadn't kept snapping his fingers. The boot now was laying on it's side, and Al gasped as he saw a tiny Mustang running out of the boot, looking a bit green. He turned around just as he saw Ed's hand reaching down toward him fast as lightning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd made sure to pin the shrunken Mustang's arms to his sides, so he wouldn't be able to aim his snaps at him very well. Ed quickly stripped Mustang of his alchemy gloves and tossed them onto the floor next to his boot. <br>\r\nMustang struggled fruitlessly as Ed began to put the squeeze on him. Al quickly lifted his foot off of your exhausted body, and came over to have a look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd grit his teeth as he kept applying pressure onto Roy, then letting up a bit for a few seconds, then squeezing him again. \"Ed....What....How.......\" Al stammered before Ed looked to him. \"I shrunk him silly! As for how.....I just looked up a way to make a shrinking serum through alchemy! Now we have two slaves! One for each of us! But this little runt is going to have to be taught a lesson in obedience.\" Ed said glaring down at Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy gulped as Ed looked down at his boot, which now had a small burned hole. Ed turned his furious gaze to Roy. \"You go on and play with the other shrimp some more. We'll continue our contest later, after I've broken this little bastard.\" Ed said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl nodded, knowing bad slaves, even ones who used to be their allies, had to be broken down into a subservient little toe kisser. </span></div></div>",

Roy can only remain silent as Ed carries him through the apartment toward his bedroom. Once there, Ed closes the door and tosses Roy onto the bed. Mustang bounces off a pillow and lands somewhere in the middle of the mattress. He looks up at Ed with a furious glare, who only glares back at Roy with his hands on his hips. Roy finds it extremely difficult to keep the glare up while Ed looks down at him with that powerful gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose boots were expensive, you know! They don\u2019t even sell them in this city!\u201d Ed scolds Roy, who merely scoffs at Ed\u2019s anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you return me to normal, I might consider sending away for another pair.\u201d Roy offered, lying straight to the teen\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot going to happen, squirt.\u201d Ed replied, ending the conversation there. He began to strip himself of his black jacket and pants, leaving him in his tank top and blue boxers again. Before Roy could say anything else, Ed sat down on his bed and snatched Roy back into his hand. He brought the older male up to his face and looked him over. He was so fragile at this size; Ed had to be careful not to literally break him while he was breaking him. \u201cOkay, Colonel Bug, you\u2019re going to spent some time in my armpit. Before that, though, let\u2019s get you nice and sticky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy didn\u2019t know what Ed meant, but knew it too well once the teen licked his lips and tossed the elder alchemist into his mouth. The mouth closed behind him and Ed started sucking on Roy\u2019s miniscule body, tossing it around his mouth like a juicy piece of steak. Roy was fighting a losing battle with Ed\u2019s tongue as it slapped into him again and again while covering him with saliva. Finally, Ed spat Roy back into his hand and wiped his mouth of drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you don\u2019t taste half bad. If you don\u2019t turn into an obedient slave, maybe I\u2019ll just turn you into a snack!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFullmetal\u2026I\u2019m going to roast you!\u201d Roy threatened, trying miserably to clean himself of Ed\u2019s slobber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, the only one who\u2019ll be roasting is you\u2026in my warm pit!\u201d Ed said before lifting his arm and slapping Mustang into his armpit. Roy was immediately glued to the raunchy skin by a combination of Edward\u2019s spit and sweat. He tried to struggle free, but he was just a fly trapped on some sandpaper. Ed put his arm down; his armpit making a wet squishing sound as it closed. \u201cYou just stay there for awhile and be quiet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what are you going to do?!\u201d Roy barely managed to ask, getting a mouthful of pit sweat and small hairs in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? Oh, I\u2019m just going to <i>take care</i> of something I should have before I left. You remember, right?\u201d Ed teased as he laid down on his bed, resting his head against his pillow. Roy thought for a moment before his eyes widened in shock. He couldn\u2019t mean\u2026he wasn\u2019t going to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd sighed as he pulled down his boxers, his erect member springing up once released. Using his flesh hand, Ed started to stroke his erection gently. Roy felt the slight movements of the teen\u2019s arm rub against his back. He could hear Ed moan quietly through his lips. He couldn\u2019t believe he was listening to the pipsqueak masturbate! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd pumped himself faster, thinking about Roy and all the ways he was going to dominate him. His payback was going to turn the once proud man into a pitiful, toe licking slave. He couldn\u2019t wait for the day when Roy would run over to his tired feet everyday and give them a good rub. As Ed let his imagination run wild, he started using his thumb to spread the precum over the head of his cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I bet you wish you could pleasure my meat, don\u2019t you colonel? Maybe you will if you\u2019re good.\u201d Ed mumbled. </span></div></div>",

As he got comfortable, he heard something coming from his armpit. It sounded like\u2026laughter? Raising his arm, Ed plucked the shrunken alchemist out of his rank pit and brought him up to his face. The man was having a fit of laughter, tears dripping down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow\u2026pffft!\u201d Roy mumbled before snickering some more. \u201cYour little brother just saw you masturbating! That\u2019s rich! That\u2019s just rich!\u201d Mustang continued to laugh before a tight squeeze from Ed shut him up. A squeeze from his automail fist, no less. Ed continued to give the bug more tight squeezes as he grinded his teeth in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlphonse\u2026that little brat\u2019s gonna get it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Al was heading down the hall toward his own room, biting his thumb along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I really pissed Ed off this time.

And with Ed's temper, who knows how long Ed could keep from smashing Roy to bits in his anger? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy knew that Ed's new size difference to him, combined with his short fuse, that he would have to be careful around the giant teen. Roy gasped in pain as the cold, hard Automail fist continued to put the squeeze on his poor defenseless body. Ed kept applying pressure, Roy squinted up at his captor through the pain and saw him gritting his teeth and giving him a death glare. He was starting to black out, at this rate he would surely be turned into a bloody pulp in Ed's automail. And he doubted Ed would miss him that much, save for the satisfaction of making Roy a pitiful slave to his raunchy body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy couldn't take the pain, he had never experienced such pain. Even when he was in war and had wounds, they were nothing compared to the pain of this torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy suddenly realized he was afraid to die. Especially in this manner. So he let go his pride, and began to beg. \"P-Please Edward! S-Stop!\" Roy said through the pain. Ed suddenly let up a bit, and then began to squeeze again, but not as hard this time. \"Well? Go on! Beg!\" Ed said with a half smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy said nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd began to get annoyed, \"I said beg, little bitch!\" Ed thundered just loud enough for them both to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's ears were ringing from Ed's loud voice. The pressure was now worse than ever before. And Roy couldn't take it anymore, pride be damned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE, I'M SORRY!!! I'LL DO ANYTHING JUST.....STOP!!!\" Roy screamed up to Ed, who smiled in satisfaction. He had at last forced Roy to abandon that arrogance and pride of his. \"That's better, I'll stop...I'll expect more of that kind of behavior from now on!\" Ed said, lowering his hand and dropping Roy a few feet above the ground. Roy, still being immensely sore from the torture, cried out in pain as he hit the ground. He would be bruised all over from this kind of treatment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd stood up from the bed, his feet on either side of the colonel. He wiggled his Automail toes and his flesh toes. His human toes making a squelching sound as they rubbed together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now....Lets go attend to Alphonse.\" Ed said picking the bruised and battered Roy and gently smushing him into his armpit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd put on his pants and his black jacket. Roy was now trapped in the sweltering prison, and it would only get hotter and sweatier from then on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He also hoped that Ed wouldn't shrink him, sick as it may be he enjoyed tormenting this boy. The idea that he could dominate him with his rank feet made him giggle. But he was too worried about his fate to enjoy it that much. He just playfully wiggled his toes inside his sock, you were in there of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Ed opened the door and walked in. Al looked up fearfully. Ed came and sat down on the couch next to his little bro. \"E-Ed? A-Are you still mad?\" Al said frightened of being shrunk. It tore Ed's heart out to see his little brother so frightened of him. They had been through so much together, now he had threatened his brother with shrinking just because he didn't knock and saw him wacking it. Ed sighed, \"Listen Al...I didn't mean what I said back there....I would never do anything to hurt you. I'm sorry for what I said...And I'm sorry if I scared you.\" Ed said placing a hand on his brother's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl sighed in relief, \"I'm sorry if I came in on you like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay Al.....Just promise me you'll knock next time.\" Ed said with a small smile. Al nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long silence Ed finally spoke up. \"So....Where's the little guy? I've got Mustang in my armpit right now. Heh.\" Ed snickered as Al made a grossed out face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's in my sock right now...I'm using him to comfort my toes. Ha!\" Al said with a wiggle of his big toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd ruffled Al's hair, \"You're really getting the hang of it little bro! Now what about the stinky contest?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s continue it.\u201d Al suggested as he leaned down to take off his shoes and socks. Before he could pull of the sock that contained you, Ed stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on a minute, why not add this guy to the judge panel?\u201d Ed asked before unbuttoning his jacket and slipping it off just enough to get access to Mustang. He grabbed the bruised up colonel and handed him over to Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Al questioned as he examined Roy. \u201cHe looks kind of beat up, and I don\u2019t want to accidentally kill him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s a tough bug. Don\u2019t hold back at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026okay, if you say so.\u201d Al stood up with Roy in hand and walked to the center of the room. He turned his head back to Ed to asked, \u201cCan you keep an eye on the clock?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Ed glanced at the clock before looking back at his brother. It was going to difficult to watch the time while also watching his brother deal with a couple slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl clenched your head with his toes as he slipped off is sock. You were glad to finally be free of that cotton prison, but the hell had only just begun. You watched as Al grinned above you before pinning you underneath his foot and rolling you under the ball of his sole. You were being smothered with foot sweat and constantly rubbed between the wooden floor and the soft skin of the alchemist\u2019s foot. While all this was going on, Al stripped off his shirt and held Roy in front of his smooth chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about this, Colonel Mustang. I never thought you were a bad person, but now you\u2019re just a slave. You understand, right?\u201d Al apologized to the broken man as he lifted his other arm, exposing one of his hairless pits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot again\u2026\u201d Roy grumbled as he was smushed once again into the armpit of a young, teenaged boy. Al began rubbing Roy up and down, using him like he would use a stick of deodorant. No matter how much he rubbed, though, he could still smell the B.O. radiating under his arms. Mustang didn\u2019t make a good deodorant. After a while, Al switched hands and started rubbing Roy into his other pit. At the same time, he took his foot off you and began rolling you under the other one. One of the advantages he had over Ed was that he had another foot and pit to torture the little slaves with. Twice as much stink, if you ask me. However, that was for the two little insects to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding  that the two judges had experienced his feet and pits enough, Al began to move on to something else. He took Roy out of his pit and grabbed you off the floor, holding both of you in front of his smiling, childlike face. Roy looked over at you and appeared surprised. They had another shrunken human? How many more did they have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Mustang could think that over any more, Al suddenly brought both his slaves over to his behind. Using his free fingers, he carefully opened the elastic of his pants and boxers and dropped the two of you into them. When the elastics were snapped back into place, Roy and you were crushed against the boy\u2019s round butt cheeks. Al began walking around the living room, grinding both of you against his ass with every step. As he moved, his butt started to get sweatier and sweatier. Foot sweat and pit sweat\u2026both were inferior to the pungent smell that was ass sweat. As the two shrunken souls slipped closer and closer to Al\u2019s butt hole, you both started to get a hint of something else other than the smell of sweat. It was the stench of dried crap, and you were getting closer to the source every second! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Elric stopped for a moment and touched his stomach. He felt a soft rumble in his tummy and groaned a bit. Before either Roy or you knew what was happening, Al released a gigantic fart into his pants. Luckily, neither of you had reached the teen\u2019s butt hole yet, so you were saved from a direct hit. Still, something that smelled like a mix of rotten eggs and fried beans lingered in the ear. You couldn\u2019t handle it anymore; you were going to pass out any second now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy, Al, that was TERRIBLE!\u201d Ed said, fanning the air in front of his nose while he chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, Ed!\u201d Al said as he laughed along with his brother. \u201cI\u2019ve been farting like that a lot recently. I think it must be all the farts that built up over the years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe. Anyway, your time\u2019s up, little bro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Al walked over to Ed as he fished the two of you out of his pants. He tried offering them to Ed, but the older Elric made a grossed out face and told him to place them next to him. Al did so and went to find the shirt he had tossed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy felt dizzy and sick, but fortunately (or unfortunately) still conscious. He glanced over at you and noted that you were a boy around Ed\u2019s age. You looked pretty beat up yourself, which could only mean that you had been through your own deal of torture. Mustang felt sorry for you, despite not knowing who you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, kid, you alright?\u201d Roy asked. You also felt dizzy and sick and were on the verge of collapse, but could still make out that someone was talking to you. You looked to see that it was Roy Mustang and he was the same size as you. You had taken note that the brothers had gotten themselves another slave, but couldn\u2019t make out who it was. Who would have thought it was the colonel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look it. What\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Roy.\u201d said the colonel before going silent. He wanted to try and reassure the boy; saying that everything would be fine and that the Elric brothers couldn\u2019t keep them forever. However, Ed was in earshot and he didn\u2019t want to upset the towering teen. Ed had already shown him what he could do if he got angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl returned and slipped his shirt back, seating himself on the other end of the couch next to Ed. The two of you were now trapped between two giant, blond gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, little guys, it\u2019s time to find out the winner. What\u2019s the verdict?\u201d Al questioned, his face showing how eager he was to know who the victor was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t lie, we want the absolute truth!\u201d Ed added, pointing a finger at you. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about making us mad, neither of us are sore losers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Roy exchanged glances, neither of you trusting that Ed was speaking the truth. Despite that, you both knew the winner of the contest was clear as day\u2026</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile Al had leaped off the couch and was now jumping up and down shouting \"I win, I win!\" Just like a child who had won a wrestling match with his brother. Ed turned off his death glare as he stood up and congratulated his little brother with a handshake. \"Nice going Al!\" Of course, Ed had made sure his gigantic flesh foot had landed on you two, as if to try to get you to reconsider that he wasn't the smelliest, either that or he was just wanting you both to know of things to come. Either way, you both found yourselves trapped under an extremely sweaty and extremely pungent foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl laughed with his brother as an idea popped into his head. \"Hey brother....Can I have the little guy and you can have Mustang? That way we'll both have toys to play with by ourselves!\" Al said grinning hopefully. \"Well.....Alright! Mustangs alot more fun to torture anyway.\" Ed smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Lets go to my room little guy!\" Al said looking down to see that you were being smashed underneath his brother's raunchy foot. \"Oh sorry!\" Ed said grinning cheekily as he lifted his foot and pretended he hadn't known you were down there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl plucked you up and took you into the other room. Giggling all the while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd however, poked Mustang with his big toe. \"Ooph!\" Mustang said as he received yet another bruise from his titanic master. \"What the hell Roy!? You chose Al instead of me!? I ought to squash you right now!\" Ed threatened as he lifted his foot off the ground and let it hover over Roy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to repay me, shrimp!

Scum like you belong at my feet, worshiping my toes!\u201d Ed said coldly as he plopped his butt back on the sofa and stuck his foot in Roy\u2019s face. The movement accidentally kicked Roy a few feet back, but Ed didn\u2019t show any signs of remorse. \u201cGet over here, shrimp, and give your master a foot rub!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy didn\u2019t question the giant adolescent and ran back over to Fullmetal\u2019s huge foot. When he reached the foot, Ed lifted it so Roy could get under it and begin his service. He massaged the boy\u2019s rank sole while getting a smell of the odor it gave odd. Mustang\u2019s hands were quickly covered with sweat, and the humid air around Ed\u2019s foot began to make him sweat too. Ed watched with menacing eyes, not intending to give Roy the least bit of compassion. After awhile, Ed grew bored and nudged Roy back to the floor. He then placed his big toes over the colonel\u2019s frail body and began to press down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow start licking my big toe. Show that you\u2019re nothing before it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy refused to lick the bratty teenager\u2019s toe and tried to push the digit off him. It was an impossible task, and Ed just started to press down harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, do it or I\u2019ll pop you!\u201d Ed commanded as he watched Roy\u2019s struggles with a sadistic glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please don\u2019t!\u201d Roy yelled out in pain. He forgot his refusal moments before and began licking Ed\u2019s toe like it was a popsicle. Ed grinned in victory and released Roy, but positioned hit directly over him so he couldn\u2019t escape. The Flame Alchemist got the picture and started licking the blond god\u2019s sole. Ed sighed and relaxed with his arms behind his head. Roy wished he could relax, but was instead getting a stomach full of teenage sweat. This couldn\u2019t be good for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Ed once again changed the position of his foot. This time, his toes were pointing down at Roy. The Elric wiggled his toes and spread his big and index toe apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext, clean all the filth form between your master\u2019s toes. Use your tongue, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy almost wanted to cry. This was too much, he\u2019d rather be stuck in the office doing mountains of paperwork than this. Holding back his tears, Roy positioned himself between Ed\u2019s toes and began licking the toe jam out of the crevice. It was moldy and foul, but Roy ignored his brain telling him to stop and continued lapping up the grime. Eventually, he had gotten it all, and as a reward was given a nice vice hold from Ed\u2019s toes. The young alchemist lifted his former superior off the floor and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026what to do next\u2026\u201d Ed pondered as he wiggled his toes, grinding Roy between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s about time you took a shower\u2026\u201d Roy suggested, his voice weak form his torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ordering me around?!\u201d Ed raised his voice as he clenched Roy between his toes, earning a yelp form the smaller male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m just suggesting! You can\u2019t live like this forever; think about your health!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd paused for a moment. The insect had a point, it was only a matter of time before they started receiving complaints from the neighbors. They might even get kicked out at this rate. However, the way Roy sounded like his parent or something made him pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Finally, the young Elric let out a sigh and said, \u201cWell, since you two picked me as the winner, I guess I\u2019ll go easy on you, but just this once.\u201d The both of you breathed a sigh of relief, happy that Al was at least a bit kinder than his older brother. The boy leaned back on his hands and continued to stare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, while we wait, why don\u2019t you tell me about yourself. I\u2019ve been so wrapped up playing with you that I don\u2019t even know my own slave\u2019s name.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were reluctant to speak at first, since the giant in front of you, despite his appearance, hadn\u2019t been so nice to you. However, he was your master now and you imagined he\u2019d probably wouldn\u2019t like you ignoring him. Therefore, you told the blond teen your name, where you came from, and how you ended up in your current situation. Alphonse listened to your every word carefully,  not finding a bit of it boring. New things he didn\u2019t know about fascinated him. When you were done, Al was sporting a sad look in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, so you had your own life and family before Ed found you and turned you into our slave. That really sucks.\u201d Al said as he gently stroked your head with his finger. \u201cDon\u2019t worry though; I\u2019ll make sure to take good care of you\u2026while I\u2019m not using you as an insole or something.\u201d Al chuckled a bit after the last part. His eyes then turned to Roy, who had been silent and keeping to himself this entire time. \u201cSo colonel, how did Edward shrink you anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell if I know.\u201d Roy cursed. \u201cHe just gave me a drink and I started shrinking. He must have put something in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, wow. I can\u2019t believe you fell for a trick like that. You always had your dim moments, colonel.\u201d Al chuckled again, earning him a glare from Roy which he didn\u2019t notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, what\u2019s taking Ed so long?\u201d Roy asked, glancing in the direction of the bathroom. The faint sound of water running could be heard threw the walls. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take this long to take a shower. Plus, he has two less limbs to clean than everyone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about him.\u201d Al replied, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably take awhile to get all those weeks of stink off him. I\u2019ve seen my brother spend almost and hour in the shower.\u201d As Al said this, he suddenly realized that he could be spending quite a while with his two shrunken toys. It seemed like such a waste to do nothing. \u201cYou guys want to play a game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you said you weren\u2019t going to do anything to us!\u201d you shouted up at Al, a slightly worried look on your face.

I haven\u2019t played that since I was little, mainly because it was hard to hide with that big armor body.\u201d Al said, thinking back to the old days. Mustang and you glanced at each other and then looked back at Al. It didn\u2019t seem like a very dangerous game. \u201cOkay, here are the rules. I\u2019ll count to a hundred and fifty while you two hide somewhere in my room. I\u2019ll give a reward to whoever I can\u2019t find. <b>However</b>, anyone I do find has to give ME a reward!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell are we supposed to give you a reward?\u201d Roy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s for you to think about.\u201d Al replied as he took the both of you off his knees and placed you on the wooden floor. \u201cI\u2019m going to start now, so you better hurry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Elric began to countdown while you two ran off like a couple mice. The two of you ran together for a bit before Roy split off from you in another direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, where are you going?\u201d you yelled after him. The older man turned his head around but didn\u2019t stop running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, kid, but if we hide together he\u2019ll just find us more easily. You\u2019re on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat jerk! He was leaving you behind. You wanted to run after him, but there wasn\u2019t a lot of time left. You quickly looked around and discovered that Al\u2019s room wasn\u2019t as clean as you imagined it\u2019d be. There were several piles of clothes scattered around the room. Al had just gotten his body back from what you figured, so he couldn\u2019t have worn all of these. He must have tried on a bunch of clothes until he found the ones he liked and neglected to put any of them away. Instead of looking for a particular hiding spot, you just dived into the nearest pile of clothes and burrowed your way to the bottom. You found yourself stuck in\u2026something. It was too dark to see, so you couldn\u2019t tell if it was a shoe, a shirt, or even a pair of boxers. You hoped it wasn\u2019t the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were doing this, Roy had other plans. Edward hadn\u2019t broken his spirit completely and he was looking to escape. He ran over to a wall and looked it over while brandishing a smile. Reaching into his uniform, Roy took out a piece of chalk and began drawing a small transmutation circle on the wall. Ed had taken his gloves, but he couldn\u2019t take his alchemy. When Roy finished, he placed his hands on the circle and caused it to glow with alchemic energy. Before long, he had formed not only a hole in the wall, but also a small tunnel to the next room over. Roy quickly entered the hole and drew another circle which he activated to close the hole back up. As he dashed through the tunnel away from Al\u2019s room, he thought about the kid he had left behind. He felt sorry for him, but bringing him along would just make things more dangerous. Once he was normal size again, he\u2019d defiantly come back here to rescue him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c148...149...150!\u201d Al yelled as he finished counting and peered around the room. With a smirk on his face, the young boy began searching for his little playthings. </span></div></div>",

You couldn't believe Roy could be so selfish! Of course you have watched the Anime and knew what kind of man he was, anyone who would make his subordinates wear tiny miniskirts (if he was to become fuhrer that is) isn't a very good man to rely on. Looks like you were on your own, at the mercy of the younger blond. You heard Al's giant steps as he searched under the bed and under his dresser. Al was about to give up when he spotted a lump in his clean clothes pile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl smirked, instantly knowing it was either you or Roy. \"Hmm...I wonder what that is.\" Al said out loud, chuckling a bit. Al stepped as quietly as he could towards the pile of clothes. When he was close enough, he yanked two of the garments off and found you curled up into a ball, trying to hide yourself as best you could. You looked up and saw Al's grinning face. \"Heh heh. Found ya!\" Al said picking you up as gently as he could. \"So...Wheres Mustang?\" Al asked you, holding you gingerly in his palm. \"He ran off,\" you blurt out. \"I don't know where he's hiding!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I just have to look for him too.\" Al said as he gripped you in his fist and started searhing through the piles of clothes. As he searched, he noticed a small part of the wall looked as if it had been altered with alchemy. \"This was clearly changed by alchemy, he must have made a hole and escaped....Wait a minute...That would lead him right into the bathroom!\" Al said. \"Well looks like he's Ed's problem now.\" Al said standing back up. \"I just hope Ed doesn't kill him for sneaking in there with him.\" Al sighed, his brother could be so short tempered sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on, Roy had reached, to his horror, the bathroom. Which of course had Ed showering in the tub! Washing away all that dirt and grime that he'd collected over the past few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stopped dead in his tracks when he saw the nude giant standing in the tub, allowing the gentle spray of the water to wash over his bare skin. Luckily Ed's eyes were closed as he relaxed in the nice soothing water. The tub was massive, Ed was massive, everything made him feel so puny now! As Roy started to tiptoe back into the hole. He realized that Al would've surely found out he had ran away by now! He was stuck between two giants on either side! One was slightly more kind, but he wasn't going to take any chances with either of them being angry at him! Ed would probably kill him for seeing him naked, but Al would probably only put him in his sock for awhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the decision was made....</span></div></div>",

How about some foot worship!? My feet are awfully sore and could use a soothing tongue to help with that.\" He grinned toothily down at you in his hand. You gulped, feet again? Apparently this never gets old to these boys. Al sat you down on his bed and began stripping his feet of their layers (for he had put his socks back on after pulling you off his foot), he sighed in relief, wiggling his toes as the cool air hit them. Al sniffed, and pinching his nose, fanned the air. \"Smells like old cheese!\" Al laughed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then picked you up and placed you on the end of the bed, lifting up his feet and setting the smelly objects down in front of you.

He slowly turned his head toward the shower, where Ed was staring straight at his tiny form on the tiled floor. His own face showed just how pissed off he was. Roy could only watch as the giant, nude teen stepped out of the shower and began stomping toward him. His body dripped water onto the floor, but Edward didn\u2019t seem to care. It didn\u2019t take long before Ed stomped both his feet on either side of Roy and glared down at him. Roy had to strain his neck upward to look past the elder Elric\u2019s heaving chest.

He was fully ready to crush the minuscule man, but now he was having second thoughts. Roy looked so pathetic that Ed just couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. Roy felt and heard the foot stomp the ground, but not on top of him. He look up just in time to see Ed\u2019s hand reaching for him and picking him up. With the colonel in hand, Ed peered down at him and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve decided to give you one more chance, bug man. Your master\u2019s being merciful. However, you\u2019re still getting punished severely!\u201d Ed announced as he started to use his other hand to peel away Mustang\u2019s military uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what are you doing?!\u201d Roy shouted as he tried to stop Ed from undressing him, but failed miserably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you won\u2019t be needing these in a moment. They\u2019ll just get wet.\u201d Ed said as he finished stripping the older man and tossing his clothes into the sink. Roy was left just as naked as him, covering his privates and shuddering from Ed\u2019s cold skin. Ed walked back into the shower and Mustang felt the warm water hit him. It felt nice, but Roy was in no position it enjoy anything at the moment. \u201cOkay, colonel, you\u2019re going to have the privilege of being my soap. Doesn\u2019t that sound great?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! You can\u2019t be serious!\u201d Roy screamed as he wiggled in Ed\u2019s strong grip. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in here awhile, and you haven\u2019t even started cleaning yourself!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve been cleaning myself alright.\u201d Ed replied as he showed Roy the small remnants of his soap, which now fit between his fingers. \u201cBut it takes awhile to scrub out all the stench, and I\u2019m just about to run out. Good thing you\u2019re here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Roy could shout another protest, Ed began scrubbing him the leftovers of the soap bar. Soon, Roy was covered in soap bubbles and ready to be used by his giant master. Roy\u2019s eyes were shut tight, as to not get any soap in his eyes. The last thing he needed was soap in his eyes during what was sure to be a horrifying experience. Ed started by applying his Roy-Soap to his flesh arm, gliding it everywhere from his shoulder to his elbow, then from his hand to his bicep. He swiveled Roy into his armpit a bit before scrubbing up his sculpted chest. After his pecs were clean, Ed moved Roy down his sides and then his stomach. Roy grunted as he was pushed along each of the grooves of Edward\u2019s abs. Ed went lower and began washing his human knee and thigh, ending with that foot Roy knew all too well. The Flame Alchemist thought it was funny that he had been tortured with that foot so much, and was now being used to clean the thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ed finished rubbing his new soap against his sole, he brought Roy back up in front of his navel. Roy rubbed the soap away from his eyes and looked weakly at Ed. The teenager was smiling down at him, but didn\u2019t say anything. Roy let his eyes wander until they fell on something just below him: the boy\u2019s crotch. Roy looked back up at Ed with a frightened expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god no! Please don\u2019t! Anything but that!\u201d Roy pleaded with Ed, who just chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, bug, you\u2019re in luck. I already scrubbed that area enough before you came in. Maybe next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext ti-?!\u201d Roy tried to ask, before he was swung around and slapped against Ed\u2019s butt. Edward started to scrub his butt cheeks vigorously, much to Roy\u2019s irritation. With his ass squeaky clean, Ed wasted no time in shoving Roy up his butt hole. He twisted the small man a bit as he hummed in pleasure. Roy, however, was mentally screaming. It didn\u2019t help that Ed didn\u2019t remove Roy when he was done. Instead, the teen squeezed his butt muscles together and kept the bug man in place as he reached for a large brush and began scrubbing his back. Roy was left inside Ed\u2019s crack for a few minutes before he was finally pulled out, but the experience had left him with the odor of pure shit stuck in his nose. Ed let the shower wash away any leftover soap suds from the two of them before he turned the water off and started to dry off with a nearby towel. Once both Roy and he were dried, the giant stepped out of the tub and placed Roy in the sink. He ordered Roy to get dressed while he used the towel to dry his long, golden hair. The younger male\u2019s gaze was still locked on Roy, making the man a bit embarrassed. Still, the giant had just used his naked body as a bar of soap\u2026it didn\u2019t really matter what he saw now. Once Roy was dressed, Edward wrapped the towel around his waist and left the bathroom with his personal slave. He headed to Al\u2019s room first and knocked on the door twice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in!\u201d came Al\u2019s voice from inside the room. Ed opened the door a crack and peaked his head through. Al was sitting up in his bed while you were giving him a good foot licking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m done with my shower, so you can go ahead and take yours now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. I was thinking of taking a nice bath, though. It\u2019ll be my first time bathing since getting my body back, so I want to enjoy it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, you\u2019re such a kid.\u201d Ed replied with a chuckle. \u201cBy the way, I caught that shrunken bastard. Try to keep him in your sights next time, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sorry about that.\u201d Al said, looking a bit ashamed with himself. Ed was about to close the door when Al stopped him. \u201cWait a sec, brother!\u201d</span></div></div>",

You might be a bit rusty.\u201d Ed teased, grinning at his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl just grinned back and replied, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come over here and see if I\u2019m rusty or not?\u201d Al motioned his older brother toward him. Ed took the bait and rushed at his brother, fists ready. The beginning of the match was simply the brothers exchanging blows with each other. One brother would throw a few punches while the other either blocked or dodged them. Al was noticeably taller than Ed and a bit stronger, but Ed had the advantage of speed. When Al tried to throw a hook punch at Ed, the older sibling quickly ducked under it and threw a few light punches at Al\u2019s stomach. Al predicted this, however, and tensed up his abdominal muscles to take the blows. Unfazed by Ed\u2019s attack, Al returned his bro\u2019s efforts with a knee to the chin. Ed was pushed back by the blow and caressed his bruised chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, lucky shot.\u201d Ed muttered as his brother wasted no time in charging at him. The State Alchemist was ready for him and caught his brothers fist in his hand. Before Al could pull his fist free, Ed use his other hand to burrow his knuckles into his younger bro\u2019s face. He followed this up with a few quick jabs to the face and ended with an uppercut. This time, it was Al who was caressing his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking it off, Al prepare for Ed\u2019s next strike. The older blond threw a straight punch, but Al jumped clean over it and balanced himself on Ed\u2019s outstretched arm. Before Ed knew it, Al had swerved his feet around and delivered a hard kick to his face. The blow knocked Ed to the ground while Al landed safely on his feet. He smirked down at his brother, but long haired teen just smirked as well before snatching some dirt off the ground and tossing it into Al\u2019s face. This distracted Al long enough so Ed could trip him with his leg, bringing the younger Elric to the ground as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s playing dirty, Ed!\u201d Al complained as he rubbed the dirt from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDirty? This is coming from the guy who smells like moldy cheese.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026um\u2026you\u2019re <b>short</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHO ARE YOU CALLING SO SMALL HE COULD BE MISTAKEN FOR A SHELLFISH!?!\u201d Ed screamed as he got to his feet. Al took this opportunity to dive for Ed\u2019s legs, pulling him to the ground once again. Al stood up, still gripping one of Ed\u2019s legs, and hoisted him off the ground. Ed was now being held upside-down by his leg\u2026by his little brother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready to give up, big brother?\u201d Al chuckled smugly. Ed replied by using his remaining leg to kick Al in the gut. Al saw this coming and tensed his abs again, but the impact still forced him to drop Ed. Ed flipped over in mid air and got ready to punch Al. He was still pissed at being called short, and converted all that anger into strength that he gathered into his automail hand. Without a second thought, Ed smashed his metal fist right into Al\u2019s cheek. The blow sent Al flying, causing him to blow right into a few trash cans. Ed grinned in satisfaction as he watched the dust settle. When it was gone, Al was sitting on the ground holding his cheek. The punch had split his lip and he was bleeding. He was also\u2026crying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026Al, you alright?\u201d Ed asked as he ran over to his brother. He helped him up and looked him in the face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have hit you that hard, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl gave a few more sniffs before wiping his tears away. The younger Elric then smirked toothily and gave Ed a hard kick in his stomach. Ed, who wasn\u2019t expecting it at all, took the full force of the blow and got sent flying backwards. Alphonse ran after him and, without giving the teen the chance to stand up, jumped on top of him. Ed felt the weight of his brother crush him and howled in pain. Al grinned smugly at his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready to give up NOW?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammnit, Alphonse! That was cheap trick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYet, you always used to fall for it when we were kids. Half the time, it was the reason you lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalf?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, the other half was just because I\u2019m better than you.\u201d Al grinned wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, just get off me! You\u2019re heavy and you stink!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStink? You mean like\u2026this?\u201d Al whispered as he leaned closer to his brother and lifted his arm up. Al had gotten really sweaty and his shirt was clinging to his body. The area around his pits were especially damp. Ed watched in horror as Al lowered his armpit toward his face. The smell was terrible, and Ed just wanted to get away from it. Gathering up his strength, Ed managed to push his little brother off him. He sat up as his brother laid down next to him, laughing hysterically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou win this round, you cheater. I won\u2019t fall for that again, so you better watch out next time!\u201d Ed said to his brother as he stood up and dusted himself off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, sure.\u201d Al muttered as he too stood up. \u201cSo, you ready to give me my reward?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026right.\u201d Ed remembered that he always rewarded Al somehow whenever he won. When they were little, it was usually ice cream or candy or something. When he was in that armor, he would usually bring Al to the pet store or some show. \u201cWhat do you want? Some ice cream?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, how about a foot rub?\u201d Al replied as he brought over a nearby chair and sat in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! Since when were foot rubs a reward for winning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not usually, but I just remembered that one time where I won, but you couldn\u2019t think of any rewards because the ice cream and candy shops were closed. Winry suggested a foot rub, and I think you liked it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd was dumbfounded. He didn\u2019t remember that at all, especially the part about him liking it. While he was trying to remember, he watched Al take off his shoes from his sweaty feet. His socks came next, releasing fuzz everywhere when they were pulled off. Al turned one of his socks over and dropped Roy into his hand, who almost looked like he was going to puke. Ed suddenly remembered the other slave and lifted his arm, revealing your tortured form. Ed\u2019s pit just got hotter and sweater throughout the entire fight. It was already beginning to smell a bit. Ed peeled you off his pit and dangled you in front of his face. His gaze switched to Roy and then to Al\u2019s feet. Al was wiggling his toes, urging Ed to give him his reward. </span></div></div>",

You better be prepared to rub my foot when I win.\u201c Ed threatened as he approached the seated Al and kneeled before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen\u2019s that going to be? In a hundred years?\u201d Al joked as he laughed down at Ed. Ed ignored him and started to rub the boy\u2019s left foot, much to his dislike. It wasn\u2019t as bad as what you were put through, since Ed didn\u2019t have to press himself up against Al\u2019s foot. Even so, Ed could still smell Al\u2019s foot stink even from a distance. He wondered if he should be called a poor brother for allowing his sibling to get this rank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget the other one, Ed?\u201d Al reminded, pointing to his unattended foot. Ed was about to rub that one too when he got an idea. He took Roy and you and dropped the two of you on ground. Al\u2019s foot hovered just above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two do that one, I\u2019ll take care of this one.\u201d Ed commanded, giving his slaves an evil glare. You immediately obeyed and starting rubbing Al\u2019s sole. Roy did as well. The two of you looked pretty bad, especially Roy who had been constantly pressed into Al\u2019s shoe. The last thing he wanted to do was serve another foot. He didn\u2019t even want to look at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Ed? This is supposed to be your reward to me; don\u2019t force our slaves to do everything for you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still rubbing your foot, so be happy. It feels good, right? So don\u2019t complain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl went silent and relaxed into the chair. He was right; it did feel good. Plus, Ed was being humiliated which was  a plus for him. Ed probably hoped no one would see him rubbing his little brother's feet. The foot rub lasted several minutes before Ed stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s your foot rub, now go take a bath.\u201d Ed instructed. Al was satisfied and just nodded in agreement before picking you up and heading toward the apartment. \u201cWhy are taking him? Gonna \u2018use\u2019 him?\u201d Ed smirked, reminding Roy what he had done to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing like that!\u201d Al answered, turning back to his big brother. \u201cHe\u2019s a slave with benefits, remember? I\u2019m going to let him take a bath with me so he can get cleaned up too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. I\u2019ll be in a while, I\u2019m going to train out here for awhile longer.\u201d Ed watched Al nod and disappear into the building. The short teen looked down at Roy and smiled at him. \u201cReady for some training, bug man?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Al grinned down at you. \"No problem.\" He said as he ruffled your hair with his index finger. He set you on the sink counter, before taking off his shirt and pants, leaving him in a pair of dirty looking briefs, which he quickly pulled out of. Al lifted the dirty pair up to his nose and took a small sniff. His face screwed up, and he dropped the undies like they were scorching hot. You had already stripped off your clothes, which now reeked of feet and armpit, and stood there shivering because the countertop was cold on your bare soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl smiled at you when he turned around, you saw that he was pretty good size for his age, even if you were normal sized he would still have a bigger member than you. You weren't very big yourself, which made you feel even punier than normal standing there, nude, before a young boy who was superior to you in every way. Endowment, height, physical strength, fighting ability, smarts....You were just a pathetic little boy from another dimension who had the bad luck to wind up shrunken in the house of two brothers who needed some entertainment. You always knew that Ed was a mischievous guy from the anime and manga, but you never expected Al to have the heart to do this to someone. But neither of the boys were heartless, you knew that. They were just dealt a shitty deck in life and needed someone to take it out on you supposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a look to see if you hadn't fallen down the drain or anything, Al turned on the water in the tub and stuck his hand under the running water to make sure the water was just right. He then placed the plug in the drain and turned to you. He smiled down at you before reaching over behind you and grabbing a small box labeled: Muscle Soak. You guessed that these would sooth Al's aching muscles from the spar. It was then you realized that Al was looking at you, \"These make for a really nice bath, it's soothing and it smells great!\" Al said before he turned around and poured some into the hot bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tub was now halfway full, and Al shut off the water. He turned back around to you, \"Ready for our bath?\" Al said smiling kindly at you. You nodded vigorously before Al plucked you up and placed you down on the floor beside the tub. \"I'm gonna test it first, I don't want you being scalded to death.\" Al said before placing a bare foot into the tub. Al nodded and set his other foot inside before sitting down and sighing with pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh.....That feels so nice.....\" Al said closing his eyes. </span></div></div>",

He slowly lowered you into the water, asking you if it was too hot or cold for your liking. You shook your head before Al let go of you, allowing you to sink under the water. You felt water enter your nose and mouth and ears for only a second, before Al rescued you. \"Whoops...Sorry little man.\" Al said sounding genuinely sorry. \"You okay?\" he asked you as you coughed and sputtered. You looked up at him and nodded. \"Good.\" Al said as he let his hair down from the ponytail he had been wearing. Al's hair wasn't as long as his big brothers of course, it only reached down to his shoudlers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl put the braid down on the tile floor and grabbed a bar of soap and a washcloth. And began to rub the two together, making a lather. Al proceeded to wash his upper body, making sure to wash his reeking pits thoroughly. Then Al proceeded to wash the rest of his body, making sure not to knock you into the water again in the process. When Al was finally done he pinched off a small fraction of the soap and handed it to you to use. Al however, grabbed a bottle of shampoo and began to scrub his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scrubbed yourself thoroughly, hoping to get the brothers' stink off of you. When you had gotten yourself soaped up, you held your breath and went down under the water to rinse. You came back up and found yourself face to face with Al's monster. Al noticed this and smiled. \"Don't be so shy. The way I see it, we both have the same stuff, so it's no big deal.\" Al chuckled as you broke your gaze. Al picked you up and set you on the ledge of the tub. He then laid down in the tub, rinsing his hair underwater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Al was done rinsing, you saw him rising out of the tub before you, dripping wet, like some mighty Poseidon. You were so tiny compared to him! You now realized how puny you were and began to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl looked down, thinking your tears were just water, then he heard you sobbing and picked you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s because you\u2019re so small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know and that\u2019s what\u2019s scary. I know you mean well, but the truth is that I\u2019m so much less of a human being than you. You can\u2019t pay full attention to me all the time and I could easily end up dead. What if you put me in your shoe and press down too hard? What if you forget I\u2019m here and mistake me for a bug? It just takes a quick second to stomp out an insignificant bug!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl was at a loss for words. He could understand his buddy\u2019s fears; they were all true. The giant boy brought you up to his soaked chest and pressed you gently against it. You hugged your giant\u2019s skin as you continued to sob into it, your tears mixing with the bath water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, Matt. I\u2019ll be EXTRA careful around you always. You\u2019ll just have to trust me.\u201d Al said, trying to comfort you the best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Ed? He doesn\u2019t care about me at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true. Ed\u2019s not a complete meanie. Besides, he likes to play with Roy more, which is why he gave you to me. During the few times where you are with him, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d never do anything to really hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded into Al\u2019s chest as you started to calm down a bit. You felt a little better, but the fears were still fresh in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, looking up at me as a giant doesn\u2019t have to be scary. How many people do you know can say they\u2019re friends with a giant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn my world, people would be thrilled to just have the chance at meeting you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, you said I\u2019m a popular character in your world. Kind of like a celebrity, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSort of.\u201d you replied, kind of finding it weird to think of Al as a fictional character when you were right here bathing with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you feel better now? Wanna get out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded to both questions and Al stood up in the tub. He took a towel and started to dry the both of them off. After that, he stepped out of the tub and drained it before placing you on the sink. The blond alchemist examined your clothes and stuck his nose up at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese need to be washed. Why don\u2019t I make you something to wear until then?\u201d Al offered as he clapped his hands together and placed them on a folded towel. A simple transmutation later and Al handed you a blue bathrobe made out of the towel. You happily slipped it on and tied the rope around your waist so it wouldn\u2019t fall off. Al wrapped a different towel around himself and exited the bathroom with you in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Al\u2019s room, the younger Elric placed you on his bed as he got dressed. After tying his hair into a ponytail, he sat down on the bed and looked down at you. With a smile, he asked\u2026</span></div></div>",

As Alphonse asked this, you heard your stomach make a loud grumbling noise. You placed your hand over it and nodded up to Al. The blond heard your stomach and giggled. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll make us something. Rest a bit here until I get back, okay?\u201d You nodded and watched the giant stand up and leave. You laid down on the bed and tried to get some rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl headed toward the kitchen and immediately started taking out everything he needed. He took out a large pot which he put on the stove, along with several vegetables and beef. He started cutting up the vegetables and meat, which he did very quickly and accurately. A few minutes later, he was standing over the stove while stirring the cooking contents of the pot. As he did this, he heard the door open and his older brother enter the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething smells good! What are you making?\u201d Ed asked, walking through the kitchen doorway. The teen was covered in sweat, having come back from a hard training routine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeef stew.\u201d Al answered simply, but earning a bright smile from Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStew? Awesome!\u201d Ed said with joy as he strolled over to the fridge and grabbed himself a soda. Ed instantly downed half the bottle and looked back at his brother. \u201cWhere\u2019s the little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn my room. I\u2019m letting him rest until it\u2019s time to eat. The poor thing\u2019s starving and I\u2019m a bit hungry myself.\u201d Al tested the stew with a taste and added a bit more salt to it. \u201cWhere\u2019s your little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you mean this?\u201d Ed reached into the collar of his shirt and pulled Roy out. The colonel was tied to a piece of string that hung from around Ed\u2019s neck. \u201cHe was being disobedient so I used him as a necklace while I trained. How was it, bug man? Nice and hot in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy ignored Ed and focused in catching his breath. It had been hellish inside Ed\u2019s shirt and he was glad to be out in cool air again. He happened to sniff the air and catch the smell of something cooking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that stew? Do I get any?\u201d Roy asked to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou? Hell no! If you\u2019re hungry, I\u2019ve got your meal right here.\u201d Ed grinned as he kicked his boot against the floor. Roy cringed, knowing that Ed\u2019s boots were still unwashed and probably full of toe jam and other filth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEd, don\u2019t be mean.\u201d Al said, turning away from the stove to face his brother. \u201cYou\u2019ve given the colonel a hard day. The least you could do is give him a proper meal. Give him a break, would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was glad Al was so thoughtful, but ultimately the decision was Edward\u2019s.

After all I don't remember ever getting a break from you.\" Ed said untying the colonel and setting him on the kitchen table. Ed turned to his brother, who was busy stirring the stew with a wooden spoon. Roy knew that any other time he would have hopped from the table to a chair and climbed down to hide. But the brothers were being thoughtful enough to give him some food that wasn't made up of toe gunk or sweat. And he was quite hungry anyway, so he stayed put on the table and watched Al taste the stew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ed could you go to my room and get Matt?\" Al asked not turning away from his cooking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Ed said walking down the hall into Al's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd opened the door and saw lots of kitten posters on the walls, Al even had the classic framed picture of a kitten doing chin ups that had the caption \"Hang in there\". Ed had to chuckle at this, his brother still hadn't changed after all this time. He saw you laying there fast asleep on Al's pillows. Ed smiled down at you as he crept over to the side of the bed. Ed had to admit, it was kind of cute seeing such a tiny person sleep. Kind of like how a cat curls up on it's owner's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd reached down with his human hand and gently shook you awake. You sat up and rubbed the sleep out of your eyes. You yawned and looked up to see Ed smiling down at you. \"H-Hello sir.\" You said hoping that Ed wouldn't be as mean as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey squirt, you ready to eat?\" Ed said as he picked you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's almost ready, lets go into the kitchen.\" Ed said as he prepared to leave the room, only to hear what sounded like a kitten purring. Something furry was tickling his foot too! He looked down to see a small grey and white cat rubbing up against his human foot lovingly.</span></div></div>",

Ed glared at his brother for a few seconds, then sighed and handed you to Al. He picked up the kitten and sat down on the bed with the kitten on his lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat continued to purr and rub it's head up against Ed's chest. \"Aww...He likes you!

I promise he won't be any trouble!\" Al said as happy as could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd followed his brother back into the kitchen, bringing the cat with him. \"Please tell me you bought the necessary cat stuff?\" Ed groaned as he imaged little cat poopies all over the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Al said producing a litter box, a bag of cat litter, a few cans of cat food suitable for a kitten, and some cat toys from the cupboard under the sink.

Your stew is just what I need after some difficult training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, brother.\u201d Al replied before glancing down at their two shrunken slaves. \u201cHow about you? Did you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was great! Even better than my mom\u2019s!\u201d you answered, rubbing your stomach like Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was fine.\u201d Roy said, looking the other way due to embarrassment. Al smiled, happy with their replies, and looked back at his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do now, big brother? Play with Roy some more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like to,\u201d Ed said, grinning at the tiny colonel. \u201cbut I have to hit the books. I still need to find a way to get my limbs back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl nodded and hid a frown as he started to clean up. Ed had successfully brought back his body, but was still looking for a way to get his own body back. He wasn\u2019t having much luck recently, which was part of the reason he had a lot of built up irritation to take out on a couple tiny slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go out for a bit. Now that I know we can keep Mittens, I have to buy a collar for him. Do you mind if I take Matt and Roy with me?\u201d Al asked, finishing up the dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but don\u2019t stay out too late. When I came in from training, the sun was starting to go down.\u201d explained Ed as he left the kitchen and sat down in the living room. He gathered up a few books and notes from a nearby table and started going through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Al said as he put the two of you into his pocket and hurried out the door. Mittens strolled over to Ed\u2019s legs and nuzzled against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Al left the apartment building and walked down the street. Looking up at the sky, he noticed Ed was right and the sun was starting to go down. The Moon was becoming visible and it would be nighttime in an hour or two. As Al hurried down the sidewalk, Roy and you were having a hard time staying still. Al\u2019s running was causing the two of you to rattle around in his pocket, occasionally smacking right into each other. Save for the part where you bumped into Roy, it was sort of fun. Still, it was making you dizzy so you eventually managed to cling onto the inside of the pocket to keep yourself in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl reached the pet store and entered it, looking around for cat collars. He found several hanging together and looked through them, searching for a particular one. Once he found it, he brought it to the counter and paid the clerk. With the collar in his other pocket, Al left the store and made his way back to the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope he likes this.\u201d Al said to himself, caressing the collar in his pocket.</span></div></div>",

Backing up a few steps, his eyes looked into the window of the store and a smile spread across his face. Roy and you felt Al change direction as he entered a second store. What was he doing now? You listened as Al looked through a bunch of stuff until he found something he liked and brought it to the store owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Alphonse, I didn\u2019t know you had an interest for this kind of thing.\u201d the old man said as Al paid him the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t know either.\u201d Al replied, chuckling nervously. He waved to the man and left the store with his bought item. Outside the store, you suddenly felt Al reach into his pocket and pull you out. He let you stand on his palm as he spoke. \u201cLook what I got ya, little guy.\u201d Al showed you his other hand, which carried a miniature shirt, pants, socks, and shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d you asked, taking the clothes and looking them over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis store sells all kinds of miniature models, including human ones! I hope those clothes fit you; they didn\u2019t come in sizes. Try them on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complied and started to change into the model clothes. They were a perfect fit, as if they were made for you. You finished putting on the shoes and smiled up at Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are great, Al! Thank you so much!\u201d you said, hugging the boy\u2019s thumb. Al was glad you were happy and pet you on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you like them. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t sell any miniature underwear or boxers, so you\u2019ll have to go without those for now. Al was about to put you back in his pocket when he heard Roy speaking to him. The alchemist had climbed up the pocket and was hanging over the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026what about me? This uniform is kind of sweaty so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Mustang, but I only had enough money left to get Matt something. Plus, he needed them more than you because he was only wearing a bathrobe! Maybe next time, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy was disappointed that he had to stay in these clothes, which reeked of the Elrics\u2019 sweat. He just nodded in understanding and dropped back into the pocket. He was soon joined by you and the three of you were on your way back to the apartment. Along the way, you admired your new clothes, much to Roy\u2019s annoyance. You caught Roy glaring at you and talked to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you jealous or something?\u201d you asked the older man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJealous? Don\u2019t make me laugh. I still want to get back to normal, not live my life depending on these giant kids.\u201d Roy said, looking away form you and just staring at the fabric of Al\u2019s pants. There was nothing better to look at. Part of you was glad Roy was still himself, while another part wished Roy would just give up and accept his new life. If he didn\u2019t and tried to escape again, who knows what could happen. Edward had shown that he had a kind side, but you knew he probably also had an evil side that wouldn\u2019t think twice about getting rid of a hopeless slave. Boy, were you glad you were a slave with benefits\u2026</span></div></div>",

You weren\u2019t very enthusiastic about being away from the kinder Al, but didn\u2019t express it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Ed took you from Al and held you in the palm of his hand.

You and Ed stared at each other for a bit until you spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026how\u2019s your research coming?\u201d you asked, trying to start a conversation with the blond haired giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTerrible!\u201d Ed exclaimed, blowing hot air at you. \u201cI can\u2019t find anything new on the stone or any other way to get my limbs back. I\u2019m really frustrated\u2026good thing I have a tiny slave you take out that frustration on.\u201d Ed gave you a sly grin as he stood up from his sitting position. \u201cAlthough, Al said I had to be gentle with you. What could I do to you?\u201d Ed ran his hand through his golden locks as he though. Suddenly he snapped his fingers. \u201cI got it! How about we test out how much strength you got in those tiny muscles of yours with a game.\u201d Ed poked you in the chest, easily forcing you to sit down on his palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of game?\u201d you asked, a bit fearfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA climbing game. I\u2019ll start you out on my knee and we\u2019ll see how far you can climb up me in\u2026say\u2026ten minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that\u2019s dangerous! What if I fall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll catch you, squirt. However, you\u2019ll have to start over again from my feet. Plus, just to make the game more interesting, you\u2019re going to spend some time in whatever you\u2019re closest to when time runs out. For example, say you fall at the last moment and end up on my feet. I\u2019ll place you between my toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeing between your toes doesn\u2019t seem very gentle to me\u2026\u201d you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a baby! If I really wanted to torture you, I wouldn\u2019t be playing this game and just force you to lick my feet. I can still do that, if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll play the game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026then, let\u2019s get started!\u201d Ed brought you down to his knee and waited until you had latched onto his pants before standing upright again. He told you to start climbing and you did. You scaled the expanse of Ed\u2019s black, leather pants as fast as you could. You had done some climbing in your old life, but this was much different. This mountain was alive! Ed tried to stand as still as possible, but still fidgeted a bit and caused you to slip a few times. You managed to prevent yourself from falling completely, though, and grabbed onto Ed\u2019s pants each time. You finally managed to leave his pants and start climbing his upper body, but you had no idea how much time had passed. Had it taken you the full ten minutes to scale just his pants, or did you still have time left?</span></div></div>",

Mittens followed of course. Al looked at the dishes in the sink which had piled up over the last few days. He sighed and rolled his sleeves up after setting you down on the kitchen table. He ran some warm water with some soap in it, and took out a sponge and began to wash the dishes. He wasn't even finished with the first dish when he heard you calling his name. He turned around to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you were, sitting on the table and minding your own business when Mittens hopped up on the table and gave you quite a scare. Mittens meowed at you, which you took as him saying he liked you. You reached out to pet his paw when he lay down on his stomach, reached out his two front paws and trapped you between them. By the time Al turned around Mittens was already giving you a bath with his tongue.

When Al finished washing the dishes he piled them up in the little rack beside the sink to let them dry.

Ed didn\u2019t glare at the shrunken man and just grinned before flicking him in the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s wishful thinking to believe you\u2019ll break after just one day. But you know, Colonel, you\u2018re just going to get punished if you act like this.\u201d Ed said as he put a little squeeze on the tiny man. He saw his little brother enter the room and stopped the pressure. \u201cHey, Al, you\u2019re just in time! Wanna help me punish this disobedient slave? He still hadn\u2019t learned his place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, you really enjoy torturing him, don\u2019t you?\u201d Al asked, chuckling a bit at his brother\u2019s behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? This little shit\u2019s done nothing but nag at me since I started working for him.\u201d Ed flicked his ex- superior again, this time in the stomach. To the smaller alchemist it felt like being punched right in the gut. \u201cHe deserves this. Now come on; you know you enjoy it.\u201d Ed gave his brother a sly smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fine, but only for a bit. It\u2019s getting late and you have work tomorrow, don\u2019t you? Just because you shrunk one of your bosses doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Ed mumbled as his brother sat next to him. They both looked down at Mustang and the shrunken man cringed under their stares. \u201cWhat should we do with him? Make him lick our feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like fun, but I have an even better idea. Give him to me.\u201d Al took Roy out of Ed\u2019s hand and brought him up to his face. Grinning at the little man, the younger Elric started to carefully remove Roy\u2019s boots and socks. Both Ed and Roy were curious about what he had planned. They watched as Al finished removing Roy\u2019s tiny footwear before bringing one of the Colonel\u2019s feet up to his mouth and giving it a quick lick. Roy lurched in Al\u2019s grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Al, what are you doing?!\u201d Ed asked his brother in total shock as he watched him lick Roy\u2019s foot. \u201cYou\u2019re licking our slave\u2019s foot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but does it look like he\u2019s enjoying it?\u201d Al asked as he continued caress the shrunken man\u2019s bare foot with his large tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlphonse\u2026please stop.\u201d Roy begged, quickly losing his breath. Al\u2019s only response was popping the Colonel\u2019s entire foot into his mouth and sucking it. Roy gasped and felt tears build up in his eyes. Al\u2019s mouth was so hot and wet, plus it was starting to tickle him. Roy was actually very ticklish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it really that bad, Roy?\u201d Ed asked, greatly amused by his brother\u2019s choice of torture. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to eat you or anything.\u201d Ed chuckled and his brother chuckled as well, vibrating Roy\u2019s foot in his mouth. He slipped the tiny limb out of his wet cavern before giving the same treatment to the other foot. Roy\u2019s foot was passed between Al\u2019s lips as he sucked it like a lollipop. At this point, Roy was red in the face and almost at the point of screaming. He was lucky Al stopped when he did and gave him back to Edward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it? You\u2019re not going to torture him more?\u201d Ed asked as his brother stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m getting kind of tired so I\u2019m turning in for the night. You better soon as well. I don\u2019t want to drag you out of bed.\u201d Al gave his older brother a stern look before heading into the kitchen. He carefully picked up you and Mittens and brought the both of you to his room. Ed was left alone in the living room with his little toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat Al. He\u2019s supposed to be the little brother, yet sometimes he sounds like a mom.\u201d Ed told himself. He looked at Roy, who was panting and recovering from Al\u2019s foot licking.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re worn out from THAT. I\u2019ll give you something to get worn out by\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Ed caught Roy once more and looked over to Al drying his hands off with a dish towel. \"Hey Al, wanna join in?\" Ed asked waving Roy towards Al. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl simply shook his head and yawned. \"No thanks, I'm gonna go get Matt and head to bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his little brother yawn caused Ed to yawn and realize how tired he was. \"Yeah, I should head to bed too....I've got work tomorrow, everyone's probably gonna be in an uproar about their precious colonel being lost.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd grinned evilly down at Roy and continued as Al went into the kitchen to fetch Matt. \"All the while I'll be holding your puny head between my humongous toes in my boot!

He quietly made up a little bed with some cushioning and a nice soft blanket so Mittens wouldn't get cold. When he had finished, he gently lifted up Mittens' paw off you and picked you up. You rubbed the sleep out of your eyes and yawned, you blinked sleepily and looked up at Al's kind smile. He motioned for you to be quiet and slowly tucked you into his pants pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMittens was still asleep until Al picked him up and carried him over to his little basket in the corner. He uttered a whiny meow as his eyes opened and he was set in the basket. Al lifted up the small folded blanket that he had prepared for his kitten and covered Mittens up. \"Goodnight Mittens.\" Al whispered as he turned off the light...Only to hear Mittens whining. Al turned the light back on and Mittens stopped. Al realized that his cat was afraid of the dark and chuckled, \"Okay...I'll leave this light on for you.\" Al whispered as he went down the hall to his room.</span></div></div>",

You recall falling asleep inside Al\u2019s pocket while he slept, which means the giant must have woken up first, changed into some clean clothes, and placed you on the bed to continue sleeping. Before you could start to wonder whether you could just wait here or not, the door to the bedroom opened and Al walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re already awake. I was just about to wake you up.\u201d Al told you as he approached the bed and let you climb onto his palm. He brought you up to his face and said, \u201cGood morning, Matt.

Al rolled his eyes and headed to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez.\u201d Ed muttered as he rubbed his head and picked himself off the floor. \u201cI hate mornings\u2026\u201d The older Elric scratched his stomach as he yawned. He put on a clean pair of pants and a new tank top before heading for his desk and grabbing an oddly placed sock off it. The State Alchemist rattled the sock before turning it over and causing a tiny and sleepy Mustang to tumble out. \u201cHey there, Colonel Insect. Did you have a good nap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou made me sleep in your smelly sock, how do you think it was?!\u201d Roy shouted up at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I don\u2019t really care.\u201d Ed replied as he violently snatched Roy off the desk and left his room. In the kitchen, he found Al just about to sit down to enjoy a freshly cooked omelet. You were right next to the plate, hungry nibbling on a small piece of the omelet. Mittens was lapping up some milk in the corner. The two brothers exchanged good mornings before sitting down to eat breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to give Roy any?\u201d Al said after swallowing his fourth bite of omelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? He\u2019s going in my boot after this, so he can eat all the toe jam he wants for breakfast!\u201d Ed replies before stuffing \u00bc of the omelet into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you won\u2019t, I will.\u201d Al cut off a small piece of his omelet and gave it to the tiny colonel. Mustang was happy to take it and started eating, much to Ed\u2019s annoyance. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact these brothers were enslaving him, he might of complemented Al on his cooking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy it now, bug. The rest of the day won\u2019t be so nice.\u201d Ed told his tiny boss as he smiled evilly. After breakfast was over, Roy knew that \u201cthe rest of the day\u201d was about to start. Ed snatched up Roy and dropped him into the back of one of his boots (Ed had repaired the boot Roy ruined using alchemy). Roy wasn\u2019t surprised at all when Ed lowered his bare foot into the boot and pinned Roy under it. Roy\u2019s head was perfectly set between the teen\u2019s big and index toes. Ed snickered as he kicked his boot around, making sure the Colonel couldn\u2019t move. The Fullmetal Alchemist slipped on his signature red jacket and said goodbye to his brother. After that, he was out the door and heading toward the military headquarters. Every now and then Ed would grip Roy\u2019s head tightly between his toes, sometimes hard enough that the man thought he would pop. The air inside Ed\u2019s boot quickly heated up as Roy was forced to endure not only the pressure of the teenager\u2019s foot but the stench as well. Even after a day of torture, Roy was still not used to the rank smell. </span></div></div>",

Ed didn\u2019t mind, though, since he enjoyed the exercise. Plus, it meant he could torture and humiliate Roy with each step he took. After around forty-five minutes of walking, Edward finally arrived at the doors to the Central Headquarters. No more than four steps in and he could already hear the intense chatter through the place. Everyone was asking everyone else if they had seen Roy. Some were worried, others were happy since the Colonel wasn\u2019t the most popular superior in the building.

Aren\u2019t you jumping the gun?

Afterwards, Major Alex Louis Armstrong entered and Mustang was not present.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I went to his office, but the bastard wasn\u2019t there.\u201d the alchemist lied. \u201cI waited for a few minutes but decided to head home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026and do have any information that may relate to his disappearance?\u201d William asked, tipping his glasses and eying Edward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, sorry.\u201d Ed replied as he swiveled his flesh and blood foot, grinding Roy tiny body into his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell than, if you come across anything please report it to me or my colleagues. I must ask that you do not leave Central until the investigation is concluded.\u201d the Major saluted Edward and walked away. Ed stopped himself from snickering and continued down the hall. Since he had no one to report to, he decided to stop by the library and do some light reading. While there, he couldn\u2019t help but feel he was being watched. The same people seemed to pass him occasionally and give him odd glances. Eventually, after over an hour and a half of reading, a letter was handed to the older Elric.

Get rubbing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy groaned in pain as Ed lifted his sole off Roy just enough for the older male to rub his foot from his laying position. The alchemist reluctantly began rubbing the boy\u2019s foot, ignoring his sinister smirk high above. Ed had build up a lot of sweat in his boot, so by the time Roy was finished his hands were soaked in sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really have time for this? Don\u2019t you have to report back?\u201d Roy asked while he rubbed his teen master\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd remain under the watch of that Sullivan guy? I think I\u2019d rather take my time here. If he wants me back, he can tell me himself.\u201d Ed told his slave as he took his foot off him and roughly snatched him up before he had a chance to run. \u201cHow about we see if this dump as anything we can use. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll mind\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

He was about to leave the room when something on the desk by the window caught his eye. He went over to the desk and saw four or five papers scattered over it. There was also a bulky round thing wrapped in newspaper and tied at the top with some string. Ed shrugged, probably the dirtbag's lunch. However something compelled him to open it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he undid the poorly tied knot, he got the shock of his life. A grin slowly spread across his face as he re-wrapped the package and stuffed it along with the rest of the papers in his pants pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd ran to the police station, where Albert was being held. He ran inside, flashed his watch for everyone and anyone who wanted to see it, and eventually gained access to see Albert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had asked to be alone in the cell with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Albert saw Ed he sighed and looked down at the floor. \"What do you want from me kid?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd had made sure that the guards were positioned far away so he could do what he was about to do. He approached the wall behind Albert, clapped his hands, and placed them on the wall which quickly dissolved. Albert looked from Ed, to the open space and turned to run out. However the first step he took onto the soil outside, a transmutation circle appeared under his feet, and suddenly the world seemed to be getting bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Albert had reached the desired height, Ed stepped outside, snatched the dazed and bewildered man up, and stuffed him in his pants pocket. The guards of course came running. Ed explained to them how Albert had had an accomplice who could use alchemy come bail him out.

About half-way to his apartment, Ed quietly slipped into a nearby ally and fished the tiny criminal out of his pocket. Albert struggled in his grip, but the older teenager was too weak compared to the giant Edward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ass wipe! You\u2026you shrunk me!! You took the notes from my room!\u201d the tiny man screamed at his large captor, who was previously a couple feet shorter than him and now towered over him like a god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I did, but I already knew about the alchemic circle described in the notes. They just happened to remind me of it. What was REALLY interesting was this\u2026\u201d Ed reached into his pocket and took out the object he had found in the hotel. Unwrapping it, he showed it to Albert. It was a blood red stone, a Philosopher\u2019s Stone. \u201cCare to explain where you got this, punk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I stole it from a military warehouse. I thought it was just a rare gem, but once the military found out I had It they arrested me and demanded I tell them where it was. I managed to escape and was about to leave town when you knocked down my door!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I thought you killed your girlfriend. That\u2019s why you were arrested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a lie! My girlfriend broke up with me months ago and moved down South.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. What about the research notes on shrinking? You don\u2019t look like an alchemist to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose belong to a friend of mine. He was using it to shrink his merchandise to make them easier to transport. I was holding onto them for him.\u201d the nineteen tear old explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, merchandise? Why shrink merchandise when you can shrink people? It\u2019s a lot more useful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t you everything I know, can you turn me back to normal now? Please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026nah.\u201d the elder Elric replied. \u201cAm I correct to assume all those other crimes on your record are true?

You can\u2019t do this to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch me. Today is the beginning of your new life, slave.\u201d Ed said evilly as he stuffed Albert and the stone back into his pants pocket and made his way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he arrived at his apartment number, he rushed through the door and ran right by Alphonse. The younger alchemist was sitting on the couch reading while you were willingly giving him a foot rub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Ed, what are you doing home so--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now Al, wait just a moment!\u201d Al shouted to his brother as he rushed to his room and slammed the door shut. Inside, he tossed Albert onto his bed and took his boots off before throwing Roy onto the bed with him. The two shrunken men exchanged glances before Roy looked up angrily at the blond teen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFullmetal, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Roy asked, getting to his feet and walking to the edge of the bed. \u201cWhy is--?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust shut up bug and watch!\u201d Ed snapped back as he took off jacket and shirt, revealing his entire automail arm. Ed took the Philosopher\u2019s Stone out of his pocket and examined it closely. He would have to use it to find out if it was real or not. Ed was eager to do just that, so he took a few minutes to mentally prepare before holding the stone between his fingers, clapping his hands together, and placing them against his chest. The entire room filled with blue light as alchemic energy crackled everywhere. Roy and Albert were forced to shut their eyes or go blind from looking at the light. Al saw the light from down the hall and rushed for the door. When he found it locked, he banged on the door repeatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother! What\u2019s going on in there?!

Without warning, Al slammed his socked foot on top of his new slave and forced him onto his back with a thud. Only the teen\u2019s head was visible, the rest of his body was smothered by the giant foot. Al smirked as he gripped the man\u2019s head with his toes, forcing his face into his fuzzy sock. Albert tried to wiggle free to escape from the foul odor, but only succeeded in amusing Al further. Al eventually let his head go and just kept his foot on top of the tiny criminal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert looked dazed as he recovered from having his face stuffed into the dirty sock of a younger boy.

He was confident that the military experts would find out Ed was behind his disappearance eventually. It wasn\u2019t that difficult; two people vanishing who are somehow involved with Edward? Despite his confidence, Roy feared Ed\u2019s new power. The teenager now had the knowledge to shrink anyone he wanted using alchemy. Combine that with his ability to transmute without circles, and Ed would just have to touch someone and they would quickly find themselves looking up at a much bigger Edward Elric. He could shrink and enslave the entire military!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to calm down\u2026Edward isn\u2018t that crazy.\u201d Roy said to himself as he tried to get comfortable in Ed\u2019s damp, hot armpit. His jacket was trapping all the heat and causing his pit to produce sweat much faster. That, and the fact that Ed\u2019s blond armpit hairs were tangling around Roy and greasing him with sweat, made getting comfortable near impossible. Roy could only imagine what that Albert kid was going through; probably trapped in Ed\u2019s sweaty boot. If things continued like this, it would only be a matter of time before someone else was shrunken and put somewhere on Ed\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf only I could get a look at those research notes on shrinking.\u201d Roy muttered to himself, remembering that Ed had mentioned taking them from Albert\u2019s apartment. He might still have them on him\u2026but it\u2019s not like Roy could just ask for them. Roy sighed and started to think about something else. Maybe he should just give up on trying to get back to normal and accept Ed as his master.

Ed might be nice too if\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I thinking?!\u201d Roy screamed, accidentally getting himself a mouthful of pit sweat. With his face pressed up to Ed\u2019s skin, the colonel was forced to swallow the liquid and groan  in discomfort. Not wanting that to happen again, Roy kept his mouth shut and waited silently in the giant\u2019s armpit. Ed occasionally rubbed his arm against his ribs, crushing Roy deeper into his pit and filling his nostrils with the rank body odor. Ed was oblivious to Roy\u2019s worries and thoughts, the giant only cared about humiliating the flame alchemist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ed arrived at headquarters, he stepped through the doors and expected Sullivan to spot him immediately.

When you noticed the giant approaching, you immediately dashed out of the way before you got crushed under his massive form. You watched as Al sighed again and folded his arms behind his head, staring at the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was looking forward to teaching that guy a lesson. I guess there\u2019s always later, but by that time Ed would have put him through hell. Now I\u2019m bored\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking this opportunity, you ran over to your master\u2019s body and started scaling up his shirt. Once you reached the top, you ran across it until Al\u2019s head was right in front of you. Al felt something scurrying across his chest and glanced down to see you looking back up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey  little guy, what are you doing?\u201d Al asked with a sincere smile, as if he hadn\u2019t spent that last few minutes torturing Albert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou looked down so I wanted to ask if there was anything I could do. Edward may have taken Albert and Roy, but you still have me to play with!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl chuckled at your concern and used a finger to gently pet you on the head. \u201cThat\u2019s nice of you, Matt, but you don\u2019t have to try so hard to please me. You already gave me a nice foot rub and I don\u2019t want to force a friend to do too much.\u201d After saying this, Al picked you off his chest and sat up while holding you in his palm. After he had seated himself comfortably, you resumed speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not just a friend, I\u2019m also your personal servant. You can\u2019t lie and say you don\u2019t enjoy bossing around someone smaller than you.\u201d you told him, holding a straight face as you called yourself a servant. It wasn\u2019t such a bad thing when your master was a kind and handsome boy like Al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d Al replied, laughing a bit. \u201cI can\u2019t explain why I enjoy it. Brother\u2019s obsession is obviously because he\u2019s always been\u2026shorter than everyone else.\u201d Al said \u2018shorter\u2019 in a soft tone, as if his brother might hear him. The two of you soon erupted into laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe reason doesn\u2019t matter; I\u2019m glad to serve you, Al.\u201d you say as you hug one of the teen\u2019s curled finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about your home? Don\u2019t you ever miss it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face turns into one of sadness as he asks this. \u201cSometimes I miss my old life. Going to school, hanging out with friends, and just being normal. However, I can never go back, right? I don\u2019t even know how I ended up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can never give up hope, Matt. I never did when I lost my body and look at me now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou respond to his encouragement with another smile. \u201cThanks, Al! I\u2019m glad I have a big friend like you to talk to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl returns your smile with one of his own as he replies\u2026</span></div></div>",

Where he was greeted by the smell of his brother's intense foot odor. \"Gross, Ed.\" Al laughed. Ed just smirked as he wiggled both sets of toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl saw Albert crawling out of the boot, already looking weary. Al expected Roy to come out and asked where he was. Ed responded by taking off his red coat and lifting up his arm, his black jacket's armpit was wet and the vague outline of the colonel could be seen.

Alphonse had to really concentrate just to spot the tiny speck in the center of the circle he had drawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-what did you d-do?!\u201d Albert shouted at the top of his lungs. He was so small, however, that all the giant alchemist heard was a squeak. Al checked over the documents he suddenly broke out into the laughter. Albert just watched the boy\u2019s laughing fit with total confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow, I was so nervous that I made an amateur mistake on the circle. How embarrassing.\u201d Al seemed to find this very amusing, while Albert was just shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-mistake?\u201d Albert muttered, his eyes looking blankly into the distance. His little escape plan was a total failure because of some mistake. Now he was even smaller than before. The scumbag had just signed his own death warrant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert was snapped out of his trance when he heard two loud booms behind him. The tiny criminal slowly turned around to see a pair of large feet. They weren\u2019t Al\u2019s, being too small. Looking up, Albert realized they belonged to you, the teen he had just threatened with a gun. You were now standing above him, scowling down at him with your hands on your hips. Your scowl quickly turned into a grin similar to the ones the Elrics put on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well. It\u2019s a good thing you pushed me out of the circle when you did.\u201d you told the older, smaller teen as you cracked your knuckles, ready for some revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hold on, kid. I-I was never going to hurt you! It was just an act!\u201d Albert pleaded as he tossed the pistol away, it being useless now. \u201cI may be a bad guy, but I\u2019m no murderer!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny. You sure looked like one a few seconds ago. Now you just look pathetic.\u201d you told him as he you knelt down to get a closer look at him. To you, he was about six inches tall. To someone like Al, he was a mere half inch\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert spun around and ran away from you\u2026directly toward Al. The titanic alchemist simply had to put his own hands on his hips and glare down at Albert to freeze him with fear. Albert felt all the blood leave his face as he grew pale just looking at the towering Elric. He was big before, but now he was just godly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed in you.\u201d Al said in a saddened tone. \u201cI had just a glint of hope inside me that someone like you could change. Now I realize you can never change.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2026I\u2026\u201d Albert struggled to say something, but he was too frightened. Al was dominating him with nothing but his glare. When Al slowly moved one of his hands toward the tiny speck, Albert didn\u2019t try to run or protest. There was nothing he could do to escape those tree trunk sized fingers. Al gently pinched the tiny slave between his thumb and index finger and brought him up to his eyes. The younger Elric couldn\u2019t believe he was holding a human being this small. This shrinking alchemy was really powerful\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl started to roll the speck-sized criminal between his finger tips, covering him with the sweat on his hands. Albert curled himself into a ball as he was played with like a pebble. The reality of the situation was quickly weighing down on him. He was nothing to these boys now. Absolutely nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl stopped showing Albert how weak he was now and just kept him pinned between his fingers. He looked at him with cold eyes and Albert looked back at him with teary eyes\u2026but Al could barely see that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I going to do with you now? I don\u2019t think you\u2019d last very long as a slave at your size. You\u2019d probably just get crushed accidentally. I should just put you out of your misery\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!! Please, god, no!! I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ll worship you and your brother like gods from now on! I\u2019ll live every waking moment of my pathetic life serving you! Just please spare me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl took a moment to think before making his decree\u2026</span></div></div>",

Al went into his room with Albert, leaving you alone on the floor. <br>\r\nAlphonse sat down on the bed once he got to his bedroom, and peeled off his already moist sock. Al wiggled his free toes with a sigh and brought Albert over to them. Albert began struggling frantically, but his struggles didn't even tickle Al's humongous fingers.

He brought them up his handsome face and gave them his signature grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Ed, what are you doing?!\u201d Al shouted as he moved to take you from his brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy, Al. I won\u2019t hurt him, I just want to play with both of them for a bit.\u201d Ed said as he backed away from his little, yet taller brother. \u201cYou\u2019ll have Matty back when I\u2019m done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026fine, but go easy on him. He\u2019s had a rough night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d Ed assured his brother before turning toward the hallway and making his way into his room. After locking his door, the teenage alchemist took off his black jacket, leaving him in his sleeveless tank top. Ed laid down on his bed and dropped the two shrunken males onto his heaving chest. As the two slaves tried to balance themselves on Ed\u2019s rising and dropping chest, Ed smirked down a them and readied himself for some fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, runts, time to get to work. First\u2026\u201d Ed glanced at you as he kicked off his boots. \u201cI want a foot rub. Not too bad, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded obediently and ran toward Ed\u2019s flesh and blood foot. Past his rumbling stomach, down his leg, and onto the bed sheets before circling around the foot until you were in front of his sole. You cracked your fingers before using them to massage Ed\u2019s massive foot. As you did this, Ed turned his attention to Roy and gave him nasty smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for you, Colonel Insect, I\u2019ve had to listen to Sullivan\u2019s bullshit all day. I need a certain bug to clean out my ears.\u201d Ed prodded one of his ears with his finger and removed it, bringing a large clump of earwax with it. Ed flicked it into the distance and turned his gaze back to Roy. The older alchemist knew what he had to do and hopped off the boy\u2019s chest and made his way to the side of his head. Ed relaxed his head on the bed as the colonel reached into his ear and searched it for earwax. As he did this, Ed moaned a bit. \u201cOhh, that feels great.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy took his hands out and found them covered in globs of earwax. He tried waving his hands frantically, but the sticky substance wouldn\u2019t come off. Edward glanced down at his slave\u2019s trouble and chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed a hand?\u201d Ed asked as he reached one of his hands down the side of his bed. A box of tissues rested on the floor and Ed took one to hand to Roy. The man silently thanked the giant before using the oversized tissue to wipe off the earwax. After his hands were clean again, he went back into Ed\u2019s ear to look for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you were also making the giant alchemist feel good with your foot massage. You were getting pretty good at it, but the smell as still something you could do without. Ed had been outside walking from place to place all day, and his foot smelled horrendous. You knew Ed could do a lot worse, but this was still pretty bad. In fact, it was so bad that the foot actually felt really hot under your hands. You could actually feel the air around you heat up from being around Ed\u2019s raunchy, bare foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Roy had cleaned out Ed\u2019s left ear, the blond placed him near his right and commanded him to clean that one as well. Ed loved the feeling of Roy\u2019s tiny hands rubbing against the inside of his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make a great Q-tip, Mustang\u2026\u201d Ed said as he sighed.   </span></div></div>",

Ed was going without underwear today as well. Ed dropped his pants off his legs and lifted his feet out of them. He threw himself down on the bed and spread his legs with a sigh. The smell of dirty sweaty penis filled the air as he did this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd flexed his toes as he shoved Roy into his fleshy young sack. Roy's nostrils flared and his eyes watered from such a strong scent of musk. \"You're gonna lick my entire crotch clean Mustang.....Just to prove how much you appreciate me!\" Ed moaned, his dick becoming harder every second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Mustang stuck out his tongue and licked Ed's greasy sack. He gagged and tried to spit out several pubic hairs that had become entwined in his mouth, but Ed just shoved him back in. \"Lick!\" He practically yelled. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With no way to refuse Ed\u2019s orders, Roy continued to lick the teen\u2019s sweaty balls. The blond pubic hairs that curled out of the sack caressed Mustang as if to welcome him to Edward\u2019s privates. Roy could tell Ed was enjoying this greatly, as his hand shoved the man harder into his balls despite the fact that the slave was doing as he was told. Ed became more and more aroused with every lick as his penis started to turn into a small mountain. Eventually, he couldn\u2019t take it any more and released Roy so he could stroke his meat. Roy landed on the bed sheets, but never had the chance to stand up as Ed\u2019s cum-filled balls rolled over him. Roy tried to push the globs of damp flesh off him, but they were far too big and heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep licking, bug, or else I\u2019ll crush you under them!\u201d Ed warned. Roy got the message and began licking the underside of Ed\u2019s sack. Ed moaned at the feeling of the colonel\u2019s wet tongue lapping up the sweat from his balls. Ed had no intention of returning Roy to the military; he was far more useful like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd stopped masturbating for a moment to pluck Roy out from beneath his balls. He pressed Roy against his member before wrapping his hand around his shaft and squeeze Roy against it. The Flame Alchemist didn\u2019t need to be told and started licking Ed\u2019s long shaft. Ed stroked himself vigorously as Roy did this, dragging the small man all over his dick. Roy stuck out his tongue the entire time so it could lick anywhere Ed brought him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, from the nightstand, you were watching the entire thing. You just couldn\u2019t take your eyes of Ed\u2019s massive member and the way he dominated the older alchemist so easily. You had seen Al\u2019s dick before and knew how huge it was, but Ed\u2019s was a couple inches bigger! It seems there are just certain things that are bigger on the older brother, no matter how small they may be in height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter introducing Roy\u2019s sore tongue to most of his musky dick, Ed brought Roy to the pink head and allowed the colonel to lay over it as if it was a stump. Roy was covered in sweat and didn\u2019t know how much more of this he could take. By the look of things, it was almost over. Without being told to, Roy started to lick Edward\u2019s mushroom top which caused the teen to moan a little louder. A hint of precum could be tasted amongst the sweat, but they were mixed so thoroughly that Roy couldn\u2019t tell the difference. Roy\u2019s tongue was getting sore from tasting nothing but Ed\u2019s crotch, and he only had one more lick in him. Without looking, Roy dipped his tongue into Ed\u2019s slit and that was the last straw. An eruption of white man juice splashed right into Roy\u2019s mouth and flung him off the cock and onto the bed near Ed. The giant blond, not wanting to dirty his clothes, pointed his dick away from him and came all over his bed and a bit on the floor. After pumping what seemed like gallons of sticky white stuff out of his balls, Ed\u2019s sweaty head fell back onto his pillow and his dick went limp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat as great, Mustang. You must really appreciate your master.\u201c Ed said softly as he took a few deep breaths. Roy could not respond, of course, because he was busy swallowing the spunk that had gotten into his mouth. As Edward took a few moments to rest, Roy crawled over to the tissue he had used to clean up Ed\u2019s earwax and used it to clean his seamen-covered face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later, Ed picked himself off his bed and grabbed a few tissues to wipe off the cum from his bed and floor. After tossing the tissues into the trash, the teen pulled his pants back up and zippered them close. You watched the titanic teen\u2019s sweaty junk disappear back into his pants, probably to be released again at a later date\u2026</span></div></div>",

He used his fork to pass a single string of spaghetti to you, which was like an entire helping. You thanked him and started biting into the surprisingly thick noodle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, brother, what are you going to do about Sullivan?\u201d Al asked as he cut into a large meatball and popped a piece of it into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that\u2026\u201d Ed stated as he curled his fort into he spaghetti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just pretend he isn\u2019t watching you, Ed. You can\u2019t afford to lose your place as a State Alchemist. It\u2019s our only income of money and you won\u2019t have access to restricted research. Heck, you might even end up in jail\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Alphonse.

I hope you know what you\u2019re doing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf-way through their meal, the two brothers heard a small shout coming from the sink. They looked over to see a nude Roy leaning over the edge of the sink and waving to them. Al got up and gently removed Mustang from the water. The alchemist quickly dressed himself in the makeshift bathrobe and allowed himself to be brought to the table. At first Ed just ignored the tiny slave, but a quick glare from Al made him hand over a shred of spaghetti for the man to chow down on. For a person who\u2019s tasted nothing but sweat and man seed all day, this was like heaven to Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you forgetting about someone?\u201d Ed asked, glancing down at Al\u2019s boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am?

You aren\u2019t going to feed him anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Al replied, smirking. \u201cThat speck of dirt doesn\u2019t deserve human food. If he\u2019s hungry he can eat the lint in my toes!\u201d Al wiggled his toes as he said this, barely feeling the tiny criminal trapped between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell said.\u201d Ed gave his brother a smile. He was glad Al at least knew the correct way to treat a slave; he just wished he wasn\u2019t so attached to Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate for about a half our before the entire pot of pasta was gone and both boys were patting their stomachs in satisfaction. You had eaten exactly three and half strings of spaghetti while Roy had eaten five. The two brothers cleaned off the table and placed the dishes in the sink to be washed later on. Afterwards, they sat back at the table and wondered what to do next. It was getting late, but neither boys were ready for bed yet. </span></div></div>",

The young criminal, however, was out cold from the smell of his toes and the constant movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dare you to stick that ball of lint in your mouth and clean off our puny slave.\u201d Ed said, grinning widely at both the idea and his brother\u2019s facial response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Ed, that\u2019s gross!\u201d Al moved his finger away from him as he put on a face of disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if they can do it so can we, right? Plus, it\u2019ll probably wake the runt up. However, if you\u2019re too chicken I understand\u2026\u201d Edward smirked as he looked away from his brother while keeping an eye on the changes to his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not chicken! Watch!\u201d As the younger Elric said this, Ed watched as his brother opened his mouth and slowly brought the glob of toe lint toward it. If Albert had been conscious, he would have seen himself slowly entering the dark, wet cavern of Al\u2019s mouth. Once passing the gigantic lips, Al closed his mouth around the digit and licked Albert off his finger. Ed snickered as he watched his brother pull the finger out of his mouth and begin to swish Albert (but mostly the lint) around his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou young alchemist concentrated hard on removing all the lint around Albert, but the task wasn\u2019t so simple. First of all, the taste of his own sock lint was disgusting and Al grimaced every time pieces of the glob passed over his taste buds. Second, Albert was so tiny that it was hard to distinguish him from a piece of lint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEd, I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s Albert and what\u2019s lint\u2026\u201d Al mumbled to his brother as he continued to break down the ball of lint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. If you lose him, just swallow everything! No one will miss him\u2026\u201d Ed explained as he relaxed back on his chair, enjoying the sight of his brother grimace at tasting a slave\u2019s usual meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Al\u2019s mouth, Albert started to stir and soon woke up. He found himself waking up to a completely different world than his master\u2019s toes. It was dark, hot, wet, and seemed to be moving nonstop! The tiny criminal was tossed all over Al\u2019s mouth via his tongue and was constantly smashed into the boy\u2019s cheeks, teeth, and other pieces of lint. He was soon covered in slimily salvia and still had no idea where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I think he woke up!\u201d Al said, feeling something move on his pink tongue. Albert heard it too, and almost went deaf from the volume of Al\u2019s voice. He watched light flood his prison as Al opened his mouth. Albert now realized where he was. Rows of huge teeth, a muscular and pink tongue, the smell of delicious pasta, and the sight of Master Edward looking in his direction from beyond the \u201cwindow\u201d. He was in Alphonse\u2019s mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Albert saw two giant fingers come into view and enter the mouth. The fingers moved around Al\u2019s mouth, brushing over his tongue and teeth. Al was probably looking for him, but at this size it would take a lot of luck to find him! Albert tried to move to run over to his god\u2019s fingers, but found himself glued in place by the sticky spit that coated Al\u2019s tongue. All the pint-sized speck could do was scream for help in a last ditch effort to get Al to find him. At his size, his voice just wasn\u2019t loud enough. It was all up to luck now\u2026and all Albert had was bad luck.</span></div></div>",

At his command, Ed took a deep sniff on Alphonse\u2019s feet. He felt his nostrils fill with the stench the feet gave off, as well as a few clumps of toe jam and lint. Ed tried to pull back to cough it back out, but Al used his feet to hold the shorter male in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, brother! You aren\u2019t leaving this position until I say you can!\u201d Al declared as he grinned down at his kneeling bro. Ed snarled in disgust, but continued to breath in Al\u2019s foot odor anyway. He knew it was only fair he do this, since he had Al eat one of their slaves (although he hadn\u2019t specifically told him to do that). However, this was the second time he was stuck servicing his little brother\u2019s feet. When was Al going to be the one kneeling before him? It was just so humiliating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHad enough of the smell, big bro?\u201d Al asked his brother as he clenched his toes around the boy\u2019s face. \u201cIn that case, it\u2019s time for you to get licking!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd couldn\u2019t help but give a small whimper hearing this. He reluctantly opened his mouth and brushed his tongue across Al\u2019s sweaty sole. He licked the soles a few time before his mouth was carrying a good amount of sweat and he was forced to swallow it before continuing. He grimaced as he gulped the liquid down, feeling it enter his stomach and washing over the spaghetti. Al moaned as he felt his brother\u2019s skilled tongue move between his toes and slurp up any toe jam left between them. Al had his eyes closed and focused on the sound Ed\u2019s tongue made against his warm feet. Every now and then is stomach made a gurgling sound, signaling that it was working on Albert and the pasta dinner. Mostly the pasta dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you and Roy were getting one heck of a show. You were both enjoying the sight of Edward worshiping his brother\u2019s feet with his tongue. Roy enjoyed it because his tormentor was finally finding out how it felt to be tormented. You were enjoying it because Al was showing that he could control his older brother so easily, which only increased your respect for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, brother\u2026\u201d Al asked, still leaned back in the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d  Ed mumbled a reply between licks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you would make a really good slave. You're already really good at this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay that again and I\u2019ll bite off your toe.\u201d Ed glared up at Al who just for a moment could have sworn he saw Ed\u2019s eyes turn a feral red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-right, brother. Sorry.\u201d Al stuttered and looked away from Ed, who had gone back to servicing his feet. After awhile, Al finally took his feet off Ed and allowed the older alchemist to take a breath of fresh air. Ed had really done a number on his feet; they no longer glistened with sweat, but instead with Edward\u2019s saliva. </span></div></div>",

Ed thought about where he should put the colonel this time, and quickly spawned one of his cruel ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess\u2026I\u2019m sleeping in the sock again.\u201d Roy predicted, giving a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, I think I\u2019ll be nice tonight. You can sleep on the bed with me.\u201d Ed replied, surprising the other alchemist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-? I\u2026uhh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Shy? We\u2019re already pretty intimate, if you know what I mean.\u201d Ed gave a sinister grin as he used his automail hand to grab his crotch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026just put me down, Fullmetal.\u201d Roy uttered, turning slightly red from the memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd flashed another grin before dropping Roy on the mattress and laying down himself. Mustang wasn\u2019t on the pillow, like you were, but instead somewhere on the bed near Ed\u2019s midsection. It might not have been as fluffy as a pillow, but it was a hell of a lot better than a smelly sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, goodnight, bug.\u201d Roy heard Ed say as the giant reached over and turned off the light. Roy listened to Ed rustle behind him as he got comfortable on his side. In a few minutes, Ed was fast asleep. Roy laid on his back and stared up at the ceiling, which he could somewhat see from the light leaking in through the window. The day hadn\u2019t ended on such a bad note. Sure, he was forced to lick Ed\u2019s <b>crotch</b>, but then he got a bath, a nice hot meal, and even some entertainment. Now it looked like he would get a well earned rest\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it happened. Ed, who had been sleeping soundly on his side, rolled over onto his stomach. Roy had mere seconds to watch as the ceiling was replaced by the young giant\u2019s six pack coming down on him. Roy tried to stop it with his hands, but it was like trying to stop a mountain. He was easily pinned underneath Edward as the teen unconsciously rolled on top of him. The cruel teen had known he would roll over if he tried sleeping on his side, and he had cleverly put Roy right in his way. It was unlike being pinned under his rank foot or underneath his arm, he was being forced into the bedding by Ed\u2019s massive bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamnit, Edward! Get off me!\u201d Roy shouted as he tried moving his arms as much as he could to whack against Ed\u2019s stomach. The shrunken man\u2019s efforts were in vain, however, as the Fullmetal Alchemist had abs of steel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humongous weight on top of him was never enough, though. Every breath Roy took through his nose came with the overpowering stench of Ed\u2019s teenage musk. It had all been trapped inside his shirt till now, and damn was it awful! Someone who sweated this badly should learn to take a shower every night. Roy felt his new bathrobe get drenched in body sweat and groaned in discomfort. Eventually, the military officer was able to drift off into sleep as well. Perhaps he just got too tired from struggling, or maybe the sound of Ed\u2019s gurgling stomach above him lulled him to sleep\u2026</span></div></div>",

How did they find out he was here so fast, and who knew Ed\u2019s younger brother was so strong\u2026he wasn\u2019t even in the military! The Major looked back up into the smug face of the teen alchemist. As he did, his eyes fell on something\u2026interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on\u2026what the heck is that?\u201d William asked, looking like he had just seen something impossible. Ed tilted his head in confusion, especially when his brother also glanced at him and his face went pale. They were looking right at\u2026his stomach. Edward\u2019s eyes went wide as he looked down at himself. There, plastered just above his navel, was the tiny Mustang, still sleeping soundly as if nothing was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, shit, shit!\u201d Ed cursed up a storm as he peeled the shrunken colonel off himself and stuffed him into his pocket. William Sullivan, however, had already seen plenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that\u2026Mustang?\u201d Sullivan asked, not believing his eyes. His face suddenly brightened up and a grin shot across his face. \u201cI knew it! You were behind it! You used some kind of size changing alchemy to shrink the colonel and then hold him captive! It all makes sense; that\u2019s how Colonel Mustang and Albert seemed to disappear into thin air. Amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd scowled at the military officer and, acting on impulse, clapped his hands together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, brother! You can\u2019t shrink him! If you do, they\u2019ll be three disappearances linked to you!\u201d Al shouted at his brother, making the older Elric stop his approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better listen to your brother, Edward Elric. You\u2019re better off turning me in. Oh, but wait, that won\u2019t do much either. Someone of my status won\u2019t get kicked out because of something as petty as trespassing. I\u2019ll get out with barely a slap on the wrist, and then I\u2019ll make sure both you and your brother are put behind bars!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSullivan, you bastard\u2026\u201d Edward grinded his teeth, glaring into the older man\u2019s amused face. It took a few seconds, but Ed eventually calmed himself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026you know, I could have a use for that talent of yours.\u201d William spoke up, grinning up at the young State Alchemist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a few\u2026problems in my life. It would help if the source of those problems were to just\u2026vanish. If you help me, I\u2019ll make sure the investigation\u2019s eyes are completely taken off you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the hell should I trust you, Sullivan?\u201d Ed asked, clenching his automail hand with enough strength to snap a human bone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a choice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward paused for a moment before letting out a sigh and telling Al to release the man. The younger Elric did so and Sullivan stood to his feet, dusted himself off, and fixed his glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of problems are we talking about?\u201d Ed questioned, keeping his golden eyes on the Major.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you the details tomorrow. Come to my office as soon as you get to headquarters. And remember, I hold you and your brother\u2019s fates in my hands, Fullmetal Alchemist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brothers watched Sullivan leave. When he was gone, no one said anything for awhile before Al spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d he began, but Ed cut him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now, Alphonse. I\u2019m tired. We\u2019ll talk in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ed turned around and entered his room, slamming the door shut behind him. All stood there in the hall for a dew moments more before entering his own room. You were still sitting on the bedside table, having listened to the entire conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl\u2026\u201d you mumbled to the giant as he picked you up and placed you back on the pillow before lying down himself. Before you could ask him anything, he turned his head around so you were looking at the back of his head. You sat there for awhile, wondering if Al was asleep, before dozing off yourself.  </span></div></div>",

Not saying a word, when you said good morning to him today he just mumbled as he picked you up. It's starting to make you feel not wanted. Finally you get fed up and decide to pout. When Alphonse sets down his and your's plate, you refuse to eat, hoping to get Al's attention. It works, you get plenty of attention! Though not the kind you wanted. \"I'm full, you can have the rest.\" Al says pushing his plate away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou 'hmph' and turn your nose up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl however, while not being a full blown genius and a big naive at times, isn't dumb enough to buy it. For the first time this morning he grins and impales a small piece of syrupy pancake on his fork and shoves it in your face. \"Mmmm...yummy!\" He says teasing you. Your stomach rumbles a bit, \"Oh well....Guess you aren't hungry.\" Al says as he slowly begins to bring the piece towards his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dive for the fork, but end up landing in the sticky pancakes on the plate! Al and you both have a good laugh at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Al gets over his laughing fit he decides you both need a bath and takes you into the bathroom, getting his hands sticky in the process.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You and Al are already in the bath together. You had both cleaned your hair with shampoo are currently relaxing in the tub and allow your hair to rinse. As you lay back in the warm water with Al\u2019s huge body looming over you, you decide to ask how he\u2019s doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you still gloomy, Al?\u201d you ask, watching his expression carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda.\u201d he replies, frowning. \u201cI\u2019m just worried Ed will be forced do some really awful things to protect me. He might not be shrinking plain criminals this time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least you have a brother that cares for you. I\u2019m an only child\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure your parents love you.\u201d Al says as he raises his head out of the water and smiles down at you. You nod happily as you watch Al\u2019s long hair droop over his shoulders. Water pours from it like waterfalls. He and his brother are both quite the lookers, but Al seems to give off a cute vibe that Ed doesn\u2019t. One thing you don\u2019t like is his gloomy expression, so you try to think of  away to get rid of it. Suddenly, you think back to last night when you watched Roy get (involuntarily) intimate with Ed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Al\u2026is there anything I can do to take your mind off Edward?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what, little guy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething like\u2026this.\u201d You take a deep breath and dive underwater. Al watches puzzled as you swim down toward his\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what are you-AAAH!!\u201d Al lurches forward when he feels something touch him \u201cdown there\u201d. His face goes red as he franticly stands up in the tub. He looks down and sees you hugging his shaft, hanging on tight as is bounces up and down.  \u201cMatt, what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTaking your mind off Sullivan and Edward. Is it working?\u201d you ask almost seductively as you start to lick his member. Al tries to resist but can\u2019t control the blood flow to his organ, making it harder by the second. He reaches his hands for you, but can\u2019t seem to reach you, as if being held back by an invisible barrier. He can\u2019t decide if he wants to grab you or his dick. \u201cSit back down, Al. Just try to relax.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl does as he\u2019s told and sits back down into the bath water, but making sure his penis is above the water. He watches as you climb up his shaft, licking and rubbing the sensitive skin. This isn\u2019t the first time Al had felt pleasure like this; it was one of the first things he wanted to experience when he got his body back. Now that someone else was doing it, someone MUCH smaller than him, made him feel weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatty\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026I have to\u2026\u201d Al replaces the last few words with moans and grabs his dick, helping you. By the time he begins stroking himself, you\u2019ve reached the head of his member and have begun licking it. You don\u2019t waste much time in crawling over to his slit and licking the inside of it. This doesn\u2019t throw Al over the edge like Ed, but does increase the intensity of his moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside the bathroom door, Mittens happened to be walking by when he heard Al\u2019s moans. The kitten curiously sits in front of the door and continues to eavesdrop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026Matt\u2026I\u2019m gonna\u2026I\u2019m gonna cum!\u201d Al shouts from beyond the doorway, followed by a loud and long moan. After that, the only sound that Mittens hears is Al\u2019s breathing. Getting bored, he gets back to his feet and walks off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bathroom, Al has his head resting against the fall. His face is covered in sweat and cum, plus you. The young alchemist\u2019s ejaculation had rocketed you off his dick and on to his face, right on top of his nose. Al seems to get his breathing under control and blinks his eyes open to spot your sticky self smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel better?\u201d you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah\u2026much. I had no idea you were so bold.\u201d Al chuckles a bit before picking you off his face and giving you a big kiss with his lips. The huge kiss covers most of your body in wetness, but you don\u2019t care. You just hug your big friend\u2019s lips as he licks his cum off your body. </span></div></div>",

After Al gets dressed he goes into the kitchen with you, once Mittens sees his master he rushes over to Al's feet and meows. <br>\r\nAl chuckles, putting you on the counter and picking up his cat. \"I'm sorry I haven't paid much attention to you lately, Mittens.\" Al apologizes and snuggles his face against Mitten's furry head. Mittens purrs in delight at the attention he is receiving. After much cuddling, Al puts Mittens down on the floor. \"Hmm....I think we've used most of our food in the fridge. I think we should go shopping for you some clothes, and some food, and Mittens a toy.\" Al says counting off the things on his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come shopping with you?\" You say jumping up from your seat on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl puts a finger to his chin and thinks, \"Hmm....I guess it couldn't hurt.\" Al says as he goes to the fridge and fills up a saucer and a bowl of food for Mittens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMittens looks up gratefully at Alphonse as Al gets his jacket and puts you in the pocket after giving you a little wink. Alphonse goes out the door and out into the street, he spots the doll shop and goes inside. He may have be able to make you clothes, but he would need materials, and it would be cheaper just to buy the clothes. When he goes inside he sees there are alot of little girls inside who are looking at him weird when he comes inside. He approaches the counter and sees the old man from before smiling back at him. \"Hey there Alphonse! Just the clothes again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl nods, \"I need two outfits, and um....can I have some privacy?\" Al says looking around for something like a dressing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.....sure....you can go back into the storage room to er....try them on.\" The old man says as Al picks out two outfits and swipes them from the now nude forms of the boy figures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Al's soft delicate fingers grip you and pull you out into the dimly lit room. He opens his other palm in front of you and shows you the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a bit, looking from one to the other, before you choose one. Al nods and puts you back in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making his purchase, Alphonse goes to the grocery store with you, then a pet shop. Soon the shopping is done, and Al is left carrying several bags.</span></div></div>",

Instead of heading back the way he came, the young alchemist decided to take a shortcut through the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think Mittens will like what I got him?\u201d Al asked you, looking down at his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet he\u2019ll like anything you gave him, Al.\u201d you reply, the both of you chuckling at the possible truth of the statement. Several minutes later, the two of you arrive at the center of the park. It\u2019s really busy around this part; there are parents taking their kids out to play, artists sitting down and sketching, couples sitting down and talking, and even some tourists taking pictures of the landmarks. One person stands out, however. Sitting alone on a nearby bench is a young boy, no older than thirteen. He\u2019s wearing a red cap that covers his chestnut hair and a white, dirty, sleeveless shirt along with a pair of baggy pants with several rips in them. His feet are dirty and bare and the boy seems to stare at them with lonely eyes. Occasionally he looks up to watch someone pass by, staring at the ice cream or sandwich they\u2019re holding. Al, being the kind pedestrian he is, walks over to the boy and sits down next to him. The child glances at Al, but is soon staring at his feet again. They both sit in silence for a few moments before Al speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you sit here often?\u201d Al asked, smiling at the younger boy. The boy doesn\u2019t even look at him and continues to stare at the ground. Al frowns at the lack of response, but continues to try and talk to the boy. \u201cMy name\u2019s Alphonse, what\u2019s yours?\u201d This time the kid looks up at Alphonse for a moment before once again looking at the ground. It seems like he\u2019s going to ignore the question again until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRobert.\u201d he replied, almost in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you Robert. Are you here alone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. I don\u2019t have anyone else\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026well, when was the last time you ate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026a few days ago.\u201d The boy clutches his stomach as it growls. When Al sees this, he reaches into the grocery bag and pulls out a loaf of bread. He hands the bread to Robert, who just looks at it and Al for a few seconds. With a nod from Al, Robert takes the bread and begins consuming it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d he manages to say between swallows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl smiles at the homeless boy before asking, \u201cSo you don\u2019t have anyone who can look after you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI used to have a dog. His name was Chester. He would always be at my side, but a year ago he got ran over by a car.\u201d Robert wipes his eyes with the back of his hand before taking another large bite of the bread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026do you like cats?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert nods and replies, \u201cMy grandma used to own a car, but she was really old and never wanted to play.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a kitten at home, his name is Mittens. If you want, I can let you play with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Albert looks at Al suspiciously, but the older male just laughs at the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not some creep. I\u2019m just a couple years older than you, believe it or not. So, what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I guess so. Is there more bread?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, yeah. I can make you a nice lunch of you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert smiles widely just before he finishes the brad in his hands. He leaps off the bench with Al and before long the two were walking off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me carry one of those for you.\u201d Robert offered, taking one of the bags from Al. The younger Elric thanked him and patted his head with his free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two boys made their way to the apartment, you were listening from within Al\u2019s pocket. You knew there was a big difference between bringing home a cat and bringing home a kid\u2026Ed wasn\u2019t going to like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after Al and Robert left the park, someone else arrived and sat down in the same bench they were sitting at. It was Edward, and the troubled teen wasn\u2019t looking so good. He took out three photos from his pocket and looked them over again. They were his three \u201ctargets\u201d from Sullivan, who wanted Edward to make then disappear with his shrinking alchemy. He didn\u2019t care what happened to them after they were shrunk, just that they never bother him again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first photo was of a young man William had identified as his brother, Johan Sullivan. The two of them were polar opposites. While William was a high ranking military officer, Johan was a simple owner of a simple fish market. So why did Sullivan want his own brother gone? The only reason he had given was that he hated his guts. It made Ed sick that he wanted his own brother to vanish\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second photo was of a twenty-year-old military officer, Colonel Carl Heinrich. Carl was a prodigy in the military, having made the rank of Colonel at just eighteen. Sullivan wanted him gone because, apparently, Carl was blackmailing him with some \u201cdirt\u201d he had picked up on the major. The colonel was using this information to prevent William from moving up in the ranks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third photo, and the worse of them all, was of a thirteen-year-old street urchin by the name of Robert Schneider. When Ed first saw the photo, he couldn\u2019t believe Sullivan wanted a child to disappear. The reason was even more ludicrous. According to Sullivan, the boy\u2019s dog had been run over by his car a year ago. Ever since, the boy had been harassing him every chance he gets. His tires were slashed on several occasions, his house sprayed with graffiti, dead pigeons left to rot on his doorstep, and much more. The major had never been able to pin any of these things on the boy, but knew he was behind it all. A year of this torment had finally pushed Sullivan to take such drastic action\u2026and he was using Ed to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe State Alchemist sighed as he put the photos back in his pocket. He couldn\u2019t think of anyway out of his situation other than to do as William says. The teen got up and made his way back into the city. Ed didn\u2019t want to see Mustang\u2019s face since last night, so he had stuffed the man in his armpit without even giving a reason. He felt the man struggle, but wasn\u2019t really in the mood to enjoy it\u2026</span></div></div>",

Robert's eyes nearly bugged out of his head at the sight of the nice interior. Robert looked up at Al's smiling face as if he was asking \"Really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl just smiled wider and nodded. Robert took a hesitant step into the house, his barefeet leaving dirty footprints on the floor. He walked slowly inside, turning this way and that to get a look at the place. But Alphonse took no notice of the boy's uncleanliness he just smiled at the kid's expression, one of a boy who hasn't had a real home in a long time. Robert nearly dropped the bag he was holding, but Al took it from him in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Robert?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Al?\" Robert said looking back at his new caregiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take a bath down the hallway. Not that you stink or anything\" Alphonse chuckled nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert's eyes lit up at the mention of a nice hot bath, he rushed down the hallway and soon the sound of water running was heard. Al sighed and began putting the groceries away. He felt you moving in his pocket and pulled you out. \"Hey Matty. Looks like we have a new friend!\" Alphonse said smiling widely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this Al? I mean, you were lucky with the kitten.\" You say crossing your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl frowns, \"Once he gets cleaned up I'm sure Ed will love him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe running water in the bathroom stopped and soon you both heard splashing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl got out the other loaf of bread and began to make sandwiches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert soon poked his head out of the door, \"Al? Can I don't have any other clothes.\" He frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl went over to the closet across from the bathroom and pulled out a towel, soon Robert had a bathrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Al!\" He says tying the belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, come out and get your sandwich!\" Al says and a immediately Robert races out into the kitchen and snatches up a sandwich. He raises it to his mouth and is about to take a bite when he sees you next to Al's, nibbling on the edge. At first glance you looked like some sort of pest that needed squishing, but then Robert sees that you are wearing clothes and sitting upright. He falls from his chair in surprise! \"Robert!\" Al says and rushes to his friend's aid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the heck is that!?\" He says pointing to you peering over the table at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl just laughs as he helps Robert up, \"This is Matt. He's a person just like us, only he's tiny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert approaches you cautiously and peeks at you with his big blue eyes, you are starting to feel uncomfortable with his staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert then smiles wide and says in an obnoxiously loud voice. \"Hi Matty!\" he says offering you his finger to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your ears are done ringing you take his finger and shake it as best you can. He giggles at your tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you've all eaten your fill, Al calls in Mittens, who hops up on his lap. \"This is Mittens.\" He says as he scratches behind his ears. \"Can I hold him?\" Robert asks. Al nods and hands Mittens to Robert, who gently sets him on his lap and begins to do what Al had been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMittens purrs and rubs up against Robert's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love cats.\" Robert says as Mittens closes his eyes and seems to go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl just flashes a grin, \"So do I.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edward checked the address he had been given and compared it with his current location. This was defiantly Crimson Creek, the store Sullivan\u2019s brother managed. Edward sighed as he braced himself for what he was about to do. After preparing, Ed pushed on the glass door and heard a chime as the door opened. The store was quite small and only had three customers at the time. One man was looking at fish behind a glass window, another man walked past Ed and made his way outside with a bag of produce. The third person, a woman, was talking to his target, Johan Sullivan. Johan was busy placing the woman\u2019s purchases in a plastic bag to notice Ed\u2019s arrival. The young dog of the military took this time to examine Johan more closely. He looked a bit like his brother; same dirty blond hair and a similar facial structure. He lacked the glasses the major wore and Ed noticed he was considerably more muscular than his scrawny brother who spent most of his time behind a desk (when he wasn\u2019t breaking into people\u2019s homes). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the woman left, Ed approached his target and Johan welcomed him with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to Crimson Creek, kid. How can I help you?\u201d he asked while drying his hands on a rag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not a customer.\u201d Ed replied before flashing his State Alchemist watch. Johan\u2019s expression completely changed and was now looking at Ed with distaste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe military, eh? What do you want?\u201d His tone of voice had also changed. He apparently wasn\u2019t much of a fan of the government. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here on behalf of your brother, Major William Sullivan.\u201d Ed replied, his tongue receiving a bad taste as he said the man\u2019s name. \u201cCan we speak someplace private?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWilliam? Oh, this should be good. Follow me.\u201d William\u2019s brother finished washing his hands and lead the elder Elric into the back room. The room was much colder than the main part of the store and several frozen fish hanged from the ceiling. Edward was glad he was wearing his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what does my brother want this time?\u201d Johan asked as soon as the two of them entered the back room, his back still turned to Ed. Instead of hearing a verbal response, he heard the sound of clapping followed by a faint \u201cSorry.\u201d and then two hands upon his back. The next thing he saw was a surge of blue light that engulfed him. The man covered his eyes with his arm as his body quickly shrank before Edward\u2019s eyes. In a few seconds the light faded and Johan stood the same size as Ed\u2019s past victims. At first the man was confused, but after spinning around he noticed Edward\u2019s giant boots in front of him. Johan strained his neck to look up at the gigantic teen that now towered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what\u2019s going on?! What did you do to me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd didn\u2019t answer immediately and just looked at the poor man with sorrowful eyes. This wasn\u2019t the same as shrinking a lowly scumbag; this was just a normal man that had to have a jackass as a brother. Edward closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. When his eyes opened, he was smirking down at the fish market owner with the same eyes he looked at all his victims with. If he was going to be forced to shrink people, the least he could do was try and enjoy it. Once someone shrunk, it didn\u2019t matter what their old life was like, they were his slave. That\u2019s what Ed told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSucks for you, little guy! William\u2019s gotten tired of you being around and wants you gone. So, I\u2019m here to fulfill the order!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy brother?! He told you to do this! Kid, he\u2019s insane!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Trust me, I know.</i> Edward through before reaching down and grabbing the tiny Sullivan. The muscular man tried to struggle, but Ed was far too strong for him now. The blond sat down in a nearby chair and used his free hand to take off his boot, revealing his bare foot. Ed shuddered a bit as he felt the cold air of the room hit his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, bug, you\u2019re now my slave! Instead of explaining it to you, let me show you what I do to my tiny slaves.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He could hear Johan gagging, he pitied the man, this wasn't like the other slaves, who more or less deserved to be tortured. This was an innocent guy who just had some bad luck. Johan looked up with teary eyes, though Ed couldn't tell whether it was from the smell or from his situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd almost lost it at the sight of the muscly man crying, but he just looked away and lowered his sweaty foot into the boot, on top of the tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd wiggled his toes, getting a good feel of Johan's body underneath him. Soon he was heading back to central to report to Sullivan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ed was in Sulivan's office he raised his foot out of his boot and pulled Johan out. Sullivan laughed at the state of his brother, making Ed have images of himself stomping Sullivan underfoot flash through his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, can I see him for a bit?\" Sullivan said wiping a tear from his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....That wasn't part of the deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSullivan scowled at the alchemist but said no more.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>One down, two to go\u2026</i> Ed thought as he exited Sullivan\u2019s office and began to think about his next target. He did not like the idea of shrinking a kid, not matter how much of a brat they were, so he decided to save Robert for last. He would instead track down Colonel Heinrich, the twenty-year-old army prodigy. He could just ask around headquarters, but that might make him seem suspicious when the colonel suddenly vanished. As the red-coated alchemist walked down the hall, he overheard two women speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, aren\u2019t you supposed to be at the training field today?\u201d the blonde one asked. \u201cI thought it was your turn to train the new recruits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cColonel Heinrich offered tot take my place. You know how that showoff is; he\u2019ll jump at the opportunity to display his marksmanship skills to the newbies.\u201d replied the brunette. Ed smirked at his luck and changed his direction, heading for the outside training field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside, Edward spotted several young recruits lined up before a single man in a blue military coat. The man was the same as the one in the photo; Carl Heinrich. He had messy auburn hair and a face that the woman would swoon over. Unfortunately, his smug attitude didn\u2019t make him very popular among his peers. It\u2019s only thanks to his superior skills that he was promoted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright guys, watch closely. This is how you shoot a gun.\u201d Carl said to the group of newbies as he turned to face the marksman target. He just stared at it for a few moments before whipping out his gun and immediately firing three shots. All three bullets hit the bullseye almost perfectly. Heinrich blew the barrel of the gun and twirled it on his finger before putting it back in its strap. The group of recruits rolled their eyes at the man\u2019s cocky attitude and clapped softly. \u201cOkay, now I want all of you to try. You won\u2019t be leaving this field until you each hit the bullseye at least once!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl waved to the group before getting out of their way. As they took aim and began firing, Carl noticed Edward watching from afar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one they call Fullmetal, aren\u2019t you? Wow, you are short!\u201d Carl laughed, unaware of the danger he had just put himself in. Ed felt a blood vessel pop in his head as he grinded his teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We just started talking and I already hate him.</i> Ed thought as he put his anger under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, what brings you out here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you see-\u201d Ed began, but Carl finished for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess; you want some marksman practice, right? You alchemists do pretty good with your abilities, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to always have a gun by your side.\u201d the colonel stated as he patted the gun strapped to his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about your height, either. Even a child can shoot a gun.\u201d Carl interrupted again, laughing as Ed\u2019s temper rose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That\u2019s it! I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m being forced to shrink him, he\u2019s no better than Mustang!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, sir, I have something important to discuss with you. Can we talk somewhere private\u2026and less noisy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, urgent is it? Very well\u2026\u201d Carl turned back to the group he was training. \u201cYou guys keep on practicing! I\u2019ll be back in a minute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new recruits seemed to breath a sigh of relief as the colonel left. They had no idea he\u2019d be out of their hair for more than just a minute\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was nearby, Edward and Carl entered one of the headquarters\u2019 indoor gyms. No one was using it, thankfully, allowing Ed to do the deed without any witnesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Fullmetal, what did you want to talk about?\u201d Heinrich asked as he turned around to face the younger man. When he did, however, he saw Ed grinning at him and clapping his hands together. Before the colonel could react, Ed had his hands on his chest and light engulfed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe alchemists have no need for guns when we can do things like this!\u201d Heinrich heard Ed say as he watched the short man seem to get bigger and bigger. Soon Ed was the one that was looking down at him! Not only that, but the gym itself was getting bigger too! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?! A-Am I shrinking?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! Who\u2019s short now, colonel?\u201d Ed boomed down to him as the expert marksman shrank down to his stomach, then his knees, then is heels. When the light faded, Carl was just like Roy: Colonel Insect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you just got demoted, shrimp!\u201d Ed laughed down at the tiny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou punk! I order you to turn my back immediately! I\u2019m your superior officer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t I just say you were demoted? You now hold the rank of slave! Congratulations!\u201d Ed continued to grin down at the shrunken man. Shrinking an innocent citizen was one thing, but bringing down someone who always acted high and mighty put a smile on his face. Carl didn\u2019t find it so humorous, though, as he pulled out his gun and started firing at Ed. Trigger happy little fellow, wasn\u2019t he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo bad for Heinrich, he was shooting Ed\u2019s automail leg. The bullets just deflected off him like they were made of plastic. Even if Carl had hit flesh, it would probably feel just like a bug bite to the giant. Edward lifted his black boot high into the air and stomped the ground hard, knocking the colonel off balance and making his gun slip out of his fingers. Ed quickly stepped on the small pistol and grinded it into dust. Heinrich watched in horror as his only weapon disappeared under the teen\u2019s foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that I\u2019ve taken care of that, lets get down to business. I\u2019m not too thrilled about going after my next target, so let\u2019s have some fun!\u201d Ed said down to the helpless little bug while towering over him. Without his gun, Heinrich was reduced to a frightened little man. </span></div></div>",

He\u2019s a really mean man.\u201d Robert replies as he gets and angry look on his face. Al\u2019s eyes widen at the mention of the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSullivan?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you know him?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he the guy who\u2019s causing Ed so much trouble?\u201d you jump in, looking up at the giant Al. Al nods to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo your brother doesn\u2019t like him either? He already sounds like someone I\u2019d like!\u201d Robert smiles toothily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like him\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Is it okay if he stays here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ed didn't reply, he just dug his hand into his pocket and pulled out the photo of the boy.

If we split up, we should be able to find him.\u201d Ed tells his brother.

If he tries to run away again, I might have to shrink him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl bit his lip before replying, \u201cIf it comes to that\u2026you\u2019ll change him back once we get home, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we can think of a way to take down Sullivan, then yes.

He placed Carl and Johan on the growth circle while placing an unconscious Roy on the table. After that, Ed preformed the transmutation and watched as the two men started to grow. When the alchemic reaction ended, both men were standing in the Elric\u2019s apartment and back to there normal sizes. Heinrich wasted no time in flashing Ed an angry glare before lunging at him. Ed responded by punching the colonel in the stomach and then kicking him to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust sit there and listen!\u201d Ed ordered, not losing his commanding voice just because his slaves had returned to normal. Carl, despite being taller than Ed now, was still a bit scared of him and sat on the floor with his head down. \u201cNow listen\u2026I didn\u2019t want to shrink you two; Sullivan forced me to with blackmail. I need your help to think of a way to take him down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy should we help you?\u201d Carl asked, looking up at Edward.

I won\u2019t have a choice unless you help me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl and Johan glanced at each other and then at Robert. The boy had tears in his eyes and they couldn\u2019t understand how someone would want him to disappear. After a few seconds, both men nodded and agreed to help Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now let\u2019s get down to business. Colonel Heinrich, Sullivan said you had some dirt on him and was blackmailing him. What is it, exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few years ago, back when he was Lieutenant Sullivan, he executed three officers without permission and then reported they were shot by the enemy. He thought there was no witnesses, but I had discovered the entire event was recorded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, brother! With that tape, we can send Sullivan to jail!\u201d Al said, smiling. Johan, however, shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if you did put him behind bars, he would still have the dirt on you. Nothing is stopping him from telling someone and alerting the higher ups of the military.\u201d Sullivan\u2019s brother explained, making Al\u2019s smile vanish. Was there anything they could do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. He wanted me to make three people disappear, and now it seems the only way to bring him down is to make HIM disappear.\u201d Ed said, not exactly bothered by this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck doing that.\u201d Carl muttered with a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019ll have another disappearance connected with you and they\u2019ll be storming your home in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026what if, my brother disappeared, but it wasn\u2019t Edward Elric that did it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are talking about?\u201d Ed looked at Johan, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if  you disguised yourself and shrunk William with a few witnesses present. They would immediately report that he was kidnapped, but the description they would give would not be yours. They would be looking for someone completely different!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile spread across Ed\u2019s lips as he said, \u201cYeah\u2026not only that, but they may look at this mystery shrinker as the one who caused the disappearance of Colonel Mustang! All eyes would be off us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis plan might work\u2026\u201d Carl jumped in, finally getting up from the floor. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, Major Sullivan is supposed to have a meeting with two Generals from the military to discuss the progress in Mustang\u2019s investigation. It would be the perfect time to strike.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd slammed his fist into his automail hand while making a wide, almost scary, grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, this plan is perfect! I\u2019ll disguise myself, sneak into headquarters, shrink Sullivan, escape, change out of my disguise, and them come back here. Bam! Both Sullivan and his mysterious shrinker disappear into the night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure this is okay, Johan?\u201d Al asked, looking at the muscular man with a frown. \u201cHe\u2019s your brother\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with this. We\u2019ve always hated each other, and I\u2019ve known for a long time that William is an evil man. Someone like that should not have so much authority; he should be shown his place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Ed nodded to Johan and turned toward the hallway. \u201cAl, I\u2019ll need your help with the disguise. We need to be really creative so no one will know it\u2019s me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing!\u201d Al looked down at Robert and smiled. \u201cCan you wait here with Matt and Roy? I think Mittens is hungry too.\u201d the young boy smiled and nodded, running off to get Mitten\u2019s food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026are we allowed to leave now?\u201d Heinrich asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but you have to promise not to tell anyone about this!\u201d Ed said, pointing his finger at the two men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be putting my brother in his place, I won\u2019t hold any grudges against you.\u201d Johan stated before heading for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like being near that foot of yours again. My lips with stay sealed.\u201d Carl assured before leaving as well. When both men were gone, the Elric brothers strolled off to Ed\u2019s room to begin preparations.</span></div></div>",

Like always, two tough looking guards were stationed at the entrance. Ed glanced over at Al as if to say \u201cYou ready?\u201d and Al nodded to his silent question. Al emerged from the brother\u2019s hiding spot and started to approach the two guards. The men exchanged annoyed glances as they saw Al approach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, kid, where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d one of the guards asked, blocking Al\u2019s path when he tried to get past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I heard there was all kinds of yummy foods inside Central\u2019s headquarters. Can I please have some, I\u2019m really hungry.\u201d Al put on his best sad face and rubbed his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! If you\u2019re hungry, kid, go dig in a dumpster like a good street urchin. Now get lost!\u201d yelled the other man, giving Al a light push. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut--\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said get lost, trash!\u201d the man yelled again and gave Al a stronger push, knocking him to the ground. Al gave the two guards an angry look. Both guards didn\u2019t like the look\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I like the look he\u2019s giving us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, let\u2019s teach this brat a lesson in respect.\u201d The guards started laughing as they approached Al, cracking their knuckles in an intimidating fashion. The last thing they saw was the poor homeless kid before them smirk before he disappeared. Al quickly maneuvered around the guards and struck them in the back of the neck. In a matter of seconds, both large men were face-first against the cement. Al turned to his brother and gave him a thumbs up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice going, Al!\u201d Ed said as he ran up to his younger bro and gave him a high five. \u201cI\u2019ll only be a few minutes. You should get out of here in case someone else comes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl nodded and watched Ed run into HQ. Giving one last glance at the unconscious guards, Al ran off in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n++++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you say there has been no progress in the search for Roy Mustang?\u201d an older man with grey hair and a large mustache asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d Sullivan replied, sipping from his tea. \u201cI suggest we start thinking about writing up a false report to hand in. Say he betrayed the military and joined Drachma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree. We can\u2019t simply say one of our top personnel vanished into thin air.\u201d said a middle-aged man with black hair. \u201cI will make sure it is done tomorrow. In the mean time\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two generals and Sullivan started to hear crashes and screams coming from outside. Before the could make a move to see what it was, the double doors of Sullivan\u2019s office were kicked in and certain disguised alchemist invited himself in. Ed put his hands on his hips and gave the three men a wide, smug grin. Sullivan knew that grin from anywhere\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be\u2026you\u2019re-!!\u201d the major began, but could not finish as Ed dove straight at him. The teen clapped his hands together in midair and placed them on Sullivan, tackling him to the ground in the process. The two generals watched as the two of them hit the floor and a bright light filled the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlchemy? He\u2019s an alchemist!\u201d one of the generals yelled. They couldn\u2019t see a thing until the alchemic reaction ended and they were allowed to stop shielding their eyes. They watched the mysterious, young hobo pick himself off the floor. The major was no where in sight\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What did you do to the major?\u201d the black-haired general inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe major?\u201d Ed repeated, disguising his voice by making it deeper than usual. \u201cOh, you mean him?\u201d Ed held out his hand to the two generals. Poor William had been shrunken and was now being held by the back of his coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?! I\u2019ll make you pay for this, Full-\u201d the tiny man screamed, but was silenced as Ed clutched him in his fist and muffled his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? H-How did you-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd didn\u2019t let the man finish as he gave them a farewell smirk and darted toward the window. The generals watched as Ed jumped right through the glass, shielding his face with his arms. They ran up to the broken window just in time to see the perpetrator disappear into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell just happed?\u201d the older man asked, unable to accept everything that had just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u201cwhat happened\u201d? William Sullivan was just kidnapped! Call the guards and tell them what we just saw!\u201d the black-haired man yelled, turning back to the window as his fellow general picked up the phone and started dialing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n++++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd arrived at the spot he and Al had agreed to meet at. Al was already there, and met his brother with a look of both worry and eagerness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? Did you do it?\u201d he asked, hoping nothing had gone wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Ed chuckled as he held out his fist and showed Al the much smaller Sullivan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe did it! I can\u2019t believe it actually worked! This is fantastic, brother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy yourselves while you can.\u201d Sullivan snarled as he struggled in Ed\u2019s powerful grip. \u201cThey\u2019ll find you and lock you both behind bars for this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey will? I don\u2019t see how, since they won\u2019t be looking for the Fullmetal Alchemist.\u201d Ed smirked down at Sullivan as he witnessed the man begin to understand the brothers\u2019 plan. Ed shoved Sullivan into his pants pocket and lead his brother to a nearby warehouse. There, Al removed their clothes from a bag he was carrying and the two brothers changed out of their hobo outfits. While he did this, Ed dropped the shrunken major into his boot before slipping his sweaty foot inside, ignoring the man\u2019s screams. After the disguises were disposed of, the Elric brothers casually left the warehouse and began heading home. Both had victorious grins on their faces the entire time\u2026</span></div></div>",

He sat up on the couch and stared down at you, you were starting to get uncomfortable when Edward and Alphonse came in the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert jumped up in excitement, nearly dropping you in the process.

Is he in there? Heheh!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd nodded and retrieved Sullivan from his boot.

Sullivan wiped the footwear from his eyes and look right at Robert\u2019s giant, youthful face. His own face went white with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You?!\u201d Sullivan cried, thrashing in Robert\u2019s hands. At his size, even this thirteen-year-old was leagues stronger than him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, me!\u201d Robert replied, grinning and squeezing the major tightly. Robert turned to the two blond brothers and asked, \u201cCan I go somewhere private with him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, you can use my room.\u201d Ed offered, leading the younger teen to his bedroom. Once there, Ed shut the door and Sullivan was all alone with the former street urchin\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting so long for this.\u201d Robert stated as he brought the shrunken major up to his face. \u201cI\u2019m finally going to get justice for Chester!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChester?! You mean that dog of yours? Listen, kid, I didn\u2019t mean to run him over! It was-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie, scum!\u201d Robert interrupted, raising his voice a tiny bit and putting the squeeze on the creep of a man, making him yelp. \u201cI saw what happened! Chester ran into the road and you saw him, but you didn\u2019t even try to slow down! You killed him and you didn\u2019t even stop! You probably thought he was just too petty and insignificant to slow down for!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSullivan trembled in the young boy\u2019s strong grip. He was completely correct; that dog wasn\u2019t worth anything to him. How would he know running over that dog would result in this situation? It was just some dirty brat\u2019s dog! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, guess what?\u201d Robert spoke as he got his emotions under control and wiped away some tears with the sleeve of his bathrobe. \u201cWho\u2019s petty and insignificant now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert smirked evilly as he bent down to place Robert on the floor. Instead of gently placing him down, he dropped him when he was still a few feet from the floor. Sullivan landed hard and cried out in pain. Nothing was broken, but if this kid continued to have his way with him, EVERYTHING might get broken soon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge earthquake shook the ground under Sullivan as Robert sat his butt down with a thoom. The former major craned his neck up as he looked the young giant in the face. Just yesterday, this kid was filthy and homeless, while he was powerful and held authority. Now, the kid was the one who was powerful while he was still dripping with Edward\u2019s foot sweat. How was that fair?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want a foot massage!\u201d Robert said out of no where, confusing Sullivan. When the major saw the boy\u2019s bare feet appear on either side of him, he wasted no time in running away from the towering teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No! NO!\u201d Sullivan chanted as he ran. A shadow suddenly engulfed him as Robert stomped down on him, pinning him under his warm foot. The boy snickered as he rolled Sullivan onto his back and took his foot off him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get any say, slave! Do what I say if you don\u2019t want me to get angry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSullivan wanted to cry, but his tears wouldn\u2019t have any effect on his boy. The major watched as Robert planted both his feet in front of Sullivan, soles facing him. Sullivan gulped under the boy\u2019s intimidating glare and wobbled over to the feet. He placed both his gloved hands on the boy\u2019s soft sole and started rubbing. Robert sighed deeply at the first touch, amazed at how good it felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026do it more!\u201d Robert ordered. Sullivan complied and rubbed the sole with all his strength. Robert wiggled his toes in excitement, loving the power trip this was giving him. Was this how Edward and Al felt when they played with one of their little slaves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, Sullivan would switch feet and rub the other one. He thought that if he obeyed, he might get the chance to escape. Deep down, however, he knew the chance of escape was probably zero percent. At best, he would probably be crushed for his crimes against these three giants\u2026but not before they had their fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several long minutes of massaging Robert\u2019s sweaty, warm feet, Sullivan was still going at it. Robert still looked relaxed and showed no signs of letting the major rest. Little did he know, the child was already plotting up more ways to take out his revenge on the little man\u2026</span></div></div>",

He opened the door and was greeted by Ed's smiling face. \"Hey kid, Care for a little company?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure...Come on in..It's your room!\" Robert said as Ed came inside, never taking his eyes off of Sullivan. Ed sat down on the bed with a sigh, he lifted his human foot and rubbed it with his fingers, groaning. \"The plan went off without a hitch, but it needed alot of footwork. I need a massage and a nice foot licking too! Know anybody who would be willing to do that, kiddo?\" Ed said grinning widely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert grinned too and held out Sullivan, Ed smirked and held out his automail hand. Robert placed the quivering former major into the cold metal palm. Which in turn enveloped itself around the pitiful man.

Ha!\" He laughed as he roughly shoved Sullivan's head between his big and second toe. Robert and Edward could hear Sullivan's pitiful screams, it was like music to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd really forced Sullivan's face into the sweaty pocket of flesh between his toes. All the while he and Robert laughed at his humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing the same with the rest of his toes, Ed brought Sullivan up to his face and saw that the man had been knocked unconscious by the smell! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd turned to Robert and got a nasty idea....</span></div></div>",

Robert watched as Ed lifted up his human arm and, in one quick movement, slapped the shrunken major into his armpit. Robert cringed at the wet sound Ed\u2019s flesh made when the tiny human was pressed against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s going feel like shit when he wakes up!\u201d Robert exclaimed, slapping his knee as he laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd chuckled as well while he slowly putt his arm down, savoring the feeling of the tiny man compress under his triceps. He turned to the younger teen and said, \u201cThere\u2019s more; follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd lead Robert out of his room and into the kitchen, where Al was. Ed entered the kitchen and saw Al washing his hands and smelled something delicious in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Al. Something smells good!\u201d Robert exclaimed, smelling the air and following it to the oven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s steak, I just put it in the oven. It should be ready in an hour or so.\u201d Al said as he dried his hands off and approached Ed. \u201cDid you come in here for Roy? He woke up a bit ago and I put him in my room to rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m not interested in Colonel Insect right now. I\u2019m preoccupied with Major Shrimp.\u201d Ed jested as he raised his arm and showed his brother the unconscious Sullivan. Al snickered at Sullivan\u2019s position, not showing any pity for the evil man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what did you come in here for then? Did you smell dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I was wondering you wanted to get some training in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Ed. It\u2019s getting pretty late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? Don\u2019t tell me you can only fight during the daytime, because you knocked out those guards with expert timing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I wanna see you two train!\u201d Robert shouted, looking at Al with a cute, innocent face. \u201cPlease?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, alright. I\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert jumped for joy and gave Al a hug. After that, the older alchemist and the hyperactive kid both ran outside to the back. Robert sat down on a nearby lawn chair and watched Ed do a few stretches. When Ed lifted his arm up to stretch it, he looked down at Sullivan to check on him. The little man was tightly secured in his pit via his blond hairs; he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. After a couple minutes, Al appeared from the door and approached Robert. He handed you over to the boy, who placed you on his leg to watch the two brothers train. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember, brother! Whoever loses has to do something for the winner.\u201d Al reminded his brother as he took his place in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know. That\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m going to win this time! I\u2019m not going to act like your servant a third time!\u201d Ed shouted at his brother, clenching his fist in determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d Al replied, grinning as they both took up their fighting stance. The two blonds stared at each other for what seemed like a full minute before beginning the sparing match. Robert was almost blown out of his chair when the first punches were thrown. He knew these teenagers were martial artists, but seeing them move the way they did was mind-blowing! They moved so fast that Robert found himself unable to keep up a few times. By the intensity of their fighting, one wouldn\u2019t believe they were just training and not really trying to hurt each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! I hope they teach me to fight like that someday.\u201d Robert muttered under his breath as he became transfixed on the fight. You were also in awe as you watched the Elrics train. You had watched them before on TV, but actually being this close to them was a whole new experience. You were glad you had front row seats this time and weren\u2019t trapped in Edward\u2019s armpit like before. This time, it was Sullivan who was in that situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Sullivan, the man was lucky to be unconscious during the whole ordeal. Ed\u2019s quick moves repeatedly pressed him deep into the sweaty pit. His luck ran out when one squeeze was so tight it woke him up. He was conscious for about three seconds before Ed swung his arm down and slapped him into his underarm. The force of the blow combined with a monstrous stench even worse than the teen\u2019s feet knocked the investigator back into dream land. </span></div></div>",

Even though Sullivan hated being laughed at, this was his chance to try and escape. While the trio were occupied with their laughing fit, Sullivan dashed across the coffee table. His captors saw him running, but didn\u2019t look worried at all. They watched Sullivan run away from their gigantic forms before he came to a sudden halt upon reaching the edge of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnd of the line, Sullivan. Unless you want to try jumping from that high up.\u201d Al said as he leaned toward the scared little man. \u201cNow come here; I want a turn to play with you!\u201d Sullivan watched as Al\u2019s enormous hand reached out to grasp him. Refusing to be passed around like some kind of toy, Sullivan decided he would rather die then live another moment as these three\u2019s play toy! With his mind made up, Sullivan jumped off the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, he actually jumped!\u201d Ed exclaimed, his attention grabbed. Sullivan braced himself for the ground, but found the landing to be a lot less painful they he thought. This was because a small rug had been placed under the table, which Sullivan landed on with nothing but a couple bruises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick, grab him!\u201d William heard Robert shout as the sound of the three giant\u2019s feet stomping toward him filled his ears. Sullivan pushed himself off the ground and rushed for the first thing he saw: a pile of alchemy books left on the ground by Edward. Sullivan ran into his fortress of paper, disappearing from the teens\u2019 sights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw him run in here! Help me look through them.\u201d Al said to the other two as the three boys got onto their knees and started fishing through the pile of research material. By the time they started, Sullivan had craftily sneaked out of the book pile and dove underneath the rug he had landed on. The tiny bump that now appeared on the rug went unnoticed by the three teens. Eventually, Sullivan crawled himself out of the run and resumed running toward the only means of escape he knew: the door. He had barely gotten anywhere near it when\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, he\u2019s not there!\u201d Ed cried out, tossing the book he was holding back into the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has to be around here somewhere! Those tiny legs couldn\u2019t have brought him far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys nodded to each other and got to their feet to search the living room thoroughly. Sullivan cursed under his breath and scrambled behind a nearby lamp. He leaned against the lamp and caught his breath. He wasn\u2019t fit for this kind of stuff\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I have an idea!\u201d Ed suddenly said, smirking. \u201cWhoever finds the shrimp gets to be the one to smush him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Robert cried, looking up from the rug he was inspecting. \u201cBut I hardly got to torture him at all! I still  a bunch of ideas left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink about it, kid. You got to look down at him for once. Imagine how he must have felt looking up at your giant body! Realizing how pathetic and puny he was must have been punishment enough, right?\u201d Ed explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you're right.\u201d Robert replied. Even if his revenge against Sullivan was cut short, it was almost certain that as long as he hanged out with these alchemist brothers, another shrunken victim would come along for him to toy with. \u201cI still want to be the one to squish him, though!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you better get looking then.\u201d Ed flashed the boy a grin before they both resumed their search. Sullivan hugged himself and tried to stop himself from shaking. This was it\u2026he was doomed. Trying to run to the door while the trio was searching the room like hawks was suicide! Even if he didn\u2019t move, it was just a matter of time before he was found and crushed like\u2026like\u2026like a bug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be the end!\u201d Sullivan told himself, furiously running his hands through his hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t climb through the ranks to be stepped on like an insect! I\u2019m not an insect! I\u2019m Major William Sullivan!\u201d </span></div></div>",

Maybe if you get on your knees and beg loudly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Sullivan fell to his knees onto the floor and began weeping and begging for his life like the coward he was. \"Please E-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me master!\"  Edward thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSullivan gulped, \"M-Master....Please spare me!!

I promise to-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me finish!\u201d Ed raised his voice, but said it quiet enough so the other two boys didn\u2019t hear him. \u201cI can\u2019t let Al or Robert know you\u2019re still alive; they want you dead. Therefore, I\u2019m going to shrink you even smaller and keep you as a secret slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-smaller? B-but-!\u201d Sullivan mumbled, but the thunderous sound of Ed clapping his hands together brought an end to his whimpering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201d Ed grinned as he slowly brought his palms over William. \u201cSlaves that get this small don\u2019t usually have a long \u201clifetime\u201d. Good luck!\u201d And with that, the former military officer was covered with the alchemist\u2019s\u2019 palms and blinded by blue light. Ed kept the alchemic reaction between his hands, making sure the two other males didn\u2019t see or hear anything. When Edward removed his hands, the light faded and Sullivan was a mere half-inch\u2026a speck to the cruel teenager. \u201cHehehe, yeah\u2026that size fits you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSullivan trembled under the shadow of the titan before him. The alchemist could crush him with nothing but his toe now. It didn\u2019t matter if he lived or died now\u2026he was dead to the world. He watched hopelessly as Ed bent down and pinched his frail body between his fingers. Ed brought the puny man up to his face, gave him a satisfied grin, and shoved him into his armpit. Sullivan was so small that he didn\u2019t even need to touch the young man\u2019s flesh; he was slumped over a few of the tree-like hairs and glued to them by the sweat coating. Ed put his arm down, trapping the major in darkness. When Edward walked into the kitchen, he saw Robert and Al on the floor, playing with mittens using a toy ball Al had gotten him during his shopping trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you do it?\u201d Robert asked, his attention fully on Ed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup!

Ed did as he was told and left the kitchen with a paper towel in hand. A few seconds later, he reentered the kitchen and chucked the paper towel into the rubbish as if he had actually cleaned something up with it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, is dinner almost ready?\u201d Ed asked, loving the smell of that steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite yet.\u201d Al replied, checking the timer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026looks like I\u2019ll have to find something else to do until then\u2026\u201d </span></div></div>",

I finally beat you and I want my prize! Don\u2019t chicken out on me, Al.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026\u201d Al gave in and picked himself off the floor.

The younger blond gave him a nasty glare, as if to say \u201cAnd I DON\u2019T want you to watch.\u201d. Robert got the message and sat back down as the two brothers left the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do I have to do?\u201d Al asked his brother as he followed him into his room. Ed didn\u2019t respond and instead tugged his tank top over his head, tossing it on the floor somewhere. \u201cUm\u2026Ed?\u201d Al asked again, but his brother still didn\u2019t answer him and instead walked over to his bed and laid himself down on it, back facing the ceiling. The elder brother rested his chin on his arms and flexed his back muscles, hearing them crack uncomfortably. Finally, he spoke\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoing Sullivan\u2019s dirty work, beating up a bunch of guards, and winning a sparing match\u2026I\u2019ve had a long day. My back is all tense, mind loosening it up for me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you want me to massage your back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I have to spell it out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl shrugged and approached his brother\u2019s bed, pulling up his sleeves as he did. A backrub didn\u2019t sound too hard. It sure beat rubbing his feet. Once Al was standing over his brother\u2019s body, he cracked his fingers and got to work. Ed felt his brother dig his fingers into his skin and grunted in response. The younger brother began massaging his brother\u2019s broad back, loosing up his tense muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little to the left, Al.\u201d Ed said as he closed his eyes, focused on the amazing feeling his brother was giving him. As Al continued to massage his brothers back, he happened to get a strong whiff of the air and almost gagged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEd, your B.O. is horrible!\u201d Al said, coughing a bit from the smell. He now understood one of the reasons Ed wanted him to rub his back. With no shirt on, the sweat he had accumulated all day was free to unleash its unholy stink on Al. Al moved one hand off Ed and noticed it was covered in greasy sweat. \u201cYou really need to take a shower!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, soon. Maybe tomorrow\u2026or the next day.\u201d Ed mumbled, not really listening to his bro. \u201cKeep rubbing. Lower this time.\u201d Al sighed and did as he was told. Upon moving down to the area just above Ed\u2019s buttocks, his brother suddenly moaned in delight. \u201cOh yeah! Right there. Scratch right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl obeyed and scratched Ed\u2019s back, feeling the muscles under his fingertips flex to life. This continued for about fifteen minutes until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough.\u201d Ed said, earning a pleased response from Al. Ed got off his stomach and sat up on his bed. \u201cYou did good, Al.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you\u2019re happy.\u201d Al replied, sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m done now, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smirked at his brother and said...</span></div></div>",

Ed felt like playing with Sullivan some more and lifted his human arm to check up on him. Unfortunately of him, the smell of his B.O. was far too strong for the speck-sized Major and William was out cold. \u201cThat\u2019s no fun\u2026\u201d Ed whined as he out his arm down again and stood up. If Sullivan wasn\u2019t going to offer him any amusement, there was someone else who could. With a grin on his face, the blond alchemist left his room and strolled down the hall toward Al\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was there, he entered the similar room to find just what he was expecting. There on Al\u2019s perfectly made bed was Roy\u2019s sleeping form. Mustang looked so peaceful sleeping, Ed almost didn\u2019t want to wake the bug up. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough time to rest, Colonel Insect. Time to get back to your slave duties!\u201d Ed called as he approached the sleeping Colonel. Ed roughly snatched Roy into his steel fist and brought him up to his evil looking face. Roy, however, was still sleeping. He had spent the entire day in Ed\u2019s armpit, so the man was completely tuckered out. It wasn\u2019t going to be easy to wake him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said it\u2019s time to get back to your slave duties, colonel!\u201d Ed said again as he squeezed and shook the shrunken alchemist. The man twitched a bit in his fist, but would not wake up. Ed was starting to get annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, have it your way, sleeping beauty.

Without a second thought, Ed released his superior\u2019s leg and dropped the tiny man into his gaping mouth. If Al had walked into the room at that moment, he would have thought Ed had just devoured the Colonel. Once he was inside, Ed closed his mouth and began swishing his slave around like a piece of hard candy. He found the human being to be surprisingly tasty\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about twenty seconds before Ed started to feel Roy stir in his mouth. Before long the colonel was screaming and thrashing about. Ed chuckled cruelly, but kept his bug in his maw a bit longer. Eventually he spat Roy into his steel hand and curled his cold, metal fingers around his slave.

Mustang couldn\u2019t believe how much gunk had accumulated between Edward\u2019s toes since he had taken a shower. Ed was a god alright; a god of uncleanness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026look at all that toe funk.\u201d Ed whispered as he wiggled his toes, enjoying the feeling of his toes rub his crusty toe jam together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a damn shower?!\u201d Roy yelled, still plugging his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy so soon?

Because I told you to, bug!\u201d Ed replied before using his other hand to pinch Roy around the waist. In one quick movement, he pushed the shrunken military man between his smelly toes. When he removed his fingers, the toes clamped themselves around the man\u2019s small form. Roy tried to struggle free, but Ed\u2019s digits had a tight grip on him. It was like Major Armstrong had caught him in a bear hug\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop struggling, shrimpy. We\u2019ve been over this: I\u2019m your new master and you\u2019re my slave.

The Colonel lapped up the combination of dead skin, sweat, and who knows what else. After a few licks, his mouth was full of the disgusting junk and he swallowed it with a pained expression. Ed smiled evilly and folded his arms over his chest while he watched. He could tell that the alchemist wanted to finish his little appetizer quickly, as it only took about two minutes before the pocket between his toes was licked clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone already? Good boy, you must have really enjoyed that.\u201d Ed plucked the Colonel out from between his toes and brought him to face level. \u201cSo, how was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was delicious. Just freaking delicious.\u201d Mustang replied sarcastically as he spat some stands of lint out of his mouth and tried desperately to wipe the bad taste off his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you liked it. That\u2019s all for now, though. You still need to have room for supper, or else Al will know I fed you already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. Can I go back to sleep until then? I\u2019m stick tired from being in your armpit all day!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell no! There\u2019s still time to kill!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ed released his hold on the shrunken male and watched him plummet to the wooden floor. Roy screamed as the ground quickly got closer and closer. Before gravity carried him too far, Ed swung his foot off the ground and curved it so Roy landed on his pants leg. The impact was  a lot less worse than if he had hit the ground, but it still hurt. The elder Elric didn\u2019t give him enough time to rest, though, as Ed planted his foot back on the ground and forced Roy to cling to his pants to prevent plummeting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, look at you! Clinging to your mighty master like a pathetic slave. How cute.\u201d Ed taunted, making Roy glare up at him. Ed put his hands on his hips and started down at the tiny creature that was holding onto his leg for dear life. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, shrimp, you can choose what happens next. You can take the easy way out and climb down to the floor. Someone like you should at least be able to manage that. If you do that, however, you\u2019re going to have to worship my foot until dinner\u2019s ready. That could be an hour or more! If you don\u2019t want to worship my foot, then you\u2019re going to have to climb up the rest of my body. If you manage to get to my shoulder, I\u2019ll go easy on you for the rest of the night. What\u2019s it going to be, Colonel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy didn\u2019t know what to do. He didn\u2019t want to spent an entire hour or more worshiping this brat\u2019s foot, but could he climb up this living mountain? One wrong move and he would plummet to his doom. Even if he survived, Ed would probably make him worship his feet as the price for failure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up and decide, shrimp! If you\u2019re not quick enough, I\u2019ll just shake you off!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Ed kept his finger pressed against his slave\u2019s head so he wouldn\u2019t chicken out half-way through the act. As Roy continued to make out with his former underling\u2019s sole, he felt the need for some air and accidentally sucked in a large portion of foot sweat. He gagged and choked and the giant Ed felt his slave fight against his finger. Understanding what the Colonel had done, Ed laughed and let the alchemist have some air. Roy pushed himself off the sweaty sole and coughed hysterically. When he was done, he grabbed both his knees for support and took a breather. Ed watched the entire thing from his seated position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Colonel Insect? I thought someone with your looks would be a better kisser.\u201d Ed said, failing to flatter the smaller male. \u201cTake a breath and then get back to work! I want you to kiss as much of my sole as you can reach at your measly height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy nodded and when he had caught his breath, walked back over to his master\u2019s sole to continue. When he had pressed himself back against it and began giving every inch he could reach a quick peck, he realized how quickly he had agreed to Ed\u2019s demand. The old him would have at least expressed his distaste somehow. Was he starting to become adapted to this life as a slave? No way! That was impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roy thought about his situation, Ed watched the tiny bug plant kiss after kiss onto his filthy sole. Even though he wasn\u2019t smooching it anymore, Ed could tell Mustang wasn\u2019t enjoying a moment of this. Still, he put up less of a fight then usual, so perhaps he was finally starting to break. It was only a matter of time before the torture and humiliation became too great and the Flame Alchemist broke completely. He would soon BEG for the chance to smell his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of watching the small alchemist kiss away, Ed moved his foot so Roy was no longer leaning against it. He positioned his big toe right in front of Roy\u2019s face and wiggled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne last smooch for my toe, Roy. Give it a nice wet one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy resisted showing his anger at Ed and just looked at the floor. He couldn\u2019t find the courage to stand up to someone who could destroy him with just the toe he was being asked to kiss. He wanted to glare at Ed, but he feared worse torture. Without giving himself any more time to hesitate, Roy pressed himself against the big toe and pressed his lips to it. Ed shuddered in pleasure as he felt the bug use his tongue to brush against his sensitive skin. When Roy was finished, he pulled back and a trail of spit/sweat connected him to the toe. Ed laughed out loud and wiped the saliva off his toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job, slave. You\u2019re starting to get the hang of this.\u201d Ed said before glancing over at the clock. \u201cIf I\u2019m right, Al should be calling me for dinner any minute now. Before he does, how about you and me make another deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d Roy asked as he wiped his mouth off in his sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I want you to get on your knees and verbally tell me how small and pathetic you are and how big and awesome your master is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-? What?!\u201d Roy yelled, shocked. Ed had humiliated him to no end, and now he wanted him to humiliate himself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll let you sleep somewhere nice tonight. If you don\u2019t, then I\u2019m going to tie you to my foot for the night! It\u2019s your choice.\u201d Roy watched as the giant picked himself off the floor and planted both his humongous feet on either side of him. Ed put his hands on his hips and stared down at the shrunken colonel. \u201cMake your decision, bug. Your god is waiting\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

It only lasted a second before Al brought his face away and noticed the puzzled expression on you.

That\u2019d be fine.\u201d Al once again lowered his face down to you until his lips were leveled with you. You walked across the younger Elric\u2019s palm until you could hug his bottom lip and give it a quick kiss of your own. The two of you separated again and Al touched his lips with his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026that was my first kiss.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, mine too.\u201d you say, also touching your lips. \u201cSo\u2026does this make us a couple?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?

Would you mind if I was your tiny boyfriend?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl looked like he was about to cry and just shook his head. The next thing you knew, the hand you were standing on rushed toward Al\u2019s body as your new boyfriend hugged your small form. You giggled and snuggled into the boy\u2019s chest, listening to his heart beat underneath his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, Al.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too, Matt.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl gave you another smooch to the top of the head as the two of you just stayed in that position for a while.  </span></div></div>",

This was bad news for Albert, who felt each one of the giant alchemist\u2019s stomps as he matched across the sidewalk. By the time Ed reached the apartment, Albert felt like his body would collapse under Ed\u2019s foot after just a few more minutes. As Edward walked through the door, he noticed his brother wasn\u2019t waiting for him like usual. The light was on in his bedroom, so he was probably in there. Too pissed off to even greet his brother, Ed stormed into his room, shut his door, and started stripping off his jacket and boots, removing the two shrunken males in the process. Roy and Albert were roughly discarded onto Ed\u2019s messy bed like a couple of toys. Roy struggled a bit to get back to his feet, still covered with Ed\u2019s pit sweat. There was nothing he could do to wipe himself off, and Ed would surely get angry if he tried cleaning himself with the bed sheets. Albert, on the other hand, did not have the physical strength of a military officer and couldn\u2019t even manage to sit up. The tiny teen was far too exhausted to do anything but take in the fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd, in his tank top, put his hand son his hips and glared down at his two slaves. With a sinister smile, he said, \u201cWell, bugs, in case the ride home wasn\u2019t enough to show you, I\u2019m really pissed off right now. I need a couple slaves  to help relieve me of some stress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo your worse!\u201d Roy shouted up, surprising Ed a little bit. \u201cI heard your entire conversation with Sullivan. He\u2019s on to you and it\u2019s only a matter of time before you\u2019re caught!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd just grinned at Roy, not showing any worry, and replied, \u201cOn any other day, I probably would punish you for using that tone of voice with me immediately. Lucky for you, I still have to teach my new slave a few things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbert\u2019s eyes shot open a she heard this, knowing the giant was referring to him. No matter how much he told his limbs to move, they would not budge. He just watched with teary eyes as Ed grinned down at him and picked him up with his automail hand. As he brought the small criminal to his face, he raised his human arm over his head and burrowed his face into his armpit. A few seconds later, he recoiled in disgust with some grease smeared on his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPee-yew! It reeks in there, even after Roy spent a couple hours soaking up the sweat. I guess I need some deodorant.\u201d Ed finished his sentence by giving Albert a nasty smile. The tiny, frightened man practically gapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no! Please don\u2019t! I don\u2019t want to!\u201d Albert pleaded, struggling weakly in Ed\u2019s iron-like grip. The blond teen ignored his protests and sin one quick movement, shoved the shrunken slave into his sweaty pit. The Fullmetal Alchemist started rubbing Albert into in armpit just like he would a stick of deodorant. He listened to his slave scream in desperation and responded to it by twisting the boy into his slightly hairy pit, shutting him up nicely. As he continued to apply his \u201cdeodorant\u201d to his smelly underarm, the cruel giant walked over to his mirror and watched himself. He smugly smiled back at himself, as if saying \u201cYou\u2019re one BIG guy, Edward. Everyone else are bugs to you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of taking his frustration out on the scumbag, Ed felt like Albert had soaked up most of his sweat and tossed him onto the bed. The teen was barely conscious, his skin bright red from the heat of Ed\u2019s pit and his clothes drenched in his sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re turn, Colonel Insect!\u201d Ed said as he reached for Roy, but a loud rumbling sound stopped him. It took him a few moments to realize it was his own stomach. He touched his gut as a frowned spread across his face. \u201cI was having so much fun with you bugs that I completely forgot I didn\u2019t even eat lunch today!\u201d Ed glanced over at the clock and noted it read 9:30 PM. \u201cIt\u2019s dinner time too\u2026I need something to eat\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

You need to be punished, and I\u2019m sure my big brother knows how to do it.\u201d Al said, tossing the weapons aside and getting a closer look at the three thugs.

The three thugs suddenly became really fearful. They had heard stories of the Fullmetal Alchemist, and now they were going to be punished by him? What rotten luck\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Al made it to the apartment building and walked up the stairs with his three followers. He opened the door leading to his apartment and spotted Ed still studying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m home, brother.\u201d Al said, making Ed look his way. His eyes fell on his brother first\u2026and then his three companions. In chains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlphonse, explain. Now.\u201d Ed ordered. \u201cBringing home a kitten is one thing, but you can\u2019t just bring every street urchin you find home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Ed. These guys were robbing an old man! I stopped them and brought them here to be punished, if you know what I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd\u2019s lips curved into a smirk as he replied, \u201cNice thinking, little bro. Mind helping me in the kitchen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Al watched his brother stand up and leave the room. The younger Elric called Mittens over and put the new collar around the feline pet. He pet the small animal a few times before following his brother into the kitchen. The group of thugs were left in the living room, alone save for the small kitten. Mittens gave the three men a glance and hissed at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the Elrics returned holding a few glasses of water. Ed held two in his hands while Al carried one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys look like you could use a drink. How about some water?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget it! That stuff\u2019s probably poisoned or something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoisoned? Yeah right. Have you ever heard the Fullmetal Alchemist using poison? Tell you what; just drink the water and you can leave.\u201d The older Elric lied. The three thugs gave each other a glance and finally agreed to take the liquid. Even with their hands bound, they could still hold the glasses up to their mouths to take a drink. The water tasted funny, but the three thought nothing of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re a lot shorter than I thought.\u201d one of thugs said as he handed his glass back to Ed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, you really shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d Ed said with a smirk, just as the three began to shrink. While they had once been looking down at Ed, they now found themselves looking up at him. The cuffs around their wrists slipped off and hit the floor with a loud clang. The three young thugs continued to dwindle down until they had shrunk to the same size as Roy. Before the thugs could even realize what had happened, they noticed Ed lift his human foot off the floor and hover it over the thug that had called him short. With a quick stomp, the foolish male was pinned under Ed\u2019s sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow who\u2019s short?\u201d Ed asked, squeezing the smaller boy\u2019s head with his toes and making him scream for mercy. The other two boys looked up in shock and confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to us?!\u201d another one of the thugs shouted up at the giant teen. Ed responded by raising his automail foot over him and stomping down on him too, pinning him under it. It didn\u2019t smell like his flesh foot, but the pressure was immense. It would only take a tiny bit of strength to pop the thug like a grape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shrunk you, losers!\u201d Ed told them, wiggling his metal toes. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re going to be punished for picking on a defenseless old man! You were probably going to kill him, weren\u2019t you? You deserve to be stains on our feet or just some more meat in our stomachs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, no!\u2019 begged the leader, the only one left not being pressed into the floor by a giant foot. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to kill him! We were just roughing him up a bit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell you\u2019re lying. We\u2019ll see how good you are as slaves before we decided on your fate.\u201d Al told the smaller, older man. \u201cWhat to do first\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Ed was about to go after him, when who else but Mittens ran in front of the fleeing man, probably thinking he was a mouse that his owners had neglected to pin under their feet. The leader stopped dead in his tracks as he saw the gigantic kitten loomed over him, staring down at him with those cat eyes, he looked ferocious at that size, worse, he looked hungry! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd looked down in surprise, he couldn't help but chuckle at the evil man's situation. \"Little man, meet Mittens!\" Ed laughed evilly. Al didn't know whether to help the man or let his cat eat him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thug leader turned and ran in the other direction, towards the boys' feet. The cat was right behind him, he could hear it's thundering footsteps. So he took a literal leap of faith and dove forward....landing his face between Ed's recently washed, but still foul toes. His legs were kicking and hitting David, who was still under the same foot, in the face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two who were underneath Ed's feet, shuddered in fear at their leader's muffled screams of horror and despair. Ed however, clutched his gut in laughter. \"WAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" Ed's thunderous and ear shattering laughter made the two cringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMittens however looked disappointed at his lost meal, he meowed sadly up at Al who smiled, \"Aww....Don't worry Mittens, I'll fill up your bowl and you can eat that okay?\" Al chuckled, picking up the kitten and taking him into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd finally stopped laughing and realized that the man was smothering, he spread his toes and let the man fall back on top of David. The man's face was covered in greasy sweat from Ed's feet. Ed lifted one foot off of David, and lifted the other off of Leon. He picked them all up in his human fist, and took them over to the couch. </span></div></div>",

The only thing you have to do is watch\u2026unless you don\u2019t want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I can\u2019t look weak in front of our slaves. I\u2019ll sit here and watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get started then.\u201d Ed used his automail hand to grab the leader by his head and tug him free of his tight grip. He then held the young creep in his metal fist and looked at him sternly. The elder Elric licked his lips and spoke, \u201cI don\u2019t usually eat dirty filth, but it\u2019s the easiest way to do away with you without leaving much of a mess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please! I just did the things I did to get by! You can\u2019t end my life after everything I\u2019ve had to go through!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour own rotten life doesn\u2019t give you the right to make others suffer. I doubt they had anything to do with your situation. I can see it in your eyes; you\u2019ve killed people before, haven\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader stuttered a bit, but didn\u2019t deny it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that settles it. Scum like you is better off this way. Down the hatch!\u201d Ed exclaimed before opening his mouth wide and bringing the leader closer to it. The thug struggled and screamed curses, attempting to free himself from Ed\u2019s metallic grip. His efforts ended in failure and he was casually tossed into the teenager\u2019s mouth. Ed shut his jaws and sloshed the creep around his wet mouth. He continued to struggle to survive even when Ed tilted his head back and took a big gulp. The two other horrified thugs and Alphonse watched as Ed\u2019s Adam\u2019s Apple bobbed and a small bump made its way down the alchemist\u2019s throat. Ed tracked its position with his finger until he couldn\u2019t feel it anymore. He was in his stomach now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad for scum.\u201d Ed commented, rubbing his stomach through his shirt. \u201cI can feel the little shit moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl leaned over and lifted his brother\u2019s shirt up, pressing his ear against the six pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can hear him screaming. He sounds like he\u2019s in pain.\u201d Al said, taking his head away and frowning a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Think about what you\u2019ve done while you digest, bitch.\u201d Ed gave his gut one last pat before he started to ignore the struggles. \u201cWhere\u2019s the other two squirts, by the way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight here.\u201d Al reached into his pocket and fished out their other two slaves. Both of you had heard everything that had happened and were equally as horrified as the thugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you, Fullmetal.\u201d Roy said, glaring from the blond\u2019s stomach to his face. \u201cWho do you think you are?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think we settled that awhile ago. I\u2019m your master, and I was just disposing of a useless slave. I thought about doing that to you a few times, you know.\u201d Ed replied, making Roy shut up. You, on the other hand, believed that what the Elrics had done was the right thing. They had done the city a favor, so how could anyone complain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, time to decide on which of the remaining thugs we get as our personal slaves. I did away with their boss, so I choose first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I\u2019m okay with either of them.\u201d Al said, grinning down at the two thugs. They had just witnessed their leader get eaten and now they were going to be turned into slaves? Weren\u2019t their lives already bad enough?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd examined both the thugs and found little difference between the two. They both appeared to be the same age, with David having longer hair than Leon. They both looked fit enough to be good slaves, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll take you.\u201d Ed said, choosing David and tossing Leon into Al\u2019s hand. He brought the older boy up to his face and smirked at him. \u201cI haven\u2019t finished paying you back for calling me short.\u201d</span></div></div>",

That alright with you, Al?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll head to my room too.\u201d the taller Elric replied, getting to his feet with Leon and you in hand. The two boys nodded to each other and left for their rooms, which were on opposite ends of the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Edward*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fullmetal Alchemist entered his bedroom, locked the door, and jumped onto his bed. Ed placed both the slaves by his giant, bare foot and smiled down at them. Roy knew what was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, slaves, time for a foot rub. With both of you rubbing, it\u2019s sure to feel great!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget it! I\u2019m not rubb-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d Roy cut in, already rubbing Ed\u2019s greasy foot with his hands. \u201cIf you protest, you\u2019ll just make it harder on yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you the Flame Alchemist? How can you give into this kid so easily?!\u201d David asked, lowering his voice a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow? Just look at him, stupid. You want to end up in his gut like your boss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gave no countermark and sighed heavily. He began to help Mustang with the foot rub, knowing that refusal meant the possibility of becoming Fullmetal crap. He looked past the foot at Ed, who was laying back and resting. The teen\u2019s hand moved to his stomach and scratched under his shirt. A quick burp escaped his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Alphonse*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl sat down on his bed and placed his slaves next to him. He started to untie his boots while Leon just backed away as much a she could from the titanic teen. You looked over at the older boy and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Al\u2019s a good master. You\u2019re safer in his hands then you are in Ed\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSafe? Did you miss the part where his brother SWALLOWED Ulrich?! Aren\u2018t you worried about him doing that to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUlrich? So that was your leader\u2019s name?\u201d Al asked as he tugged off one of his socks, sending sock fuzz everywhere. How much did he have in those things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t do that to me. I\u2019m a slave with benefits.\u201d you smiled, somewhat proud of your title. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlave with\u2026what?\u201d Leon asked, dumbfounded. Before you could answer, Al picked both of you up and placed you each on a knee. He was sitting cross-legged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Leon, tell me about yourself. How did you end up with a creep like Ulrich?\u201d the innocent boy asked. Leon wasn\u2019t fooled by that innocent look, though. He knew the young teen could change at any moment. Still, he decided to tell his story. No one had ever asked him to talk about it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Ulrich found me about a year ago. My family was killed in a fire and I had just lost my job. I was\u2026going to kill me boss in anger, but Ulrich stopped me. He said it wasn\u2019t worth it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was\u2026nice of him.\u201d Al said, believing that Ed\u2019s snack hadn\u2019t been totally evil. A shake of Leon\u2019s head told him otherwise, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, a few days later I found out the place had been robbed and the guy was murdered. Ulrich never said anything, but I somehow knew he was the one who did it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026so\u2026have you ever\u2026killed someone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, never. Ulrich was the one who always did it.\u2019 Leon explained, looking up at Al and noticing the boy\u2019s face had changed from pity to anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you could have stopped him all those times! You just let him do the deeds. When he was pointing that gun at that old man, all you did was hold that switchblade!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I know. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Leon mumbled, bowing his head down. Al\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d Al felt sorry for the boy, but couldn\u2019t forgive him for what he\u2019d done.

He grins in excitement as he placed you on the floor near his shows. You watch in terror as he slowly starts to remove his shoes, revealing one socked foot and his \u201cbare\u201d metallic foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour first job is going to be worshiping my foot. You\u2019ll look at it like it\u2019s a god in itself, understand shrimp?\u201d he asks from high above. You don\u2019t say anything and he scowls at you. Raising his auto mail foot and stomping the ground, you snap out of your trance and nod up to him. Edward grins and starts to peel his sock off, even more slowly than his shoes as if to add dramatic effect. When the sock is completely off and tossed onto the bed somewhere, the now-bare foot lifts up so the sole is facing you like some kind of wall of flesh. From his seated position on the bed, Ed simply points at his foot while staring you down with his eyes. You don\u2019t really know what to do, but you defiantly don\u2019t want to make Ed angry. The first thought that comes to mind is to touch it, so you do so. Your hands touch Ed\u2019s soft soles as they rub as much of it as your small size would allow. Ed seems pleased form the look of his face above you. You don\u2019t really know what to think. The foot reeked like any teenage boy\u2019s would, but the stench was somehow comforting. Rubbing the giant\u2019s sole felt humiliating, but also kind of good. Before you new it, you had your face pressed into his sole just to get a good sniff of it. Ed saw this as was amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you like to be that close to my foot\u2026why don\u2019t you lick it next?\u201d Lick them? The thought seemed disgusting to you, but you were in no position to defy him. Therefore, you hesitantly stuck out your tongue and gave the foot its first worshiping lick. Ed felt this more than the rubbing and his foot twitched at the feeling. Again, you didn\u2019t know what to make of this. The taste of pure, teenage boy sweat was all you could taste on the foot. Salty and warm\u2026not your first choice for a drink. Neither the less, you continued to lick all the places you had rubbed. The foot worshiping went on for a full half-hour before something else happened. </span></div></div>",

You cringe and cover your head, feeling like that hand is going to come down and crush you into paste. Ed doesn't do this of course. His grip is gentle, for a metal hand anyway, but firm. It's a grip that clearly says you aren't going anywhere unless Ed approves. You feel your stomach drop as you ascend in a god like hand to Ed's face. He opens his fist and you gaze up once again into his golden orbs. He grins at you and says, \"You liked being down by my feet didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost shook your head and told him you didn't like it, but you both knew that would be an outright lie. You had willingly embraced and smelled his foot before licking it for half an hour. You did, in fact, like his feet. You nod and he laughs slightly. \"Yeah, I knew you did. So when you're good you get to go to my feet. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...it was better than being dead...so you nod again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" he raised a finger and waggled it threateningly. \"if you're bad then you're going to end up somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted up his flesh and blood arm and revealed his pits. You barely notice that there's not even any hair there before the hand you're seated in slaps against the open pit. You feel moisture cover your body instantly, your mouth swimming in fluid. You can't even pull your head out to breathe so you take a big sniff of the area you're in. It reeks of sweat but it's not much worse than Ed's foot. You feel the pressure on your back alleviate as he pulls his hand away only to have it replaced by his arm as he closes you inside his pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever you do something that pisses me off, you'll go in there for punishment. Just don't ever piss me off too much or I might just skip over the jail time and get right to the execution if you catch my drift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was slightly muffled thanks to your position but, yeah, you caught his drift. You just hope you don't spend too much time encased in this sweaty, horribly hot prison. The air was so musky it was hard to breath.</span></div></div>",

His metallic arm, as well as his trained muscles, allowed him to lift an amount that even a grown man would struggle with. While it didn\u2019t appear that he was breaking a sweat, his pits were a different story. With each second that passed, the elder Elric finished another lift and each time his pit became hotter and more moist. With no hairs to entangle you, your small form was virtually glued to his flesh. When Ed\u2019s arms stretched out to lift the weight, the pit opened up and allowed you a half second of light and air. The arms then came down again, smothering you in darkness and coming up once again with a soft squelch. You felt like a bug trapped the smelliest bug trap ever made. Edward pumped iron for a good ten minutes, meaning you were put through around 600 consecutive lifts of the weight before Ed finally placed it back on the hinges. By now his pit must have reeked like moldy cheese and you were red with your\u2019s and Ed\u2019s sweat. Mostly Ed\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the sweat covering his pits, Ed didn\u2019t seems exhausted at all. There were a few drops on his brow and some on his torso, but ultimately he was fine. The blond teen got up off the bench and grasped a bottle of water from a nearby crate. He took a few gulps of it and wiped his mouth with his arm. Before putting the bottle down, he lifted up his flesh and blood arm to get a look at you. The sight of you plastered to his pit amused him, but he didn\u2019t want you dying on him or anything. Therefore, he poured some of the water over you and his pit. You happily lapped up as much of the liquid as you could as it seemed to wash away some of the sweat and smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re well enough to go on, cause I\u2019m not nearly finished.\u201d Ed told you as he put his arm back down again and looked around the room for his next workout. </span></div></div>",

All in all you slid maybe a handful of centimeters before being firmly glued back in place. While this was going on Ed had made his way over to the pull up bar against the far wall. When he reached up to grab the bar you were awarded another look at the outside though it wasn't a very long look as Ed quickly lifted himself up his arm coming down to cover you once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next ten minutes it was pretty much the same repetitions as when Ed was bench pressing. Hot smelly moist darkness, brief clean light and air, back to hot smelly moist darkness. The only difference was that instead of just his arms moving his whole body was. You started to get dizzy as you were plunged in and out of darkness and up and down without stop. The experiences left one thought screaming in your mind. Never, ever, piss Ed off. If this was what it meant for disobeying an order there was no way you'd do it. Of course, this is exactly why Ed is keeping you where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Ed finished his workout on the pull up bar.

If you pressure him too much before he\u2019s ready you\u2019re gonna kill him!\u201d Ed explained to his brother, who\u2019s eyes drifted back and forth from the floor to his bro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d responded Al. \u201cI was just having a little fun. I wasn\u2019t trying to hurt him or anything.\u201d Ed sighed and used his metal hand to ruffle Al\u2019s hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you weren\u2019t, little bro. Just be more careful next time.\u201d Ed said with a smile. Al smiled back and nodded. Ed looked down at you and noticed you had awoken. \u201cOh, you\u2019re awake. I gave you a quick bath while you were unconscious. I bet you\u2019re really tired\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a weak nod and Ed started to make his way toward the brothers\u2019 bedroom. Al, meanwhile, stayed in the kitchen and started to prepare dinner. When Ed arrived in the bedroom, he placed your naked form onto one of the blue-sheeted beds and started searching through his closet of clothes. You simply sat there with your hands covering your privates. Ed removed himself from the closet carrying a white shirt with black stripes, which he laid down next to you. \u201cStand on this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObeying, you picked yourself up and walked onto the shirt. Not really know what the elder brother had planned, you stood in the middle of the garment and looked up at your blonde master. Ed clapped his hands together and touched the bottom of the shirt. The alchemic reaction flowed across the clothing and around you. Although it looked like electricity, it didn\u2019t hurt at all. You watched shockingly as the clothing began to curl around your bare skin. A few seconds later the transmutation ended and you were left standing in a hole shaped like a shirt and pair of pants. You found yourself wearing a pair of simple black pants and a white shirt. You weren\u2019t wearing any underwear and nothing was protecting your bare feet, but it was better than nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you like it? I tried to get the size right.\u201d Ed said as he discarded the now ruined shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, thanks.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Ed looked at his watch and then back down at you. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s partially your fault. If you weren\u2019t so weak you could have remained conscious despite Al\u2019s \u2019fun\u2019.\u201d You didn\u2019t say anything and just looked down with a saddened expression. Despite his kindness, Ed still thought of you as nothing but his slave. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll shape you into a tough slave worthy of being owned by the Elric Brothers. Hopefully, anyway.\u201d You worried about what would happen if you couldn\u2019t meet Ed\u2019s satisfaction. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll leave you here awhile to rest and come back when dinner\u2019s ready. Don\u2019t even think about trying to escape; I have no problem with killing you if you aren\u2019t going to be obedient.\u201d You nodded, but Ed had already turned around to see your agreement. After he left, you laid down to try and get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd walked into the living room, which was empty save for some lamps and book shelves. He grabbed some papers on a nearby side table and started writing on them. They were reports to the state military. Al just finished putting their dinner, a pan of lasagna, in the stove. The apartment was quiet and kind of peaceful, despite the torture you had gone through the past few hours. </span></div></div>",

Stop nagging. \u201c Edward told his brother with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll get my sweaty, stinky, and sexy self over to the bathroom.\u201d Ed snickered and left his brother in the kitchen, who just scoffed. You held onto the giant teen\u2019s toes as his feet pounded down the hall toward another door. Entering it, you took notice how the bathroom looked quite nice for an apartment one. After turning on the lights, Ed plucked you from between his toes and placed you on the nearby sink. He then placed his hands on his hips and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we\u2019re both kind of cheesy. Makes sense that you\u2019ll join me in my shower. I mean, I don\u2019t want my slave to be smelly all the time. So, hurry up and get those clothes off.\u201d You gave him an odd look and he just cocked an eyebrow. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. What do you do; take a shower with your clothes on? Hurry up and strip, or I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d Ed grinned as he raised his hands toward you in a threatening matter. You got the idea and immediately started to remove your shirt. It was difficult since the sweat made it cling to your body. Ed was entertained with your struggling and started to unbuckle his pants. After getting the drenched shirt over your head, you watched Ed pull his leather pants down to his feet, revealing his boxers with a visible bulge in the front. Ed caught you staring and smiled. \u201cLike what you see?\u201d You became red and turned your head away while fiddling with your pants, getting them off with some effort. By this time Ed had already removed his boxers, so when you turned back around you--oh god, his dick is huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young alchemist may not have been blessed with height, but when it came to muscles and package size he was like a god. You gaped at his naked and clearly superior form while he looked down at you in amusement. After removing the band in his hair and allowing his golden locks to come loose, the giant adolescent pointed down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you need some help with that last piece?\u201d he teased, pointing at your boxers which clung tightly to your groin. The erection you were getting was starting to get painful to contain, so you didn\u2019t wait to tug them down. As you did, your aroused dick was freed and both of you faced each other in your birthday suits. Ed didn\u2019t waste any time and grabbed you off the sink. \u201cGlad to see you enjoy being around your master. That\u2019s good.\u201d Ed stepped into the tub, closed the curtain, and placed you on the nearby rack where the soap and shampoo laid. He turned the knob and a torrent of warm water began pouring down on him. He stood there for a few minutes to allow the water to soak into his hair and skin. Some of the water that splashed against him came back down on you, giving you your own shower. It wasn\u2019t too bad and you welcomed the chance to rid yourself of Ed\u2019s stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter both of you had soaked  in the water, Ed took the shampoo and put a little in his blond hair. He also let a little drip onto his finger, which he gently patted your head with. Both of you washed your hair of grime and sweat while relaxing in the shower\u2019s cleansing waters. After your hair was cleaned and rinsed, Ed reached for the soap and prepared for the next part of his shower.</span></div></div>",

You try to figure out how to wake him up, but come to the conclusion that it's impossible. There was no way someone as tiny as you could get the attention of a sleeping giant. Maybe if he was awake\u2026but asleep? A definite zero possibility. Your voice wouldn\u2019t reach him nor would your fists resister with him if you banged on his boots. You weren\u2019t even going to consider trying to climb the behemoth\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one brother sleeping on the couch and another off grocery shopping, you decided your only option was to wait for an opportunity to get some help. At first you were just going to lie back where you sat, but quickly jumped to your feet when you realized it was dangerous to just sit out in the open like this. You might fall asleep and Ed or Al would step on you before you could even open your eyes. Therefore, there was only one thing to do; explore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away from the sleeping giant and make your way across the living room. As you walk you glance around at your surroundings and determine that this seems to be an apartment owned by the Elric brothers. Nether of the alchemists seemed to be good at decorating, since the room was fairly empty. There wasn\u2019t even a rug under your feet; just a wooden floor. As you continued to walk and look around at the giant\u2026everything, you suddenly notice you\u2019ve approached another room. Staring into the new room you quickly deduce that it\u2019s the kitchen. For an apartment, it had a fairly large kitchen. The two brothers must of enjoyed a lot of good meals in here\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the kitchen was just a kitchen. You\u2019ve seen them before and wanted to explore more of the apartment. Therefore, you look away from the kitchen entrance and spot another doorway leading somewhere else. You run over to the opening, wondering what\u2019s beyond it. By the time you pass through the large doorway and out of the living room, a half hour has already passed since Edward fell asleep. Your tiny legs could only travel so far within a certain period of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to a stop and start breathing heavily. You never thought it would be this difficult to run across a room. As you catch your breath, you look around and see that you\u2019re in a small hallway. There are at least four or five doors in the hall. Two of them were probably the brothers\u2019 separate rooms, and another was defiantly a bathroom, but what about the others? How big was this apartment anyway? Edward\u2019s State Alchemist status must come with good pay\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide you want to take a peek into one of the rooms and look to see if any of them are open. All of them were shut\u2026save for one. One of the doors was open a crack and you were just barely able to squeeze yourself through. You enter the new room to find that it\u2019s\u2026</span></div></div>",

He groaned, \"Sigh....Guess we'll have to organize this place....eventually.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward's voice snapped you out of your dreamlike state.

Normally his size was nothing impressive, but to you he was like a god. \u201cBetter smash it before Al gets home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward raises one of his boots over you and you gaze up at the leather footwear as if it\u2019s the last thing you\u2019re ever going to see. You thankfully break out of your trance just soon enough to run for the nearest hiding place; the pile of books nearby. Ed\u2019s foot comes down just as you dive for the books. The impact misses you, but it creates a powerful gust of wind that sends you deeper into the book pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor crying out loud\u2026\u201d Ed mumbles a she notices you disappear into the books. \u201cIf that thing lays eggs on any of my books, I\u2019m going to make its death long and painful!\u201d the Fullmetal Alchemist gets back onto his knees and starts rummaging through the books again. Meanwhile, you quickly make your way through the maze of books and reach an exit before Ed can dig deep enough. You hop out of your hiding spot unnoticed and make start running for your life. Ed has reached the bottom of the book pile, but sees no signs of you. He\u2019s about to start opening books when he spots his tiny target in the corner of his eye. An evil smirk slides across the teenager\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think you can escape me, bug?\u201d Ed asks as he stands back up and starts stomping in your direction. In just three steps he\u2019s already on top of you and you think this is defiantly the end. Your love of Fullmetal Alchemist will be rewarded by becoming a red stain on the bottom of the main character\u2019s boot. How lucky you are\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEd!! Stop, please!!\u201d you shout without turning around. The blond titan doesn\u2019t seem to hear you and just continues to grin down at the bug he\u2019s about o squash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout a week ago I found a bug crawling through the pages of my favorite book. You know what I did to it?\u201d Ed asks as he raises his foot over you once again. You may be fast for a bug your size, but you can\u2019t escape the foot of the elder Elric. \u201cWell you\u2019re about to find out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ed brings his foot down and you brace yourself for your abrupt end. Luckily for you, Ed is still a big groggy from his nap and his aim is a bit off. The foot crashes down just inches from your minuscule form, sparing you once more. The powerful impact once again sends you flying\u2026right into another pile of books. Ed grinds his boot against the wooden floor, thinking he\u2019s crushed you. A lack of a crunch causes him to inspect his sole and realize you\u2019re still alive. Ed angrily stomps his boot against the floor, sending  a tremor through the room that causes a few books to fall of their shelves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re really pissing me off now\u2026\u201d Ed mutters under his breath as he scans the floor for you. All he wanted to do was find a book to read, but now some bug was giving him a hard time. Once he found you, he was going to show you exactly what happens to a bug that finds its way into his personal library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you\u2019re laying at the bottom of the book pile and shaking with fear. The books on top of you are weighing you down, so it\u2019s very difficult to move. You\u2019re a sitting duck\u2026if Ed finds you, he\u2019ll surely put an end to the insect that\u2019s causing him so much trouble. All you can do is wiggle and slow make your way out of the book pile; hoping Ed doesn\u2019t search through the books and find you. </span></div></div>",

You had come very close to death today, you didn't know whether you should still get the brothers' attention or not. Being that you could so easily be mistaken for an insect that needed squishing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to peek out the door to spy on the Elrics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spotted Al and Ed stocking up their kitchen with groceries, you heard snippets of conversation.

A quick look upwards revealed that Al had dropped his socks\u2026and they were heading right for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even utter a scream, the socks connected with the floor and covered you in fluffy whiteness. Al didn\u2019t notice he had dropped his socks on another person and just walked right over them. The younger Elric walked over to his window and slid it open with a push. Alphonse stuck his head out the window and breathed in the fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, that\u2019s a nice breeze.\u201d Al muttered as he closed his eyes and let quick breezes cool him off a bit. It was a hot summer outside and he was really sweating from bringing all those heavy groceries in. It was a good thing his body was in tip-top shape, or else he\u2019d never have been able to lug those bags to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Al was enjoying the summer breeze, you were \u201cenjoying\u201d being hugged by all sides with the smelly cotton of Al\u2019s socks. You tried to claw your way out of the cotton prison, but you couldn\u2019t even tell what direction you were going. At your tiny size, a simple sock was almost like a circus tent had collapsed upon you. A very smelly circus tent. The lingering odor of the teen\u2019s foot was making your eyes water\u2026that\u2019s not exactly helping in this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Al removed his head from the window and strolled over to his bed. He sat down upon it and wiped his forehead with his arm. Looking at his arm, he saw that his sleeve was covered with sweat just by wiping his forehead so many times. The young alchemist sighed heavily as he collapsed backwards on the bed. He stared at the ceiling and let the sweat from his face drip onto his mattress. His ceiling was very bare, save for a single light bulb that hanged from it. Unfortunately, the only ceiling fan in the apartment was the one in the living room. The rest of the rooms had to make due with an open window, which didn\u2019t help much. Al closed his eyes and tried to rest, but found it difficult. It was easy to sleep at night since it was cool then, but in the middle of the day when it was scorching hot outside? All Alphonse could do was just relax his body and try to ignore the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the socks, you weren\u2019t doing too well ether. The heat of the room was also making you sweat, but the socks that covered you were making it even worse. A few times you caught your skin sticking to the cotton fabric and had to tug it away. Your body was quickly becoming covered with lint and sock fuzz. The socks were very soft, however, and part of you just wanted to take a nap. You knew you couldn't do that, however. What if Al stepped on the socks while you were sleeping under them? You needed to get out of here...</span></div></div>",

They\u2019ll be done real quick, so just wait in the living room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, sounds good!\u201d Ed smiles and licks his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll be sitting down and reading; call me when they\u2019re ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, you\u2019ll probably smell them first\u2026\u201d Al replies under his breath as he starts taking out a bowl and other things he\u2019ll need. Al unknowingly steps on you again and again as he walks from one part of the kitchen to the next. Even after he\u2019s assembled all the ingredients and begins making the batter, he still steps from side-to-side to reach for distant objects. Hell, the giant boy is putting a lot of pressure on you just by standing still! You can only imagine how horrific it would have been of you were under his sole\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alphonse stirs the pancake batter and heats the stove, he wipes a bit of sweat off his brow. The kitchen gets much hotter as the stove turns on. Inside his shoe, things are even worse. Your entire body drips with sweat while Al\u2019s toe smothers you underneath it, drenching you in even more sweat. It\u2019s so hot\u2026you can barely stand it! When Al starts pouring the batter onto a pan, you know you have to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAl! Help!\u201d you shout, banging your fists against the hard texture of his toe. Your tiny fists don\u2019t register with the blond at all, and Al just continues to make pancakes while whistling a tune. You listen to his carefree whistling and grit your teeth. You had to get out of this sock\u2026fast! At this rate you might pass out from the heat\u2026</span></div></div>",

There must have been a reason Ed was hiding you from Al and you didn\u2019t want to risk angering him by trying to get Al\u2019s attention. You just sat there inside Ed\u2019s pants pocket as he took groceries out of the bags and put them where they belonged. When the two brothers were done, Ed noticed his brother wipe a few beads of sweat from his forehead. It must have been really hot out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, when\u2019s dinner?\u201d Ed asked immediately, knowing his brother always had something good planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026I\u2019m not sure, brother. To tell you the truth, I didn\u2019t have anything planned. I\u2019m kind of tired too and I think I\u2019m just going to lay down and rest. Do you mind just making yourself a sandwich or something for supper?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Ed replied as he patted his brother on the shoulder. Al gave Ed a big smile before he headed off to his room for some rest. Ed waited until he heard his brother\u2019s door close before he quickly took you out of his pocket and ran into the living room. The teenaged alchemist plopped himself onto his sofa and dangled you in front of his youthful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, why don\u2019t you tell me your story, squirt?\u201d Ed asked, blowing hot air at you as he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t really explain everything. One moment I was in my own room, the next I was here at this size!\u201d you explained. Ed continued to stare at you with his large, golden globes before he spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty lousy excuse.\u201d Edward said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-lousy? But it\u2019s the truth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, and I think you\u2019re lying.\u201d Ed suddenly drops you and you start falling toward his lap. Before you reach it, he catches you with his other hand and brings you back up to his face. \u201cI think you\u2019re some thief that thought they could sneak by me by shrinking themselves. I\u2019m not sure how you did it, but looks like it didn\u2019t work.\u201d Ed laughs softly as you start to back away from his face. A quick curl of tree-like fingers stops you and you can only stare up at the handsome giant with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Ed curls you into his fist and brings you down to the floor. You\u2019re dropped onto the hard wood as Ed starts untying his black boots. When both of them are undone, he kicks them off with two quick movements and you watch him plant his two socked feet directly in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, look at you. I bet you don\u2019t know how to reverse whatever you\u2019ve done to yourself, so you\u2019re at the mercy of my feet now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEd\u2026stop it\u2026this isn\u2019t funny.\u201d you mumble as you back away. Edward just smirks and lifts one of his socked feet over you. Before you can turn around and run, the socked foot comes down on you and slams you into the floor. The wind gets knocked out of you before Ed starts to smother you under the white, dingy fabric. You start screaming as his foul foot odor makes its way into your nostrils. Ed must have had a long day, and his feet are evidence of that. They reek like moldy cheese and you desperately try punching at the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t like the smell, squirt? You better get used to it, because a slave like you is going to be smelling a lot of it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re watering eyes widen as you hear this. Did Edward just call you a slave? There was no way\u2026no way you had gotten his attention just to become his slave! You wanted help, not this! You violently start writhing under Ed\u2019s socked foot, but Ed just responds by curling his socked feet around you and giving you a few squeezes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, bug. You\u2019re my slave now. It\u2019s what you deserve for breaking in.\u201d Ed explains as he rolls you under his foot, covering you from head to toe with sock fuzz. \u201cWelcome to your new life, puny.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Finally, your world of white cotton disappeared as Ed moved his foot off you and allowed you to stand. The moment you got to your feet, you felt a rush of dizziness and collapsed onto your butt. You started coughing uncontrollably as you choked un the lingering smell of Ed\u2019s foot odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo my feet really smell that bad?\u201d Ed laughed as he glanced down at his dirty sock. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see how you react when I take my socks off!\u201d You gasp in horror before you watch Ed lean down to strip off his socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! *cough* Edward, please *cough* don\u2019t!\u201d you plead, but Ed hears none of it. You watch him grip the end of his sock with his newly humanized hand and pull the garment right off. A rain of fuzz and lint comes down on you as he does this and you desperately try to brush all the crud off you. When you look up again you see Edward tug his other sock of with the same hand before tossing both of them over his shoulder. He stretches out his feet and flexes his toes in content. You weren\u2019t sure since he was covering it, but it looks like Edward also had his leg back as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you even know how hard being a State Alchemist is? When I\u2019m not killing my brain, I\u2019m killing my poor feet! Today was especially hard since the Colonel was sending me all across the city. It feels good to have them out in the open air like this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Ed finishes talking, he plants both his bare feet on the floor directly in front of you. With a grin, he starts wiggling his toes as he decides what to do with you next. You watch the ten large digits, each one the size of you or bigger, slap against the floor with enough force to cause you bodily harm if you were under them. You were so focused on the intimidating feet that you didn\u2019t even notice how much they were contaminating the air until you happened to take a whiff. Your face goes pale and you jump back in surprise. It smells like you had just sniffed the ass of a cow\u2026right when it farted! You cover your nose and groan as Ed\u2019s foot odor starts to have an effect on you. You\u2019re so disorganized that you don\u2019t even ntoice Ed has his foot hanging over your head until it\u2019s too late\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel something hard and powerful slam into your back and pin you against the wooden floor. It takes seconds for you to figure out its Ed\u2019s bare foot and you try fighting once more. Unfortunately, it\u2019s like trying to topple a building with your bare hands; it\u2019s just not possible. Ed has his sweaty foot planted on you and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward chuckles as he applies some more pressure onto your bug-sized body. He waits until he hears you scream in pain before letting up on the pressure. He doesn\u2019t want to squish you\u2026not when you can amuse him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it smell, bug? If you want me to move my foot, just say so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately shout for Ed to remove his foot, but your voice is muffled since your face is pressed up against the hard wood. Ed doesn\u2019t hear anything except a few squeaking noises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, didn\u2019t quite catch that.\u201d Ed says before he presses down on you again until you scream. Underneath the muscular male\u2019s foot, you\u2019ve finally given up on struggling since you\u2019ve worn yourself out. You just lay there and endure the smell and pain. Ed\u2019s foot is dripping with warm, salty sweat and you feel your shirt cling to your back as it\u2019s drenched with the teen\u2019s perspiration. You feel liquid on your face, but you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s tears or Ed\u2019s foul foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd continues to relax in his rush of power before deciding to do something else...</span></div></div>",

The heat under the foot is also immense and you find yourself sweating too.

I\u2019m your big, powerful master now and you\u2019ll do as I say!

I\u2019ll lick your foot\u2026I\u2019ll lick your foot!!\u201d you cry out, the threat of death working it\u2019s charm on you. Ed smirks and lifts his foot a tiny bit so it\u2019s no longer crushing you into the floor. You\u2019re unable to move anything below your neck, but all you really need to move to accomplish Ed\u2019s task is your tongue. You stare at the glistening sole for a few moment to prepare yourself for what you\u2019re about to do. Ed starts to become impatient and gets ready to press down on you again, but stops when he feels something small and wet touch his foot. He grins widely and relaxes back on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath his foot, you\u2019re doing as you were told and licking the sweat from his foot. You whimper every time you swallow some of Ed\u2019s foot sweat and groan as the foul stuff upsets your gut. Since you can\u2019t move at all, you can only lick the same spot over and over again. No matter how many times you clean the spot of sweat, however, more quickly takes its place. You try to ignore the awful stench and taste and simply focus on staying alive. As long as you did what Edward commanded, you\u2019d stay alive\u2026right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat feels really good, bug. I bet Al would enjoy this-\u201d Edward stops mid sentence and glances over in the direction of Al\u2019s room. His brother was a pacifist and would probably get pissed at him if he found out he was keeping someone as a slave.

Needless to say there is a fair amount of lint from his socks in there that you find yourself having to eat so you aren't smothered to death in the fuzz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the boot, Ed is putting on a pretty good act for his little brother, having put both his feet back into their designated boots, he feels around with his toes to make sure you're not in a bad spot. When he discovers you are safe, he decides he can stop being so nervous. \"Hey Al! Want me to fix us sandwiches or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl smiles, \"You sure you can manage without me cooking us dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smiles back, \"Of course!\" Ed and Al soon are sitting down to enjoy some good old fashioned sandwiches...With you still stuck in Ed's boot of course!</span></div></div>",

They mainly talked about their new experiences with their renewed bodies and alchemy stuff. You could hear everything they were saying, but no matter how much you called for Al\u2019s help, he couldn\u2019t hear you. The younger alchemist was completely oblivious to the third male in the room. He would never expect his older brother to be holding a captive slave\u2026and under his foot to boot! (no pun intended)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, the two brothers finished their sandwiches and rubbed their stomachs with glee. Al sighed with satisfaction while his brother clutched his abs through his shirt and belched loudly. Al laughed before nudging his brother in the arm and calling him childish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think I\u2019m going to head back to my room.\u201d Al says as he yawns and stretches his arms. \u201cThanks for the sandwich, brother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, Al. You have a good nap.\u201d Ed replied, patting his little bro on the shoulder. Al smiled before he got up and headed off to his room. Ed waited until he heard his brother\u2019s door close before looking down at his boot and grinning. \u201cHow are you doing in there, shrimp?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout out your obvious feelings about being shoved into another man\u2019s foot, but your words don\u2019t reach Ed\u2019s ears. The teen\u2019s boots are made from very thick leather in order to make his kicks even more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your silence as \u2019I love it in here, Master Edward!\u2019. That okay with you?\u201d Ed laughs as he flexes his toes, feeling you struggle between them. After grinding you between his filthy toes for a bit, Ed stands up and smiles as he feel you compress under his toe. He walks into the kitchen and grabs himself a glass of orange juice. With glass in hand, Ed starts aimlessly walking around the apartment. He picks up various pieces of trash and junk on the floor and tosses them into the trash bin. The entire time you\u2019re pushed into the space between is toes again and again. A few times some of the filth gets into your mouth and you gag on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up around the apartment a bit, Ed walks over to Al\u2019s room and presses his ear to the door. He doesn\u2019t hear anything\u2026which means Al must be sound asleep. Ed decides to head outside and makes his way to the door. After walking down a few flights of stairs, he heads into the backyard behind the apartment building. The backyard is pretty barren, sporting no trees or bushes and only a couple chairs and a rundown fence. Regardless, Ed and Al usually use the open space for training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd places his hands on his hips and gazed up at the night sky. A quarter moon hanged in the sky along with a few stars. Since they were in the city, Ed couldn\u2019t see as many stars as he could back when he was little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe me and Al should take a trip back home some time. I know he\u2019d like to look up at the night sky again.\u201d Ed look down at his black boot and grinned. \u201cYou could see it too\u2026if you\u2019re not already staring at my sweaty sole! I bet you\u2019d like that more, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared up where Ed\u2019s voice was coming from. You couldn\u2019t see his handsome face, but you knew for a fact he was grinning smugly right now\u2026</span></div></div>",

Ed sniffed under both of them and grimaced, \"Yuck....\" Was all he said as he quickly put his arms down and began to stretch his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put one leg out with the foot standing up on it's heel, stretching his foot back and forth into you and spreading his toes all over you. Safe to say, you were getting one hell of a smell of Ed's unwashed foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now....on to the good stuff!\" Ed said hopping back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd clapped his hands together and placed them in the dirt, with a few flashes of light, twelve training dummies made out of barren dirt stood there. Ed stood up straight and put his hands on his hips as he grinned at his handiwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on tight squirt! You're in for one hell of a ride!\" Ed called down to you as he ran to the first dummy and punched it's head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ed started running, you were thankfully in a safe spot between his toes. However his foot began pumping out gallon upon gallons of hot sweat, all of which came down to his toe area, right where you were! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when Ed used the foot you were stuck with, to take out a few more dummies. You were tossed about in the boot, sweat splashing all around you like rain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen only three dummies remained, Ed used his alchemy to make a weapon out of the chain link fence and clobbered the rest of them easily. Ed panted and was dripping with sweat. He collapsed into one of the lawn chairs after fixing the fence with his alchemy. \"That was pretty easy....But its still so damn hot out here.\" <br>\r\nEd said wiping his brow. Ed sniffed under his arm again and found the stench had increased tenfold. \"Hm....I think I've found another job for you shrimpy!\" Ed said with a toothy grin.</span></div></div>",

Once it was off his foot, the blond teen grimaced as he smelled how badly the bare foot reeked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow\u2026\u201d Ed says a she fans the air in front of his face. \u201cAre you still alive in there?\u201d Ed brings the boot to his face and looks inside. Despite being plastered to the bottom of his insole, you\u2019re clearly still alive since you have the energy to shoot Ed an angry glare. Ed finds your expression humorous and reaches his fingers into the boot to recover you. As you\u2019re peeled free of your prison, you begin thinking up what exactly you\u2019re going to scream in Ed\u2019s face. He couldn\u2019t do this to you! He couldn\u2019t treat you like some kind of sweat absorbing slave! You were\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were fully out of the boot, all your energy seemed to melt away as you gazed at the titanic Edward. His muscular arms shimmered with sweat and appeared even bigger thanks to his workout. His black tank top was glued to his torso, leaving very little to the imagination. You trembled before the titan, reminding yourself that you are nothing before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, now that\u2019s a better expression!\u201d Ed says as he smiles at you. \u201cYou better be scared of me, shrimp. I could crush you like a grape with my FINGERS! Remember that next time you feel the need to glare at your giant master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp audibly. Ed places his other arm behind his head and brings you over to his exposed pit. As you near it, you sniff the air and your eyes widen with sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what are you doing?!\u201d you shout, plugging your nose to stop yourself from taking in the putrid odor. Edward doesn\u2019t answer your question with words, but actions instead. His hand slaps you against his sweaty pit and begins rubbing you around it vigorously. Your hands are torn from your nose as you\u2019re forced to breath in his armpit stink. You cry out and plead for him to stop, but your pleas are drowned out by gallons of fresh sweat. It smells absolutely rotten! You\u2019d rather smell a corpse after Roy Mustang barbecued it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is what you get for breaking into someone else\u2019s house.\u201d Ed says as he rubs you up and down his muscled arm, transferring the sweat on it to you. \u201cYou chose the WRONG house to steal from, kid. Your method could also use some work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd raised you over his chest and switched you into his other hand. As he did\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! I\u2019m not a thief! I wasn\u2019t trying to-\u201d you try to explain to him, but he shoves you under his other arm before you can get anywhere. You feel your eyes water and your nose burn as you\u2019re forced to soak up his perspiration and B.O. After rubbing you all over his sweating arm, he dangles you over his face and grins at you. You\u2019re coughing wildly as you try to get all the sweat out of your mouth. Your clothes are drenches and your hair is greasy with sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice look, thief. I can\u2019t wait to see what you look like after I rub my feet with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No no no! Please!\u201d you beg, bowing your head to Ed. \u201cYou\u2019re the bigger man! You\u2019re stronger than me and I\u2019m just a bug to you!! Please don\u2019t put me near your feet again. I\u2026I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to take it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd stares at you blankly. Even though the two of you are around the same age, you look like you\u2019re on the verge of crying. Ed begins to feel a bit of pity for you\u2026or does he?</span></div></div>",

I can tell you really regret your decisions, but you deserve every moment of this torture.\u201d Edward explains, sticking with his belief that you were a thief trying to steal from him. \u201cNow, let\u2019s move on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! You can\u2019t! I might die if I smell any more of your stink!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that sucks for you! If you do end up dead, at least know that you died smelling your master\u2019s awesome feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Edward sits up and brings is feet closer. Ed drops you on his lap as he takes off the boot that you weren\u2019t in. You\u2019re too weak to move and only watch as Ed pries the boot off, releasing a second foul-smelling foot. You\u2019re picked up again and slowly brought to the sole of the foot. You weakly struggle in the giant\u2019s grip, but even at full strength you wouldn\u2019t have been able to make Ed\u2019s pinkie budge. Ed chuckles at your fruitless struggles and wiggles his toes to taunt you more. Right before you hit the sole, you squeeze your eyes shut and keep them shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smacks you into his bare sole and starts rubbing you over it, murmuring as your body not only absorbs his foot sweat but also massages his sole at the same time. You try your best to ignore what is happening, but the haunting smell of the teenager\u2019s foot is a constant reminder that this is happening. One of your favorite anime characters was using you as a sponge to soak up his sweat. Never in your sixteen-year-long life did you imagine this happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure you get some good whiffs, shrimp.\u201d Edward says as he sloes his eyes and relaxes his head back. He finishes rubbing you into his sole and starts forcing you underneath and between his toes. \u201cThese feet are going to be a big part of your life from now on! You\u2019re going to worship them everyday, help clean them, and grow to love them! I\u2019ll turn you into a dedicated foot licker, bug!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to cry as Ed doesn\u2019t hold anything back. How could he be so cruel? Was it because he didn\u2019t think of you as a human being? Whatever the reason was, it was clear he only thought of you as his property now. Part of you wanted to bite his foot right now and have him crush you, just to save you from this fate. You couldn\u2019t bring yourself to do it, though. Dieing under the foot of a giant boy like some insect was just too humiliating of an end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd finishes rubbing you over the top of his foot before he moves you to his other smelly sole. As you are rubbed into that one, he starts to taunt you some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe someday I\u2019ll show you to Al and you can be his slave too! He may be a pacifist, but he also has a great sense of justice! He\u2019ll understand that a germ like you deserves this punishment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Edward has finished rubbing his foot, you\u2019re on the verge of unconsciousness. You can\u2019t even remember being taken away from his foot, only noticing that you\u2019ve been dropped onto the teen\u2019s chest. You\u2019re covered in so much sweat and stink that you feel like you\u2019re pressed up against his pits again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat feels a lot better!\u201d Ed says as he stretches his less sweaty arms toward the night sky. \u201cHow do you feel, shrimp?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mumble something Edward can\u2019t understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?

You look up the foot and wonder if he\u2019s already fallen asleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI DON\u2019T FEEL ANY LICKING!!\u201d Ed shouts, still in a voice that doesn\u2019t wake his brother. You yelp in fright and begin licking your giant master\u2019s sole obediently. Ed chuckles with satisfaction before going silent again. There you are, taped to your master\u2019s foot as he sleeps, tasked with the mission of licking his mighty foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to tear up again, not only from despair, but also because of the terrible fumes that make your eyes itch. With your arms pinned to your sides, you can\u2019t rub them. You just lay there against his sole, lapping up his sweat as salty tears run down your cheeks. At least you aren\u2019t licking his toe jam too\u2026that\u2019s something\u2026</span></div></div>",

The giant alchemist was reminding you with each step that he was the bigger man and could end you with any one of these simple steps.  You felt like sobbing between  those massive toes, and maybe you already were. There was so much foot sweat on your face that it was hard to tell\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re late, Fullmetal.\u201d was the first thing that came out of Colonel Roy Mustang\u2019s mouth as the younger alchemist entered his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLate? What are you talking about?\u201d Ed replied, glancing at the clock and seeing he wasn\u2019t late at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re late by 23 seconds\u2026\u201d Roy finished, not even looking into Ed\u2019s eyes and just continued to scribble something onto a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft, whatever\u2026\u201d Ed took a seat on the nearby couch and rested his feet on the table. Even with the pressure off you, Ed just squeezed you between his smelly toes in order to keep your punishment going. You tried to push the toes apart, but the blond\u2019s little toe would be stronger than you at this size. \u201cSo, what\u2019s today\u2019s mission, Colonel? Fixing a bridge? Hunting down a fugitive? Or am I going to get stuck with a boring desk job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone of those. This is your assignment. You\u2019ll be heading to the other side of town.\u201d Roy explained as he handed the younger male a slip of paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOther side of town, eh? Sounds good!\u201d Ed grinned as he took the document, imagining you suffering under his feet the entire trip there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs the document explains, you\u2019ll be looking for the son of a local aristocrat. He ran away from home yesterday, bringing with him a few of his family\u2019s prized treasures. The family wants both the items and their son back. We\u2019ve received reports he was spotted around the spot marked on the map.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Ed scratched his chin as he glanced over the document. \u201cWhy would he steal some of his family\u2019s treasures?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know his intentions. He could be selling them off to the black market, or perhaps he just wanted them for himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what about the items themselves? What are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know that either\u2026\u201d Roy muttered with a sigh. \u201cThe aristocrat did not give us any details on what was taken; not even the number of items. He simply said they\u2019re important and he wants them back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then! I\u2019ll just find this guy, smack him around a bit, and bring him and the stolen items back to his family.\u201d Ed said as he jumped to his feet, pressing his sole hard upon your small body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s the son of a rich aristocrat; please try not to hurt him too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, tell you what; he won\u2019t have to go to the hospital!\u201d Ed exclaimed with a smirk as he cracked his knuckles. With that said, the Fullmetal alchemist left Roy\u2019s office with a wave and ran out of HQ. As the teenager ran down the sidewalk, his sweaty feet pounded you into the boot like never before. The martial artist could run as fast as any cab could go, even if he was running a tad bit slower to keep you from becoming a smear under his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, enjoy the ride, squirt!\u201d Ed said to you. \u201cAfter this, YOU\u2019RE the one that might need to be hospitalized.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The least you can do is get me a frickin' coke!\" You growl at him. He isn't intimidated however, but by chance it's a commercial and he quickly dashes off to the kitchen. \"Dr. Pepper!\" You shout after him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you hear someone go \"Psst\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the room for the source of the sound. \"Over here dufus!\" The voice says. You trace the sound and it's coming from the Tv! Your eyes bug out when you see none other than Tai from Digimon alone on the screen. If you didn't know any better, you'd say he was grinning at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.....Wanna see something cool?\" He says with a mischievous gleam in his eye. You can only nod yes, not knowing what else to say to a cartoon character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there is a blinding flash from the television. You can't see, then you feel a jerking sensation as you seem to be being pulled towards the television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later your eyes fly open, you sit up. \"Ugh....What a crazy dream.\" You mumble. You hear a chuckle from above. You look up to see a gigantic Tai grinning down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Welcome to the Digital World! My little slave!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What did you do!? Why am I so small!? Where's my brother?!\" You scream up to him in sheer terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe holds a hand up in defense, \"Whoa whoa whoa little man. You're brothers fine. In fact, You can look right over there and see him.\" He says turning you around to face a square looking portal that you can only guess is the gateway back home. Your little brother is just now coming back in with the drinks. He looks around, calling out your name. \"Darn...I should've known it was a trick to get out of watching the show! I'm telling mom!\" He calls out before running out of the room, throwing the sodas on the floor. To your horror, the gateway begins to shrink until it finally disappears, leaving nothing behind to show it was even there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai turns you back around, \"Don't worry slave, He might even join you soon....Heh heh heh.\" He laughs as he thinks up sadistic ways to break his new slave in.</span></div></div>",

Your fear only grew worse as his toes flexed, but surprisingly he didn\u2019t bring you any closer to them. Instead, he brought you over to the sock in his other hand which was stretching the opening open. Realizing what he was doing too late, you could do nothing to prevent yourself from being dropped into the open sock. You rolled down the cotton garment until you stopped at the bottom. Turning your head, you gazed up the sock at Tai\u2019s boyish face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?!\u201d you shouted in anger. Tai made a tsk tsk sound and shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep talking to me like that, little slave. We\u2019ll see where it gets ya.\u201d Tai threatened before his face disappeared from your sight. You tried to find it again, but everything darkened as something else entered the sock: Tai\u2019s gargantuan foot. You screamed just as the sole smashed into you, pressing you between it and the sock. A nice portion of foot sweat managed to get into your mouth and you started to cough it up. The foot reeked from Tai\u2019s travels in the Digital World. After making sure his sock was on nice and tight, he checked the bottom of it to see your impression sticking out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, that\u2019s hilarious.\u201d he laughed as he took in your situation. After his giggles, Tai moved his socked foot back into his shoe and stood up. You immediately felt the weight of Taichi\u2019s entire being press down on you. You groaned form the pressure and thought you\u2019d burst until the pressure lifted. Tai lifted his foot in the air and shook it, making sure you were secured nicely. He brought the foot down again and the pressure returned, but you knew the sadistic child was going easy on you. He didn\u2019t want to break your body too much, just your spirit. After that, Tai returned to his trek in the Digital World. Each step pressed your face deep into his sole, forcing you to smell his horrid foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile...</span></div></div>",

He sat down with his back up against a tree trunk and untied his shoe. He lifted his socked foot out of it. The sock he saw to his delight, was plastered to his foot with sweat. He could smell the scent of his own foot odor, and he found himself giggling to himself while he pinched his nose. He couldn't even imagine what horrors you were enduring underneath his disgusting young foot. But he knew it made him feel great! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai then peeled his sweaty smelly white sock off his foot, which didn't come off without a great struggle. When it did come off however, sock fuzz flew everywhere. Some even got in Tai's mouth as he was sighing in pure luxurious cool freedom. He spat it out and looked around for his pathetic slave. That's when he felt a tickling sensation on his sole. He pulled his cheesy foot over to him and laughed hysterically as he saw your puny body plastered to his foot with all that sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly peeled you off and set you down on the ground. He then took off his other shoe and sock, leaving his very stinky feet bare. He wiggled his toes on either side of you as you spat out footsweat and lint. He sighed as he lifted one foot, and began to lower it onto you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow engulfed you, and before you knew it you were pinned to the ground by Tai's extremely sweaty and smelly boyfoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai just continued to ponder whatever he was pondering, and just mumbled an order...</span></div></div>",

You were left to stare up at him from between his toes, shock showing in your face. You were forced to be in his sock for all that time, and now he expected you to lick his toejam out?! You turned your head away in both disgust and refusal while trying to wiggle out from beneath the giant foot. Taichi cracked an eye open when he didn\u2019t feel you licking. With an annoyed grunt, he grabbed your head between his toes and forced you to look up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, you.\u201d he said in a threatening manner. \u201cLick my toes clean now, or I\u2019ll squash your head like a grape!\u201d You whimpered as the toes started to squeeze harder. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d You nodded and he released the pressure, relaxing once again with his eyes shut. Seeing no alternative, you surrendered to the task before you. Inching your head closer, you began to wipe your small tongue in-between the giant teen\u2019s toes. Every lick granted you a mouth full of sweat and toejam, which you didn\u2019t want to think was composed of. The smell might have knocked you out if it wasn\u2019t for your will to live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you had completely licked clean the toejam from between those set of toes. Not wanting to upset your master, you continued to lick the sweaty foot. Tai finally shifted his foot, but only to position you between two more toes.

These kids were insane!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, man. He looks like crap. What did you do to him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing much.

What have you done to my brother!?\u201d Matt eyed you curiously before chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, the older one\u2019s a bit feisty. A lot different than this guy. All he did was cry the moment I took him out of the portal. He\u2019s nice and quiet now.\u201d Matt said proudly. The hate in your eyes were unimaginable. Tears were building up in your eyes as you looked upon your broken brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s give them time to catch up. There are some things I want to talk to you about.\u201d Tai said to Matt. The blond boy nodded and placed Joey on a stump. Taichi did the same before both giants walked a few feet away to talk. You hurried over to your brothers side and started shaking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoey! Joey! Are you okay? Speak to me!\u201d Your young bro looked at you weakly. His eyes became wide as he recognized you and instantly shot up and buried his face into your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig brother! It was horrible! I thought you tricked me so you didn\u2019t have to watch TV with me, but then Matt appeared on the TV screen and\u2026before I knew it I was\u2026he\u2026\u201d Joey broke out into tears.

Then he made me lick them! Just a few minutes ago he--\u201d You embraced your brother to comfort him and stop him from speaking. You can\u2019t believe something like this could happen.

Matt watched him sit down and suddenly got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure on you was removed as Matt lifted his bare sole off you and your brother. You couldn\u2019t see clearly but could make out Matt\u2019s titanic form dwarfing you. The two giants had been talking about something a few seconds ago, but you were too busy smelling Matt\u2019s foot and getting dizzy from it to understand any of it. You looked to your side and noticed your brother next to you. He was just as disoriented as you and twice as scared. You reached a hand out to him when suddenly the image of your brother was removed by two giant fingers. Before you could think about what Matt was going to do to him, the giant DigiDestined simply moved him a few inches away from you. Was it to separate you? Or something else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned back up to Matt who was now turning around from what you could tell through your blurred eyes. Your first thought was that he was done and giving you guys a break, but then realized that he was probably just giving his friend a turn to torture you. Neither was correct when Matt suddenly began to lean down. You watched in horror as Matt\u2019s giant butt descended on you, the fabric of his jeans getting closer and closer by the second. You knew he was going slow just to torture you more. Joey had no idea what was happening, since he was too scared to look up. After what felt like a full minute, Matt\u2019s butt finally made contact with the stump as he sat himself down. You heard your brother\u2019s screams just before they were muffled by Matt\u2019s left ass cheek. You were pinned under his right, the rough texture of his pants pushing you down along with the mound of muscle that was hidden behind it. The pressure was much worse than his foot, but at least it didn\u2019t smell\u2026yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t crush them.\u201d reminded Tai from his seating position. If they were crushed, he\u2019d lose his turn with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, don\u2019t worry. I\u2018m not using my full weight.\u201d responded Matt without looking at Tai. He was too busy looking down at his butt. Although he couldn\u2019t see his two slaves, he pictured their smushed little bodies with his mind. The thought excited him even more. A few minutes passed and Matt knew it was almost Tai\u2019s turn. He felt like doing one last thing to the two shrimp siblings before turning them over to Tai. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You literally walked into Tai\u2019s sole and pressed yourself into the soft flesh. You hugged his foot and massaged it with your entire body. You even gave it a casual lick every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother just watched in horror as you worshiped Tai\u2019s foot. His big brother had been reduced to this.

Should we split them between us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to separate us?!\u201d you yelled up at Tai. Joey hid behind you with a frightened look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh. They\u2019re two of you and two of us. It\u2019s perfect. Do you have a problem with that, willing slave?\u201d You bit your lip as Tai grinned down at you. You didn\u2019t have a say in the matter, but you didn\u2019t want to leave your brother alone with one of these evil kids again. Suddenly, Matt put a hand on Tai\u2019s shoulder and directed his attention to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have an idea, Tai. How about you sleep over my house tonight? We can have all sorts of fun with them together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Are you show them pity?\u201d Tai asked with an evil smirk. Matt chuckled and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, I just thought it\u2019ll be more fun with both of them. We can each take one for ourselves tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan. That sound good, slaves?\u201d Tai looked down at you once more. \u201cWell, guess we better start walking. The nearest link between the Digital World and ours is about a half hour from here. And guess where you\u2019re going to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai started to strip off his shirt. Seeing this, Matt got the idea and also took his top off. When both boys were shirtless, Tai bent down and plucked Joey up from behind you. The boy didn\u2019t try to scream this time as he was slapped into Tai\u2019s armpit. Tai put his arm down and started to rub, greasing Joey up and getting him stuck to his pit. Matt grabbed you as well, but brought you up to his face instead. He poked one of his fingers into your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember, you promised to be a willing slave from now on. That goes for your brother too. If either of you try anything funny, like trying to escape, little bro will be taking a one-way trip in here.\u201d Matt patted his stomach with his other hand. You nodded in understanding before Matt stuck you underneath his arm. Both of the young chosen ones slipped their shirts back on and started to trek down the mountain together. Both you and your brother endured their hot, smelly pits for the next half hour. Soon enough, Matt and Tai reached a small TV seating on a lonesome stump. Holding their digivices to it, the four of you were sucked into the TV. It felt kind of weird traveling between two different worlds (similar to when you entered the Digital World from your world). The two preteens appeared in Matt\u2019s room through his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour room\u2019s a mess, like always.\u201d Tai said as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Matt replied as he kicked a few random objects out of his way. He looked out the window to see that the sun was just going down. Both boys once again took their shirts off to get to you, then put them back on after putting you both on Matt\u2019s bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go tell my parents your sleeping over.\u201d Matt left the room as Tai sat down on the bed next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys ready for some fun?

Lemme show you.\u201d A moment later, Tai pulled his shirt over his head. TK wondered what he was doing, but saw that something was stuck in his friend\u2019s armpit. Tai plucked you out of his pit an brought you to his face. \u201cSo, how were the past few days? Did you enjoy it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could mutter a response, TK shouted out. \u201cWhat is that?! I thought it was an action figure, but it just moved!

Wanna hold him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d TK yelped with glee before practically ripping you out of Tai\u2019s hand. He didn\u2019t really understand the part about pulling you out of another dimension, but that hardly mattered. To the small child, you were a living toy. TK grasped you with both hands and brought you dangerously close to his large face. \u201cHi there, little guy. What\u2019s your name? Where are you from? How old are you? I\u2019m eight!\u201d TK started petting you on the head like you were a rodent of some sort.

Soon you were clamped between two of his gunky toes and ordered to sniff out all the toejam in the crevice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confident that TK would come save you, so you did nothing. \"Hmm....Seems you haven't learned your place little bug! Tai if I squish this one can we get another one no sweat?\" Matt said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai chuckled, \"Of course! Be my guest!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear that bug!? You're worthless! Now squish real good and become toejam!\" Matt said squeezing your poor head as hard as he could between his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream in terror, the last thing you remember is having toejam fill your mouth and nose as you screamed and took a last inhale of raunchy smelling air. </span></div></div>",

You squirmed but too no avail there was no way of getting out of this toe trap, but that's when it happened.  Perhaps it was the smell or the pressure getting to you but all of a sudden you stretched your neck out and gave the sole of Tai's foot a big lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweaty taste that entered your mouth was almost enjoyable, so you took another lick and another.  You were enjoying this more than anything in your life, you inhaled deeply and squirmed your way to between Tai's biggest and second toe where the smell was strongest.  Hoping to please your Master you began licking between his toes to clean them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you noticed the movemtn had stopped and Tai was removing his foot from his shoe, he pulled the damp sock off and you came out with it.  he lifted his foot up and pulled you out from between his toes, as you looked up at this giant boy you dropped to your knees and bowed before him saying \"All hail Master Tai, anything you say I will do\".

Matt just scooped you up in the palm of his hand and you sat and groaned in failure at your feeble attempt to escape.  \"Tsk tsk tsk\" Matt said shaking a finger \"Can't have you running off can we now?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought the best way would just to come out and tell him what happened and ask him to help you.  \"After several minutes Matt stopped thinking and said \"Nah there's not gonna be any help from anyone because you're all mine now\".

Suddenly! There was a loud booming behind you, it shook the ground and threw you into the air, landing on your back you were encased in darkness.  The sun was blotted out as you were engulfed in this enormous shadow.  You craned your neck backwards to see an enormous kid, he looked like a God from here, he was so intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it clicked in your head how you recognised it here, you were in the Digital World!  This all made no sense, you were at home and now you're here and tiny it would seem.  You recognised the kid as Izzy, the smartest Digidestined, surely he'd know how to get you back to normal.  But looking from down at his feet and staring up at his enormous form a weird thought struck you \"Do I really want to return back to normal?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to your fett and yelled at the top of your lungs \"IZZYYYYY!!!\".  \"Huh?\" the kid said as he looked down at his sneakers and out of the corner of his eye he caught a glimpse of you waving, as his hand reached down to clutch you, you had to think fast of what to say to him...</span></div></div>",

Dropping you onto the room\u2019s cold floor, you yelped as your butt hit the floor. Before you could rub it or even stand up, the giant monk removed one of his feet from its sandal and slammed in onto you. Pain shot through your body by the force of the impact. Your ribs felt like they were going to snap in half. Again, before you could acknowledge the pain in your ribs, Miroku began rolling you under the ball of his foot. Being stuck between a hard place and the foot of a giant Buddhist monk; not a fun experience. It felt like you were slowly being molded into a ball and you were very uncomfortable. The moist underside of Miroku\u2019s sole from his travels didn\u2019t help either. After several minutes of this torture, Miroku finally stopped and positioned you so your head was poking out from between his big and index toes. You looked up at his smiling face looking back down at you. When his toes started to squeeze your head, you closed your eyes to try and tolerate the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, are you ready to tell me where Naraku is? If not, that\u2019s fine by me. I can do this all day. Or maybe not, I could also give up and then I won\u2019t need you anymore\u2026\u201d Miroku chuckled evilly. Ironic that he was trying to get info on an evil person using evil methods\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t--\u201d you started to say, but a single drop of foot sweat leaked into your mouth and you started to choke on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t quite get that. Oh well, I\u2019ll take it as a no.\u201d he said as you continued to cough. Not caring about your health and not giving you enough time to clear your lungs of the foul liquid, Miroku proceeded to grab you off the floor with his toes and scrunch them together, successfully squeezing the life out of you. Your screams fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-stop! You\u2019re going--*cough*--to crush me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen tell me what I want to know and I\u2019ll stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well.\u201d Miroku tightened his grip and you could no longer breath. That was it, you were going to break. Just a tiny bit more and you were going to snap. You could feel it, just a few more seconds and\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perverted, and apparently sadistic, monk released the pressure on your poor body and let you drop to the floor. You gasped for breath and started choking again, clearing the last bit of the sweat from your lungs. Your body ached and you were red all over. But Miroku took no pity on you and merely gazed down at your frail form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t let you kick the bucket yet. We haven\u2019t quite reached that stage yet. Ready to tell me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t know what to say. The giant male thought you were a spy with information, but you had nothing to give him but your screams of agony (although that seemed to please him just as much). Unfortunately for you, Miroku took your silence as a refusal to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersistent little bug. I\u2019ll break you eventually. In half if I must.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You gasped when you realized it was someone's eye!  \"Hmph,\" Said a man's voice, \"Bout time you woke up, puny demon!\" <br>\r\nWait a sec, you recognize that voice! \"I-Inuyasha?\" you whisper. However Inuyasha's keen dog ears were able to pick it up. \"Ha! So you do know me! Then you are a demon spy!\" He said finally giving you a view of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!? No I'm not!\" You said becoming afraid of the gigantic dog demon. \"Hmph, liar. Why else would a demon be so puny? But if you don't wanna cooporate....I'll just have to torture you til' you decide to talk!\" Inuyasha said chuckling sadistically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped...</span></div></div>",

He sat down on the wooden floor (you appeared to be in a shack of some sort) and stretched out his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, I\u2019ve been on my legs all day. They\u2019re really sore.\u201d Inuyasha groaned as he to bent one of is feet to take a look at its underside. You watched as well as the half-demon\u2019s dirty sole came into view. \u201cHow about it, spy, you think you can clean these babies for me?\u201d Without hearing your reply, Inuyasha brought you over to his bare soles and dropped you in front of them. Before you could move, the giant, teenage demon curled his feet around you to create a sort of cage. His soles were really close now, do you could tell just how filthy they looked. \u201cSorry, I haven\u2019t bathed in a week either. Better get to work\u2026OR ELSE.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieving it to be a bad idea to refuse him, you immediately started cleaning his soles in the only way possible: licking them. Your tongue met the foot and you knew right then this was going to be horrid. His sole tasted like soil, grime, and sweat. Nevertheless, you continued to slurp up the muck from the demon\u2019s feet. Or perhaps he was now a god?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes or so, your progress was getting better. You managed to clean the grime off one quarter of the sole. Your tongue felt rotten and your stomach felt full of dirt. You wished you had some real food. Looking up for the first time, you noticed Inuyasha was chowing down on something. It looked like a lunchbox Kagome had prepared. Inuyasha\u2019s keen senses detected you watching him, although he also noticed you had stopped licking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, tired already? You barely cleaned one foot, you pathetic speck! You hungry or something? If that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re the one that\u2019s hungry, so you get this. Were you expecting something better, bug? A weak, little demon like you only deserves this. Now start easting, I won\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d You hold back your tears and surrender to the giant male. Your stomach was already in pain from eating nothing but dirt and dried foot sweat, this was only going to make it worse. You lifted yourself up to Inuyasha\u2019s toes and put your head between his toes. Now only inches in front of the mess of gunk, you gulp before pushing your face into the toejam and eating. It tasted nothing like jam or cheese, and your eyes began to water just by being this close to the stuff. While you were in the middle of chewing your third mouthful, Inuyasha suddenly took his fingers away and allowed his toes to squeeze back together. Your face was now stuck between his smelly toes and pushed forcefully into the heap of toe cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha, you look so pathetic.\u201d laughed Inuyasha as he watched you try to pry yourself from his toes. He was tightening his grip and there was no way you were getting out. \u201cKeep eating, spy. Lick up every last bit.\u201d You sobbed into the hot flesh as you started to lick again. You still couldn\u2019t believe this had happened to you. Instead of having a nice pizza or hamburger for lunch, you were eating the grime from between one of your favorite anime character\u2019s toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Inuyasha had finished eating his lunch and looked down at his foot. He saw that you had passed out sometime before from the torture. Instead of feeling sorry, the half-demon just grinned in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaraku sure has some weak-ass minions.

As you\u2019re crushed between his palm and foot, the half-demon begins dragging you across the sweaty surface of his raunchy demon foot. He watches with glee as the sweat that covered his skin begins to transfer on to you. Soon he\u2019s scrubbed his entire left foot, but his right still remains. He doesn\u2019t even give you time to catch a breath before you\u2019re squeezed against his other foot. You feel just like a sponge, absorbing all the sweat and odor from his bare feet. Over the top, along the sole, through the toes. Soon you\u2019ve covered every inch of his feet and have a sweaty, raunchy body to prove it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInuyasha, please stop!\u201d you cry as he brings you back to his face. Inuyasha just flashes you a grin and uses his free hand to undo his top. The red material falls off his shoulders, revealing his bare torso that glistens with sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, that feels good.\u201d Inuyasha says as he relaxes against the tree. He lifts one of his arms up and take a sniff underneath. \u201cAnd that smells awful!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what\u2019s coming as Inuyasha brings his fist toward his exposed armpit. He doesn\u2019t even smile at you, just closes his eyes and relaxes before slapping you against his armpit and rubbing you in there good. You scream and get a mouthful of pit sweat, along with a few white hairs that taste awful. By the time Inuyasha switches hands and rubs down his other pit, you\u2019re barely conscious. The smell of Inuyasha\u2019s feet and armpits are the last thing you acknowledge before you pass out\u2026again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha feels you go limp and removes you to check your condition. He wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the stench had killed you, but his ears still pick up the faint beating of your heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no you don\u2019t! Wake up, minion!\u201d Inuyasha flicks you hard in the forehead, almost snapping your neck and leaving a big red mark. \u201cI said WAKE UP!!\u201d he shouts at you, blowing his smelly dog breath all over you. It\u2019s enough to make you stir, but you still seem out of it. \u201cWell, as long as you can smell, I really don\u2019t care how close to unconsciousness you are. Maybe you\u2019ll be wide awake after I do THIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha jumps to his feet and starts to do something with his pants. Your hearing may not be so good right now, but you can faintly hear the sound of Inuyasha\u2019s pants hitting the ground.

Tears are streaming down your face as you are covered in the Dog Demon's waste, and that you will never be able to get the horrible smell out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his crack was clean of sweat and...other things, Inuyasha began thinking about what to do next.

As bad as his butt smelled, nothing he could do would be worse than being forced to smell his past shits!

The teen winces a few times a she tugs on some hairs before he finally manages to remove you. \u201cHere, catch.\u201d Inuyasha tosses you over to Miroku, who catches you in his hands and examines you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this, Inuyasha? It looks like a tiny human\u2026but his clothes are strange.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you tell? He\u2019s a tiny demon sent by Naraku to spy on us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it you tortured him, by the looks of it. He\u2019s in very poor condition\u2026\u201d Miroku continues to examine your broken, sweat-covered form before bringing you up to his nose and taking a whiff. He immediately regrets this action as his face twists into a sickly expression. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t *cough* smell like a demon. The only thing *cough* I can smell on him is you. A LOT of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously a pathetically weak but crafty demon.\u201d Inuyasha replies, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you think he\u2019s a human. No humans are that small!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I agree that he can\u2019t be a human\u2026not a normal one, anyway. What did you plan to gain from torturing him, though? Information?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt first yeah, but he wouldn\u2019t talk so I just decided to toy with him until he kicks the bucket.\u201d Inuyasha laughs at his cruelty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis would be a good opportunity to get information from him. Like this, however, he\u2019ll die if we torture him any more. Give me a sec\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiroku lays your worn out body on the grass and removes a talisman from his clothes. You watch with weak eyes as he holds the piece of paper over you and chants a few words you don\u2019t understand. Suddenly, the talisman burns up in his hand and the ashes fall over you. Your body starts to glow white and you feel your energy returning. You no longer feel tired or in pain, although still a little smelly. You jump to your feet and start testing your joints for any pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you fixed him! Now we can play with him some more!\u201d Inuyasha grins down at you as he says this. You realize that the only reason you were healed was so they could torture you even more. Now wanting to experience all that again, you try to run away. Inuyasha easily blocks you path with his foot and you spin around to go another way. This time, Miroku stops you with his sandaled foot and you look up at him to see that he\u2019s also smirking down at you. His voice was so nice a few seconds ago, but now he wants to torture you just as much as Inuyasha does!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! I\u2019m not a spy! You have to believe me!\u201d you yell up at the towering monk, hoping he will realize the misunderstanding that\u2019s been made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the same song he\u2019s been singing all this time.\u201d Inuyasha tells his human friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be singing a new tune when where\u2019s done with him\u2026\u201d Miroku chuckles as his head fills with evil thoughts. </span></div></div>",

In your hands was your prized PSP, playing a downloaded episode of Gurren Lagann. You had just recently become fascinated by the show after a group of friends had introduced you to it. It was just so action-packed and crazy, you felt like a sky-diving experience would be similar. You were so wrapped up in watching the show that you didn\u2019t notice the world around you begin to change. Only when the sidewalk under you vanished and the world begin to dissolve did you notice anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit, what\u2019s happening?!\u201d you yelled as you fell into emptiness. Planets and star systems were zooming in and out around you and before you knew it you hit something hard. Groaning in pain, you stood up and looked around. You were now in some kind of room with metal walls and floors, like a secret base. What was strange, though, was that everything was gigantic! \u201cShit! SHIT! What\u2019s going on? Where the hell am I? Crap, where\u2019s my PSP?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to spot your PSP lying on the ground nearby. Thankful that it wasn\u2019t damaged at all, you started to run toward it until a loud crash knocked you off your feet. You stared in shock at the sight in front of you. A brown boot had just stepped in front of you, missing you by (to you) mere inches. The foot had also crushed your PSP! Straining your neck back, you looked up to see the face of Simon from Gurren Lagann looking down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hi there. What are you supposed to be?\u201d he asked in an innocent tone. This was crazy. You\u2019d shrunken and been warped to the world of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Plus, a giant Simon was now looking down at your tiny body. You couldn\u2019t help but feel a little\u2026excited. Sure, your PSP had just been crushed, but how many people get to be transported to such an amazing world like this?! And Simon, who you always thought was kind of cool, was standing above you like a god. He was dressed in his typical blue vest and brown pants. His vest was open to reveal his almost bare chest, save for his abdomen which was wrapped in white cloth. While you were still admiring his form and the aura he seemed to give off, Simon reached down and scooped you up into his hand. The hand rose to his face and you stared into his dark blue eyes. \u201cI guess you didn\u2019t hear me from down there. I\u2019ll ask again: what are you supposed to be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped out of your daze and gladly answered him. \u201cUm\u2026I\u2019m a human. Like you.\u201d This made Simon laugh, which kind of surprised you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA human? Seriously? I know we can be small sometimes, like me, but you\u2019re WAY too small to be a human. No, I think you\u2019re actually a Beastman! Probably crossed with a mouse\u2026or a bug. Did you come here to spy on us, little Beastman?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious. I\u2019m really a human. I must have been shrunken or something. Do I look like a Beastman to you?\u201d Simon scanned over you and thought for a moment. It was true, you didn\u2019t look like a Beastman. However, Beastmen were tricky and who\u2019s to say they haven\u2019t developed a way to hide their identities? After several moments of thinking, Simon grinned down at you. The grin kind of freaked you out as the joy of coming to this world started to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you\u2019re lying. You\u2019re a Beastman spy and I\u2019m going to get what you know out of you! Either that, or I can make it so there\u2019s one less Beastman in the world\u2026\u201d Simon cracked a smile. You were now officially scared. </span></div></div>",

You screamed for a few short seconds before you hit the wet spongy, and reeking insole of Simon's leather shoe. You unstuck your face from a sticky glob of toejam and looked up to see him flexing his foot above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to talk yet?\" Simon said, thoroughly enjoying having power over someone who was smaller than him for a change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-*cough*....I swear I don't know anything Simon!\" You cry up t o him. However you'd soon learn that that one slip of the tongue would cost you dearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second!

And wiggle as much as you want; it feels good.\u201d Simon said as he smirked down at his shoe. He then started to make his way out of the room, each step shaking your world. The lower portion of your body received the most pressure, causing you to strain your head in discomfort. Simon strolled down the hall of the base until he reached a large meeting room. Seated in the room were several of his comrades, plus the Aday twins playing on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Simon!\u201d screamed Yoko from across the room. \u201cLook at you, you didn\u2019t even shower! Do you like reeking to high heaven?\u201d Simon stuttered  before the older woman, until another a large hand landed on his head and another voice spoke from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell of course he does!\u201d came Kamina, entering the room after Simon and looking just as sweaty as him. \u201cHe\u2019s a man, after all. Men enjoy the smell of hard-earned sweat. Isn\u2019t that that, little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon chuckled nervously. \u201cYeah, sure thing, big bro.\u201d Yoko sighed and mumbled something about them being idiot men. Simon looked around the room, then suddenly noticed something strange. \u201cHey, where\u2019s Rossiu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeron, who was twiddling a pen in his fingers, answered Simon without looking up from the table. \u201cThat poor boy hasn\u2019t left his room in days. I think he\u2019s working on something big, but I am worried about the dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened to the conversations above you silently.

The second option is probably your best bet at this point since Simon himself seemed hell bent on not even trying to listen to you. Maybe Kamina would be more forgiving, maybe Yoko would be lenient, maybe Leeron would be more understanding...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the shoe you're in lurches backwards and Simon's toes curl reflexively around you, forcing your face deeper into the sweaty flesh. You feel like you're going to vomit and pass out, in that order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the shoe Yoko had stomped over to Simon and Kamina, ready to read them the riot act for being so gross, and Simon had panicked at her advancement and fell over himself into Kamina. Kamina wrapped an arm around his shoulders and steadied him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright enough is enough! I don't care how much you two enjoy being covered in sweat and crud you're going to wash yourselves right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, if it'll get you off our backs we'll do it!\" Kamina replied, turning Simon around and walking toward the bathroom. Yoko sighed and sat back down, rubbing her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear that man is going to be the death of me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door to the bathroom was closed Kamina stripped naked and hit the water faucets, filling up a huge community bath tub that was sunk into the floor. Simon had thrown his jacket aside and undone the cloth around his stomach when he remembered you. He glanced over at his bro and wondered if he should tell him about you. There really wasn't any reason not to. Besides, Kamina was considered the leader around here, it would be wrong not to tell him about spies! With that in mind, Simon finished stripping out of his clothes and pulled off his shoes revealing your tiny body glued to his toes by the sweat. He pulled you off and jumped into the steaming water next to Kamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro? I've got something to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina grinned and patted his little bro on the head. \"Sure thing! What's on your mind Simon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I found a little Beastman running around! See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held you up for Kamina to examine. After getting tossed around inside of Simon's shoe for so long, with no hope of being let go, you take this opportunity to jump up and shout, \"You have to help me! I'm not a Beastman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon instantly clenched his hand in a fist putting pressure on your chest causing a gasp to issue from within. Kamina bends his dripping head closer to Simon's fist and looks into your scared and miserable face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you find this guy Simon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was wandering around the hall earlier. He said he wasn't a Beastman but he knew my name! Besides, what kind of human is so small? He has to be a spy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina looked surprised at this and said, \"Hey, hey, hey! Simon, you can't judge a man just because he's small! The worth of a man is in his heart and soul, not his height! You of all people should know that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon looked shocked at what his bro was saying and shook the hand you were in. \"Yeah, but it's just not normal! No human could possibly be so small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina sternly held out his hand and said, \"Hand him over Simon. I want to talk to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon reluctantly dropped you into Kamina's hand. You quickly rise to your feet again and peer hopefully into the even bigger giant's eyes. They were fierce, scanning your tiny body intently, taking in every detail. Kamina's hand was rough under your bare feet, callused from his time wielding a sword and piloting the Gurren. You hoped, you prayed that Kamina would be merciful and let you explain yourself. Finally, after five minutes of waiting, Kamina said, \"Well you don't look like a Beastman. Where do you come from little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a loaded question. As best you can you relate what happened omitting things like your PSP which wouldn't mean anything to Kamina anyway. After you were done Kamina leaned back and closed his eyes, thinking. After a few minutes he finally sits up and grins at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know anything about other worlds but if you swear loyalty to Team Gurren than I don't care where you came from!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sink to her knees in relief, so happy that your trying time was now over. Simon looks at Kamina in shock and sputters, \"Are you sure about this bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina flashes a thumbs up and replies, \"Of course! Don't you worry Simon! If this guy does turn out to be a spy we can easily crush him! So what do you say little guy? Are you going to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump up and throw your fist in the air. \"Yes I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina shouts out, \"I like your drive kid! From now on you're on the winning team defending the planet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon smiled weakly and said, \"Well if you trust him, then I trust him too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina then proceeds to rip your clothes off and drop you into the water. \"Alright guys lets have a great bath together and introduce our new friend to the rest of the crew!\"</span></div></div>",

Yoko would kill me if she saw me like this. You wanna see?\u201d you shook your head rapidly. \u201cNo? Too bad.\u201d  Simon\u2019s hand curled around you and gripped you in his fist. He lifted his left arm up and his vest fell back to reveal a hairless, sweaty pit. Burying is face into it, Simon began sniffing it. He sighed and drew his head back. \u201cReal smelly in there. Here, have a closer look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Simon plunged you into his armpit like a stick of deodorant. You didn\u2019t even have time to scream, but maybe that was better since none of the humid sweat got into your mouth. You were still pushed into the hot pit violently and dragged back and forth along it. You released the pit was, in fact, not completely hairless. Tiny blue hairs were present, only long enough to tickle your face and smear sweat over you. Simon retraced you from his pit and looked you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was that? Ready to give me some info now? How\u2019d you get in here?\u201d he questioned with stern-looking eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d you mumbled. \u201cI was taking a walk and I suddenly ended up here! I swear, it\u2019s the truth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure, sure.\u201d Simon said, not believing you. The giant boy switched you with his other hand and lifted his right arm up. He motioned you over to it and you whimpered for him to stop. Your pleas were ignored, though, as you were once again forced into the sweaty hell. \u201cMake sure you soak up all of it, little spy.\u2019</span></div></div>",

You were stuck to his pit like a fly on some sticky paper. Simon smiled and though how perfect that place was for a spy like you. He decided that some time in there would convince you to spill the beans. If not, there was always more he could do. The young teen put his arm down so you were squeezed between his arm and ribs, both acting like walls of sticky, smelling flesh. You were unable to move even an inch and simply waited there while try your best not to pass out from the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fixing his vest up, Simon began walking toward his door. You were rubbed more and more as his arms swayed from the simple movement. After exiting his room and locking it, he strolled casually down the hall of the team\u2019s headquarters. He was trying to think of something to do on this boring, hot day. That big battle a couple hours ago had really worn him out, so he was looking foreword to resting in his room.

Your screams start to turn into wheezes until you go silent forever. Even after you had gone mute, Simon continued to ground your bones to dust and toss your meaty remains around his mouth. Once you had been reduced to a slimy paste, the young pilot easily gulped your remains down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was delicious. I hope they send more spies like you.\u201d Simon said to his flat stomach as he gave it a couple slaps. He headed off to the kitchen to get something to wash his meal down with. On his way there, he let out a hearty belch that earned him some stares from his comrades. They wondered what the kid had eaten\u2026if only they knew. </span></div></div>",

That you, Maine Charati a normal high school guy would be shrunk at your upperclasman crush\u2019s feet. But it was true. And you loved it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuichi Soda was your senpai, or your upperclassmen, in Hope\u2019s Peak Acadamey. While you where a reserve course student you still hung around some of the \u2018real\u2019 hope\u2019s peak students also known as the ultimate students. <br>\r\nKazuichi was your biggest crush and you had tried several times to talk to him... though you would always back out in fear of rejection. <br>\r\nHowever you one day managed to build up courage to talk to him and you two became close freinds. You told him everything, (except your crush on him) even your fetish of being shrunk at a guy\u2019s feet. Kazuichi seemed to take note of that and he began to work on a new project. You would ask, \u201cWhat are you making?\u201d He would usually respond with \u201cYour Present!\u201d You would try to ask him more but he would playfully tease you until you stopped. <br>\r\nOne night you decided you would tell him about your crush after he gave you your gift. You got ready and met him at his house. Kazuichi had his typical shark toothed grin as you arrived and he immediately ushured you inside. You went to his room, which was a decently messy room. Dirty clothes were scattered across the floor and tools lined his desk and dresser. On the bed however you saw a small ray gun. Kazuichi smilled and picked up the ray gun. <br>\r\n\u201cSo you told me about your little fetish and i was thinkin\u2019 how could i make my freind\u2019s dream come true? Well then it came to me! Make a shrink ray and shrink him!\u201d <br>\r\nYou were both confused and amused. <br>\r\nAt first you didnt think he actually made one. But then he pointed and shot it at you. You felt sick and fell back. <br>\r\nWhen you awoke you were 2 inches tall with giant socked toes covering your body like a sweaty blanket. <br>\r\nLooking up you saw Kazuichi\u2019s concerned smile. He lifted you up and smiled \u201cWell... what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW-wow Senpai! I love it!\u201d Kazuichi blushed \u201cwell you know me. I\u2019m a helpful guy.\u201d You chuckled. <br>\r\n\u201cSo. Who do you want me to take you to? Im sure some of the guys will be willing to take you in.\u201d <br>\r\nWith a determined smile on your face you-</span></div></div>",

He stood up and began to strip down. After his strip all he was left in was his brightly colored underwear. You could see his bulge and yearned for it. He set you in front of the sole of his foot and smiled. \u201cExplore my body buggy.\u201d  <br>\r\nYou smiled and began by licking his bare foot. It tasted of sweat and salt. You smiled and gave it a good sniff. Then you began to walk. You got to his waist and patted his bulge giving it a good kiss. When you left his bulge and got to his chest you kissed his nipple and licked his pecs. <br>\r\n\u201cA nasty little bug~\u201d Kazuichi teased. You blushed and walked to his armpit. You wiggled under his arm and laid in the sweatty and smelly little pocket. You licked it and sucked on his armpit. After you were done you walked back to his chin and kissed Kazuichi again. <br>\r\nYou looked at him and smiled. You began to climb over to his mouth. You climbed in and laid down on his tongue. <br>\r\nHe pressed your face into the slimy pink muscle. <br>\r\nYou moaned as he continued to play with you in his mouth. <br>\r\n\u201cNow buggy lets get ready for some real fun~\u201d he began to move yo to his-</span></div></div>",

He seemed to have been running for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Naruto, have you seen Sasuke anywhere?\u201d the brown haired shinobi asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026no, why are you looking for him?\u201d Naruto replied, avoiding the urge to look at his sandaled foot where the tiny Sasuke was fruitlessly struggling for freedom. Naruto wiggled his toes and pressed Sasuke deeper into his insole to keep him quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just came back from a mission and he ditched me before we could turn in the report to the Hokage. I had to explain to her how badly the mission went all by myself! Now I\u2019ve been running all over the village looking for that bastard so I can give him a piece of my mind.\u201d Kiba pounded his fist into his other hand and growled in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I had to spend an entire mission with someone that smells like wet dog, I\u2019d want get away from them as fast as possible too.\u201d Naruto joked, snickering at Kiba. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feral genin glared at Naruto and countered., \u201cLook who\u2019s talking! When was the last time you bathed?\u201d Kiba fanned in front of his nose to emphasize how badly Naruto stunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a busy guy, you know! I don\u2019t always have time to spend at home. Right now is one of my lucky breaks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever\u2026\u201d Kiba scratched his head and looked around. Sasuke was no where to be found and Naruto didn\u2019t seem to know anything. \u201cYou feel like hanging out? This mission and chasing after Sasuke has gotten me really stressed out. I could use a break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but where\u2019s Akamaru? I don\u2019t see him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe got injured during the mission and I had to leave him at home to rest. That too is partially Sasuke\u2019s fault. When I find him, I\u2019m gonna kill him!\u201d Kiba snarled and clenched his fists. His temper made even Naruto take a step back. The blond ninja wondered what the angry teen would do if he found Sasuke at this size. \u201cAnyway, where do you want to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young ninjas headed off into the village together to find something to do. Kiba had no idea they had a third genin with them; the tiny Uchiha stuck under Naruto\u2019s sweaty foot. </span></div></div>",

We'll just take a walk there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto and Kiba were heading towards the training field, the tiny Sasuke was helplessly struggling under Naruto's stinky foot. Even while talking with Kiba, Naruto hadn't forgoten about Sasuke at all. He was enjoying to humiliate his rival by making him his insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst all of this, Sasuke was starting to get angry. \"Hey, you idiot! Get me of here! You can't do this to me! You loser, get me out of here!!!\" Sasuke was screaming as he couldn't take the smell. \"Wait...is that Kiba?\" Sasuke moved a little so that he can see Kiba as his whole view was blocked by Naruto's huge sole. \"Yes, it's him...maybe this is my chance...yet, I don't know what his reaction might be\". As Sasuke was wondering what to do, Naruto wiggled his toes, pinning Sasuke under them, to make sure that Kiba didn't see him. \"Ugh! Yuck! I can't take this smell anymore! I don't know what Kiba will do when he finds about me, but I rather that , instead of smelling like that loser's feet\".

You must be imagining things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, I don't think th-\" Kiba couldn't finish his sentance as he dropped his pills. \"Damn!\" He said, as he began picking them up. Naruto was using this to his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO KIBA! DOWN HEEERE!\" Sasuke begain to scream again. Before he could say anything, Naruto increased the pressure on his foot, crushing the tiny Sasuke beneath it. \"AGHHH! NOOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not dare to scream again, or I'm going to squish you underfoot. Don't make me do that, after all, I just want you to smell my feet.\" Naruto said as he chuckled. \" You wouldn't dare to crush me! If you do that, you'll kill me\". Sasuke said, as if he challenged Naruto. \"Oh, yeah?\" Naruto said as he intensified his foot's pressure on Sasuke. \"NGHHH...OK,OK...ghhhh...I'LL STOP IF YOU STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but if I hear you again, you're gonna go squish...hehe.\" As Naruto had finished teaching the tiny Sasuke a lesson, Kiba had just picked up all of his pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have them all?\". \"Yeah, I think I got em' all...still, I'm getting the feeling that Sasuke's around here.\" As Kiba pondered, they had reached the training field. \"Ugh! What's that smell?\" Kiba said as he noticed a stinky odour. \" Ow, that must be my feet. I haven't washed them in quite some time\" Naruto began to say as he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" This is my chance! Kiba's looking at Naruto's feet and if I move, he might noticed me. If he doesn't, that loser is going to crush me like a bug. Well, I better try than nothing.\" Sasuke said, as with all his power he began to wriggle around under Naruto's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think there is something under you foot, Naruto.\" Kiba said.

I\u2019m wasn\u2019t going to question it and it seemed like a perfect chance for revenge.\u201d Naruto grinned down at his rival as he smothered him with his sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRevenge?\u201d Kiba repeated. He thought about it for a few seconds until an evil smile spread across his face. The moment Sasuke saw the evil look, he knew that he wasn\u2019t getting any help from Kiba. He had just made things worse for himself. \u201cI could use some revenge too. That Uchiha brat has a lot to pay for.\u201d Kiba glared down at Naruto\u2019s foot as he cracked his knuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re heading for the training ground, right? Why don\u2019t we torture him there together?\u201d Naruto suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask me twice! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Kiba turned around raced for the forest. Naruto ran after him, forcing the tiny Sasuke to endure a lot more pressure as his foot repeatedly pressed into the ground. It didn\u2019t take long for the two speedy ninjas to arrive at the training field. They were both sweaty from the run, much to Sasuke\u2019s discomfort. They kicked off their sandals and placed Sasuke on the ground. The shrunken ninja was already exhausted from the rough trip in Naruto\u2019s sandal, but the two giants weren\u2019t going to give him any rest. He weakly stared up at their towering forms as they looked down at him with anticipation in their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s start by making him smell our feet. They probably reek right now.\u201d Naruto said as he wiggled his toes in front of Sasuke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going too easy on him. This bastard deserves a bigger torture than that. I say we challenge him to a sparing match: him against our feet!\u201d Kiba suggested, stomping his bare foot against the ground and creating a loud boom. Sasuke knew how easily it would be for one of those feet to crush him like an insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Konoha shinobi argued for a bit and eventually decided on how to torture the little bug. </span></div></div>",

At normal size the bug would be nothing to him, but at his size it was like a gigantic monster from another world. He tried to run away but his body was in so much pain that he couldn\u2019t move.

After what seemed like a half hour of nothing but the two young ninjas going back and forth with each other, the argument finally seemed to reach its climax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I found him first so he comes home with me!\u201d Naruto said, glaring at the dog lover. \u201cTomorrow I\u2019ll let you do whatever you want with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what if he doesn\u2019t survive the night with you?\u201d Kiba shouted back. \u201cI won\u2019t have anyone to play with!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax. Before I found Sasuke, I had this other tiny ninja to play with. He disappeared, but I bet you anything he\u2019s still around the village somewhere. If we lose Sasuke, we can look for him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026fine,\u201d Kiba finally agreed. \u201cBut you better hope we find him if it comes to that. If we don\u2019t, I might just find a way to shrink YOU.\u201d Kiba threatened, poking Naruto in the chest. The orange ninja thought nothing of Kiba\u2019s threat and just laughed. The two said goodbye to each other and Kiba left the training ground. Before Naruto took off, he brought the small Sasuke up to his face and smirked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to head home, bug? Where should I put you for the trip?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnywhere but your sandal again, PLEASE.\u201d Sasuke begged, knowing he probably wouldn\u2019t survive another trip in Naruto\u2019s footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnywhere?

I still have my feet, though! I know how much you love those!\u201d Naruto giggled as he wiggled his toes. \u201cFirst, though, lets get rid of those clothes. Were you planning on washing yourself with your clothes on? Idiot.\u201d Naruto started to use his tree-sized fingers to tug Sasuke\u2019s clothes off his tiny body. Sasuke screamed and tried to fight back, but the giant ninja was easily overpowering him. After Sasuke was stripped naked and his clothes thrown somewhere in the bathroom, Naruto took the soap off the plate and started to scrub Sasuke with it. Once the shrunken boy was covered in soap suds, Naruto brought him down to his left foot and started to apply his Sasuke-Soap to the top of the foot. Sasuke could do nothing as he was used by his rival like a bar of soap. After cleaning the top of his foot, Naruto moved to his sole and started to scrub that. Sasuke wanted to clean himself of feet stink, but instead he was being used to wash Naruto\u2019s feet of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it smell, bug? Time for the toes next!\u201d Naruto chuckled as he scrubbed between each of his toes with the tiny Uchiha. All of Naruto\u2019s toe jam was covering Sasuke and some even got inside his mouth. After cleaning his toes, Naruto dunked Sasuke under the water a few times. Sasuke accidentally swallowed some of the soapy water and started to cough, but Naruto didn\u2019t seem to care and just brought the suffering ninja to his right foot. He repeated the process of cleaning the top of his foot, then his dirty sole, and finally between the toes. Sasuke, choking on water and foot sweat, couldn\u2019t take it any longer and fell unconscious in the giant\u2019s hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, he resumed consciousness.

The young teen glanced at the clock, which showed it was one in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat gives?\u201d Naruto groaned. He saw that his foot was pressed into his mattress; the same one that Sasuke was taped to. He lifted the foot up and examined the sole. The tiny Sasuke was still taped to his foot and looked really red and worn out. \u201cHey, bastard, what\u2019s with all the wiggling? I\u2019m trying to sleep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDope, you almost squashed me!\u201d the little slave shouted back at the towering ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?

The orange ninja had already fallen into sleep again. Sasuke wanted to pound against the foot again to wake the idiot up, but didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t want to risk aggravating the giant foot again. Instead, he closed his own eyes and tried to get some sleep. The foot may smell bad, but it was surprising comfy when it wasn\u2019t trying to crush him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came and Sasuke woke to something poking him. His eyes fluttered open to see Naruto\u2019s giant fingertip probing his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRise and shine, slave.\u201d Naruto called as he grinned down at his tiny rival.

Try climbing my dick.\u201d Naruto said before he went back to moaning. Sasuke hesitated but did as he was told. He didn\u2019t want Naruto to take things \u201cinto his own hands\u201d. The young Uchiha gripped Naruto\u2019s giant member and started to scale up it. The feeling of Sasuke\u2019s tiny fingers digging into him and his naked, sweaty body rubbing against his own sweaty cock flesh felt so good to Naruto. Sasuke soon reached the head of the penis and balanced himself on the throbbing organ. He didn\u2019t want to slip off and fall into the giant\u2019s pubic hair. As Sasuke clung to the pink head, he saw that precum was starting to leak from the slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m almost there, slave. Try sticking your hand down my cock.\u201d Naruto ordered through his gasps. Sasuke was about to outright refuse when Naruto suddenly cracked an eye open and gave him a look that said \u201cDo it or I\u2019ll smash you against my dick.\u201d Sasuke had no choice but to obey and stuck his arm into Naruto\u2019s piss slit. He was in to his elbow when Naruto was thrown over the edge. The blond started to buck his hips, almost hurtling the small Sasuke right off his body! As Sasuke held on for dear life, he felt the cock under him twitch and something wet touch his hand. Sasuke pulled his arm out\u2026just in time for a torrent of sticky white stuff to hit him right in the face. A second torrent came, this one holding enough power to hurl Sasuke off Naruto\u2019s dick and into the air. Sasuke flew through the air and landed hard on Naruto\u2019s naked chest (he had gone to bed in just his boxers). Naruto continued to moan as he came all over his chest and the tiny Sasuke. When he was finally done and his dick went limp, Naruto smiled and licked some cum off his face. He gave Sasuke a glance and saw the poor boy was covered in his spunk.

I know that Sakura thinks that you're nasty, but this is ridiculous!\" As Sasuke said that, Naruto made a surprised facial expression. \"Yeah, that's right! A little before I was shrunken, I slept with Sakura. She said that I'm a great man, and that I'm good at \"it\".

The orange ninja looked on with a blank stare as he relished in Sasuke\u2019s screams.

Sasuke\u2019s screams were quieter now as blood dripped from his mouth and his vision started to deteriorate. Naruto lifted his foot off Sasuke and hovered it over him so the remainder of him was right under the ball of his foot. Sasuke weakly looked up at the sole and spotted the bloody remains of his own legs. He tried to speak but ended up choking on blood instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA few minutes ago I thought you belonged at my feet, sniveling at them. Now I understand you belong UNDER them.\u201d With that, Naruto stomped down on Sasuke and crushed him instantly. He swiveled his foot back and forth, listening to the few intact bones crunch underneath him. Afterward, he examined the bottom of his foot, but couldn\u2019t make out anything recognizable. The fox boy merely sighed and cleaned up his foot and the floor with a napkin before tossing it into the trash.

If he finds out what I did to Sasuke, things are going to get pretty steamy here.I have to think of something...and fast!\" Naruto thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just a minute. Just let me find the key.\" Naruto said thinking up for an excuse to buy him time. \"Key? Naruto...what's going on in there!?\"  Kiba said suspecting the worst. \"Did you do something to Sasuke!? I'm going to beat the crap out of you! Open the door, NOW!\" Kiba said shouting, suspecting Naruto. \"Ugh! Is he a mind reader or something!? I better go find that Shrinking Jutsu scroll that I had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto began digging in the messy room trying to quickly find the scroll. He noticed something red poking out from under the bed and picked it up. It was the scroll. \" Nice! That Kiba is in trouble now...hehe\" Naruto chuckled already making his plans for the dog ninja. \"NARUTOOO!\" Kiba shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm coming. Jeez.\" Naruto said as he unlocked the door. Just as he opened the door, quicker than the light, Kiba entered and immediatly closed it. \"Sigh...looks like somebody woke up on the wrong side of the bed, huh Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have time to listen to your poor jokes. Where's the Uchiha?\" Kiba asked demanding an answer. \"Y-Yeah, well...you see...um\" Naruto stammered. \"YEAHHH!?\" Kiba said growling in anger. \"Well...um, you see, he tried to escape and I began searching for him and I accidentally stepped on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU WHAT!?\" Kiba said furious from what he just heard. \"Y-yeah, but i-it wasn't on purpose, I swear!\" Naruto said, obviously lying. \"WHAT THE HELL DID I TELL YOU, YOU BRAINLESS MORON!?\" Kiba said shouting at Naruto's face. \"Now's my chance!\" Naruto though, as he picked out the scroll. \"Shrinking Jutsu!\" Naruto shouted, making a hand sign, pointing at Kiba. In no time, Kiba was as tall as Naruto's toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck...!?\" Kiba said examining his surroundings. Naruto was now towering high above him. He realized that he was shrunken. \"You were saying? Heh\" Naruto chuckled, glad that his plan had worked. \"Grr! Why you...! I'm going to find a way to grow back my size, and shrink YOU sooner or later! Just you wait!\" Kiba said threatening Naruto. \"Ha, yeah right. Now let's have some fun.\" Naruto chuckled as he bringed his sandal and feet closer to Kiba. \"Just a warning. This is going to stink far more than what happened at the Chunin Exams!\" Naruto said as he...</span></div></div>",

Be honest; you\u2019d enjoy it if our situations were reversed, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba opened his mouth to say something but snapped it shut again. The giant was right; he would enjoy it if Naruto was the one shrunken. It\u2019s not fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba wallowed at his misfortune, he didn\u2019t notice Naruto\u2019s titanic fingers reaching for him until they were already pinching him between them. The tiny Inuzuka Clan member watched Naruto\u2019s humongous body fly by before he was brought to his big, blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, we\u2019re going to have a lot of fun today, Kiba! That\u2019s what you were hoping for, right?\u201d Naruto laughed at the irony, the volume of his voice making Kiba\u2019s ears pop. Before Kiba could think up a reply, Naruto had lowered him down to one of his blue sandals and dropped him onto the unwashed surface. Kiba instinctively sniffed the air and discovered just how bad it was. He almost vomited on the spot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto, get me out of here!\u201d Kiba yelled, turning around to see Naruto\u2019s face replaced by his giant sole. The tiny dog ninja could do nothing but watch as the smelly sole smushed him into the sandal. Kiba was nothing but a tiny speck compared to Naruto\u2019s foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy your stay, Kiba! I\u2019ll take you out\u2026eventually.\u201d Naruto said as he hollered with laughter and slipped his other sandal on before making his way out the door. After locking his apartment, the fox boy noticed he still had the shrinking scroll in his hand. Thinking it might come in handy, Naruto unzipped his jacket and slipped the scroll into a pocket inside. With that taken care of, Naruto took a stroll through the village streets, whistling as he walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath his foot, Kiba was in complete agony. This wasn\u2019t what he was hoping for when he knocked on Naruto\u2019s door. He was expecting a day of tormenting Sasuke, not being the one tormented! As Kiba involuntarily took in Naruto\u2019s foot odor, he began to notice another smell mixed in. His superior senses picked up the faint smell of Sasuke. Which means\u2026this was the same foot Naruto had stepped on Sasuke with! Kiba shivered at the thought of becoming a stain under Naruto\u2019s foot too. He needed to get back to normal\u2026and fast!</span></div></div>",

He though that he needed some rest, and that it would be the perfect opportunity to have some \"private\" time with the tiny Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step, Kiba was crushed more and more into Naruto's dirty insole. Not only that, but it smelled terrible. Naruto was beggining to sweat, and his foot sweat was engulfing Kiba. Kiba tried to struggle, but it was useless as his arms and legs were pinned under the slimy sole. Naruto felt Kiba wrrigling underneath his foot, and enjoyed the feeling. He was feeling really lucky. To have Sasuke at his feet, and now Kiba. It was just one of the best days he ever had in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smushed his sole deeper into Kiba, making him yelp in pain. He wanted to feel Kiba's body underneath his bare sole, and it was feeling good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like a eternity to Kiba, Naruto finally reached his destenation. The hot springs. Naruto removed all of his clothes and removed the tiny Kiba from his sandal, and held him in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! You smell like feet, Kiba\" Naruto said chuckling. \"Please Naruto, turn me back to normal already!\" Kiba said from Naruto's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll alone with the tiny Kiba, Naruto saw a bench and sat on it. He took a whiff off his own foot, and made a disgusted face as he placed the tiny Kiba on the floor next to his enormous feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, they've gotten pretty smelly again.\" Naruto said as he though about how to torture Kiba.</span></div></div>",

The brown haired ninja just stared at the sweaty sole before Naruto said, \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Smell your master\u2019s feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me? I just spent who knows how long in your disgusting sandal!

So close, in fact, that his sole brushed across the dog ninja\u2019s nose. Kiba wrinkled his nose before rearing back in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god!\u201d Kiba cursed, wiping the foot sweat from his nose. \u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better start sniffing my feet if you don\u2019t want to be pinned under them again.\u201d Naruto warned, tapping his other foot impatiently against the floor. Kiba gave the towering, naked giant one last glare before discarding his pride for survival and complying with the fox boy\u2019s demand. Kiba closed the distance between himself and the foot before taking a big sniff of the sole. He immediately jumped back and covered his nose in disgust. His nostrils felt like they were on fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed at the shrunken boy\u2019s reaction and asked, \u201cHow do they smell?\u201d Naruto already knew the answer, but still chuckled when Kiba\u2019s only reply were a series of coughs and hacks. \u201cThat bad, huh? Too bad, because you\u2019re going to keep smelling them until I say stop!\u201d Naruto said this just as Kiba began to recover from his first sniff. Like a good bug, Kiba braced himself and took another smell of Naruto\u2019s foot. The experience wasn\u2019t any better than the first, but Kiba held his ground so he wouldn\u2019t appear weak in front of Naruto. The smell was so bad that Kiba couldn\u2019t prevent a few tears from falling, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba worshiped his feet, Naruto leaned back on the bench and breathed in the warm air of the hot springs. His body glistened with sweat as the steam rising from the water caressed him. It felt so good and was just the kind of relaxation Naruto needed. Kiba, on the other hand, felt no such comfort. His fully clothed body was sweating like a pig in the heat. The least Naruto could have done was allow him to strip as well before coming in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat wasn\u2019t just having an effect on Kiba. Naruto\u2019s foot odor also seemed to intensify in the warmth. Kiba discovered this when he took his 5th or 6th sniff. The heightened odor combined with Kiba\u2019s great sense of smell resulted in the poor dog boy falling to the ground, clutching his nose and writhing around in pain. Naruto looked down at Kiba\u2019s breakdown and hollered with laugher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Kiba, you\u2019re hilarious!\u201d Naruto exclaimed before putting a stop to Kiba\u2019s movements by moving his sole over him. Kiba, his nose still burning in pain, was being smothered by the cruel giant\u2019s foot. Naruto savored the control he had over Kiba and sighed deeply, a grin plastered on his young face. Nothing could take this away from him.  </span></div></div>",

He could do nothing as he was beeing used as a foot toy for the giant fox boy. \"Well Kiba, I think that this was good for now.\" Naruto removed his foot from Kiba, and held him in his hand. Kiba was all sweaty and smelly. \"Ugh! You smell like my feet now.\" Naruto placed the tiny Kiba in one of the hot spring pools and washed him clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba was feeling a bit relieved now. He no longer smelled bad, and he got himself cleaned. \"You stay here. I think I'll go take a bath. But just so I can make sure that my feet still smell, I'll try not to wash away the smell from them, just for you Kiba\" Naruto chuckled as he flexed his toes, and tied Kiba to one of the legs of the bench. After making sure that Kiba was immobile, Naruto made his way to the spring pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, he's underestimating me!\" Kiba managed to somehow slip from the tight grip of the rope that he was tied with. \"Now then, I saw him use somekind of scroll to shrink me. I don't know whether it will return me to normal size, but it's worth a try at least. I better find it quick before he sees me.\" Kiba noticed Naruto's clothes on the bench, and began searching for the scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! I found it!\" Kiba was now happy as he though that this would return him to normal size. He read the scroll and performed the handsighns. Instead of growing however, he shrinked even more! \"No! Damn!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just what do you think that you're doing!?\" Kiba turned around to see none other than Naruto. Naruto got closer, and picked up Kiba on his hand. \"Searching for the scroll, huh? Well guess what, I have a lot of scrolls here to reduce somebody's size, but only a few to grow them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sighned in desparation that he'd never grow back to his normal size again. \"Well, although that your attempt failed, I'm still going to punish you.\" Naruto placed the tiny Kiba on the ground next to his feet once again. Not only that, but they still smelled as bad as ever. Kiba began chocking just by beeing close to them. As Naruto though about how to punish Kiba, he decided.</span></div></div>",

Now just a measly half an inch compared to the god-like Naruto, there was nothing the young ninja could do. Naruto\u2019s toes now towered over him! Every time Naruto wiggled his toes, they would create loud booms that knocked Kiba onto his butt. As Kiba trembled in the shadow of his giant master, he wished luck would somehow shine on him. It wasn\u2019t very likely\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, time to be punished for trying to get back to normal.

He was so small, however, that he wasn\u2019t covering much distance. Naruto didn\u2019t even notice that he had moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, didn\u2019t quite hear that.\u201d Naruto replied. Kiba had become so small that his voice no longer carried enough volume to reach Naruto\u2019s ears. He could no longer communicate with the giant. \u201cI think you said \u2018I\u2019d be happy to stay between your toes, Lord Naruto.\u2019, right? Well get in there, bug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba resisted the urge to cry and swallowed hard before making a dash into Naruto\u2019s toes. Naruto watched with much glee as they tiny speck ran into the crevice of his toes. As Kiba made his way to the large wall in front of him, he glanced around at the two toes that surrounded him. If he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, these two digits could easily crush him to death. Once Kiba had reached the toe jam covered wall, the ninja began to climb it. As he climbed, his body was being covered in globs of slimy toe jam. It became so bad that he soon found himself unable to move, no matter how much he struggled. The itty-bitty Kiba was glued in placed by Naruto\u2019s toe jam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed high above him and released his toes, trapping Kiba in a world of rank, sweaty flesh. He flexed his toes a bit before saying, \u201cMmm, Kiba. You feel so good between my toes.\u201d Naruto continued to flex his toes while smiling down at them. Kiba felt just like a speck of dirt, and would probably break just as easily if he wasn\u2019t careful. After getting used to the speck between his toes, Naruto dried himself off and put his clothes back on before heading out the hot spring doors. He was about to begin a nice jog around the village to build up a good sweat when he heard his name being called from behind him. Turning around, he saw\u2026</span></div></div>",

The boy\u2019s face twisted into pure fear as he yelped and dove out of the shadow just as the foot started coming down. Konohamaru rolled out of the way by the skin of his teeth and the foot hit the ground behind him.

Dodge three more and you\u2019ll complete the exercise, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-fine, but I\u2019m not going to make it easy for you!\u201d Konohamaru yelled up to his leader with newfound energy. The goggle wearing boy made a hand seal before shouting, \u201cShadow Clone Jutsu!\u201d An explosion enveloped Konohamaru and after it cleared, three Konohamarus were standing where the one used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, looks like you\u2019ve been practicing\u2026\u201d Naruto complimented his student, even though he thought of him more as a slave right now. Naruto raised his bare, sweaty foot over the three look-alikes and stomped down just as they scattered, missing all of them. Naruto growled in frustration as he watched the three tiny bugs scurrying around him. \u201cWhich one is the real one, I wonder\u2026\u201dNaruto picked one and raised his foot over it, stomping down too quickly for the boy to escape. Naruto felt Konohamaru crunch under his giant foot and grinned in victory, but that grin turned to a scowl when he felt an explosion under his foot. The clone had dispelled\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWrong one, leader!\u201d one of the remaining Konohamarus shouted. Naruto looked over at the two bugs and noticed they were grinning widely. Just a few moments ago the kid was scared for his life, but now it looked like he was having fun. It seems like the reality of his situation hadn\u2019t sunk in yet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get cocky, kid! I\u2019ll defiantly get you with the last one!\u201d Naruto shouted back as he lifted his foot and watched the two targets run off in different directions, one left and the other right. The giant genin chose quickly and hovered his foot over\u2026</span></div></div>",

This means that you're the real one.\" Naruto turned around and walked to the tiny Konohamaru. \"Well done leader, but did you have to kill them ?\" \"Well, duh.

I'm tired.\" Konahamaru began to pant. \" No brakes. If you want to be strong, you have to endure!\" Naruto dropped his foot down, but Konohamaru managed to evade it again with his last strength. He no longer had any. If Naruto was to hover his foot over him again, he would be stomped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Konohamaru ? Is that all you got ?

I won't be able to dodge this.\" Konohamaru made a scared expression. Naruto just chuckled and acted as if he didn't hear him. Instead of stomping down however, he lowered his foot softly on top of Konohamaru. Konohamaru was immediatly hit by an awful stench. \"Aw man, leader! When's the last time you washed your feet ?!\" Konohamaru said as he began squirming. \"What ? I train a lot, and my feet begin to stink. It's natural. But hey, looks like we found another challenge for you.\" Naruto said as he removed his foot from Konohamaru and just held it close to him. \"What do you mean ?\" Konohamaru said as he was puzzled by what Naruto had for him in mind. \"Well, your next challenge would be...</span></div></div>",

Is that safe, leader?\u201d the shrunken kid asked as he examined his teacher\u2019s gigantic and sweaty foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure it is! Just as long as you don\u2019t get crushed under the pressure!\u201d Naruto laughed out loud as Konohamaru chuckled nervously, thinking his boss was just joking. Naruto used his toes to grip Konohamaru around the waist and lift him into the air before discarding him onto his blue footwear. The tiny ninja-in-training laid down flat on his back and watched Naruto slip his foot into his sandal, slowly covering him in smelly make flesh. Soon Konohamaru felt his body and arms get pinned underneath the giant\u2019s warm foot with only his head resting between two toes. Naruto grinned down at him before looking forward and taking the first step. Konohamaru felt himself go weightless right before a crushing weight fell upon his frail body. Konohamaru grunted and endured the pain, which lifted in seconds\u2026only to come back a second later. Not only was the pressure difficult to put up with, but the only air Konohamaru could breath was contaminated with Naruto\u2019s stinky foot odor. The boy gagged and wanted to cover his nose, but he couldn\u2019t move his arms the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of walking through the village, Naruto glanced down at his right sandal and saw his newest slave writhing with discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToughen up, Konohamaru! How do you expect to survive as my sla-er-pupil if you can\u2019t even take the smell of my feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, leader. It just smells so bad\u2026\u201d Konohamaru coughed a bit more as he sniffed up some more sweat and stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet used to it, kid! That\u2019s the smell of a mighty ninja like me!\u201d Naruto said as he smiled proudly. \u201cBesides, you don\u2019t want to lose to Kiba, do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiba?! He\u2019s taking this training to? Is he the same size as me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly. He didn\u2019t like being so small and tried to get back to normal, but ended up shrinking even more! I think he\u2019s about a quarter your size\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s awesome!\u201d Konohamaru grinned, imagining himself being bigger than Kiba and being able to push him around. The leader\u2019s shrinking jutsu was really something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, leader, I just got a great idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed and rolled his eyes. Even at a few inches tall, the kid still couldn\u2019t keep quiet. \u201cWhat is it, Konohamaru?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should use this shrinking jutsu to shrink Sasuke! You\u2019d defiantly be able to get him back if he was really small!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto almost burst into laughter and suppressed it into a slight giggle. \u201cYeah, well, you never know\u2026\u201d Naruto replied, hiding the fact that Sasuke had already shrunk and been disposed of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd leader\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!

I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Konohamaru cried as it felt like his noggin was going to pop like a grape. Naruto released his head and muttered, \u201cGood, now shut up.\u201d before continuing his trek through the village. Konohamaru kept his mouth shut and just stared up at the towering Naruto above him. He was really taking this training seriously\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Once it was level with him, Konohamaru looked between the fingers and saw nothing but a big blob of toe gunk until he spotted a tiny ninja stuck in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for more training, Konohamaru. This one\u2019s easy; torture Kiba.\u201d Naruto said with an evil, fox-like smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean I can play with him?!\u201d Konohamaru shouted in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, you can call it that. You have to wake him up first, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru grabbed onto the tiny (doll-sized to him) ninja and tried to pull him out of the mass of toe jam. Kiba, however, wouldn\u2019t come out. Annoyed, the academy student rolled up his sleeves and tried again. Naruto snickered a little as he watched his young slave strain his face as he tried to pull Kiba out of the glob. That snicker became a little louder when Konohamaru finally pulled the older ninja free and went flying backwards as a result. Naruto wiped his finger on his pants and watched what Konohamaru did next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting back to his feet, Konohamaru picked up Kiba and started shaking him roughly. No matter how much he shook, however, the genin remained unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, dog breath! Wakey wakey!\u201d the shrunken kid said as he started slapping Kiba. After the sixth slap, Kiba finally began to stir awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026the smell. What\u2026what happened?\u201d Kiba flickered his eyes open and spotted Konohamaru\u2019s grinning face staring straight at him. \u201cWait\u2026you\u2019re the Third\u2019s grandson, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Kiba started to really wake up now as he gazed around, getting a look at the impossibly huge forest around them and his cruel tormentor sitting by a tree. He then noticed that all these things towered over Konohamaru as well. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me he shrunk you too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! I\u2019m going through a really difficult training, like you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat on Earth are you talking about, kid?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust what I said, doggy. Now I have to torture you\u2026so I guess this is part if your training too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you stupid or something?!\u201d Kiba yelled at the much bigger child. Konohamaru didn\u2019t like this and responded by kicking off his sandals and throwing Kiba against the ground. Before the dog ninja had a chance to feel the pain, the boy\u2019s foot stomped on top of him. His was big enough to cover almost his entire body! Konohamaru laughed as he wiggled his toes in Kiba\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, doggy, time to smell the feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shook his head and tried to push Konohamaru\u2019s foot off him. Konohamaru put a stop to these struggles by slamming his heel into the smaller ninja\u2019s gut. What would have usually been a light hit for Kiba was strong enough to knock the wind out of him. Konohamaru stomped his head back into the dirt and gave the order again. This time, Kiba obeyed and started taking whiffs of the young boy\u2019s bare foot. It was no where close to the hell that was Naruto\u2019s feet, but it was still the sweaty foot of a hyperactive shinobi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru laughed again as he watched Kiba grimace under his foot before saying, \u201cThis is so much fun, leader!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, enjoy it while it lasts. We\u2019ll be going back to the hard stuff soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026but can I still play with him a while longer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, a while longer.\u201d Naruto agreed as he rested his arms behind his head and watched Konohamaru\u2026</span></div></div>",

Kid you can't be serious, please! Naruto's lying to you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Konohamaru wouldn't hear it, in fact, he resented the dog boy calling his leader a liar and smashed his foot into Kiba's face, hard enough to nearly break his nose.\"Shut up! Don't talk about Naruto that way!

The dog ninja\u2019s eyes went wide as his \u201csensei\u201d said this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no! You can\u2019t do that, he\u2019ll kill me!\u201d Kiba shouted, allowing Konohamaru smother his toes against Kiba\u2019s mouth and give him a good taste of his foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, well you better obey then!\u201d Konohamaru replied, thinking Kiba was just overreacting. He didn\u2019t know how much danger the puny ninja was really in. Naruto could easily squish him if he ever got bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba whimpered like a puppy before finally obeying Konohamaru\u2019s command. The older male stuck out his tongue and started licking the spaces between the academy student\u2019s toes. The taste of sweat, lint, and dead skin filled his mouth and he almost gagged it back out. He resisted the urge, as that would surely make the bigger boy angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, look leader! He\u2019s cleaning out my toes!\u201d Konohamaru said between giggles, Kiba\u2019s tongue tickling him a bit. Naruto giggled a bit to as he looked down at his two slaves, seeing one so easily dominate the smaller one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, good job, Konohamaru. You\u2019re really breaking him in.\u201d Naruto complimented. Just because Konohamaru was his slave now didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t be proud of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how does my toe jam taste, Kiba?\u201d the young shinobi asked as he wiggled his rank, giant toes over Kiba\u2019s face. The genin didn\u2019t reply and just continued lapping up toe jam. Even though he was doing what he was told, Konohamaru still didn\u2019t like that he was being ignored. \u201cI said, how does my toe jam taste!\u201d Konohamaru repeated, louder this time and shoving one of his toes in Kiba\u2019s face. The single toe covered his mouth and lips, forcing Kiba to kiss the digit. He tried to struggle out of the contact, but Konohamaru was holding him tightly in place. Finally, the boy removed his toe and allowed his victim to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-they taste w-wonderful, Konohamaru.\u201d Kiba replied weakly, sobbing a bit from the humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKonohamaru WHAT?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026K-Konohamaru-sensei.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Konohamaru shoved his feet back into the dog boy\u2019s face and ordered him to continue licking. This torture seemed to go on forever to the poor Kiba, who obediently licked his master\u2019s toes like a dog. It was so humiliating being tortured like this by someone who was just another slave to and even BIGGER master. Suddenly, he heard that bigger master finally speak after awhile of watching in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Konohamaru, that\u2019s enough for now. Time to get back to the hard stuff!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d the shrunken academy student replied, satisfied with what he had done to the smaller slave. The Sarutobi kid stood up and approached his sensei, eager to start another difficult training routine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think Kiba should join in on the training too. He seemed to enjoy the training you gave him.\u201d Naruto suddenly boomed, making Kiba cringe on the ground. His tongue was so sore from licking Konohamaru\u2019s toes that he couldn\u2019t speak. Instead, he mentally shouted a big \u201cNoooo!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, leader? What\u2019s the training going to be?\u201d Konohamaru asked as he stared up at his gigantic boss. Naruto smirked evilly as he saw the look of excitement in Konohamaru\u2019s eyes. This kid really had no idea that he was just a slave to him now. It was going to be a joyful sight when it finally dawned on him\u2026</span></div></div>",

Konohamaru, I want you to start rubbing while Kiba licks between my toes!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026o-okay, I guess\u2026\u201d Konohamaru mutters his response as he walks over to one of Naruto\u2019s outstretched legs and begins rubbing his foot. The sole is really smelly and sticky, but Konohamaru puts up with it for the sake of his \u201ctraining\u201d. While he does this, Naruto plucks Kiba up between his fingers and drops him between his big and index toes. Kiba becomes stuck in another glob of lint, but doesn\u2019t even bother to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow its time for you to start licking up MY toe jam, dog breath! I better feel you licking, or else I\u2019m going to turn you into another batch of the stuff!\u201d Naruto\u2019s voice booms down on Kiba like a voice from the sky. Kiba, too tired to resist, just sticks out his tongue and begins licking the nearest wall of flesh he can reach. It seems to be enough for Naruto, who leans back against the tree as his slaves do their work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is this training, leader?\u201d Konohamaru asks, looking up from the foot he\u2019s rubbing to Naruto\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I say it is.\u201d he replied simply. \u201cDon\u2019t ask so many questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru put his head down and obeyed, not asking Naruto anything more. He continued to rub his boss\u2019s foot for a good while before he barked another order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow start kissing it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKISS IT!\u201d Naruto screamed at Konohamaru, making the younger boy yelp in fright and get right to kissing the hard sole. Naruto smiled in satisfaction as turned this annoying brat into a foot kisser. That shrinking scroll was the best thing that ever happened to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Konohamaru was beginning to think agreeing tot his training was a mistake. Naruto was acting really scary and it was beginning to look like they were worshiping him like some god instead of training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, leader\u2026?\u201d Konohamaru spoke up to Naruto between kisses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026you are going to turn me back to normal soon, right? I know I asked for some difficult training, but I kind of like the old training we used to do together. You\u2019re acting really scary right now\u2026\u201d Konohamaru explained to his giant teacher as he looked up at him with sad eyes. Just a moment ago he was having a great time torturing Kiba, but now it looked like he wasn\u2019t having any fun at all. Naruto looked down at the kid with uncaring eyes as he thought about how to respond. He could lie again and come up with a convincing reason as to the purpose of this training, or he could just break it to the boy that his days as a shinobi were over and he was his slave now. </span></div></div>",

Isn't this tough and challenging ?\" Naruto asked as he kneeled down to the shrunken boy. \"Um...it is leader, but I think it's getting too much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buck up Konohamaru! I told you. If you complete this, you'd get really strong.\" Naruto started to chuckle. \"But how the heck is smelling your nasty feet, training, huh ?!\" Konohamaru growled. \"It is. You're training your nose. What if an enemy appeared infront of you and dropped a poison smoke bomb ? You'd have to control you smell, so you don't inhale any. Even if you do inhale, you have to survive. That's why I'm training you with this.\" Naruto said, believeing that the nonsense he was saying was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...you do have a point leader. But wait! Does that mean that your feet smell like poison ?\" Konohamaru said as he burst out laughing. \"Uhm...well...I do train a lot, and my feet pretty much smell horrible.\" Naruto said as he watched as Konohamaru just laughed so hard that his stomach hurt. \"Oh yeah ?\" Naruto said as he brought his smelly foot next to Konohamaru, which turned his laughs into squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, leader! Stop!\" Konohamaru said as he was pinching his nose from the immense stench. \"Haha, who's laughing now ?\" Naruto said as he enjoyed watching Konohamaru wriggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guaaaaah !\" Naruto heard a scream, and saw a tiny Kiba wriggling from the stench. \"Oh yeah, I forgot about you.\" Naruto says, as he removed Kiba from between his toes, and put him next to Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh ! Don't you ever do that to me !!! Did you hear meee ?!\" Kiba screamed as he was furious about what happened. He had suddenly gained energy to speak because of the fury he held. He was all dirty in Naruto's toe jam. \"Wow...you must have really had it bad there, huh ? I sure wouldn't want to be at you place.\" Konohamaru said as even he was terified. \"Shut up! You're the one to speak! Just moments ago you tortured me as well.\" Kiba said as he growled. \"Yeah, but it's nothing compared to Naruto's feet, now are they ?\" Konohamaru questioned Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...his feet's smell could just...kill you! If he ever dares to put me beneath, next to, between or infront of his feet...I'll...I'll...!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll what, bug ? Don't make me step on you. Heh...\" Naruto said as he intimidated Kiba with his size. \"Grr, why you...\" Just before Kiba was about to say something, he stopped himself realizing that Naruto may do what he threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then. Instead of staying here, let's go to my house. I have a lot of plans.\" Naruto said as he already began thinking about what to do. Just as Naruto was about to put them in his pocket, he put on his sandals, but noticed how their surface had gotten rough on his feet. \"Ow ! I need to buy me some new sandals...but I don't have money right now. These already appear to be overused. If only I had something to place under my foot and the sandal.\" Naruto said as he didn't want his feet to hurt. Suddenly, he looked onto the tiny Kiba and Konohamaru and grinned at them. Each of them on each of his feet was going to be perfect.</span></div></div>",

While he did this, his other hand was busy removing his sandal off his left foot. Once it was off again, Naruto roughly dropped the academy student onto the sandal. The boy landed on his butt with a yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! What\u2019s the big idea, leader?!\u201d Konohamaru cried as he stood up and rubbed his behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to act as my insole during the walk home. Think of it as more training!\u201d Naruto said, knowing that Konohamaru would agree to anything if he thought it was training. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, this is more nose training, leader?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, but not just that! The weight of my entire body is going to be coming down on you, so you have to endure the pressure too. This is to ensure that if an enemy ninja tosses a huge boulder on you, you don\u2019t get turned into a leaf ninja pancake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, Naruto! I won\u2019t get turned into a pancake no matter what!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to hear it, now lie down on your back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru did as he was told and laid himself down on the sandal. He watched as Naruto slowly slipped his rank foot back into his blue footwear. Soon Naruto\u2019s giant foot was once again pressing down on him, but this time Konohamaru\u2019s head wasn\u2019t sticking out between his toes. The boy\u2019s entire body was being smothered by his boss\u2019s sole. Naruto sighed as he felt Konohamaru\u2019s shrunken body squirm under his foot. It felt much better now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour turn, dog breath!\u201d Naruto pinched the puny Kiba between his fingers and brought him up to his smirking face. Kiba struggled hopelessly between Naruto\u2019s tree-like digits, knowing the true nature behind the giant\u2019s smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Naruto! It\u2019ll be a miracle if I survive under your foot at this size! I\u2019ll get squished for sure!\u201d Kiba begged, now wanting to end up like Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToughen up, Kiba. Part of being a great ninja is luck! So\u2026good luck!\u201d Naruto laughed evilly as he slipped off his other sandal and tossed Kiba onto its rough surface. As soon as Kiba landed, he scrambled back to his feet and tried to escape the shadow formed by Naruto\u2019s quickly descending foot. The giant fox boy was too fast, however, and Kiba soon found himself laying on his stomach with Naruto\u2019s titanic foot pressed down on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Naruto, I make a terrible insole!\u201d the dog ninja pleaded, but Naruto couldn\u2019t hear his muffled shouts. He was thinking the same thing, though, as he could barely feel the pint-sized Kiba under his sole. Kiba wasn\u2019t making his right foot feel any better, but Naruto didn\u2019t seem to care. The idea that Kiba was fighting for his life under his smelly, sweaty foot was good enough for him. Satisfied, Naruto began his trek back to the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long way out of the forest and it didn\u2019t help that Naruto got a bit lost along the way. Each step he took threatened to squash one of his slaves, and they probably would have been crushed by now if he was putting his full weight on his feet. By the time Naruto arrived back in the village, both shrunken shinobi were covered in their giant master\u2019s sweat and were very weak from the smell and pressure being put on them. Kiba was in the biggest pickle, being so much smaller than Konohamaru. The smell would of knocked him out cold if it wasn\u2019t for the constant weight that was being forced on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost there, bugs.\u201d Naruto whispered to himself. \u201cTry not to become leaf ninja pancakes!\u201d</span></div></div>",

His leader's smelly foot was always pressing on him, and Konohamaru felt as if he was already beeing turned into a flat pancake. As if that wasn't enough, the nasty smell was making Konohamaru dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, lead-\" Konohamaru couldn't finish his sentance as Naruto's foot was making itself comfortable over him. From all of this, Konohamaru felt like a true insole for his boss. Naruto didn't seem to care what happened to him, and he just wanted to have an insole. Konohamaru moved with all of his strenght so that he could see his leader's face from between the dirty toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leader, hey, I want to ask you something.\" Konohamaru shouted, so that the giant blond could hear him. \"Ugh! You just never shut up! Just when I was enjoying the softness you and Kiba provided me with, you just had to ruin it for me!\" Naruto said, as he began to get extremely annoyed by the brat. Even when he was normal size, he was just as annoying to him. Naruto could never get some rest at piece, even though sometimes he wished to teach Konohamaru a few things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it getting too much leader ? I mean...you did say that I was going to act as ...um... your insole, but this is just ridiculous! You are LITERALLY using me as one. If you were the same size, I'd never do that to you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really ? Didn't you enjoy it when you made Kiba smell your foot ?\" Naruto said with a grin. \"Well...I did...a little, but I'd never use him like you use us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ofcourse you wouldn't. It's because you can't! He's still bigger than your foot, while you two are like ants to me.\" Naruto chuckled as he reached his house. He kicked off his sandals, and removed the two tiny ants from his insole. He opened the door to his room, sat on his bed and placed the shrunken ninja on the ground. He looked down at them grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leader! Sorry, but I demand that you return me to normal size!!! I've had it for today.\"<br>\r\n\"You're not going anywhere Konohamaru.\" Naruto said as he stamped his foot next to the tiny brat. Konohamaru clearly saw that he was just as tall as Naruto's pinky toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've also had it! I'm not going to be your foot toy forever!\" Kiba growled in his wrath. Both of them were mad at Naruto, but Naruto sees that he's going to enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The giant fox boy watched amusingly as the speck-sized Kiba ran across his floor toward one of his feet. Kiba focused chakra into his own feet and ran up the side of Naruto\u2019s foot. Once he was on top of the giant mass of flesh, Kiba began punching, kicking, and even scratching the top of Naruto\u2019s foot. Unfortunately, Kiba was just too small to cause any damage to Naruto. His attempts to harm his master hardly registered with the giant genin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen are you going to learn your place, Kiba? You\u2019re a bug to me. A bug!\u201d Naruto taunted as he used his other foot to wipe the pesky bug off his foot. After the young shinobi tumbled to the floor, Naruto brought his foot over him and began to smother the tiny pup once again. There was nothing Kiba could do to fight Naruto, he could only lay there and allow the wall of sweaty flesh to dominate him. After awhile of smothering Kiba under his warm foot, Naruto picked the foot off the floor and inspected the bottom of it. Kiba was glued his sole and was struggling to free himself. No matter how much effort he out into his struggles, he wouldn\u2019t budge. He was stuck to the giant\u2019s foot like a fly trapped on sandpaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so weak, Kiba. That\u2019s why you make a great foot toy! I don\u2019t want to smush you, so just accept your new life already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew you!\u201d Kiba shouted and spit at Naruto\u2019s face. The spit didn\u2019t even reach the titan and Naruto just smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, have it your way.\u201d Naruto said before his face became obstructed by another wall of flesh. It took a moment for Kiba to realize that it was Naruto\u2019s other foot! The cruel blond listened to Kiba scream for just a second before he brought his feet together and started grinding Kiba between them. He snickered in delight as he felt the tiny bug get rubbed down. His feet were really sweaty and he heard them make sick squelching noises as they rubbed against each other. Naruto\u2019s other slave, Konohamaru, watched all of his unfold. He was finally beginning to understand that this was no training\u2026Naruto had kidnapped the two of them and was using them like toys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeader, please stop!\u201d the little kid screamed up to the giant blond. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto ignored the brat\u2019s pleas and continued to rub his feet together. He rubbed Kiba down for a good few minutes before he finally separated his feet with a loud squelching sound. The dog ninja was stuck to his left foot, still conscious and twitching a bit. Naruto peeled the speck off his foot with a singe finger and let the genin drop to the floor. Without giving Kiba any time to rest, Naruto hovered his big toe over Kiba\u2019s frail body and began to press down on him. Kiba screamed in agony as he felt the enormous digit slowly crush him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!! Naruto, stop! You\u2019re going to kill him!\u201d Konohamaru cried out, tears streaming from his eyes. Naruto gave Konohamaru an evil look before chuckling and letting up a bit on the pressure. He was still pressing down on Kiba lightly and could crush the speck at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to stop just because you told me to, Konohamaru.\u201d Naruto said to the small boy. \u201cI can do anything I want with you bugs because I\u2019m bigger than you! Now, make yourself useful and lick my foot while I\u2019m teaching this mutt a lesson.\u201d The orange ninja placed his right foot (the one that wasn\u2019t torturing Kiba) in front of Konohamaru. The academy student looked at it for a few seconds before staring back up into Naruto\u2019s sinister, blue eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t do this, leader. I want to go home!\u201d Konohamaru yelled up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is your home now, brat. I\u2019ll take good care of you as long as you do as I say. If you don\u2019t, you might find yourself a stain under my foot like Sasuke\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sasuke? You\u2026you crushed Sasuke?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and replied, \u201cYup! Finally put that smug rival of mine in his place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto\u2026how could you do that?\u201d Konohamaru said in a combination of sadness and anger. He was sad that the shinobi he had always looked up to was treating him like this and angry because he hated this evil side of Naruto. </span></div></div>",

Kiba was all dirty and sweaty and smelling like Naruto's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you a rest for now Kiba.\" Naruto said as he turned his attention to Konohamaru. Konohamaru was licking non-stop and he wasn't enjoying it. After some more of this, Naruto finally said to Konohamaru to stop licking it. Konohamaru thumped on the floor all tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh...I'm bored...\" Naruto sighed as he ran out of ideas. \"Well Naruto, how about you grow us back?\" Kiba asked. \"Grow you?! Why? So you can try to shrink me? Do I look that stupid to you?\" Naruto asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh\" Is all that Kiba muttered, as if saying yes. After all, Naruto wasn't really smart. \"He has a point leader. I just want to be normal sized...PLEASE return us to normal!\" Konohamaru begged the giant blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, I don't want to return you to normal. You're more useful like that. And second, I don't have such a scroll...a growing scroll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot. It's in Tsunade's office. There are all kinds of scrolls there, including that. I think it was called \"The Size Increasement Scroll\" Kiba said trying to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! Wow...I didn't know there was such a thing. You know what...? I'm going to use it!\" Naruto said, as he quickly came up with a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! But you need to point the scroll at us, so you can grow us back to normal size.\" Kiba said as he lit up with happyness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said anything about growing you back? I plan to use it on my self. You know...get huge! I'm going to make the village pay for when they hated me!\" Naruto said as he started getting himself ready to go outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go Kiba...\" Konohamaru said as he glanced at Kiba. \"W-well...I thought that he was going to help us.\" Kiba stammered. \"Yeah right.\" Konohamaru responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't take you two with me, just in case you manage to get you size back. I'll just leave in here.\" Naruto said as he pulled a jar over them. \"Hey, you can't do this!\" Kiba screamed. \"Yeah? I can put you in another pair of sandals of mine, if you want...\" Naruto chuckled. \"Oh, shut up Kiba. You'll just make it worse again\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto dressed himself and got ready to go outside. He locked the door to his apartament and took the shrinking scroll with him, just in case something came in the way. He reached the Hokage building and entered it. When he entered the hallway before the door to the Hokage's office, he took his sandals off to prepare his feet for the rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto Uzumaki. Stop right there\" a mysterious voice said from behind him. It was 3 ANBU members. \"What do you want from me?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke Uchiha has went missing. He was last seen with you. Where is he?\" The ANBU leader asked. \"Huh? How should I know?! I'm not his wife!\" Naruto responded. \"So you say that you don't know? How can we trust you? Do you have any evidence that you can provide us with?\" One of the ANBU guys said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm telling you that I don't know anything!\" Naruto said. \"You'll come with us for interrogation.\" the third ANBU guy said as all three ANBU pulled out their swords. \"It would be good if you don't resist. Now turn around so you can face us...and do it slowly!\" The ANBU leader commanded. Naruto then reached for the shrinking scroll in his jumpsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP! What are you hiding there?\" The ANBU leader asked. \"Oh, it's nothing. It's just a scroll containing various jutsus. How about I give it to you, and in return you let me go? But I'll have to turn around so I can give it to you\" Naruto said as he snickered quetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. You may.\" The ANBU leader said. Naruto turned around slowly so he was now facing the three ANBU members, and pointed the scroll at them. \"What is it for?\" the 2nd ANBU guy asked. \"Well...it's for a SHRINKING JUTSU\" Naruto said with a huge grin on his face. The three ANBU started shrinking. To them Naruto was getting taller, but they realized that it was not him who was getting taller, but it was they who were shrinking. They stopped shrinking when they were the size of his ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?! Is this a genjutsu?\" one of the ANBU asked. \"Nope. It's as real as I am. And I've shrunken you to the size of ants.\" Naruto snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tricked us!\" The ANBU leader said. \"More than that, what is he doing with such a jutsu? It's a forbidden jutsu!\" the 3rd ANBU said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bla-bla. I'm afraid that I can't let you go either now. If I do, you're going to call for reinforcements and things are going to get tough for me! So let's just get this over with.\" Naruto said as he grinned, and stomped to the three tiny ANBU members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even like this, we're not going to go down without a fight. Scatter!\" The ANBU leader commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto watched as the trio of ANBU scattered in different directions. They\u2019re petty efforts amused the blond giant, who continued to stomp forward. The ANBU were supposed to be very intelligent and experienced ninja, but if they thought their tactics were going to work on someone his size, they were about to have the truth come crashing down on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the group had surrounded Naruto, the titan stopped and waited for their next move. Suddenly, tiny kunai and shurikens were flying through the air and cutting at Naruto\u2019s legs. Unfortunately, the ninja tools were just too small to even penetrate the fabric of Naruto\u2019s pants. When one of the ANBU noticed their assault wasn\u2019t working, he decided to target Naruto\u2019s soft spot: his bare foot. The man ran over to the fox boy\u2019s foot, took out his sword, and swung. A small, barely visible cut was made in Naruto\u2019s skin and the giant looked down angrily at his attacker. Before the experienced shinobi could react, the same foot he had slashed lifted over him and stomped down with unbelievable force. The two other ANBU watched in horror as their comrade was crushed instantly. Naruto smiled evilly as he continued to pulverize the insect\u2019s flattened corpse, relishing in the crunching sounds it made. The ANBU duo got over the cruel death of their partner quickly and took this opportunity to attack. They both made a few hand signs and released two streams of fire at Naruto\u2019s upper body. What would have been a devastating attack barely registered with Naruto, who only noticed the flames after he had finished crushing the first ANBU. The white hot flames couldn\u2019t even singe Naruto\u2019s jumpsuit, let alone harm him. Naruto responded to the attack by throwing a kick at the small men. One of them rolled to dodge while the other one took the full force of the blow and went flying several feet back. Before giving the ANBU the chance to stand up (which he couldn\u2019t do anyway, since most of his bones had been broken) Naruto ran over to him and stomped down, squishing him as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought the ANBU were supposed to be strong? You guys are even weaker than Konohamaru!\u201d Naruto mocked as he finished squishing his second victim into paste. He turned his eyes to the last one, who was kneeling and clutching his left leg. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t managed to dodge the blow completely. Naruto grinned and stomped over to the shrunken man, who looked up at the god-sized boy with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-why are you doing this?! You\u2019re a Konoha shinobi; why are you murdering your comrades?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the ones who pointed swords at me.\u201d Naruto replied as he raised his bare foot over the injured man, who could clearly see bits and pieces of his comrades stuck to the dirty sole. \u201cBesides, who would think of bugs as comrades?\u201d Naruto gave the scared ANBU one last grin before stomping down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Naruto entered the Hokage\u2019s office after dealing with the three pests and wiping their remains on the floor. As he closed the door, he muttered to himself, \u201cI better find that scroll fast before someone notices the mess in the hall. Once I\u2019m a giant, everyone in the village will be a bug to me!\u201d Naruto smiled at the thought and began his search. He tore apart Tsunade\u2019s desk, her bookshelves, and even looked behind the shelves and potted plants. It was a powerful forbidden jutsu, so it was only right that it was hidden well. Naruto wasn\u2019t going to give up, though. The scroll was somewhere in this room and he was going to find it!<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Naruto looked everywhere, even in Tsunade's desk but he found nothing. \"Darn! Kiba said that it was in this office...then why can't I find it!?\" Naruto pondered. Naruto was starting to loose all hope, when he noticed something really tiny beside the mess he made. Naruto walked over to the red piece, and noticed that it was a scroll. \"Wait! Could this be it?!\" Naruto hyped when he found the scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why is it so small?\" Naruto asked himself as he barely holded it with his fingers. He was afraid not to drop it, because he may not find it again. \"Oh, boy. If Kiba saw this, he'd probrably do anything to get it. But so do I!\"<br>\r\nJust as Naruto was starting to try and open the tiny scroll, he heard somebody going up the stairs. \"Crap! If it's Grannny Tsunade, I'm going to be in big trouble.\" Naruto started to panic. The door quickly opened and in walked none other than Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tsunade-sama! There's a-\" Shizune couldn't finish her sentence as she just saw Naruto. Tsunade was nowhere to be seen. \"N-Naruto-kun...ugh. Thank God\" Shizune said as she wiped the sweat from her head with her hand. \"Naruto-kun, there's something wrong with the ANBU...I was just coming from a mission, when I noticed flattened remains of tiny ANBU corpses along the hall. I don't know what's going on...\" Shizune said looking down. Naruto remained silent for a few seconds, until deciding to tell her. \"I can tell you what's going on.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Then please do.\" Shizune asked Naruto. Naruto reached for the shrinking scroll in his jumpsuit and pulled it out of it. \"I shrank them, and then I killed them...\" Naruto said. \"Wh-wh-what?! B-but...you'd never do something like that.\" Shizune said amazed by the shocking news. \"Yeah, I wouldn't but they wanted to take me for interrogation about Sasuke. They were even going to cause me harm. That's why I decided that it would be I who would make the first move if things were like that. They were hostile towards me!\" Naruto said. \"Naruto...they are supposed to be hostile. That's their job.\" Shizune said annoyed by Naruto's stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that. Give me the scroll.\" Shizune demanded as she held her hand expecting for the scroll to be given to her. \"I don't want to turn you into paste Shizune. I've known you for a long time, so don't make me shrink you.\" Naruto said as he backed away. \"Then I have no other choice...\" Shizune took a few steps back and locked the door, locking them inside. \"I also got this other scroll. It's supposed to make me huge. And I want it!\" Naruto said as he pulled out the tiny scroll. \"Naruto-kun! That's a S-class forbidden jutsu. Don't use it!\" Shizune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...I would've already used it, if I knew the handsigns. Say...how about you tell me? If you do, I'll try not to stomp on children when I get giant. If you don't though, the village will start smelling like my feet and I'll squash everybody who tries to resist me!\" Naruto threatened. \"What's the matter with you!? You've always said that you cherished the village. You were the last person from whom to expect such a thing!\" Shizune said. \"It's true that I cherish the village, but I want payback for the times when I was isolated...when everybody called me a monster. Before I had any friends...that's why I want to pay them back tenfold!\" Naruto explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you won't tell me, then I'll just use the same handsign that I use for the shrinking. Let's see if it works.\" Naruto said. \"N-No! Don't do it!\" Shizune screamed. Naruto ignored her and quickly made the handsign and then put his hand on the scroll. \"Enlargement Jutsu...or what ever...\" Naruto stammered. Just as he said this, he started growing, and growing until he broke the roof of the Hokage Mansion. Shizune almost fainted when she saw the blond get so huge. Naruto stepped out of the Mansion and looked at his surroundings. He was as tall as the Hokage Mountain. He couldn't belive it. The feeling was intoxicating. \"Ohhhh boy...Tsunade-sama's not going to like this!\" Shizune said as she looked at the huge Naruto before her. \"Peee-uh! And what's that smell?\" Shizune pinched her nose. \"That's the smell of my feet. They're pretty sweaty and things are just going to get better.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizune! What's going on?!\" Tsunade said as she saw the enourmous Naruto. \"Tsunade-sama! Where the heck where you?!\" Shizune asked. \"Ughhh...welll...you see...\" Tsunade stammered embarassed. \"Aha! You were out gambling again! When this is over, I'm going to tell Jiraya-sama about this!\" Shizune finished. \"H-hey now...\" Tsunade stammered again. \"Hey Granny! How's the view from down there?\" Naruto said as he mocked Tsunade. \"You little twerp...what did you say?!\" Tsunade said as he started to crack her knuckles. 'Ha! Little! Do you even realize the irony?\" Naruto said as he stomped creating a big boom. \"Heh...even at this size, I can still smack you down. After all, I'm one of the Legendary Sannin...don't forget that.\" Tsunade said. \"Tsunade-sama! Be careful!\" Shizune warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait. The ground is so rough. Let me just enlarge my sandals.\" Naruto said as he made the handsign again and his sandals became the size of two houses. He then put them on, but that didn't mean that he couldn't take them off when he wanted. \"Alright Granny! What do you prefer? Beeing my insole or letting me use you to wash my feet?\" Naruto said as he stomped to her. \"Ohhh! You're gonna get it now!\" Tsunade said as he charged towards Naruto, who was pondering whether to wash his feet with her or use her as an insole.</span></div></div>",

She learned this the hard way when Naruto\u2019s sandaled foot suddenly whipped at her. She only had time to throw her arms up in defense before Naruto\u2019s giant toes hit her and sent her flying into a nearby building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! Barely used any strength in that kick!\u201d Naruto bellowed, putting his hands on his hips and grinning victoriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsunade-sama!\u201d Shizune cried as he ran over to the several pounds of debris that has burrowed her master. Suddenly, the debris exploded outward as Tsunade punched her way out. The blow from the giant Genin had injured her, but not critically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky shot, brat, but it\u2019ll take a lot more than that to defeat the Hokage!\u201d Tsunade screamed at the titan before she took off again. Before she could take her fourth step, another figure appeared in front of her and stopped her in her tracks. It was Kakashi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, please let me handle this. As the Hokage, you should get someplace safe.\u201d the silver haired Jonin said as he turned to his superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, Kakashi\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Naruto is my student, allow me to take care of him.\u201d Kakashi interrupted and turned to Shizune. \u201cShizune, please take the Hokage somewhere safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026right.\u201d Shizune replied. \u201cThis way, Tsunade-sama.\u201d The female Jonin led Tsunade away from the giant, much to Tsunade\u2019s distaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Hokage was safe, Kakashi turned to Naruto to see that the giant boy had already stomped over to him and was gleaming down at him with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, Kakashi-sensei! Do you plan on taking me on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto! That jutsu is forbidden for a reason! Stop this recklessness at once before it\u2019s too late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s already too late, Kakashi-sensei. Just a few minutes ago I used the shrinking jutsu to turn three ANBU into little red stains! And just this morning I crushed Sasuke!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou what?! Naruto, how could you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was easy! It was just like crushing a bug. Now that I\u2019m a giant, I can crush anyone that opposes me! You\u2019re better off just being my slave, Kakashi-sensei!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I will stop you, Naruto! It\u2019s my duty as your sensei!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, but don\u2019t hate me if you end up squashed because of your \u2018duty\u201d.\u201d Naruto bellowed before lifting his foot and slamming it down on Kakashi. He didn\u2019t feel any resistance under his sandal, however, and raised it to see that the older ninja was gone. The masked ninja appeared next to Naruto\u2019s face, his hand covered in lightning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRaikiri!\u201d Kakashi yelled as he plunged his hand into Naruto\u2019s cheek. The giant howled in pain as a gash was made in his cheek. His hand flew up to smash Kakashi, but the superior shinobi jumped off his pupil\u2019s face and dodged the hand. He wasn\u2019t done yet, though. As he fell, the copy ninja made a few hand signs and blew a giant fireball at Naruto\u2019s left foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAAAHH!!! Hot, hot, hot!!\u201d Naruto yelled as he hopped on one foot, causing mass destruction to the area around him. Kakashi landed safely on the roof of a building and watched as the giant blew on his singed foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou may have grown a bit, but you\u2019re still not good enough to beat me in a fight, Naruto!\u201d Kakashi shouted, angering Naruto some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get cocky, bug.\u201d Naruto said as he finished nursing his foot and grinned at the smaller man. He pointed at his cheek and Kakashi watched the wound he made quickly close up. Naruto\u2019s growth seemed to also increase the Kyuubi\u2019s healing power. \u201cYou might think you can fight equally with a giant, but\u2026\u201d </span></div></div>",

As if one wasn't a problem, three would be a crisis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Kakashi-sensei, what do you think of this?\" Naruto asked as he and his clones took a step to Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you forget Naruto. I can also use Shadow clones. Shadow Clone Jutsu!\" Kakashi did a handsign and created at least 100 shadow replications of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! So many bugs!\" Naruto scoffed. \"You know what they say, don't you Naruto? Three times zero is still zero.

That's what I don't like about you, Kakashi-sensei! You're always too arrogant. You think that you're the best, just like Sasuke!

Don't forget that I'm a Jonin and that you're a mere Genin. If anyone's going to get abused, it would be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I was normal size, but now, my toes are bigger than you. Besides, those ninja that I shrank were ANBU, and yet they died underfoot...literally.\" Naruto chuckled. \"Enough talk! Go!\" Kakashi commanded as all the shadow clones started to attack. \"That's boring, Kakashi-sensei.\" Naruto said as he stomped his foot over 40 clones crushing them flat in one step. Before he realized though, 30 other of Kakashi's clones threw 30 fireballs over one of Naruto's clone, and it dispelled. Naruto's other clone, lifted it's foot over them and crushed all of them as well. Only 30 more of Kakashi's clones were left. All of them, took out their kunais and enveloped explosive tags to them. Then, they threw all the kunais at the other clone of Naruto. They all exploded and Naruto's last clone dispelled. \"You tiny shits\" Naruto said as he hovered his huge sandled foot over them and stomped so hard, that the earth trembled as if and earthquake happened. \"Well, I'm surprised that you managed to dispell all of my Shadow Clones, Kakashi-sensei.\" Naruto exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Ugh, I'm all out of chakra....and I'm no match for him. I need to find a way to return him to normal size and stop his rampage. If I can just manage to-) Kakashi's thoughs were cut off, as Naruto grabbed him in his sweaty hand. The giant blond stared evilly at his sensei. \"You're out of chakra, Kakashi-sensei. You can't perform Raikiri nor do any more annyoing tricks.\" Naruto said as he started to grip Kakashi even tighter in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...clock's ticking, Naruto. Sasuke will be here any moment.\" Kakashi said. \"SASUKE?!\" Naruto shouted almost popping everybody's ears in the whole village. \"What do you mean by SASUKE?! I shrank him and I crushed him!\" Naruto said, still unaware to what Kakashi was trying to say. \"I don't know what you're talking about. I and Sasuke were on a mission today. We returned an hour ago. That's why I was surprised when you told me that you crushed him this morning. But that can't be, as all of the morning we were on a mission.\" Kakashi explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...how? I was certain that was Sasuke. Hmm...so maybe that shrunken Sasuke that I wished for, was a replica created by my wish? And not the REAL Sasuke, but just an exact copy....with all of his thoughs, reactions and everything. It looks like it wasn't just a normal clone then.\" Naruto pondered outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm quite certain that he has already noticed his overgrown rival by now. If he hasn't shown up yet, then that means that he's just getting ready.\" Kakashi said. \"Hahahaahahahahahahaha!\" Naruto burst outlaughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to imply? That I should be scared? If you couldn't beat me, then he can't either. This is just a chance to have the pleasure of torturing him again.\" Naruto said excited. \"Ngh! Let me go!\" Kakashi demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to be punished for trying to attack me Kakashi-sensei, and my foot odour is anything but pleasent. You know that I bath rarely, and even you won't be able to take the smell from them. Now that you're this size, you don't even stand a chance and the smell is going to be worse!

Do you regret challenging me yet?\u201d Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026Naruto\u2026stop.\u201d Kakashi mumbled as the smell of Naruto\u2019s foot was making him dizzy. It alone was enough to bring even the strongest of ninja to their knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I stop when I\u2019m having so much fun?\u201d Naruto asked again as he grinned and squeezed the poor Jonin\u2019s head between his toes. \u201cJust be quiet and watch your god rampage! You have a great view !\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled evilly as he walked deeper into the Leaf Village. Everyone around him had fled during his battle, but the village was simply too big for everyone to flee in such a short time. It only took the giant Naruto a few steps before he arrived at an area where hundreds of people where in the middle of evacuation. When they saw the giant menace approach, they all screamed and fled from his massive form. Naruto merely smirked at the tiny insects, but didn\u2019t acknowledge them any more than that. He wasn\u2019t interested in the townsfolk just yet, he could play with them later. Right now he just wanted to experiment with his new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto spotted a restaurant that had once kicked him out because they were scared of him. With much pleasure, Naruto kicked the building with his sandaled foot and watched it crumble into cloud of smoke. He did the same thing to a few other places he disliked, not caring of any innocent people got in the way of his foot. Most of the time they did\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto found an apartment where several people he held grudges against lived. Unfortunately, the cowards had already fled, but that didn\u2019t stop Naruto from stomping on the apartment and turning it too into rubble. After that, Naruto just stomped and kicked blindly while watching things go boom before his eyes. Every stomp of his left foot pushed his entire weight onto Kakashi, who didn\u2019t know how much of this he could take. He may have been a hardened ninja, but no one had ever taught him how to survive against a giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of destruction, Naruto whipped the sweat from his forehead and looked around at his work. He had turned several blocks of Konoha into smoking ruins\u2026without even using any jutsu! No ANBU had tried to stop him; they were probably fleeing in terror too or protecting their precious Hokage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about time I found the real Sasuke and showed him my new power. I bet he\u2019s watching me right now and peeing his pants in fear!\u201d Naruto grinned toothily and cracked his knuckled. He couldn\u2019t wait to find that Uchiha punk and enslave him\u2026again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait\u2026enslave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crud! I forgot about my two other slaves!\u201d Naruto looked by his feet to make sure he hadn\u2019t stepped on his apartment. \u201cMaybe I should go pick them up before I accidentally crush my apartment. They\u2019re probably so pathetically small now that I\u2019m bigger!\u201d Naruto looked at his large hands and estimated that Konohamaru would be about the size of a gnat to him and Kiba a mere germ. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Naruto do? Search for his rival or head back home?</span></div></div>",

He stomped what was under him, and reached his house crushing everything on the way under his feet. He didn't want to ruin his house and just broke the window with one of his fingers. Although trying to just brake the window, he broke the entire wall as he was too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing for braking part of his own house he reached for the jar where he placed them. The jar was so little, that he didn't even see what was inside. On the inside, Kiba and Konohamaru just saw orange skin. They didn't even have an idea what was happening. \"I better enlarge those two. I can't even see them this way.\" Naruto muttered and took out the growing scroll. He cast a few handsigns and pointed at his hand. Kiba and Konohamaru quickly grew to their normal sizes. \"Yeah! We're back to normal size!\" Konohamaru cheered together with Kiba, only to turn their attention to the giant grinning face of Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Cat got your tongue? You wanted your normal sizes, right? I granted your wish.\" Naruto chuckled. \"So you did use that scroll I told you about? Look at you. You're a 50 foot giant blond teenager! You really let yourself go Naruto.\" Kiba pointed out and sighed. \"I did that on purpose you moron. Just be grateful that I returned you to normal size.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only did that so you could tease us, because you couldn't see us considering your new size. Don't play the hero.\" Kiba noted. \"Well...I suppose that I'll be setting for Sasuke.\" Naruto said. \"Sasuke? I thought that you stomped him.\" Konohamaru pondered. \"I thought the same. Turns out that he was just some kind of clone. A kind of a special one. All the better though. I lost my temper back then, and I smushed him. I'll try to make him suffer longer this time before smushing him again.\" Naruto grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go easy on you this time, while I play with Sasuke. I'll put you two in my pocket, because you certainly don't want to be in my sandal, right?\" Naruto asked chuckling. \"Not if i ca-\" Kiba began to say something but he was interupted by Konohamaru. \"Uh, yeah, leader. Sure.\" Konohamaru said. \"I won't let you blunder again, Kiba!\" Konohamaru quietly said to Kiba. \"Now that's what I wanted to hear.\" Naruto said as he dropped them in his pocket. \"I'll take you out when I decide to torture you\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked around his surroundings and pondered to where Sasuke could be. \"Say, Kakashi-sensei. Where is Sasuke? You were last with him, so you should know.\" Naruto asked as he looked at his toes. Kakashi was in a really bad state. The nasty smell weakened him a lot. \"Near...the...river\" Kakashi mumbled unable to speak from the smell. \"Near the river, huh? I suppose that you're talking about the river near the Forest of Death. All right, let's see.\" Naruto said and began to stomp his way to the river. It didn't take him long enough to reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyyyyy, Sasukeeee. Show up you ant!\" Naruto screamed with the whole village hearing him. Naruto scanned all over for him, but didn't find anything. \"Over here you loser.\" Sasuke calmly said from behind Naruto. Naruto turned around and saw his rival next to a tree. \"Ah! There you are.\" Naruto said as he stomped to him. \"What's up with that size you moron? Did you eat too much, heh\" Sasuke joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you're still as over-confident as ever. You're the real one, all right.\" Naruto agreed. \"Real one?\" Sasuke asked. \"Yeah. I wanted you 3 inches tall, so that I can give you some proper payback. It turned out that it wasn't the real one though. I have to say that I had a lot of fun with your clone, but unfortunetly he turned out as a red stain under my foot.\" Naruto chuckled. \"Hn. Then that clone was weak.\" Sasuke said in a cool manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still calm, huh? I don't think that you'll be as calm when I'm finished with you. You'll smell my feet now, and then you'll take a bath with me in this river. I don't have a soap, but you'll do fine...again. I'll wash my WHOLE body with you this time, and I'm going to enjoy it.\" Naruto chuckled. Naruto took out Kakashi from his sandal, who had fainted from the smell and took out Kiba and Konohamaru. Naruto then placed them on the ground and threw his huge jumpsuit on them, so they couldn't move. The cloth didn't crush them, but they could not move. Naruto then started to remove the rest of his clothes, preparing for the bath he was going to have with Sasuke.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Naruto pulled his black shirt over his head and tossed it away, the blond placed his hands on his hips and looked down to give Sasuke the evilest smirk he could muster. The Uchiha was still leaning against the tree and didn\u2019t seem to be affected by Naruto\u2019s new size. Any normal person would tremble under the shadow of the shirtless teen, but not Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto frowned, but he wasn\u2019t going to give up just yet. Without warning, the giant took a seat and crushed several trees under his orange-clad ass. The resulting tremor carried enough force to knock Sasuke off his feet. Not wanting to show any weakness to Naruto, the Sharingan user quickly stood back up. He saw that Naruto was in the process of undoing his sandals, so he probably didn\u2019t see him fall. Once the giant kicked his sandals off, he stretched out his legs and wiggled his newly-freed toes. The breeze blowing against his bare torso and feet felt nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Sasuke, it\u2019s time to smell my feet! I bet once you get a whiff of these, you\u2019re attitude will change.\u201d Naruto said, smirking down at the glaring Uchiha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForget it, dope. I have better things to do then play Giant with you. Later, loser.\u201d Sasuke turned his back to his oversized teammate and started walking away. Before he could increase the distance between them by five feet, a heavy weight came crashing down on Sasuke\u2019s back and forced him into the ground. Without even standing up, Naruto had stomped Sasuke with one of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast, bastard! I don\u2019t think you fully understand the position you\u2019re in, so let me explain again. You\u2019re going to smell my feet until you\u2019re on the verge of passing out, and then I\u2019m going to use you to wash my ENTIRE body! Forget any dignity you had, Sasuke, you\u2019re about to suffer ultimate humiliation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArg! Get your stupid foot off me, dope! It stinks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point. Look who\u2019s the dope now.\u201d Naruto replied before he began tapping Sasuke\u2019s small head with his big toe. Every time the big digit hit the back of Sasuke\u2019s head, it forced his face into the muddy ground. \u201cLike the taste of dirt, Sasuke? It fits a bug like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued to knock the wind out of Sasuke for awhile before rolling him over so he was facing him. He chuckled when he saw Sasuke\u2019s face looked pretty beat up after just that. Sasuke writhed under Naruto\u2019s foot, but the giant Genin wouldn\u2019t budge. Sasuke tried to free his hands so he could perform a jutsu, but they were pinned to his sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Naruto, get this thing off me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr what? What\u2019s a tiny bug like you going to do against someone as big as me?\u201d Naruto mocked Sasuke with laughter before moving his foot so Sasuke\u2019s vision was obstructed by the wall of flesh. Naruto began smothering his rival with his sweaty foot, giving the overconfident prodigy a good rubdown. \u201cOh man, you feel so good rubbing against my sole! I can\u2019t wait until I\u2019m rubbing you over everything else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, underneath Naruto\u2019s jumpsuit, Kiba was making good use of the limited mobility he had to try and claw his way to freedom. The jacket may have been several times bigger than it should have been, but it was still just fabric. Kiba was a member of the Inuzuka Clan; there was no way his sharp claws couldn\u2019t penetrate a simple jacket\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, this stuff is tougher than I thought.\u201d Kiba muttered as he found himself making lesser progress than he had hoped. At normal size, it would only have taken a couple swipes to tear through this. Still, he was confident he could break through eventually. \u201cHey, mind helping me?\u201d Kiba glanced over at Konohamaru, who was just laying down and waiting for their giant master to remove the piece of clothing himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure, I\u2019ll just bite our way through.\u201d the young academy student said sarcastically. Unlike Kiba, he couldn\u2019t make his nails razor sharp. How was he supposed to help? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLaying down and doing nothing isn\u2019t going to help either. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m taking this chance to escape! While Naruto is preoccupied with Sasuke, I\u2019ll make a rip in this jacket and slip out unnoticed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s pretend you do manage to escape and Leader doesn\u2019t catch you; what next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026I haven\u2019t though that far yet. Right now I only care about getting out of here. It reeks of Naruto\u2019s B.O.!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru agreed, but believed it was much more tolerable than the giant himself. He watched Kiba slowly tear his way thought the fabric of Naruto\u2019s jacket. Was it a good idea to follow him if he managed to make a rip? The idea of freedom was nice, but if Naruto caught them...well, let\u2019s just say he wouldn\u2019t be happy that Kiba tore a hole in his favorite jumpsuit\u2026 </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, Sasuke. How's the smell down there?\" Naruto asked chuckling as he felt Sasuke move under his bare foot. Sasuke's face was touching Naruto's bare sole and it almost made him puke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Ugh...should I use the Curse Mark? It's going to take me a lot of chakra...but...no. I'm not going to use it, just because I'm under Naruto's sweaty foot...grrrrrrr. NO WAY) Sasuke thought, getting furious about what was happening to him.\"Get it off me, damn it!\" Sasuke screamed from under the foot. \"Heh, fine\" Naruto said as he removed his foot from Sasuke. Sasuke just layed there, as if flattened by something, but still breathing. Naruto reached for him, and grabbed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pee-uhh! You stink Sasuke...like feet...hehe\" Naruto grinned. \"I think that you need...a bath. And since I do, we'll go together.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, he stood up and took a step to the river. He dipped Sasuke into the river, and pulled him out all wet, and choking from the sudden water pouring into his mouth. After that, Naruto started rubbing him against his armpits. Sasuke wasn't liking that. Even though it didn't stink as bad as his feet, it didn't smell any better either. \"Mmm...liking it? I sure am.\" Naruto said as he enjoyed the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack under Naruto's jumpsuit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost there!\" Kiba said tearing through the jumpsuit. (That moron...he's going to get smashed if Naruto sees what he did to his clothes! And he's going to take me with him along...sigh...) Konohamaru sighed as he was thinking. \"You thinking to write a book or something?\" Kiba said sarcastically. \"I'd be better if you try scratching your way out as well...\" Kiba said. \"No thanks\" Konohamaru responded. \"Fine. You're on your own.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while, Kiba finally managed to break through the jumpsuit, making a hole in it. \"Finally!\" Kiba said as he jumped and got out. \"Ahhh! Fresh air!... So? Are you coming or not?\" Kiba asked looking down at Konohamaru. \"Ofcourse I am\" Konohamaru responded as he jumped out too. After that, they turned their attention to the Giant Naruto who was rubbing something against his pits. They didn't care though, as he was facing the opposite direction and they could manage to escape. \"Do you think it's Sasuke that's getting rubbed in his armpits there? Shouldn't we help?\" Konohamaru asked. \"Are you crazy??? Go near him, and you'll be stinking like his feet in no time. Besides, we shouldn't stay here. He could step on us, even if he doesn't see us.\" Kiba said and began running away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't leave me alone!\" Konohamaru screamed. Kiba turned back facing him.\"Well Sasuke...let's get down to the next step.\" Naruto said as he pulled Sasuke out of his armpits. He was all sweaty and dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Look out!!!!\" Kiba screamed at Konohamaru. \"Huh?\" Konohamaru said. The Giant Naruto took a step back and his foot was about to fall right onto Konohamaru. Konohamaru just stared at the bare flesh of Naruto's foot, shivering. \"L-Leader!!! Down here! Don't step on me!\" Konohamaru screamed with all the power he had. It was of no use however, as Naruto was too tall and he couldn't hear him. Konohamaru's eyes bulged as he saw Naruto's gigantic foot lowering onto him. If he didn't do anything soon, he was going to be crushed.</span></div></div>",

His brain kept screaming, \u201cMove, Konohamaru, MOVE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*crunch*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Naruto glanced down at his foot when he felt something crush underneath it. Thinking he had stepped in Kakashi, the giant blond picked up his foot and inspected it. Instead of a flattened corpse, he saw the squashed remains of a log. \u201cOh, just a log.\u201d Naruto chuckled and flicked the wood off his sole before turning his attention back to Sasuke. \u201cWhere was I? Oh right, the next step!\u201d Naruto grinned toothily before dipping Sasuke into the cold river again. This time, he slapped the Genin against his hard chest and began scrubbing. Sasuke groaned with discomfort as his body was used to clean Naruto\u2019s pectorals. Despite this humiliation, he refused to use the Curse Mark. Doing so would force him to admit that Naruto had surpassed his natural power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral feet away, Kiba ran over to a nearby tree where a shaken Konohamaru laid. He knelt by the young boy and shook his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright, Konohamaru? That was close one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I know. He almost stepped on me without even knowing it. Leader\u2026Leader almost killed me!\u201d Konohamaru looked like he was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the more reason to get the hell out of here. If we stick around and Naruto finds out we put a hole in his clothes, he\u2019ll squash us both!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, it was just you who made the hole\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot the point! You\u2019re still trying to escape with me! Now hurry up, you can stand right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d The academy student picked himself off the ground. \u201cBut, Kiba, what is escaping going to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? We\u2019ll be away from Naruto, isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d Kiba asked, but Konohamaru shook his head in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we run back to the village, Naruto will just head back there too and cause more mayhem. We might end up dying in the destruction, without Naruto even knowing. I\u2019ve been thinking, and I think the key to setting things right again is right under our noses!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you. You were almost crushed by your beloved Leader and you still want to risk your life? Why do we have to be the heroes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf not us, then who? Just hear me out, okay?\u201d the young boy appeared to have made up his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026fine, spit it out\u2026\u201d Kiba replied, cursing himself for not running away while he had the chance. The boy had a point, though. They would never be truly safe from the giant blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf we can get our hands on either one of the scrolls, we can turn the tables on Naruto! I remember seeing Naruto put them in the pocket of his pants. We can use the scrolls against Leader!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. If we had the growing scroll, we could enlarge ourselves to Naruto\u2019s size. If we had the shrinking scroll, we could shrink that bastard back down to size. There\u2019s one problem with your plan, however. Naruto is still WEARING the pants! How are we supposed to get to the scrolls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple; we\u2019ll climb up the pants!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-WHAT?!  No! No, no, no! Your plan was good until that part. If we get anywhere near Naruto, we risk getting crushed under his gigantic feet! We should just wait until he takes off the pants and search through them then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of waiting! I\u2019m sick of this entire situation! The keys to saving everyone is right in front of us!\u201d Konohamaru yelled at the older shinobi, anger and irritation in his voice. \u201cYou can wait here if you want; I\u2019ll be the one to safe everyone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Konohamaru took off toward the half-naked giant. Kiba yelled to stop him, but he wasn\u2019t listening to reason. He didn\u2019t know if Konohamaru knew it, but he was acting just like Naruto did; always rushing head-first into danger. Always wanting to be the hero\u2026</span></div></div>",

And if he doesn't, I might get stepped on...just like you were going to be, just a few minutes ago.\" Kiba replied. \"Tsk...coward!\" Konohamaru said, and began running towards the giant Naruto. \"Why that little...! If I get my hands on that shrinking scroll, I'll be sure to pay some payback to that brat!\" Kiba groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Konohamaru runned, he was careful not to be spotted by Naruto. But that wasn't the only thing he was careful about. This time, he was also careful not to get stepped on, or otherwise he'd be turned into paste. After a while, he just made it next to Naruto's bare foot. \"Ok. All I have to do now, is focus chakra on my feet, and start climbing until I reach the pocket!\" Konohamaru said. And with that, he started running up. His running was shortly interrupted, as Naruto shifted and Konohamaru lost his balance. \"Ahhh!\" Konohamaru screamed. He quickly took out one of his kunai and stabbed it in Naruto's skin, so he didn't fell. \"OW!\" Naruto said as he felt something stab him near the knee. He turned around and grabbed Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konohamaru?! What the hell are you doing here?\" Naruto's voice boomed, as he held Konohamaru in his right hand, and Sasuke in his left one. \"Ummmm...I....ummm\" Konohamaru stammered. \"Hmmm?\" Naruto said as he saw Kiba in the other direction. Naruto turned around and started stomping in Kiba's direction. \"OHhhhhhhh maaaaaaannnnn! That brat blew it...and I'm going to get it now!\" Kiba sighed in his great misfortune. He picked his head up as he stared at the towering over him Naruto who was holding Konohamaru and Sasuke in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you two got out, huh?\" Naruto asked as he turned his attention to his jumpsuit. His eyes bulged as he saw a huge hole in his favorite jumpsuit. \"Ahhhh! What have you done???!!!!\" Naruto boomed. \"Ehehe...\" Konohamaru nervously laughed. (I sure wouldn't want to be in Kiba's place right now...but it's my fault that he's going to get it) Konohamaru thought. \"You little shits! This was the only thing I had! And now...look at it! Grrr...WHO DID THIS???\" Naruto angrily glared and started squeezing Konohamaru tightly in his hand, almost crushing him. \"Ahhh, leader! Stop it! You're crushing me!\" Konohamaru begged. \"And I'm going to do that if you don't tell me who did this!\" Naruto threatened. (Oh boy...) Sasuke thought. \"I-I-It wasn't me! I-It was Kiba!\" Konohamaru spoke. \"Kiba?\" Naruto asked as he loosened Konohamaru. \"I'm doomed...\" Kiba said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...it was YOU, dog-breath!\" Naruto said as he stomped his foot, creating an earthquake, which caused Kiba to lose his balance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The earthquake made Kiba fall right on his butt. As he hissed in pain, he noticed both of Naruto\u2019s bare feet plant themselves firmly on either side of him. He looked up in fear as he realized that the hurt had just begun. Naruto scowled down at the ant-sized Genin before raising one of his dirty soles over him. Kiba screamed an rolled to the side just as Naruto\u2019s foot came crashing down. The quake caused by the stomp could be felt all the way to the Leaf Village. Seconds after his foot hit the ground, Naruto lifted it back up and stomped down with his other foot. Konohamaru winced every time he heard Naruto stomp on Kiba, his mind filling with images of Kiba\u2019s squashed form. This was all his fault\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued to trample the same place again and again, as if performing some kind of dance of death. Kiba was surely dead by now, but Naruto kept inflicting overkill on the poor teen. Soon Naruto started to tire as shown by his heavily sweating body. When he finally ceased stomping, a veil of dust concealed the ground below him. The same thought went through Naruto, Konohamaru, and Sasuke\u2019s minds: Kiba was gone. No one could survive that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you deserve, dog breath!\u201d Naruto spat as he turned his back to the dust cloud and walked back to the river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you sure showed him, Leader.\u201d Konohamaru said, nervously. He smiled up at his giant boss, but found nothing but a cold stare looking back at him. The look made the young boy shiver in Naruto\u2019s sweaty fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get all buddy with me, ya brat! You stabbed me in the fucking knee! Don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting away with that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto walked away from what he thought was Kiba\u2019s grave, little did he know that the dog ninja was still very much alive. Naruto had been so fueled by rage that his aim was completely off and Kiba had managed to dodge any stomps that came near him. Unfortunately, he had not come out of the ordeal completely unscathed. He had been thrown around by the sheer force of the impacts and was heavily bruised because of them. As he crawled out of the crater the titan had formed, he clutched his sprained arm in pain. He definitely wasn\u2019t going to survive another encounter, so he had to get out of here. He weakly limped away from the pissed off blond. He was Konohamaru\u2019s problem now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, before I punish you, tell me why you were climbing my pants!\u201d Naruto shouted at his former pupil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is bad. If Naruto finds out I was trying to get the scrolls, I\u2019ll never get another chance to take them!</i> the academy student thought. \u201cIt\u2019s true that I was planning on escaping with Kiba, but when I looked back at you and saw you using Sasuke as soap to clean your body, I realized how much of a powerful and godly shinobi you really were! I just wanted to be closer to your body, Leader!\u201d Konohamaru lied, kissing his master\u2019s hand to further prove his lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that\u2019s how you feel, why did you stab me in the knee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Leader! I was going to fall and I just reacted without thinking. It\u2019ll never happen again!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Hehee\" Naruto chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, you loser! I've had enough out of your body. I will NOT service you anymore!\" Sasuke said. \"Ohh? What's the matter Sasuke? Are you starting to lose your calm? Heh\" Naruto smiled in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! I swear...if you try to do anything with me from this point on, I'm going to use all of my chakra to spit out fireballs to burn your damn face! If that doesn't work...well...let's just say that you'll know what it means to be hit by a thunder!\" Sasuke said glaring at Naruto. \"Oh really? Don't make me smash you too...just like your clone and just like Kiba died. That's the most humiliating way to die! Like a bug, and crushed under my foot!\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyways...let's start with you bastard!\" Naruto said as he lowered Sasuke to the river and dipped him, making him wet. He removed his pants, until he was only with his boxers. He pulled out Sasuke, and pulled down the part of his boxers that covered his butt. \"It doesn't stink as bad as my feet, but it's not smelling like a flower either.\" After finishing to say this, Naruto pushed Sasuke in his bare butt, between the cheeks and started rubbing up and down. Sasuke was getting covered with sweat and the smell almost made him puke. After a while of this, Naruto pushed him even further next to his ass hole, and started scrubing there with the tiny Sasuke. \"Ahh! That's the stuff!\" Naruto said as he finally pulled out Sasuke. He looked beat up and dirtier than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Sasuke? Haha! Don't tell me that this is all that you can handle!\" Naruto said to the tired and sweaty Sasuke. Naruto then turned his attention to Konohamaru in his other hand. \"P-please leader! Don't do this!\" Konohamaru begged. \"Why? You said that you wanted to be closer to my body, didn't you? Why not then?\" Naruto asked. \"Uh, yeah. But I don't consider your butt an important part of your body.\" Konohamaru explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. The next step is my feet. And I promise you both that this will be the worse from all. I'll save your energy Konohamaru, for my feet. You know how bad they smell, don't you?\" Naruto grinned. \"I...ummmm\" Konohamaru remained speechless. \"I know that Konohamaru knows how they smell, but you don't, Sasuke! Or at least you didn't see that first hand. Don't worry. I haven't forgotten about my groin. And we'll have pretty much fun with that, Sasuke. But right now, I want to clean my feet using you two.\" Naruto chuckled as he lowered Sasuke to his foot and deeply pushed Sasuke's head in his sole. Immediately, Sasuke started moving from the awful smell, with muffled screams.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHow\u2019s the smell, Sasuke? Too much for you?\u201d Naruto mocked as he pressed his rival\u2019s head harder into his sole. \u201cStop screaming already, you sound like a baby.\u201d But Sasuke\u2019s couldn\u2019t stop, no matter how much he tried. The stink quickly overcame his pride; it was like nothing he had smelled before. He always knew the fox boy stunk just by going on missions with him, but his new size had increased the smell tremendously. After Naruto decided that Sasuke had learned how bad his feet were, he took the boy away from his foot and plopped himself down, making another earthquake. He grinned at both his captive slaves before dipping them into the river and bringing them near his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you both know how bad they reek, it\u2019s time for you to do something about it! Hehe\u2026you\u2019re both gonna STINK after this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Naruto pressed Konohamaru against his left foot and Sasuke against his right. He began rubbing the two screaming boys up and down his rough sole. As he scrubbed his feet, Naruto leaned back and listened to muffled screams of the two. The sound was like music to the giant\u2019s ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Konohamaru was rubbed against Naruto\u2019s filthy heel, he had completely forgotten about stealing one of the scrolls and stopping the giant. He still wanted to save everyone, but right now he was only focused on saving himself. His sensei\u2019s foot stink was like a trip into Hell; it was just too much. He tried to squirm out of Naruto's fingers, but the Genin's growth into a god had given him strength that the academy student could never beat. He began to regret ever asking Naruto for difficult training. None of this would have happened if he hadn\u2019t agreed to the \u201ctraining\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure are screaming a lot, Konohamaru. I thought this is what you wanted? To be close to my awesome body?\u201d Naruto asked, taking Konohamaru away from his sweaty foot for a moment. Sasuke, however, was given no such respite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m sorry, Leader. Your feet just stink so badly and my nose feels like it\u2019s on fire.\u201d Konohamaru replied, tearing up slightly from the stink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. You\u2019ll eventually get used to it, Konohamaru. Then you\u2019ll be begging to smell my feet. Until then, squeal away! I enjoy it.\u201d Naruto gave the young kid a evil smirk before forcing him back against his foot. Once most of the sweat on his soles had been soaked into the two shinobi\u2019s clothes, Naruto moved onto his toes and pushed his slaves\u2019 heads into the crevices between his toes. By the time he had finished scrubbing between each of his toes, both boys\u2019 faces were covered in lint and toe jam. Some of the gunk had gotten into their mouths and turned their faces pale. Naruto finished up his foot cleaning by rubbing the top of his feet and the sides. When he was done, he brought both of his dripping wet rivals up to his face and sniffed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two smell like feet! That\u2019ll never come out of your clothes!\u201d Naruto said as he scrunched his nose. Before standing up to finish the job, the blond gently placed Konohamaru on the grass next to him. \u201cI want Sasuke alone to experience the full humiliation of cleaning my crotch, so you just wait there.\u201d Naruto stood to his feet, but kept his eyes on Konohamaru. \u201cAnd don\u2019t move a muscle! I\u2019ll be keeping my eye on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, leader.\u201d Konohamaru muttered, gulping at the sight of his master towering over him. \u201cJust please don\u2019t step on me! I\u2019m really close to your feet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, I\u2019ll try not to. It\u2019s kind of hard to watch out for bugs, though.\u201d Naruto turned his gaze to Sasuke and smiled at him. \u201cReady for the finale, bastard? I\u2019m going to enjoy cleaning my groin with you\u2026hehe, I have a friend that misses you.\u201d Naruto playfully grabbed his crotch through his boxers and gave it a squeeze. A tent could be seen forming; the giant Naruto was enjoying this. Sasuke, however, wasn\u2019t so thrilled. He didn\u2019t understand what Naruto meant by his friend \u201cmissing him\u201d. He had never been anywhere close to Naruto\u2019s privates, save for the few times they went to hot springs together.  He couldn\u2019t have known that his deceased clone had gotten to know Naruto\u2019s cock oh so well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear, dope, if you bring me anywhere near that I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Sasuke threatened, activating his Sharingan to further try and scare Naruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, I\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d</span></div></div>",

(If I had a better jutsu...maybe I could bring him down. But this won't do...I'm the size of his toe! The Fire Ball Jutsu won't work and my Chidori just fazes him temporarily. Now what do I do...) Sasuke pondered trying to think off a strategy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...you tiny bastard. Heh...don't tell me that you want more of my feet. If that's what you want, you could've just told me.\" Naruto said as he raised his dirty sole over him. \"What?\" Sasuke asked as he looked up to the sole that was hovering over him. Without a warning, Naruto quickly brought it down, but Sasuke managed to escape just in time. (Well...at least my speed's good.) Sasuke thought, beeing sure that Naruto was thinking the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...that's what I hate about cockroaches. They're always too fast. I triend nailing one with my slipper one time at home, but it just managed to escape. You however, don't have anywhere to hide. We're in the open, and you'll soon tire.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\" was all that Sasuke responded. Naruto once again raised his foot and dropped it. Sasuke had managed to slip again. Just after he had stomped, he raised his other foot and brought it down as quickly as he could. Sasuke just turned back to see the flesh decending. He had no time to react, as Naruto stamped on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the feeling, Sasuke? I bet they don't smell any better.\" Naruto said as he covered Sasuke's head with his sole and started grinding it in his face. He could hear agonising screams coming from under his foot. Naruto's sole literally touched Sasuke's face, mouth and nose and almost made him puke. Naruto then started rolling Sasuke under his foot, making the tiny Sasuke smell like feet even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto was doing this and was just grinning down at his foot, Konohamaru just watched. \"Oh, boy. His feet reek, but having his sole right at his face...ugh!\" Konohamaru just shivered at the thought. \"Hopefully, leader's going to stop some time...\" Konohamaru said. As he was noticing Sasuke getting grinded into the dirt under Naruto's smelly feet, he noticed a buldge forming under Naruto's boxers. \"Is he getting turned on by that?!\" Konohamaru pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do they smell?\" Naruto asked grinning. All he could hear were just a few muffled screams. \"Not very good, right?\" Naruto said as he chuckled. He brought his hand to his green boxers and gave his crotch a few more squeezes, from under the boxers. \"We're just beggining now, Sasuke!\" Naruto said.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019d be so easy to squish you with my big, smelly foot!\u201d Naruto taunted as he continued to smother Sasuke under his bare foot. He could feel his dick become harder and harder under his hand. The sounds of Sasuke\u2019s screams of distress were turning him on. Eventually, his dick became too painful to contain in his boxers and the blond reached inside to pull it out. Konohamaru watched with awe as Naruto took out his hard on and began stroking it. He couldn\u2019t believe how big it was\u2026it was even bigger than him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026Sasuke\u2026you feel so good under my foot. I could get used to this.\u201d Naruto moaned as he tugged on his penis. Sasuke had no idea that Naruto was getting off, at least not yet. He did notice, however, when Naruto increased the speed of his pumping and increased the pressure he was putting on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru realized he had been staring and quickly diverted his eyes elsewhere. Watching his Leader (or anyone else) jacking off just seemed wrong. However, he could still hear the giant\u2019s rapid breathing and the sound of his sweaty hand rubbing against his sweaty meat. He tried covering his ears, but that didn\u2019t do anything to block out the noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, Sasuke became too tired to scream anymore and just allowed his body to be smothered into the dirt by Naruto\u2019s foot. Thanks to this, he could now hear the erotic sounds coming from above him. He couldn\u2019t believe that dope was getting off to humiliating him\u2026how dare he! As a surviving member of the Uchiha clan, this was like a kick in the nuts to Sasuke. He felt so humiliated\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was starting to reach his limit when he thought about crushing Sasuke. Feeling his rival crunch under his foot would make for an awesome finish, but he resisted the urge. He didn\u2019t want to end Sasuke yet; he still had plans to humiliate him some more and make him truly understand that he was nothing but a bug now. Imaging the look on Sasuke\u2019s face when he was utterly defeated drove Naruto over the edge. His dick exploded, sending a torrent of cum onto the ground. For once, Sasuke was lucky to be under Naruto\u2019s foot; it shielded him from being covered in the fox boy\u2019s man juice. After about ten whole seconds of releasing his load, Naruto collapsed onto the ground; tired and completely spent. His foot was taken off Sasuke, who was laying immobile in a giant footprint. Naruto looked passed his limp member toward his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, look what you did, Sasuke. My foot\u2019s all dirty again. Oh well\u2026I guess that\u2019s enough of a bath for now. I\u2019m just going to rest for a bit and then we\u2019ll\u2026\u201d Naruto didn\u2019t finish, as his eyes fluttered close and he began snoring. The sound of his snoring could be heard all the way to the Leaf Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Naruto was asleep, Konohamaru ran to Sasuke\u2019s side and knelt over him. The boy plugged his nose when he noticed Sasuke was drenched in foot sweat and smelled almost as bad as the feet themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Konohamaru asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I\u2026*cough*\u2026look okay?\u201d Sasuke muttered back. Konohamaru realized that had been a stupid question. Sasuke looked really beat up and was probably very low on chakra. \u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2026*cough* this. That idiot gets a little bigger and\u2026*cough*\u2026he\u2019s suddenly this powerful. It should be ME who\u2019s lording over HIM. *cough* It\u2019s not\u2026fair.\u201d Sasuke loss consciousness after the last word; the pain in his body and the stench of foot becoming too much for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru stood up and glanced over at Naruto\u2019s pants. This was his chance! Naruto was out cold and masturbating must had made him really tired. If Konohamaru could sneak into the giant\u2019s pants and grab just one of the scrolls, he could turn the tide against Naruto! If for some reason Naruto woke up and caught him, he would just make up another excuse like he was trying to find a comfortable place to sleep. The ninja-in-training nodded to himself and took off toward the giant pair of pants. </span></div></div>",

After a while, he finally reached the pocket where Naruto had hidden the scroll. \"Hm. Let's see now\" Konohamaru said as he began to search through Naruto's pocket. \"Got it!\" Konohamaru lit up as he got one of the scrolls. \"Shrinking Scroll\" it said. \"With this, we'll be able to finally return him to normal size!\" Konohamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...my body...hurts.\" Sasuke awoke. He looked up to see Naruto bigger than life and Konohamaru having something in his hand. \"I smell so bad. What a humiliation...\" Sasuke thought to himself as he remembered to himself what had happened. He then stood to his legs, and appointed his attention to Konohamaru. \"Hey kid! It's dangerous! Get off him!\" Sasuke screamed at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shush, you dumb idiot!\" Konohamaru spoke trying not to wake Naruto up. \"Why not speak even louder?! You didn't manage to wake him up!\" Konohamaru quietly said with sarcasm. \"Whaaaaaaat?!\" Sasuke screamed even louder, not hearing what the kid said. Naruto then suddenly jerked and immediatly sprang up, making the kid fall off him. \"Yes, sensei!\" Naruto said on habit, before he rubbed his eyes and looked at his surroundings. He then quickly remembered what the situation was and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru just runned in Sasuke's direction with the scroll, and managed to reach him, while Naruto was still drowzy. \"Are you a total idiot?! I just told you to keep quiet!!!\" Konohamaru glared. \"Oh, sorry. Forgive me for not beeing able to hear you a mile away from me.\" Sasuke rolled his eyes. \"Yeah, yeah. I got your point. You still didn't blunder it all. I got the scroll!\" Konohamaru said as he showed Sasuke the scroll. \"So we'll use that to shrink the loser back to normal size, right?\" Sasuke asked. Konohamaru just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!\" Naruto stretched, and pointed his attention to the tiny ants. \"Hey, Sasuke. How about you give me a foot massage?Hehe\" Naruto chuckled and pointed to his foot. Sasuke just glared. \"Do it.\" he said to Konohamaru, extremely annoyed by what Naruto just told him. \"Alright!\" Konohamaru said and pointed the scroll to Naruto. \"Shrinking Jutsu!\" Konohamaru screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! When did you get that?!\" Naruto asked as he began to rise up, but it was too late as he quickly got back to normal size. \"Damn!\" Naruto cursed as he now faced Sasuke and Konohamaru. \"It's time for...\" Konohamaru begain to say \"Revenge!\" Sasuke added as both of the cracked their knuckles. In the prosses however, Konohamaru dropped the scroll, which would soon prove to be his mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru charged at Naruto and tried to punch him. Naruto ducked and tried to kick him. Konohamaru just managed to dodge the kick barely. \"Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!\" Sasuke said and made a fireball in Naruto's direction. Konohamaru and Sasuke watched as there was only smoke. \"I think we got him.\" Konohamaru said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't think so.\" Naruto said as he was behind them with the scroll in his hand. \"Who's the idiot now?! Why the hell did you drop the scroll?!\" Sasuke asked. \"Oops...Sorry\" Konohamaru sighed. \"Let's make small talk.\" Naruto grinned as he pointed it in their direction and screamed \"Shrinking Jutsu\" and them. Konohamaru and Sasuke's faces were as if it was the end of the world for them. In a matter of seconds, they were as tiny as a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeeing at peace, Naruto reached for his jumpsuit and noticed that it had shrunken too, even along with the whole in it. \"Whoa. The whole's so small. I supose I can still wear it.\" Naruto said as he put it on, and the whole was almost unnoticable. He then loomed over the tiny Sasuke and Konohamaru, with his hands on his hips. \" Let's go to my house. You both know that you'll have to be somewhere during the trip, right? And you won't be in my pocket, I can assure you.\" Naruto chuckled. He grabbed the two bugs in his hand and began to wonder where to put them, until he decided. \"You'll be in my boxers...Konohamaru.\" Naruto grinned as he slowly inserted the kid in his boxers. \"L-Leader! Please don't! I don't want to be there!\" Konohamaru said, but he was ignored and put there anyway. \"As for you, Sasuke...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou\u2019re going in my sandal as my insole!\u201d Naruto said as he grinned and looked around the area. \u201c\u2026once I find my sandals, that is.\u201d With the tiny Sasuke in hand and Konohamaru in his boxers, Naruto began searching the riverside for the sandals he had discarded when he was a giant. Since his jumpsuit shrank, it was safe to assume that his sandals had also somehow returned to normal. After several minutes of looking, Naruto finally found both is sandals several feet away from each other. As he picked the second one up, he noticed it was in a large imprint created by it when it was giant-sized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026I was pretty big.\u201d Naruto commented as he glanced at the imprint he was standing in. After he took on the sight, the normal sized fox boy placed his sandals back on the ground and slipped his left foot into one of them. \u201cReady, bug?\u201d Naruto asked his shrunken slave as he bent down and dropped Sasuke into the other sandal at a safe height. As Sasuke landed on his back, Naruto was already sliding his bare foot into the footwear with him. Sasuke didn\u2019t even have a chance to sit up before the giant foot passed over him and came down. Sasuke was completely helpless to stop Naruto\u2019s giant foot as it pressed him into his sandal with all of Naruto\u2019s weight. Sasuke thought he was going to be crushed, but Naruto was careful not to end Sasuke yet. He didn\u2019t want to crush Sasuke until he really felt like it. \u201cWell, let\u2019s go, guys!\u201d Naruto exclaimed before he began whistling and making his way back to the village. As the young genin walked, he unknowingly left behind the still unconscious Kakashi. Naruto was too immersed with having Sasuke under his foot and Konohamaru in his pants to remember his sensei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Naruto arrived back at the village. It took a lot longer to get there since he wasn\u2019t a giant anymore, but that was just fine since it meant more torture for his two slave boys. As Naruto walked through the village, he made sure to sneak around to make sure no one saw him. It only took a few minutes, however, for Naruto to notice he was alone in the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like everyone evacuated.\u201d Naruto muttered to himself as he walked through a ruined section of the village. He couldn\u2019t believe HE was the one who caused so much destruction. He defiantly needed to use the growing scroll again sometime and have more fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasuke was pounded into submission with every step, Konohamaru was also suffering inside Naruto\u2019s boxers. The poor boy was tumbling around uncontrollably as his giant captor walked toward his apartment. Occasionally he would whack into Naruto\u2019s balls or his member, causing the older boy a jolt of pleasure. Konohamaru\u2019s wild ride finally came to a halt when he got stuck under one of the orange ninja\u2019s fleshy balls. The cum-filled sac weighed down on the academy student and stopped any movement he could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHome sweet home!\u201d Naruto shouted as he arrived at his apartment and walked in. he immediately ran into his bedroom and sat down on his bed. The blond giant removed his sandals again and peeled Sasuke off the right one. He chuckled when he saw Sasuke covered in his foot sweat. It looked like that bath he had didn\u2019t do much. Nevertheless, Naruto laid himself down and dangled Sasuke before his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you, bastard!\u201d Naruto mocked as he smirked. \u201cYou got me back to normal size, but now you\u2019re smaller than everything! You should of used the shrinking scroll to shrink me past my normal height. What an idiot\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, dope!\u201d Sasuke shouted, struggling in Naruto\u2019s strong grip. \u201cYou aren\u2019t getting away with this! Once everyone finds out you\u2019re not a giant anymore, they\u2019ll come for you! You\u2019ll get just what a traitor like you deserves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! If I were them, I\u2019d give me the title of Hokage! As long as I have these two scrolls, no one can beat me!\u201d Naruto reached into his pocket and took out the two scrolls from within. \u201cI\u2019ll just shrink anyone who tries to fight me! No matter how powerful they are, a bug is still a bug. And if they ever try and outnumber me, I\u2019ll just grow into a giant again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke glared hatefully at Naruto, but knew he was right. As long as the dope had those two scrolls, he was probably the most powerful person on the planet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s have some fun, bug.\u201d Naruto dropped the small Sasuke onto his chest and watched him try to get to his feet. It was made very difficult since Naruto\u2019s chest went up and down every time the giant inhaled and exhaled. </span></div></div>",

Sasuke stood up and glared at Naruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto was wondering, Sasuke began to think what to do. (I can't get away from him...all that would do is just get me in trouble again. Ninjutsu doesn't work on him because he's too big, and if I try Taijutsu I might end up under his feet again...literally. My only option left...is to use Genjutsu! Yes...an illusion should buy me enough time to escape.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't come up with anything.\" Naruto shrugged. \"Any suggestions...Sasuke?\" Naruto grinned as he looked at the tiny Sasuke on his chest. \"Yeah, I have a suggestion.\" Sasuke smirked. \"Haha, you do, eh? I'd love to hear it.\" Naruto chuckled thinking that Sasuke was going to chose his own punishment. \"How about we play the \"Run away from the giant Sasuke\" game?\" Sasuke said. \"AHAHAHA! I didn't know you had a sense of humour.\" Naruto chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that.\" Sasuke said as he began to perform the handsigns. Just before he finished it he was suddenly grabbed by Naruto. \"Ugh.\" Sasuke groaned. \"I'm bored.\" Naruto signed as Sasuke smelled the hot ramen breath he had. \"Ohh...Is my grip too hard for you, Sasuke?\" Naruto cynically asked. \"You...dirty ass!\" Sasuke sweared trying to brake his hands free from Naruto's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ass? Oh! That's a great idea Sasuke! My butt really is a little dirty. How about we play the game \"Clean my ass\"? Naruto chuckled. \"You wouldn't\" Sasuke said. \"Oh yeah?\" Naruto asked as he pulled his pants down and his boxers, with still Konohamaru infront. He then bringed Sasuke to his butt and he shoved him in suddenly. Naruto then let out a massive fart straight into Sasuke's face. \"Ewww. That was really smelly even for me.\" Naruto mocked. \"Narutooooo! Let me out of-\" Sasuke couldn't finish as Naruto shoved him even further. He then started to move him up and down using him as toilet paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he pulled him out Sasuke was covered in dirt and shit. \"Yuck! You're really dirty Sasuke.\" Naruto pointed out. \"Grrr...\" Sasuke grumbled. He finally managed to let his hands free as Naruto's grip loosened. He quickly performed the handsigns and casted the Genjutsu. \"Huh?\" Naruto wondered as Sasuke dissapeared from his hand. Suddenly, his room vanished and all there was was a red space surrounding him. Behind him, a gigantic Sasuke appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in reality, with having Naruto numbified Sasuke quickly began to run for the door. \"By the time he dispells that, I'll be long gone.\" Sasuke smirked. Even tiny, within two or three minutes he should be able to reach the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the illusion, Naruto stared confused. \"What the...how can this be? I'm sure he didn't get the Giant scroll. Wait! Could this be an illusion?\" Naruto pondered. The giant Sasuke raised his sandaled foot over Naruto and tried to bring it down on him. Just barely, Naruto managed to dodge it. \"That bastard...so that's how it is, huh? He's going to wish he never did this when I'm finished with him\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kyuubi. I need your help.\" Naruto said as he was in his inner self dimension infront of the Kyuubi's cage. \"My help, huh? If I help you dispell the illusion, what will you do for me?\" the fox asked Naruto slyly. Naruto pondered before answering. \"Um...well...I won't let the Akatsuki capture you. I promise!\" Naruto said boldly. \"That's in your favour too. If they capture us, you'll die when I'm extracted from you.\" the Kyuubi responded. \"That's true, but you'll be in trouble too.\" Naruto remarked. The Kyuubi pondered for a little before responing. \"So be it. I'll help you THIS TIME. Touch me.\" The Kyuubi said. Naruto slowly approached the fox and touched it's furr. The moment he did it, he was back in his room, sitting on his bed. The illusion was dispelled. He was really mad at Sasuke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing him to depend on the Kyuubi and making himself giant in a illusion had pissed off Naruto a lot. He then caught Sasuke trying to escape. \"Not so fast you tiny shit!\" Naruto said as he ran after Sasuke. One of Naruto's footsteps was so hard that it made Sasuke trip. \"Wh-\" Sasuke began to say but it was too late as Naruto had put a jar on him. Naruto moved the jar to his bed, while being careful so Sasuke could not escape. \"What is this?! You were in my illusion! How did you escape?!\" Sasuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jinchuuriki who can control the Tailed Beast inside them can't be affected by illusions. I need a partner who has to touch me so I can escape from the illusion. That partner is the Tailed Beast inside me.\" Naruto explained. \"Damn it!\" Sasuke cursed. \"You'll pay for this...\" Naruto cracked his knuckles. Sasuke just shivered. \"...after I go jog.\" Naruto finished. \"What?\" Sasuke was surprised. \"You stay here. When I come back, you better be ready\" Naruto said. He reached in his pants and bringed Konohamaru out, only to noticed that he had fainted. \"Haha. Must be really sweaty in there. I'll just put him in a seperate jar than yours, Sasuke. Just in case.\" Naruto said as he put Konohamaru on a table and put a jar over him. He then mischievously grinned, put his sandals on, opened the door and went out side. Sasuke noticed that grin and was concerned. What was Naruto plotting? He tried pulling off the jar but it was pointless. The only thing he could wait was for Naruto to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*After 2 hours*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke heard the door open. In, entered Naruto all sweaty. \"I see you couldn't escape\" Naruto grinned. He looked over to Konohamaru, who still hadn't waken up. He took the jar off of Sasuke and placed him on the ground beside his bed. Naruto sat on the bed and grinned down at Sasuke. Naruto slipped his sandals off and a putrid smell was unleashed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god! What's that smell?!\" Sasuke asked as he plugged his nose. \"Ahh. I smell victory.\" Naruto said as he pulled off the evilest grin he could do. Without any warning, Naruto lifted his sweaty foot over the tiny Sasuke and brought it down. \"AUGHUGHAUGH! It reeks!\" Sasuke jerked under Naruto's sole that was covering his face. \"Do anything you can! Lick, sniff or kiss! And if you refuse to, I'll just use you as an insole to jog AGAIN. But this time, both my feet and sandals are sweaty and smelly, and you'll suffer like you've never suffered before!\" Naruto commanded. Having too big of a pride, Sasuke was going to do everything but to obey.</span></div></div>",

The giant blond simply smirked at his rival\u2019s defiance and moved his foot so the dark haired Uchiha\u2019s face was poking out between two of his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat Uchiha pride is some sturdy stuff, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Naruto said as he squeezed and grinded Sasuke\u2019s head between his massive toes. The large ninja was amused by the way Sasuke\u2019s face compacted. \u201cWell, whatever. You\u2019re right; you may never obey me. However, you know what\u2019ll happen if you don\u2019t?\u201d Naruto grinned a wicked smile. Sasuke\u2019s eyes widened and he shivered a little at the demonic look. \u201cYou\u2019ll be dead\u2026like a bug!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying anything more, Naruto clenched the tiny Uchiha with his toes and brought him over to his sandal. Naruto slammed his foot down upon the sandal, knocking the wind out of poor Sasuke. He moved his foot again so that Sasuke\u2019s face was once again pushed up against his hard sole. Once he put his other sandal on, Naruto stood up and put all that healthy shinobi weight upon the bug sized Sasuke. The smaller shinobi screamed as his eyes watered from the massive amount of sweat and foot stench. The sandal was damp against his back and the foot was hard and foul smelling as it squashed him into said sandal. Sasuke had never smelled such hell and wiggled desperately to get away from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime for another workout!\u201d Naruto announced as he stretched and took off into the village. The young boy was in such a rush that he forgot to lock his apartment up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto made his way into the empty streets of Konoha and jogged through them. Every inch of his body became soaked with perspiration. His face went red and it was anyone\u2019s guess how much sweat was building up in those clothes of his. Under his foot, Sasuke was powerless before the larger, stronger ninja. The sole pinned him against the worn, blue sandal and prevented him from making any plans of escape. His clothes became drenched in sweat and stuck to his skin. The young boy\u2019s eyes rolled into the back of his head as he just barely remained conscious. He wished again and again to receive the blessing of unconsciousness, but it wouldn\u2019t come. It was as if cruel fate was forcing him to stay away and endure his suffering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh, this is great!\u201d Naruto said as he wiped some sweat off his brow and turned the nearby corner. As he did, he was surprised to see a bunch of fallen rubble in his path. With nimble skill he easily jumped over the debris. \u201cHeh, look at all the damage I caused\u2026\u201d Naruto glanced around at the ruined village. It looked like a tornado had hit it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the orange ninja ran, he didn\u2019t know that a few other ninjas were watching him from a nearby rooftop. One of these ninjas was Shikamaru Nara, accompanied by two other chunin around his own age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, look at him go for a jog like nothing happened.\u201d Shikamaru said as he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a giant anymore, though!\u201d spoke the ninja to Shikamaru\u2019s left. \u201cThis is are chance to ambush him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree, but we can\u2019t just go in there recklessly. Even at normal size, Naruto is a formidable opponent. Plus, as long as he has those shrink and grow scrolls, he has the advantage. If we get shrunk or he grows, we\u2018re finished.\u201d Shikamaru explained as he scratched his chin. \u201cOur best bet would be using my Shadow Possession jutsu to immobilize him. Then, once he can\u2019t move, you two go in there and take the scrolls from him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood plan, Shikamaru!\u201d complimented the chunin to the right. \u201cWe\u2019ll take those scrolls and then it\u2019ll be his turn to find out what it\u2019s like to be small and weak!\u201d The young ninja slammed his fist into his palm as he grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust as long as I have the first shot at him!\u201d came a voice from behind Shikamaru. The lazy ninja turned around to see none other than Kiba. The dog boy was still bruised up from the stomping Naruto gave him; his left arm was even in a cast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re injured. You shouldn\u2019t even be here, but you insisted. If you want to help so badly, I have another job for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, fine. Just as long as I can teach that bastard a lesson eventually. What do you want me to do?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know that Naruto has Sasuke Uchiha and the honorable grandson captured. I want you to head over to his apartment and see if he left either of them behind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph, fine. When I get back, I better see that blond headed dope the size of an ant!\u201d Kiba scoffed and hopped off the roof, making his way toward Naruto\u2019s apartment building. A few moments later, Shikamaru and the two other ninja jumped to another rooftop and continued tracking Naruto.</span></div></div>",

Just as he was about to pull it out...BAM! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow Possesion Jutsu...success.\" Shikamaru remarked behind Naruto. He slowly turned around so Naruto was now facing him. The other two ninja jumped to Shikamaru's side. \"S-Shimakaru! What are doing?!\" Naruto asked. \"What am I doing? The question is what are YOU doing...Naruto?\" Shikamaru responded. \"What are you talking about? I didn't do anything!\" Naruto said. \"Don't lie to me. I know about the scrolls, and about Sasuke and the Honorable Grandson. All three are in your...possesion.\" Shikamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just frowned. \"I also know about those three ANBU that were dispatched to do the task that I'm now dispatched to do. Their squashed shrunken remains were found. You have something to do with that, don't you?\" Shikamaru asked. Naruto just sighed. \"Yeah. They were really annoying and I decided to get rid of them. Let me go, before I decide to get \"rid\" of you too.\" Naruto threatened. \"I don't think that's gonna happen. Just surrender already.\" Shikamaru said as he began to approach Naruto, who was mimicking his moves too. \"Wait!\" Naruto said. \"What?\" Shimamaru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked. \"Lift your toes on your left foot.\" Naruto said. \"What are you talking about?\" Shikamaru asked. \"Hehe...you'll see.\" Naruto responded. Shikamaru thought for a second, but decided to comply with what Naruto said. Shikamaru lifted his toes on his left foot. With him doing this, Naruto also mimicked the same move. When Naruto lifted his toes, the tiny Sasuke's head could be seen. \"No way! Is that...Sasuke?!\" Shikamaru asked in confusion. \"The very same one. Fortunately, I had taken him with me today. But this works in my favour now. I can still move my foot enough to crush him. It won't be pretty.\" Naruto grinned. (Damn. I didn't foresee this. Now what...) Shikamaru thought. \"C'mon!\" Naruto urged as he began to press on Sasuke. Sasuke screamed in pain, his body slowly crushed. \"Ok, ok.\" Shikamaru responded as he undid his Shadow Possesion. \"Ah, finally.\" Naruto said as he stopped putting pressure on Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess I'll be returning home now. If you even try to ambush me again, OR if you follow me, Sasuke here will share the fate of an ordinary bug.\" Naruto smirked before setting off. \"So we are just going to let him get away?\" one of the ninjas asked. \"We can't afford to put Sasuke's life at risk. Not all is lost though. Kiba should be at his apartament right now. I guess we'll just have to leave things in Kiba's hands.\" Shikamaru sighed scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Naruto's house, Kiba managed to sneak in. He entered his bedroom, and to his surprise he saw the shrinking scroll on Naruto's bed. \"Haha. Looks like luck is on my side. Not only did he forget to lock his apartament but he also forgot the shrinking scroll. The growing scroll must be with him though.\" Kiba pondered. Just then he heard screams behind him. Konohamaru was in a jar on the table. Kiba saw this and peeked through the jar. \"Heh. Serves you right. Let's see how you'll like my feet now, you puny brat!\" Kiba smirked. Just as he was about to open the jar and take Konoahamaru, he heard Naruto's footsteps. He quickly hid behind the door. \"Man. Don't tell me he got rid of Shikamaru and the others!\" Kiba said. \"Ah well...I'll get my revenge then...Sasuke must be with him too. Hah. I'll just get my revenge on all three.\" Kiba smirked as he took out the scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew he closed it, however, which means someone else must of entered! Gritting his teeth, the orange ninja snuck through the doorway and glanced around for the intruder. His eyes fell upon Konohamaru\u2019s jar; the tiny boy awake inside. \u201cHey squirt, you\u2019re awake! You see anyone sneak in here?\u201d Naruto asked the shrunken academy student as he walked toward the jar. Before he could take a second step, Kiba jumped out from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShrinking jutsu!\u201d Kiba shouted, pointing at Naruto. The blond haired shinobi spun around to meet Kiba face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiba! What the-? I thought I cru-?\u201d Naruto stopped when he noticed everything becoming bigger. His blue eyes widened in horror as he watched Kiba grin and loom over him. When Naruto stood only to Kiba\u2019s waist, the handicapped ninja gave him a push that sent him onto his butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it feel to shrink, Naruto?\u201d Kiba asked as he watched Naruto reduce in size. He was quickly becoming nothing but a bug to him. \u201cHow\u2019s it feel to look up at someone for once?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto finally stopped shrinking when he was the same size as his victims. The small fox boy gaped up at the tower Kiba, not understanding how he shrunk or why Kiba was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe look on your face is priceless.\u201d Kiba spoke as he pocketed the shrinking scroll. \u201cWondering why I\u2019m not a squashed carcass embedded into the earth? It\u2019s all thanks to your terrible aim! You did do this to me, though\u2026\u201d Kiba pointed at his broken arm. \u201c\u2026and for that, you\u2019re gonna pay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the large dog ninja slowly raised one of his sandaled feet into the air. Naruto snapped out of his shock when he saw the shadow engulf him. He jumped to his feet and took off in the opposite direction, ignoring the booming sound of Kiba stomping down behind him. As he ran, Sasuke (who had also been shrunken, now only a speck in comparison to Kiba.) was pounded into the sandal with each step. The small Uchiha had heard everything and was shivering at the idea that Kiba could now crush him between his fingers. He couldn\u2019t believe how small he must be now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, run all you like, idiot!\u201d Kiba thundered as he kicked off his sandals and made slow steps toward the fleeing Naruto. The genin was running as fast as he could, but he was barely covering any distance at all. Kiba played cat and mouse with him for about a minute before he grew tired of it. The giant raised his bare foot over Naruto stomped down. Naruto was hit hard in the back and forced to lie flat on his stomach. Kiba chuckled as he slowly grinded Naruto against his own floor, listening to the former giant scream in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour torture\u2019s just beginning, Naruto. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten about Sasuke either! I know he must be with you, which means he must be speck size\u2026just like I once was!\u201d Kiba raised his foot off Naruto for a moment, but stomped it back down hard. He didn\u2019t bring his foot down hard enough to harm Naruto, but it was enough to temporarily paralyze him. \u201cWait right there. I want to have the whole gang before me!\u201d Kiba laughed and walked toward Konohamaru. He plucked the tiny kid out of the jar and held him before his menacing eyes. \u201cReady for some payback, brat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiba, stop this!\u201d Konohamaru shouted as he struggled in the genin\u2019s powerful grip. \u201cYou\u2019ve defeated Naruto, so just stop this! I want everything to go back to normal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! You think after you tortured me, everything can go back to normal? Forget it! It\u2019s time to show you, Naruto, and Sasuke why I deserve to be the big man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Kiba turned around to see\u2026</span></div></div>",

He made a few handsigns, making sure that he was faster than Kiba. In a flash, Kiba was just laying his foot on Naruto's normal sized body, with Sasuke growing a little under Naruto's foot, but stopped at the same shrunken size he was before Naruto was shrunken. Naruto quickly turned around and pushed Kiba's foot off him. Kiba just backed away as Naruto put the growing scroll back in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Damn...when did you...?!\" Kiba asked speachless. \"Fortunately, I had it the whole time. I have a lot of luck today, haha.\" Naruto just grinned. Kiba put the shrunken Konohamaru on Naruto's matress, so he can attempt to shrink Naruto again. \"Don't even bother.\" Naruto said, knowing Kiba's intention. \"If you shrink me, I'll just grow myself. And I have the advantage. I can grow even more, and become huge. I'll deal with you easier that way.\" Naruto just chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah? Well this time, I won't hesitate and the minute you're the size of an ant, I'll squash ya'. What's faster? Your hands or my foot?\" Kiba asked smirking. Naruto just sighed. He took his sandal off and let the beat up Sasuke fall on the floor before putting it on again. \"Hehe...there's your Sasuke.\" Naruto just chuckled. Kiba looked at the sweat drenched, beat up Sasuke. Sasuke's state was so funny, that he barely managed to supress his laughter. Kiba just chuckled quetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're still doing that, huh? The stench of your feet Naruto, really took their toll on the tiny Sasuke. I can say that...from my OWN experience...\" Kiba growled. \"Oh, come on Kiba. That's past. You had your revenge on me right?\" Naruto asked. \"REVENGE?! All I did was pin you under my foot! YOU used me a few times as your insole, you made me smell your putrid feet and you even wanted to step on me! I have SO MUCH more to come back at you!\" Kiba growled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess I kind of got carried away. Besides, I wanted to squash you because you had messed up my jumpsuit, but seing as how the hole you made into it, shrinked along with it, it's barely noticable now so I have no problem. Remember that time when we tortured that Sasuke clone? Why don't we have fun over him again? We'll be sure to include Konohamaru in the fun too this time\" Naruto chuckled. Konohamaru just trembled when he heard that. Sasuke just barely stood up, when he heard about what had happened with his deceased clone. Kiba just looked over at Sasuke, and then looked at Konohamaru. \"Isn't that a deal? We'll both have fun, and you'll get it back at them both...I won't miss this either though.\" Naruto chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba thought for a second before deciding to answer. \"Fine. I want to get it back at Sasuke because of Akamaru, who's currently in the hospital because of putting him in danger during that mission we had. And I also want to get it back at Konohamaru for that torture he gave me. I guess that if it's both of us, it'd be tougher for the both of them.\" Kiba said. \"Great!\" Naruto jumped up in joy. \"Just one more thing before we begin. Give me the shrinking scroll.\" Naruto demanded. Kiba took it out of his clothes and handed it over to Naruto. Naruto put it back in his pocket along with the other scroll, and waived for Kiba to come next to him. Naruto sat on his bed matress and placed the tiny Konohamaru on the ground next to Sasuke at his feet. Kiba came and sat next to Naruto on his matress with now both towering over the tiny Sasuke and Konohamaru. Since Kiba had already slipped off his sandals, Naruto just reached for his own and pulled them off. He just wiggled his toes as he put his sandals next to Kiba's. Now it was time for both Naruto and Kiba to have some fun with their slaves.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He loved the feeling he got when he toyed around with him; the feeling of power and control. To think that all that happened just yesterday! Speaking of that tiny guy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Naruto. I was just curious\u2026but how does it feel when you crush someone? Like that clone of Sasuke we toyed around with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm? Oh, him! Well\u2026\u201d Naruto tapped his chin and thought. \u201cIt feels like snuffing out a cockroach. They squish so easily and the crunch they make sends a chill down your spine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds interesting.\u201d Kiba replied with a wicked smile. \u201cMind if I test it out one of these bugs?\u201d Sasuke and Konohamaru\u2019s eyes widened in horror as they heard this. Naruto raised an eyebrow too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to squash one of them?  I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Naruto, what\u2019s the loss? If you must have at least two of them at once, there\u2019s a whole bunch of people we could shrink! Shikamaru and a few other chunin are right outside! I REALLY want to feel one of them crunch under my foot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Naruto scratched his blond hair. He could understand Kiba\u2019s excitement; it felt really good when he crushed that Sasuke clone and those ANBU. It was true that he could just get a replacement later\u2026 \u201cAlright, fine. If you have to squash one of them, make it Konohamaru. I still want Sasuke alive so I can torture him some more!\u201d Naruto grinned down at Sasuke and flexed his toes above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe squirt? Fine with me!\u201d Kiba turned his attention to the mini-Konohamaru o the floor and smirked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what?! Leader, no! Tell him to stop, please!\u201d Konohamaru begged, getting on his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Konohamaru, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll make a good slave anyway. You\u2019re just a kid who\u2019s not even a full-fledged ninja yet. You tire out too easily and I have no interest in weaklings.\u201d Naruto explained coldly before he turned his attention back to Sasuke and pinned the tiny Uchiha under his smelly bare foot. He laughed as he rolled Sasuke under the ball of his foot, his mind no longer on Konohamaru. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but\u2026leader, please! What about all that \u2018training\u2019 and torture I had to go through! Are you going to reward me for all that by\u2026by killing me?! Please don\u2019t, leader!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be talking to him, brat.\u201d Kiba said as he stood up and positioned both his feet on either side of the shrunken Konohamaru. \u201cI\u2019m the one you should be pleading with\u2026\u201d Kiba grinned toothily down at the younger boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t want to die\u2026no\u2026\u201d the academy student choked out, tears running down his face. Kiba had no mercy for the boy who had tortured and humiliated him, however, and raised his bare foot over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter run then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru screamed and took off, running as fast as his legs could carry him. Kiba stomped down where Konohamaru once was, blowing the boy forward with a shockwave. Konohamaru quickly got back to his feet and made a few hand signs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShadow Clone Jutsu!\u201d Konohamaru shouted as a cloud of smoke engulfed him and four tiny Konohamarus ran out. The giant dog ninja just chuckled at this, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, you played this game with Naruto before. It won\u2019t save ya\u2026\u201d Kiba stomped over to the nearest fleeing Konohamaru and stepped on him. The boy made a soft crunch under his foot\u2026followed by a plume of smoke that revealed it to be a clone. Kiba just shrugged and looked at the three remaining boys. Thinking that the real Konohamaru would want to be as far away from him as possible, Kiba leaped into the air and came down on the Konohamaru that was leading the other two. Both his feet impacted the ground with a boom, knocking the other two bugs off their feet. Kiba grinded his feet into the floor, but felt another explosion under his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, not that one either\u2026\u201d Kiba muttered as he scanned the ground around his feet for the remaining two. He did not see them by his feet, however, but found they were already closing in on the open door. \u201cHeh\u2026fast little buggers. I\u2019ve had enough of this game, however. Time for you to go squish, brat!\u201d Kiba once again leaped into the air and positioned his feet so they would come down on both of the Konohamarus. The two younglings looked up just as Kiba came down with a thoom, crushing them both. Kiba rubbed his bare feet into the floor, knowing that he was smearing the real Konohamaru under one of them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what you get for thinking you\u2019re bigger than-.\u201d Kiba began to say, until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*poof* *poof*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tiny burst of smoke under both his feet! Confused, Kiba looked a few feet away to see ANOTHER Konohamaru making his way out of the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026when did he make another clone?!\u201d Kiba growled in frustration and stomped after Konohamaru. The tiny academy student ran out the door and swerved right. He desperately looked around for somewhere to hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, come on! I can\u2019t just be squashed! I have to hide before-!\u201d Konohamaru stopped talking when he noticed a shadow engulf him. He had been so stricken with fear that he hadn't noticed someone had closed in on him.  His eyes widened in horror as he looked up to see\u2026</span></div></div>",

You though you could run away from Giant Kiba huh?\" Kiba chuckled in delight. \"So what's going to be flattened first? The legs or the arms? I'm not going to hurry to squash your head. I want you to suffer and to feel like a bug at somebody's feet.\" Kiba snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kiba! Please! Reconsider! I didn't do this to you when you were in my position! So why then?!\" Konohamaru desperately asked. \" I already said it. I just want to feel someone crunch under my foot. I want to feel big...and powerful.

You actually take away someone's life. Please don't do it Kiba. And like Naruto said, there are other people. I heard that Shikamaru and the others are out there.

FOR NOW I won't crush you...but if you blunder or if you do something stupid you're gonna be a squashed bug!\" Kiba threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a million Kiba!\" Konohamaru lit up. \"B-But...could you remove your foot from me? It's really heavy.\" Konohamaru said. \"What?! Who said anything about that? I'm gonna have some revenge for what you did earlier to me.\" Kiba said as he pushed his sole over Konohamaru's face and pressed on him. \"Mmmhh! Kihhh-baaa\" Konohamaru's muffled screams could be heard. \"Ahh! This is it. This feels great.\" Kiba signed as he felt Konohamaru squirm. After a while of doing this, Kiba finally removed his foot off of Konohamaru. Konohamaru just lied there, his whole body twitching as if squashed. \"Now wasn't this great?\" Kiba asked as he began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not funny!!!\" Konohamaru screamed. \"Ohhh...don't be like that.\" Kiba said still laughing. \"C'mon. Let's see how your pal Sasuke is doing. Although mine have a faint odor, Naruto's feet really reek from all that training he does. We both know that. So however he is, he isn't well.\" Kiba said as he picked up the tiny Konohamaru in his hand and went to Naruto's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was certainly enjoying himself. He was grinding his smelly feet in the ground with Sasuke suffering beneath. \"Hehe. I knew it Sasuke. You were just born to worship my feet. You always said that I was the shortest from all the teams...well except Hinata. She's shorter than me. Do you still think that I'm the shortest?\" Naruto asked as he pressed Sasuke deeper into the floor. \" I want you to kiss my sole! Say that I'm bigger than you!\" Naruto demanded. He positioned his sweaty sole over the tiny Sasuke's head and awaited for Sasuke to kiss it. Sasuke had realized that if he tries to oppose the giant that nothing good would come out of it. So for now he had decided to atleast comply with this nonsense. With much regret, he bringed his face closer to Naruto's sweaty sole and kissed it for a half second. \"That's a good bug. Now say that I'm bigger than you and that you've always been a bug to me!\" Naruto once again demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grr...why you little...\" Sasuke began to curse. \"Little? I think that you're self deluding yourself. Now say what I told you if you don't want to be turned into a stain.\" Naruto grinned. Sasuke just frowned. \"You're bigger than me Naruto. I've always been a bug to you.\" Sasuke just repeated. \"Hehe.\" Naruto chuckled as he removed his foot from Sasuke. \"Hey. How's it going?\" Kiba asked as he came and sat next to Naruto. \"Hm? I thought that you wanted to crush Konohamaru. What made you reconsider?\" Naruto asked curious. \"I'm doing it for the same reason, that you're keeping Sasuke instead of squashing him.\" Kiba said. \"Oh? So you want to torture him?\" Naruto asked. \"Yeah. It'd be better...for now. Besides, what you said about Shikamaru and the others...we could just crush them instead.\" Kiba said snickering. \"I thought that you worked with them.\" Naruto raised an eyebrow. \"Yeah, but that was until I made a deal with you. I like being...big.\" Kiba chuckled. \"Hehe. I know what you mean.\" Naruto snickered as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey just stayed in silence for some time, before Kiba spoke out. \"Yuck! What's that smell? Man I almost can't breathe.\" Kiba said as he held his nose. Naruto just picked his own foot and took a whiff of it. \"Hehe. That must be because of the jogging. Man...I sure could use some kind of rag to get rid of the stench and the sweat. It'll never go away ofcourse, but it'd make the air...cleaner.\" Naruto laughed. \"Well I don't know, but just use something to absorb the sweat and odor. I can't take it.\" Kiba spoke still holding his nose. \"Yeah, but I don't have a--\" Naruto stopped as he looked at Sasuke. Sasuke looked back at him with an intimidated look. \"Well...I think I just found my rag.\" Naruto laughed evilly as he picked up Sasuke. \"Wait. You'll use him?!\" Kiba asked in surprise. \"Yeah. I need something to absorb the sweat and the smell from my feet. Sasuke's clothes are cleaner now...and, his body would do nice in general.\" Naruto said as he looked at Sasuke evilly. \"Naruto, don't!\" Sasuke said. \"This'll stink a little...or maybe a lot. But I need a rag...and you'll do an even better job than an ordinary rag. Don't worry. You won't need to do anything. I'll just rub you around so you can clean me off of the foot odor.\" Naruto laughed. Without even noticing, Kiba got hard and he felt a bulge in his pants. What Naruto was going to do to the tiny Sasuke was really turning him on. Kiba wanted to see how Naruto was going to use Sasuke as a rag for his feet and soles. He wasn't getting hard when he was in Sasuke's postion, but he was getting hard by watching the smelly action unfold.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba watched as Naruto hoisted his right foot onto his knee and brought Sasuke down to it. He held the squirming little Uchiha right in front of the smelly sole, wiggling his toes tauntingly. Sasuke tried to break out of Naruto\u2019s strong grip and get away from the hellish smell of his feet, but he no match for the giant Naruto\u2019s strength. With a dark chuckle Naruto slammed the tiny Sasuke right into his sole. Without reliving any of the pressure, Naruto started dragging Sasuke up and down his sole. Sasuke screamed as his body and clothes soaked up the boy\u2019s sweat and odor like a human sweat rag. Kiba just stared at Naruto\u2019s foot as this happened, loving the way Sasuke was being so humiliated. The tent in his pants got bigger and the dog ninja pushed his legs together to try and hide it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026you like that, Sasuke?\u201d Naruto asked as he pushed the shrunken genin\u2019s face into a really sweaty part of his sole. The once proud Uchiha howled in disgust as he was forced to smell the terrible odor seeping into his nose. The giant, orange ninja smirked and chuckled as he rubbed Sasuke over his toes. He made sure to push Sasuke\u2019s small head between his cheesy toes and twist him around, smearing his face with his dingy toe cheese. \u201cHehe\u2026and after you finish scrubbing this foot\u2026you still have the other one to do! Hahaha!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto said this, a light bulb lit up in Kiba\u2019s head and he glanced down at Konohamaru in his fist. The shrunken kid was staring at Sasuke with a look of pity. He was probably also glad that wasn\u2019t him going through that torture. That was going to change\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, Naruto! If you make Sasuke soak up all the sweat on your left foot too, you might drown him! We don\u2019t want that!\u201d Kiba explained with an evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then what am I supposed to do? I can\u2019t just scrub up all the sweat on one foot and leave the other smelling like rotten meat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, it\u2019s a good thing we have another sweat rag!\u201d Kiba replied as he held up Konohamaru. When the young ninja-in-training noticed he was being held up, he glanced from Kiba to Naruto\u2019s foot and gaped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! No! I\u2019m not a sweat rag! Don\u2019t put me near those things\u2026please!\u201d Konohamaru shouted as he squirmed in Kiba\u2019s fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, not a bad idea, Kiba! Alright!\u201d Naruto said with a big grin. Kiba grinned himself and nodded before jumping off the bed and kneeling before Naruto\u2019s other foot. With Konohamaru in hand, Kiba lowered the panicking boy to Naruto\u2019s sole. The dog boy\u2019s other hand was kept on his nose, since he couldn\u2019t take the smell of Naruto\u2019s feet (which was made worst due to Kiba\u2019s more sensitive sense of smell). Konohamaru saw the foot coming, but could do nothing but brace himself. He hit the foot with a thwack and was rubbed over it just like Sasuke. Naruto closed his eyes and moaned as Kiba massaged his foot with the younger boy. Konohamaru squirmed, coughed, and spluttered as his face was dragged over the sweat soaked foot bottom. Naruto moved Sasuke around to the top of his foot and started massaging there. He could actually feel Sasuke become damp under his fingers and wondered if he could squeeze any sweat out of his body\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little bugs can be used in all sorts of ways, can\u2019t you!\u201d Kiba joked as he twisted the young tiny between his leader\u2019s toes. Konohamaru was feeling completely humiliated and wondered if it would have been better if Kiba had just crushed him. \u201cMan, Naruto\u2026your feet sure can sweat! It never ends!\u201d Kiba rubbed Konohamaru faster over Naruto\u2019s sole, making the poor slave feel like his entire body was going to be smoothed down flat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, well when  you\u2019re a strong ninja like me, you have to train more than anyone else! My body gets really sweaty and my B.O. hits the roof!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s obvious\u2026\u201d Kiba muttered as he got to massaging the top of Naruto\u2019s foot. Both of Naruto\u2019s feet were made (almost) sweat-free at around the same time. They still stunk, but not as much that they stunk up the entire room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026that felt great.\u201d Naruto said as he stretched his arms over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a lot more fun than I thought!\u201d Kiba smiled before bringing the small Konohamaru to his face. \u201cWhat about you, brat? Did you enjoy yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru twitched in Kiba\u2019s hand. His youthful face had turned pale and his clothes were soaked. He mumbled a reply to Kiba\u2019s question, but it was unclear as to what he said\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, should we get started on your feet?\u201d Naruto asked, making both Konohamaru and Sasuke cringe. Kiba stood up and looked down at his own bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yours! They\u2019re not as sweaty as mine, but why not give them a good massage?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026alrighty then! They\u2019re nothing like your feet, so I don\u2019t think we need to worry about our slaves drowning in sweat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooo\u2026\u201d Konohamaru and Sasuke whined together, their disgust left unheard by the giant duo.  </span></div></div>",

Naruto just went near them and caught both of them. \"Haha. You smell like my feet now.\" Naruto chuckled. \"Very funny...YOU IDIOT!\" Sasuke screamed up. \"What's this? You want to die like a cockroach?\" Naruto asked. Sasuke just frowned an turned his head in the other way. Naruto went near the bed, and Kiba hopped his feet on the bed, wiggling his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're ready to service me, my little slaves.\" Kiba said as he rubbed his foot against his other one. \"Forget it! Fire Sty-\" Sasuke couldn't finish as he dropped to his knees. Being soaked in Naruto's foot sweat had really taken it's toll on him, and he couldn't recollect his powers back. \"Damn it.\" He muttered. \"Kiba please! We're tired! Don't make us do this!\" Konohamaru begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you really are useless! I guess I'll have to do this myself.\" Kiba said as he reached for Konohamaru. Konohamaru tried to run, but Naruto was on the other side, grinning down at him. Just as he turned around back to Kiba, Kiba had already captured him. He hoisted his foot, and without any warning slammed Konohamaru onto his dirty sole. Naruto grabbed Sasuke and prepared to return the favor Kiba did for him. Naruto began to massage Kiba's heels with the tiny Sasuke, who was just wiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for the toes, brat.\" Kiba said as he scrubbed between his toes with the Tiny Konohamaru. Konohamaru began to choke on the dirt. Naruto's feet had almost made him faint, but now Kiba's were going to finish him. On the other foot, Naruto also scrubbed with Sasuke between Kiba's toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, man. That felt so great. We should do this again\" Kiba chuckled. Naruto just looked at Konohamaru and Sasuke. They were all dirty, especially Sasuke. Sasuke was barely breathing. Bits of Naruto's toe jam were still on Sasuke's hair and arms. \"Naruto, I want more people to service my feet! And I want to crush someone! I say we go over to the Training Field and take care of Shikamaru and the others.\" Kiba suggested with a grin on his face. \"Yeah. I feel like crushing some ninja under my feet too.\" Naruto grinned evilly as he wiggled his toes. Kiba wanted to tell Naruto about his boner, but he didn't want Naruto to know. He was really feeling turned on by what Naruto was doing though. \"Man...when you torture someone with your feet, you're pretty hot.\" Kiba quietly said. \"Hm? Did you say something? I heard \"Hot\"?\" Naruto asked. \"Oh, yeah. I was just saying that it was really hot in here.\" Kiba said. Naruto reached for the growing and the shrinking scrolls and grinned. He, together with Kiba were planning to shrink Shikamaru and the others and to crush them...literally. \"Hey, Naruto. Give me the scrolls. I have a safe place to hide them.\" Kiba demanded. Naruto just nodded and gave the scrolls to Kiba. Kiba grabbed the tiny Sasuke and the tiny Konohamaru and placed them inside his pockets. \"Why are you putting them there?\" Naruto asked puzzled. \" I just thought that they should rest a little. Servicing our feet, especially yours made them really tired.\" Kiba explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After we take care of Shikamaru and the others, we'll go back here in your house so we could resume the fun.\" Kiba said. \"Yeah...I guess you're right.\" Naruto said with a quiet tone as he slipped on his sandals. Kiba just reached for the shrinking scroll and bam! \"Shrinking Jutsu!\" He yelled. Naruto turned back and noticed how Kiba was quickly towering over him. In just a matter of seconds, Naruto was as tall as Kiba's toenail. After he did this, Kiba just put the scroll back in his pocket. \"KIBA! YOU DOUBLE-CROSSER!\" Naruto screamed up at Kiba, angrily. \"Hey, cool it down Naruto.\" Kiba said. \"WHY WOULD I?! WHY DID YOU SHRINK ME!?!?\" Naruto screamed. \" I just wanted you at this size. Don't worry. I'll put you in my other pocket. I just wanted you like so, incase you decided to shrink me.\" Kiba said. \"I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT!!! GROW ME BACK!\" Naruto hissed. \"You shouldn't worry about that either. I'll grow you back the second we arrive at the training field, so we could have some fun. Until then however, you're gonna be this size.\" Kiba said. \"I'VE HAD IT! AAAAH!\" Naruto said as he charged toward his bed. Focusing chakra on his feet, he climbed it and jumped off, high in the air and he reached Kiba's face. \"Man, what are you...?!\" Kiba began to ask, as Naruto screamed in attack. \"SMELL THIS! Ha!\" Naruto grinned as he farted straight in Kiba's face, like he did in the Chunnin Exams. After farting, he set himself on his bed, watching Kiba squirm around the house. \"OOOOHH! Disgusting! Ahhh!\" Kiba said said as he wiggled around the hose, rolling on the floor from the smell, holding his nose. \"Ha! No one can beat the Great Naruto Uzumaki!\" Naruto proclaimed himself proudly. Kiba had recovered from the smell, as he stood up. It wasn't as bad as the Chunnin Exams as Naruto was tiny and so was his fart. Naruto began to sprint away, and tried to hide under his bed, but he failed as the Giant Kiba grabbed him. \"Damn!\" Naruto cursed. \"What was that all about, you moron?!\" Kiba shouted spit as he talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you that I would return you back!\" Kiba said as he slipped on both his sandals. \"So how should I punish you now...hmm.\" Kiba pondered. \"Let me go, Kibaaaaaaa!!!\" Naruto screamed, tryng to break Kiba's grasp. \"I know!\" Kiba lit up. \"You used me and Konohamaru as insoles when I was tiny too, right? You even used me 3 times! So I wonder...what would it be if I used you as my insole too. I bet it feels really comfy...well for me, anyways.\" Kiba chuckled. \"Kibaaa! If you don't let me go, I'm gonna BEAT YOU TO A PULP!\" Naruto thretened. \"Hehehehehehehehehe...I'll make sure that your face is facing my sole! Like it was when I was tiny. I'll return you back to normal when we arrive, but you'll be my Great Uzumaki insole on the way to there. I wonder if I can buy tiny Naruto's like you to use as my insole...\" Kiba mockingly pondered. \"Kibaaa!! Just you wait! I'm going to get it back at you!\" Naruto thretened. \"It's time for you to smell something too.\" Kiba grinned evilly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba smirked at the tiny Naruto in his hand. The fox boy was having so much fun being the big one\u2026suddenly becoming a bug didn\u2019t amuse him very much. It was fun watching him scream his head off and squirm in his grip. After awhile Kiba decided he better get going and casually stepped out of his right sandal. Before Naruto knew it he was lowered onto the sandal and dropped onto the wet insole of the sandal. The orange ninja stood up and glared up at his giant friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKiba, I\u2019m warning you! Turn me back to normal or else I\u2019ll KILL YOU!\u201d Naruto screamed as he shook his fists at Kiba. The dog ninja got a good laugh at the tiny boy before hovering his foot above him, shutting him up for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Naruto. We\u2019re friends now, remember? I\u2019m just going to keep you under my foot until you calm down. Okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Not okay!\u201d Naruto shouted just as he was about to perform a Shadow Clone jutsu. Before he could utter the jutsu, Kiba brought his foot down and slipped it into the blue footwear. Naruto\u2019s bug-sized body was pinned under the sole and smushed into the sandal. Kiba sported a cheeky grin as he wiggled his toes and got his foot nice and comfortable in his sandal. Now that Naruto was dealt with, Kiba could focus on what was really important. The Inuzuka clan member strolled out of Naruto\u2019s apartment, loving the feeling of Naruto under his giant foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, what the heck were you doing making everyone else an insole, Naruto?\u201d Kiba asked as he stepped out the apartment. \u201cYou make a great insole yourself!\u201d Kiba walked out to the balcony and sniffed the air. Shikamaru and his comrades\u2019 scents were starting to fade, meaning they\u2019ve probably already left for the Training Ground. Shikamaru had told him to meet there if something went wrong. \u201cHehe, something about to go wrong\u2026for you, Shikamaru!\u201d Kiba laughed before jumping off of the apartment building and hopping from building to building. Each time his foot touched down on a solid surface it would press Naruto deeper into his sandal. The fox boy continued to yell at Kiba\u2026and that\u2019s all he could do. His arms and legs were pinned under the smelly foot, so all he could do was yell and get sweat in the mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba eventually make it over the walls of the village and ran into the woods. He hopped from tree branch to tree branch, sniffing the air so he could track the scent of his prey. Inside his pockets, Konohamaru and Sasuke were weakly holding on as they endured the bumpy ride. Both of them were weak from being used as human sweat rags and on the verge of passing out. Inside Kiba\u2019s sandal, Naruto was also becoming weak from the stench of other dog ninja\u2019s sole. Kiba glanced down when he noticed Naruto had stopped his shouting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better. Now just sit back; we almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the Training Ground\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru and the two chunin were resting by three wooden poles. This was the same location Team 7 had their first lesson with Kakashi. Shikamaru looked relaxed like always, but his two comrades looked pretty nervous\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShikamaru, why did we retreat?\u201d one of the chunin asked. His name was Akai and he had red, messy hair similar to Naruto\u2019s hair. His headband, however, was tied around his arm instead of his head. \u201cIt\u2019s almost sunset; we could sneak in there while Naruto\u2019s asleep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s right, Shikamaru.\u201d the other chunin added. This one\u2019s name was Honda and he had dark brown hair which drooped down in the back. \u201cWe should steal that shrinking scroll and use it on him before he can use it on us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you; it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d Shikamaru stated. \u201cThat Naruto may be loud and obnoxious, but he can be sneaky now and again too. I don\u2019t want to be sneaked up on and turned into a bug\u2026that\u2019s be troublesome.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about Kiba? Don\u2019t you think we should save him?\u201d Akai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. We failed to subdue Naruto, so it\u2019s our fault he went in there and\u2026never came out again.\u201d Honda muttered, turning away in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but there\u2019s nothing we can do. He\u2019s probably been shrunk and enslaved by Naruto. Although, with that injured arm of his, Naruto may of decided he was too useless to keep around and\u2026\u201d Shikamaru trailed off and sighed. \u201cLet\u2019s start getting ready. We have to report back to the Hokage that Naruto\u2019s not a giant anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Shikamaru finished his conversation, Kiba arrived near the clearing and hid behind some trees. He looked over at the three ninja and grinned toothily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, time to get started!\u201d Kiba exclaimed in a whisper as he removed his feet from his sandals. He looked down at the shrunken Naruto, who weakly sat up and looked up at Kiba. \u201cCalmed down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026yeah, whatever.\u201d Naruto replied, looking away from the giant. \u201cJust turn me back to normal and NEVER do this again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, we\u2019re even now.\u201d Kiba replied as he took out the growing scroll and pointed at Naruto. \u201cGrowing Jutsu!\u201d Naruto felt the chakra surge through him as he quickly grew back to normal. He stood back up and grinned, happy to have his normal size back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow give me those scrolls!\u201d Naruto demanded. \u201cThey belong to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026tell you what, I\u2019ll give you the shrinking one. I\u2019ll hold onto the growing one.\u201d Kiba said as he handed Naruto the shrinking scroll. The blond boy sighed and accepted the deal. Once both genin were ready, they peeked over at the unexpecting trio with grins on their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do we do this? There\u2019s three of them and two of us; one of us gets to crush one more bug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst come, first serve I guess\u2026\u201d Kiba said, not really caring who he squished, just as long as he got to squish somebody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, alright\u2026\u201d Naruto grinned and cracked his knuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s ninja crushin\u2019 time!\u201d</span></div></div>",

I'm really tired. Besides, just because we're sand ninja doesn't mean that you can keep us waiting for ever.\" Akai explained. \"Fine, fine. Geez...you're both a drag. This whole thing is one big drag. I just wish that I was at home watching the clouds instead of dealing with an over-sized Naruto.\" Shikamaru said.

Suddenly, all three shrank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned as he approached them. Shikamaru's, Honda's and Akai's jaws fell down as they looked up at the enormous Naruto. \"Naruto!

I shrank you.\" Naruto chuckled. \"So you got rid of Kiba?\" Honda asked. \"Hmm...not exactly.\" Naruto pondered as he placed his hand on his chin. \"Not exactly? What are you trying to say?!\" Akai asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon saw Kiba coming from behind Naruto. \"He's trying to say that I joined him!\" Kiba proudly stated. \"You joined him? I thought that you wanted to get revenge on him.\" Shikamaru stated. \"And I did...well, sort of.\" Kiba chuckled. \"Veeeeery funny, Kiba.\" Naruto said with a comical face. \"Well that doesn't matter. I just want to step on one of your friends, Shikamaru. I want to feel them crunch!\" Kiba exclaimed excited. All three of them just cringed when they heard those words. \"Kiba! Come back to your senses! They're people! You'll kill them!\" Shikamaru nervously. \"No way Shikamaru! I want one of them to die under my foot! The other one will die under Naruto's.\" Kiba said. \"And I just picked one.\" Kiba smirked. Both Honda and Akai trembled. They didn't want to die. Not under someone's foot...litterally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want the guy with the long black hair!\" Kiba exclaimed as he cracked his knuckles. Honda's eyes bulged out. \"Kiba don't do it!\" Shikamaru said. Kiba ignored him and took a step to Honda. \"I bet that you never thought that you'd die under someone's foot.\" Kiba grinned as he raised his sandaled foot over Honda. Honda didn't move. He was patrified from fear. He had never thought that despite being a spy that he would die! And Kiba or Naruto didn't even know that! Kiba grinned evilly as he slowly began to lower his sandaled foot on Honda. Akai was speechless as well. \"Kiba, STOP!\" Shikamaru screamed as he began to run toward Honda. \"Oh no you don't!\" Naruto frowned as he grabbed the tiny Shikamaru in his hand. \"UGH!\" Shikamaru tried to break free from Naruto's grip but it was just too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! W-wh-why me?!\" Honda asked trembling. \"I just don't like you.\" Kiba said coldly. With that he lowered his foot on Honda and began to crush him. \"Nghhh...Akkkaaiii...youuu have tooo...theee invassiooonnn...ghaaaa\" Honda couldn't finish as Kiba pressed hard enough and smashed Honda in the ground. He twisted his foot, completely satisfied. When he lifted it, he just saw a red stain mixed with smashed flesh. \"Man! That felt great!\" Kiba said as he chuckled. \"Yeah, I know right?\" Naruto smiled as he dropped Shikamaru back on the ground. But Shikamaru had actually heard what Honda's final words were for Akai. \"Time for red hair to be turned into red stain as well.\" Naruto grinned. \"Naruto! Wait!\" Shikamaru intervened. \"Why should I?\" Naruto asked him. \"I want to ask him something. He may have important info.\" Shikamaru stated as he walked to Akai. \"Info? What are you talking about Shikamaru...?\" Naruto pondered clueless as ever. \"I heard what Honda said to you. What invasion is he talking about?!\" Shikamaru said looking at Akai. \"Tsk...I guess that it's useless to hide it anymore. The minute they shrunk us I knew that we wouldn't manage to see your village DESTROYED!\" Akai said. Shikamaru grabbed him by the chest. \"So you're plotting something!\" Shikamaru said. \"Yes. We are. And I know where they're waiting for the signal. But you know what? I WON'T TELL YOU!\" Akai said. Shikamaru pushed Akai on the ground. \"Naruto, Kiba! You have to take him to the Leaf Information Unit! They'll manage to extract the information out of him.\" Shikamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, maaan. This is ruining our fun!\" Naruto sighed. \"No. He's right Naruto. This puts the whole village in stake. This is serious. Our village might be truly exterminated if they invade!\" Kiba said. \"In that case take Shikamaru and go in my house. Stay there along with Konohamaru, Sasuke and him. DO NOT come out, got it? And give me the growing scroll.\" Naruto demanded. \"What? What are you planning to do?\" Kiba asked. \"I'm going to help the village AND have fun. This is my perfect opportunity.\" Naruto grinned. \"It's not fair! Why do you get to have that fun?!\" Kiba asked. \"It is fair! I want to deal with that tiny army. And you won't be left without any fun. Hello? Why do you think that I'm leaving Shikamaru, Sasuke and Konohamaru with you?! You can make them massage your feet or any of that stuff. They're yours. But give me the growing scroll.\" Naruto demanded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...you're right.\" Kiba pondered as he grabbed Shikamaru from the ground and held him in his hand. Kiba reached for his pocket and gave Naruto the growing scroll. \"Hey Naruto. What about Akai? You have to take him to the Leaf Information Unit so they can extract the information out of him.\" Shikamaru suggested. \"Don't worry. Trust me. I'll do an even better job at getting the info out of him than they would.\" Naruto grinned down evilly at Akai. \"You're probably asking yourself how he'd do that. You should trust ME now. You don't want to know.\" Kiba said as he put Shikamaru in his pocket. \"Well, see ya.\" Kiba said as he took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...crush me if you want. You won't get any info out of me.\" Akai smirked at the blond giant. Naruto just laughed as he took off his sandals and placed them behind him. \"Once you get a whiff of my feet, you'll WISH that I had crushed you.\" Naruto smirked. \"Professionals wouldn't manage. What makes you think that you'd manage to get info? Akai asked. \"If you were normal sized maybe I wouldn't manage to get any info out of you but at your tiny size my foot alone can make you suffocate in stench and you'd be willing to tell me. And then I'll get rid of you. Hehe, just my foot odor can torture you when you're so tiny\" Naruto laughed evilly at the tiny spy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Akai looked up at the towering fox boy with a smirk on his face. He was trying to keep a prideful and brave expression, but in truth he was scared out of his wits. His legs wouldn\u2019t stop shaking after he had seen Honda, his friend, get crushed like that. He didn\u2019t want to die like that\u2026he didn\u2019t become a shinobi for such humiliation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, first question\u2026\u201d Naruto said as he places his hands on his hips and smirked down at the tiny spy. \u201cWhat village are you from? Who\u2019s going to attack Konoha?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you; I\u2019m not giving you any info! Just crush me!\u201d the shrunken teen shouted up at he larger teen. Naruto just sighed and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even going to answer a simple question like that? Alright, suit yourself. Time to begin the interrogation!\u201d Naruto said as he raised his left foot over Akai. The red haired ninja watched as the giant flexed his toes and brought his foot down. Akai tried to perform a jutsu, but Naruto\u2019s foot was faster and he was quickly pinned underneath the bare sole. His face was pushed right into the ball of Naruto\u2019s foot and he was forced to breath nothing but the teen\u2019s smelly foot odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGonna answer my question now?\u201d Naruto asked as he rolled the tiny spy under his foot. Akai was being covered in boy sweat and dirt, but he wasn\u2019t caring about his appearance right now. The smell of Naruto\u2019s bare foot was all he knew at the moment. It was ungodly horrible! Akai could feel the stench literally breaking down his mental wall. He had been taught all about Konoha\u2019s interrogation methods, but he was never told about something like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmmffff!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? What did you say?\u201d Naruto asked a she raised his dripping foot off Akai. The teen was laying on his back; his red beat red and panting like a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sunagakure!\u201d the small bug blurted out. \u201cAs if knowing who we are is going to help you at all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Sand Village?! Gaara\u2019s village? You guys AGAIN?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Us AGAIN! The defeat you Konoha scum handed us the last time will not be forgiven!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I thought Konoha and Suna made up. Didn\u2019t they sign a peace treaty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat just for show! I truth we were waiting for the perfect moment to strike; and your giant incident severely weakened the village! You don\u2019t stand a chance anymore; your village will be crushed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scoffed and flicked Akai with his big toe. \u201cThe only one allowed to crush my village is ME.\u201d Naruto boomed as he stomped toward Akai again. The tiny shinobi was bending over in pain; the little toe flick feeling like a chakra-infused punch to him. He didn\u2019t have much time to recover, however, and Naruto soon stomped down on him again. The red haired boy was pinned against the ground once more; this time his face buried into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one other question: Where\u2019s this puny arm waiting for the signal?\u201d Naruto asked a he moved Akai around under his foot. He positioned the tiny teen in a way so his face was poking out between his big and index toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! I\u2019ll never tell you THAT!\u201d Akai shouted. Naruto just sighed and started applying pressure to the boy\u2019s head with his toes. Akai screamed in pain as he his head was forced into a pocket of cheesy toe jam. Naruto ignored his enemy\u2019s plea and just gazed up at the sky. Stars were starting to become visible; it\u2019d be night soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, I don\u2019t feel like searching around all night for a stupid army to crush!\u201d Naruto glared down at Akai with his blue eyes. \u201cJust tell me where they are! It\u2019ll save me a lot of time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026never\u2026\u201d Akai weakly said as Naruto put more pressure on his body. The smell was hellish, and so was the pressure. Akai couldn\u2019t believe this is how it was going to end; crushed under the foot of an enemy ninja\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you credit; you sure are dedicated to your mission. Just give it up already, though! Your mission\u2019s already failed; I\u2019m going to find that army and destroy them all whether or not you tell me where they are! You\u2019re going to be taken care of no matter what you say either; so just do me a favor and make this easier for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Go to hell\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSigh\u2026looks like my foot isn\u2019t smelly enough to get that info out of you. Let\u2019s try one last thing\u2026\u201d The orange ninja took the growing scroll out of his pocket and preformed a few handsigns. \u201cGrowing Jutsu!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt a serge of energy course through his body as the jutsu started to take effect. His body began to expand, but Naruto kept the flow of chakra to a steady amount, allowing his body to grow at a much slower rate than normal. Akai trembled fearfully as the foot he was under grew bigger and bigger. Peeking through the toes, Akai could see the smirking Naruto rising higher and higher above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast chance, red hair. Since I\u2019m just a nice guy, I\u2019ll forgive your disobedience and spare you from my feet if you answer my question. If you take too long though, you get smashed under my godly foot!\u201d Naruto laughed as he wiggled his toes, the growing digits making booming sounds as they hit the ground. \u201cHurry up, spy. You\u2019re starting to get hard to see!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can\u2019t\u2026I won\u2019t betray the village!</i> Akai thought as he watched Naruto become even bigger to him. His eyes suddenly widened as he noticed it wasn\u2019t just Naruto\u2019s size that was growing, but also his foot stink! The smell was becoming stronger and more toxic with each inch Naruto grew. Foam started to appear around Akai\u2019s mouth and his eyes rolled into the back of his head. <i>The smell\u2026I can\u2019t\u2026I can\u2019t take it! But\u2026I\u2026I have to! I can\u2019t\u2026submit\u2026just a few more seconds and it\u2019ll all be\u2026over.</i></span></div></div>",

Both were increasing as Naruto grew taller and taller. \"H-he...he's near th-the-e Konohaaa F-fore-\" Akai couldn't finish as the foot was too big and it just stepped on him and crunched him beneath. \"What did you say? Konoha Forest?\" Naruto asked as he removed his foot. Instead of seeing Akai however, all he saw was a red stain where the red haired ninja was. \"Oops. I didn't mean to smash him...well, not now.\" Naruto sighed. \"At least he was dedicated to his mission...but in the end he betrayed them. Well...you'll betray anyone when Naruto-sama tortures you.\" Naruto giggled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Near the Hidden Leaf forest, huh. The forest is huge! Even if I grow myself huge it'd take some time. Gaaaah! I don't have the time now!\" Naruto sulked. It was getting dark. He'd have to crush the army tommorow. Naruto shrank himself back to his normal size so he wouldn't be noticed. He looked around as he found his sandals and put them on. \"Sighh...I'm so tired. I can't wait till I get home. Ghehee...I have Sasuke to comfort me.\" Naruto grinned as he couldn't wait to continue playing with Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto put his arms behind his head as he began to walk towards his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at his house, Kiba was ordering the tiny Shikamaru, Sasuke and Konohamaru around. He was on Naruto's bed streching.\" The three shrunken ninja just glared at him. \"Man...I'm hungry.\" Kiba sighed pating his belly. \"And I want some MEAT! Hey Sasuke, do you think you have enough?\" Kiba said as he licked his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you eat the thing between your legs?!\" Sasuke remarked with a smirk. \"Hey! That's not the way to talk in your postion. I can do WHATEVER I want with you. So watch your tongue!\" Kiba said as he slightly rose up. \"Hey Sasuke. We don't want him to be angry at us. He's right. He can do absolutely ANYTHING with us.\" Shikamaru pointed out scratching the back of his head. \"Tsk...\" Sasuke turned back. \"Well, I'm glad that at least one of you is sensible.\" Kiba said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm baaaaaack!\" Naruto cheered up, screaming. \"UGh!\" Kiba said as he held his ears. \"Not so loud you idiot! I can hear you!\" Kiba hissed at the blond. \"I'm in my house, dog breath. Don't forget that. Just because I let you stay here, doesn't mean that you can boss me around as well.\" Naruto said. He looked at Kiba, who was in his bed with Sasuke, Shikamaru and Konohamaru beside him. \"I see that you're...already...feeling at home, huh?\" Naruto said raising an eyebrow. \"Yep.\" Kiba plainly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened with Akai? Is he dead? Did you interrogate him?\" Shikamaru asked. Naruto giggled. \"Yeah...I interrogated him. Turned out he was really persistent. I had to use...final resorts.\" Naruto said still giggling quietly. \"What do mean by that?\" Shikamaru responded. \"What matters is that I got the info out of him. I stepped on him before he could finish his sentance though. I didn't mean to do that...yet.\" Naruto explained. \"So you killed him, huh?\" Shikamaru asked. \"He was a spy! He didn't even stay loyal to his village by telling me the info. He deserved what he got.\" Naruto pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I think it's about time I go back to my house as well.\" Kiba said as rised up from the bed streching. The shrunken boys just got out of the way as he started to put his feet down of the floor. Kiba put his sandals on and stood up from the bed. \"You're not taking any of them though!\" Naruto quickly said. \"Relax. Even if I wanted to, I can't. If Hana or Mom find them, I'll be in trouble.\" Kiba said. \"Oh yeah. You live with your sister and mother.\" Naruto said. \"Uh...yeah. I do. At least you're lucky. You're all alone, and you get to do whatever you want.\" Kiba said. \"Don't say that, Kiba. You don't know what it is to be without any parents.\" Naruto said as he turned his head down. \"Well gotta go. Sis is gonna nag with me if I don't return in time...and mom's gonna be angry.\" Kiba said as he shivered. \"K-Kiba! Wait! I want to go with you!\" Konohamaru stood up bravely looking at Kiba. Both Kiba and Naruto looked surprised. \"Sorry kid, but as much as I want to take you, I can't. Like I said, I can't allow anyone to find you, and that would be hard to do in my house.\" Kiba said as he closed the door behind him. \"B-but...\" Konohamaru looked down as Kiba already made his way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying to imply that you don't want to be with me?!\" Naruto crossed his hands as he walked towards his bed. \"Uhm...I...I...\" Konohamaru stammered. \"I think you lied to me about wanting to be close to me Konohamaru. Looks I'll have to punish you somehow during the night.\" Naruto said as he frowned down at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'm feeling pretty tired. Not to mention that my feet are really, REALLY sore. Someone will have to give me a nice good foot rub.\" Naruto said as he propped his feet on his bed along with himself. All three boys cringed at the thought of nearing Naruto's feet. No one wanted to be close to them. Naruto took a whiff of his jumpsuit and noticed that it stinked a lot. He took a whiff of his toes as well, and made a disgusted face. \"Ugh...looks like I'll need to take a bath first.\" Naruto said as he began to remove his jumpsuit. The three boys sighed in relief. Naruto pulled off his jumpsuit as well as his pants and placed them on the bed. He removed his headband as well, revealing his spiky blond hair. Having only boxers, Naruto stripped himself from them too. \"Oh, God. Don't you have ANY privacy Naruto?!\" Shikamaru said as he turned away having seen Naruto's member. Naruto just ignored the remark and went inside his bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke looked at himself and noticed that he was really dirty. He took no time as he stripped himself off of them, having only his boxers on. \"What are you doing?\" Konohamaru asked. \"I reek! I need a bath as well! That loser won't be the only one getting one.\" Sasuke said as he made his way to slip from under the door. \"Shouldn't we go there too?\" Konohamaru asked Shikamaru. \"No way. I'm not going in with Naruto.\" Shikamaru sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned on the water as he began to wash himself. Sasuke entered, hoping that Naruto doesn't notice him and began to wash as well with his boxers still on. He had no idea that the clone he had, had did the exact same thing. A precise clone of Sasuke indeed. Just as he began to wash himself, a hand grabbed him. Naruto had already noticed his tiny shower mate. \"Well, well. You're right on time Sasuke. I'm afraid that I don't have any soap, but you'll do just nicely.\" Naruto grinned toothily. Sasuke watched as he noticed Naruto's feet and above them, Naruto's member that was getting hard. He just shivered at the thought of making contact with any of them at his size. \"No way you dope! Let me go!\" Sasuke said as he began to wiggle in Naruto's hand. \"Hmm...\" Naruto pondered as he looked at Sasuke's tiny body. Naruto's member was getting harder and harder with Naruto just thinking about washing his body with Sasuke's body...his REAL body. \"Yep. You'll do just fine for the job.\" Naruto smiled in delight.</span></div></div>",

Naruto just tightened his fist a bit more, suppressing the Uchiha\u2019s struggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, your clone did the same exact thing. I had a feeling you\u2019d be like him, that\u2019s why I\u2019m not surprised!\u201d Naruto explained with a grin. His smug face only served t fuel Sasuke\u2019s anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop comparing me to that weak clone! I\u2019m nothing like him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, I think you are.\u201d Naruto replied as he poked Sasuke with his giant finger. \u201cYou both jumped into the shower with me because you both couldn\u2019t stay away from me, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke\u2019s face turned bright red as Naruto said this. \u201cW-What are you talking about, dope?! It\u2019s not like that at all! I hate you for humiliating me! I despise you! If you were the one shrunken, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to crush you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah, keep hiding your feelings, jerk. You\u2019re way to small for me anyway!\u201d Naruto laughed as he stroked his hardened dick; the member bigger than Sasuke! \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though. I\u2019m touched you want to be closer to your master\u2019s body. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to give you the full tour!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better not bring me anywhere near your-\u201d Sasuke started to say, but was cut off when Naruto slammed him against the left side of his chest. The giant blond hummed as he rubbed Sasuke over his chest, dragging the boy\u2019s body wherever he wished. Since Naruto didn\u2019t have any soap to lather Sasuke up with, the small ninja could only absorb all the dirt and grime into his own body. He didn\u2019t do a very good job at making Naruto squeaky clean, but the blond didn\u2019t care. He would probably get all sweaty again tomorrow morning anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke heard Naruto moan as he passed over the teen\u2019s nipples. He was soon lowered down a bit and dragged over the bumps of Naruto\u2019s developing stomach. Once Naruto had used the shrunken Sasuke to wipe off most of his torso, he bent down and started dragging him over his thighs. Naruto\u2019s legs were pretty muscular thanks to all the running and tree leaping he did. He moved his ninja soap down to his knees and started rubbing over them. Sasuke\u2019s eyes went wide as he saw the dope\u2019s feet quickly approaching. He had already been rubbed over those smelly, disgusting things\u2026it couldn\u2019t happen again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it could. Naruto balanced himself on one foot and started scrubbing his sole with Sasuke. The tiny rival choked and coughed as his face was pushed into the wet flesh. The boy was pretty much limp in Naruto\u2019s hand as he scrubbed the other foot. Even with the feet finished, Sasuke\u2019s torture wasn\u2019t over. Naruto brought him behind his back and slapped him against his butt cheek. He giggled like a child as he rubbed Sasuke over his bubble butt. The emo boy was lucky he wasn\u2019t used to clean out his hole, instead being brought to the front and placed upon Naruto\u2019s erect penis. Sasuke gasped in shock as he sat on the large member. He looked up at Naruto in utter fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Get me off this thing, dope! I don\u2019t want to be on your dick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie, you bug. You love my giant junk, don\u2019tcha!\u201d Naruto chuckled as he slowly brought his hand to his member. Sasuke could only scream before he was overtaken by the giant teen\u2019s hand and pushed up against the hard dick. Naruto moaned out loud as he stroked his cock, feeling the tiny Sasuke squirm underneath his palm. He dragged Sasuke all over his wet dick; both using him to clean and to pleasure himself. His moans filled his house and were almost booming to the tiny Sasuke. He gritted his teeth and groaned at the sounds Naruto was making at his expense. Konohamaru and Shikamaru could hear Naruto\u2019s moaning from their positions and cringed as they imaged what was happening to Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the wetness and Sasuke\u2019s squirming, it wasn\u2019t long before Naruto climaxed. He pointed his erection at his palm and shot his load into it, drenching Sasuke in his seed. The giant, naked blond licked his lips and sighed before holding his hand under the shower, washing it off along with Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was good\u2026I needed that.\u201d Naruto mumbled as he stroked his limp dick a few more times. Sasuke was completely spent in Naruto\u2019s hand; soaked to the bone and drained of all energy. The little guy probably won\u2019t be offering him any more amusement tonight. Naruto turned off the shower and shrugged before stepping out and drying himself off with a towel. With the towel in his hair, the young giant stepped out of the bathroom and made his way into the bedroom where the other two slaves were waiting. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shikamaru and Konohamaru just stared as they saw Naruto coming out of the bathroom with a unconcious Sasuke in his hand. He placed Sasuke next to them, removed the towel and started to put on his boxers and above them, his pijamas.<br>\r\nAfter putting them on, Naruto streched his arms in the air, yawning. He layed on his bed with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that I don't need a foot rub...or at least for now.\" Naruto said while looking at his tiny slaves. They just sighed in relief. Konohamaru looked at the unconscious Sasuke and noticed that there was some kind of white liquid left on Sasuke's hair. \"Hey, Shikamaru. What is that thing in Sasuke's hair?\" The young boy asked. Shikamaru just looked at Sasuke's hair and noticed that it was Naruto's cum. \"Oh God...what has Naruto done to him...\" Shikamaru cringed as he realized. \"Why? What is that?\" Konohamaru still asked not knowing what it was. Shikamaru looked in the opposite direction, blushing because of the awakward moment. \"Uh...well...it's Naruto's...uhhhhh...ummm...man....juice.\" Shikamaru said stammering. \"Man juice? What exactly is it?\" Konohamaru still asked. \"Geez...I'm not supposed to tell you. You're better off not knowing anyway.\" Shikamaru sighed. \"Oh come on! I really wanna know!!!\" Konohamaru sulked. Naruto heard his last sentance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to know something?\" Naruto asked the tiny kid. \"Y-yeah...I was just wondering what that white stuff left in Sasuke's hair is.\" Konohamaru quietly said. Naruto glanced over at Sasuke and saw that his dried cum was left in Sasuke's hair. He grinned looking back at Konohamaru. \"Well, I needed to punish you somehow for wanting to go with Kiba. I think that I'll show just what exactly it is...first hand.\" Naruto grinned as he grabbed Konohamaru and layed him on his bed, between his legs. \"I don't think that's a punishment leader! But thanks if you're going to show me!\" Konohamaru jumped in joy, not knowing that it wasn't going to be very pleasent for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had already came, but he was in the mood for a second setion. He put his hand in his boxers and pulled out his gigantic manhood. Konohamaru just stared as he saw how big Naruto's manhood was. \"Uh...leader...what are you doing?\" Konohamaru asked as he backed away. \"What? You want to know what that white stuff was right? I'll be more than happy to show you.\" Naruto grinned as he began to slowly jack off. He began to moan as he made a circle with his legs, trapping Konohamaru at the center and making sure that when he climaxed that his cum would fall right on Konohamaru. Konohamaru looked in the other side, not wanting to see Naruto's privates. He had already seen them when Naruto was giant, but he didn't know about the cum. Naruto stroke his dick even faster as he began to get harder and harder. He looked over at Sasuke's tiny body and imagined how he would smash him under his giant dick or how he would make him massage his feet or service him. These thoughts drove Naruto over the edge. Naruto let out a loud moan as he pointed his cock straight at Konohamaru and shooted all of his load upon the tiny boy and the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Konohamaru it was like a sea felt on him. He was almost drowned when the sticky white liquid engulfed him. Naruto just let his legs loose, freeing Konohamaru and layed his head on the bed, panting. He quickly looked at Konohamaru, and noticed how the puny boy was covered from head to toe in his seed. \" And that Konohamaru is the white stuff you saw on Sasuke. It's called cum. I hope I answered your question.\" Naruto giggled. Konohamaru barely stood up as he was covered in sperm. \"Ewww...I had no idea this was it.\" Konohamaru said disgusted. \"You better clean the cum left on the bed...with you tongue! If you don't, you'll spend some time inside my sandal tommorow.\" Naruto said as he grinned. Konohamaru definitely didn't want that, but with much disgust he began to lick all the sperm left on the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around 40 minutes, Konohamaru had finaly licked all of the sticky stuff from the bed. He felt like he was going to puke. \"And that was your punishment Konohamaru. You want to be with me, right?\" Naruto asked with a glee in his eye. \"Ofcourse leader! I want to be only with you!\" Konohamaru quickly responded, realizing his mistake in saying that he wanted to be with someone else. \"Good.\" Naruto muttered as he placed him back next to Shikamaru and the unconsious Sasuke. Shikamaru was covering his eyes the whole time, not wanting to see any of the stuff. \"Hey leader. Aren't you going to wash me off this stuff?\" Konohamaru asked. \"You want a wash off? Why didn't you say so?\" Naruto grinned as he licked his lips. \"Uh...on second though. I'd be fine like that.\" Konohamaru said understanding Naruto's imply. \"Good night then.\" Naruto said as he turned off the lights and layed on the bed. Shikamaru and Konohamaru just layed on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*On the morning*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto yawned as he streched up, still looking drowzy. He looked over at his tiny slaves, who were still sleeping but much to his anger, he noticed that Sasuke was gone! He quickly got off his bed, scanning the floor and searching for him. Naruto was panicking, until he noticed the puny Sasuke trying to open the window so he could escape. Naruto grinned as he grabbed Sasuke suddenly. \"Trying to escape, huh?\" He said as he held Sasuke tightly. \"Oh come on, Sasuke! Do you hate me this much?! You want to escape from me?! I know you have feelings for me!\" Naruto said. \"I don't know what you're talking about, dope.\" Sasuke said bluntly. \"Oh yes, you do! Stop lieing!\" Naruto said. \"Pff...even if I did confess such an absurd thing, what would be of you?\" Sasuke asked as he slightly blushed. \"Oh, nothing. I just don't want anyone to lie to me. So tell me the truth, or I'll MAKE you tell it to me.\" Naruto threatened. \"Forget it. I won't tell you that, because I don't feel that way.\" Sasuke said. \"So you still insist, huh?\" Naruto asked. Sasuke remained silent. Naruto frowned as he placed the tiny Sasuke on his bed. He grinned evilly as he started to reach for something under his bed. He pulled out a tape. \"While you consider whether you want to tell me or not, I'm planning on actually using your body for something good.\" Naruto said, grinning. \"Uh...what are you doing, Naruto?\" Sasuke asked as Naruto grabbed him and lowered him to his sole. He pushed Sasuke's body into it. His face was placed facing Naruto's sole, and his legs were reaching to Naruto's arch. \"Ugh...let me go!\" Sasuke said as he plugged his nose from the regular foul smell. Naruto grinned as he taped Sasuke to his right foot. He then hid the tape back under his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget making you an insole. I'm planning on using you as my sandal!\" Naruto grinned as he slipped on his left sandal on his left foot, his right foot having Sasuke as one. He took his first step with his right foot on purpose, as he wanted to see how it felt. Sasuke screamed as the pressure was really bad but the air he breathed was only Naruto's foul foot smell. \"Haha, you feel a lot better than an ordinary sandal. It's kind of...soft. I hope you're enjoying this as much as I am. I think I'll keep you this way for now.\" Naruto chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With his rival now acting as his sandal, Naruto walked out of his room and left his two other slaves sleeping on the floor. Sasuke screamed with each step Naruto took; the giant blond was crushing him into the floor with his superior size and all the weight that came with it. Naruto made his way into the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror. The young ninja stood on his disobedient slave as he started brushing his teeth. Sasuke squirmed and shouted at the giant genin, but Naruto ignored him and spat into the sink. After washing his face Naruto grinned at himself in the mirror and walked back out into the hall. Sasuke was once again pounded underneath his foot with each step. Naruto even forgot it was Sasuke at times; he really felt like an effective sandal! He had to be careful, though. He was probably more fragile than your typical sandal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond teen entered the kitchen and started walking around to prepare his everyday breakfast; some instant ramen and a glass of milk. Sasuke\u2019s screams had become groans at his point as his face and the rest of his body pushed into Naruto\u2019s stinking foot. The boy had just had a shower last night\u2026how could his feet already smell this bad?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026nothing like starting the day with a hot cup of ramen!\u201d Naruto said as he sat down at his kitchen table and watched his ramen boil. Sasuke was given a small break from being stepped on, but his respite wasn\u2019t very good. As he waited Naruto smothered the small Uchiha under his sole and toyed with him using his other foot. Sasuke groaned as he the toes of Naruto\u2019s other foot grip the back of his head and squeeze it tightly. Feeling the massive, odorous digits of his rival humiliate him so effortlessly pissed Sasuke off. His body was too weak, however, and he couldn\u2019t do a thing to free himself from the tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the ramen was ready Naruto took out his chopsticks and started chowing down. Sasuke could hear the disgusting sounds Naruto made as he slurped up the noodles. While the giant was easting, the tiny Sasuke remained stuck to his foot and smothered against the wooden floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto slurped up the last of the ramen a few minutes later, burping loudly. He gulped down his glass of milk before standing up and giving his stomach a few pats. \u201cMmmm\u2026nothing like ramen to fill an empty stomach!\u201d Naruto grinned widely and looked down at his feet. \u201cHaving fun under there, Sasuke?\u201d The fox boy put some more weight on his foot, causing Sasuke immense pain. The small teen\u2019s screams were interrupted by a sudden knock at the door. \u201cHeh\u2026I bet I know who that is!\u201d Naruto smirked and walked over to his front door, tormenting Sasuke more with each step. He opened his front door to be greeted by Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, partner!\u201d Kiba smiled and waved. His arm was no longer in a cast; he had apparently healed overnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, Kiba. Sleep well last night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell no! I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about our little trio of slaves. You should of let me keep one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you didn\u2019t ask.\u201d Naruto replied as he let the dog ninja inside. Kiba headed right to Naruto\u2019s bedroom and found Konohamaru and Shikamaru just waking up on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, little guys!\u201d Kiba grinned as he squatted down to get a closer look at the shrunken duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026hi, Kiba\u2026\u201d Konohamaru replied as he rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. Kiba smiled at the younger boy and suddenly noticed the kid was covered in something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026what happened to you, brat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Um\u2026well\u2026\u201d Konohamaru blushed and turned away. \u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Kiba let it rest there. He had an idea, but he didn\u2019t want to know the full story. He looked for Sasuke next, but couldn\u2019t find the tiny emo anywhere. \u201cEh? Hey, Naruto! Where\u2019s our favorite bug?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, he\u2019s right here.\u201d Naruto said as he walked into his room and showed Kiba the bottom of his foot. Kiba almost broke out into laugher when he saw Sasuke taped to Naruto\u2019s foot like a footpad or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026what did he do to deserve that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTried to escape; what else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? After a day\u2019s worth of torture? That Uchiha pride is really tough\u2026in fact, I think you should just forget about him. Not worth the effort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see\u2026\u201d Naruto muttered as he stepped over to his closet and started looking through his jumpsuits. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to break him one of these days! Sasuke Uchiha will be a sniveling bug at my feet eventually; you can count on it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say\u2026\u201d Kiba sat down on Naruto\u2019s bed and looked down at Shikamaru and Konohamaru. He couldn\u2019t wait to spend the whole day with them\u2026it was gonna be fun! But before that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, when are we going to take care of those Sand ninja? I can\u2019t wait to see the look on their faces when they see a couple of giants stomping toward them!\u201d Kiba grinned toothily, imagining himself the size of a mountain and stomping invaders left and right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Kiba? I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s going to grow. You\u2019re going to stay in the village with the slaves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.excuse me?! What do you mean?! I thought I was going to become a giant too!\u201d Kiba shouted, glaring at Naruto. The fox boy didn\u2019t turn around to face Kiba and instead started unbuttoning his pajama top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get to spend the whole day in the village with them. Sure, you won\u2019t be stomping Sand ninja, but you\u2019ll still have fun!\u201d Naruto grinned widely. \u201cWhy not take them to the hot springs? The last time you were there you were the size of an ant!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto removed his top and laughed at the memory, Kiba continued to glare at his back. Having their slaves to himself did sound fun, but he had been looking forward to showing those Sand invaders their place. Why did Naruto get to have all the fun as a giant?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So just let me be the giant and squash that army!\" Kiba said as he held tight his fist. \"Geez Kiba! Don't you think you're starting to get insolent?! First of all, it was ME who found those scrolls. Second, I could've kept you at tiny size, but look here! Not only do we have fun TOGETHER but I also leave the tinies with you. I could've decided to take 'em!\" Naruto explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You're the one to talk. I used you as an insole! I could've crushed you if I wanted!\" Kiba smirked as he laid himself on Naruto's bed. \"Tough luck. I used you 3 times as an insole. Which means that I could've crushed you 3 times.\" Naruto chuckled, proud of himself. \"Ughh...fine. I guess this better than nothing.\" Kiba sighed. Naruto put on his jumpsuit. \"That army probably won't attack until the evening. It's morning now. I plan on going to get some ramen since I don't have any, and then I'll come back so we can play some more with our tiny bugs. After that, I'll go teach that army a lesson.\" Naruto laughed to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood on one foot, and looked at the sole which Sasuke was facing. \"I hope you don't try to escape again...or else...heh heh.\" Naruto grinned as he saw Sasuke's tortured face. He removed the tape and peeled off Sasuke. He was very tired and almost out of any energy. He held him in his hand as he put on his other sandal in place of Sasuke. \"I'm going to leave all three with you, while I go out to buy some ramen. And I don't want you to do anything to them while I'm out! No crushing, no eating, no anything you can come up with. The only one who can do those things to them IS ME!\" Naruto said as he placed Sasuke next to the other slaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. While you're out for ramen, buy me some as well. I'm really hungry.\" Kiba said as he licked his lips. Naruto just looked at him as he showed him his palm. \"What?\" Kiba asked. \"What do you mean \"What?\"?! Give me the money. If you think that I'll give from my savings because of you, you're about to have the truth coming down on 'ya!\" Naruto said. \"I don't have any now...\" Kiba said. \"No ramen for you then.\" Naruto responded. \"So you'll come here with the ramen infront of my eyes while I can eat NOTHING? Not even them!\" Kiba said as he pointed to the three shrunken boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...when I kind of think about it...I think I have something for you.\" Naruto pondered. \"Oh, yes! Please! I'm really hungry!\" Kiba said as he was already drooling over the thought of what tasty thing the blond was going to give him. Naruto reached for something under his bed and pulled out...a smelly sock. \"I think you'll find something to eat inside it...you know...hehe.\" Naruto laughed as he held the sock. Kiba just had a sweat drop as he backed away. \"NO WAY! &gt;_&lt;'' I'm not even touching that! And is it yours? I've never seen you wearing socks.\" Kiba asked as he plugged his nose from the smell that was coming out of the sock. \"Well, I usually wear them here, in my house, so I guess that's why you haven't seen them before. And yeah...obviously they're mine. I don't wash them though since they get wet and they're uncomfortable to wear after that...so I just leave them like that. Like I said though, you can eat the stuff left from my feet inside it, if you're that hungry.\" Naruto laughed again. \"Ugh...I think I'm going to puke.\" Kiba said as he imagined the horrible picture. \"Y-You know what? I think I lost my appetite.\" Kiba said as he waved with his hand. Naruto chuckled as he put the sock back under his bed. \"Alright. I'll be right back.\" Naruto said as he took both the scrolls and closed the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba streched as he looked on the tinies. \"I'd probably eat one of 'ya, but because of Naruto, I'm not allowed.\" Kiba sighed. \"No Kiba! Please don't eat us!\" Konohamaru begged. \"Uh...he already said that he won't because of Naruto's warning.\" Shikamaru said. \"Yeah...that Naruto. But he's right. He found the scrolls, and he went through the trouble to get them. I'm just someone who gets to have fun as well...so I'll comply with what he says...for now anyways.\" Kiba said. He looked at the tired Sasuke who was just glaring. \"What's the matter Sasuke? Did you enjoy your position as Naruto's sandal?\" Kiba giggled. \"Just shut up...\" Sasuke answered in a angry tone. \"Ughh...I'm really hungry.\" Kiba growled as he rubbed his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know where the sock is.\" Sasuke responded. Kiba glared back at him. \"So you think you're really smart, huh, Uchiha? Since you talk only of his sock, why don't you explore it from inside? I'm sure you'll like it.\" Kiba grinned as he grabbed Sasuke. \"Let me go! I'm NOT going there!\" Sasuke struggled. \"And that's your problem! Your cocky attitude! It has always pissed me off! I bet that Naruto doesn't like it either! Seriously...you're a tiny bug that he can squish underfoot! Aren't you afraid of that? Aren't you afraid that he's going to make you smell his nasty feet as a punishment for your dary doings?\" Kiba asked. \"It's gross, but I won't obey like some scum! And not to that moron!\" Sasuke answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me...I've been in your place. If there's one terrible thing that he has, it's his foot odor! I'm sure you know that already. He broke my spirit and I had to obey. If you don't obey him, he'll just do even worse things to you! Stop acting all high and mighty because you're actually tiny and pathetic right now.\" Kiba said. \"Like I need advices from a person who smells like dogs!\" Sasuke scoffed. \"I see you're impatient to get in the sock.\" Kiba smiled as he pulled it out from under the bed, holding his nose again. \"Good luck!\" Kiba grinned as he dropped Sasuke inside it, and quickly placed the sock back on the floor. Sasuke just wriggled inside from the terrible stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And because you're still cocky, I'll even ask Naruto to put them on when he comes back. The stink inside the sock combined with the stink of his own foot is surely going to break your spirit!\" Kiba grinned as he was eager to see Sasuke's spirit broken. He looked around at Shikamaru and Konohamaru. \"And if you two dare to say something about this, you'll find yourselfs in the sock as well.\" Kiba threatened. Shikamaru and Konohamaru just gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back!\" Naruto said as he entered and closed the door. \"How come you were so fast?!\" Kiba asked amazed. \"I was running.\" Naruto replied as he placed the ramen on his table. \"So that means that your feet are even smellier?\" Kiba asked. \"I think so...why?\" Naruto asked. \"Ah...ahhh...nothing.\" Kiba said but chuckled quietly. \"Would you do me a favour and put on your socks?\" Kiba asked. \"Uhh...why?\" Naruto asked confused. \"Oh...I just wanted to see how you look with them on. Come on! Just for a couple of minutes!\" Kiba said. \"You're being really weird Kiba. But fine...I planned on putting them on anyway. It's been some time since I put them on.\" Naruto said as he slipped off his sandals and pulled out the socks from under the bed. He put on his left sock, which was free, and inserted his foot inside. Naruto wriggled his toes, enjoying the feel. Sasuke was in the other sock. \"Narutoo! Don't do it!\" Sasuke screamed, but to no avail. Kiba mustered a huge grin.</span></div></div>",

Sasuke watched with horror and hopelessness as the giant\u2019s toes appeared in the sock, quickly followed by the rest of that accursed foot. Sasuke had no time to attempt and escape before Naruto\u2019s foot filled up the entire sock; his sole pressing down upon Sasuke and flattening him against the sock. Sasuke groaned in discomfort as Naruto pulled the sock on nice and tight before standing up on it. Poor Sasuke grunted in pain as all of Naruto\u2019s weight came down on him; threatening to crush Sasuke without the giant\u2019s knowledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I forgot how great these felt. Especially the right one.\u201d Naruto said as he repeatedly pressed his right foot into the floor, unknowingly smashing Sasuke underfoot each time. Kiba kept himself from laughing, not wanting Naruto to find Sasuke just yet. The two other shrunken boys kept quiet, not wanting to invoke Kiba\u2019s wrath. They tried to act normal when Naruto looked down at them and the blond didn\u2019t seem to sense that anything was wrong. He scooped Konohamaru and Shikamaru into his hand and looked at Kiba. \u201cSo where\u2019s Sasuke?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSasuke? He\u2019s\u2026in my sandal. Bastard was mouthing off again while you were gone.\u201d Kiba lied, flexing his toes as if Sasuke was underneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you not to do anything with them!\u201d Naruto responded. \u201cIf you can\u2019t even follow a simple instruction like that, maybe I should just shrink you again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey! Easy! I didn\u2019t crush him or anything; stop making a big deal out of it.\u201d Kiba made his way over to the table and smelled the ramen Naruto had brought home. \u201cNow can we just eat? I\u2019m starving!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsk, fine. If he was mouthing off again he doesn\u2019t get any ramen!\u201d Naruto said with a smirk as he walked over to the table, unknowingly stomping Sasuke underfoot each time. Kiba hid a grin as he sat down, knowing Naruto might just crush Sasuke himself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both teens were seated they placed their own bowl of ramen in front of them and started digging in. Naruto may of already had some ramen earlier, but he was always hungry for more! Konohamaru and Shikamaru were placed next to Naruto\u2019s ramen bowl. They were both given a single noodle and a small piece of a dumpling to share. Thanks to their diminished sizes, this was more than what they usually had for breakfast. As for Sasuke, Naruto may not be putting any pressure on him anymore, but that didn\u2019t mean his time in the sock was any more bearable. The rank, sweaty sole continued to push Sasuke into the dingy sock; forcing its odor up the tiny teen\u2019s nostrils. Sasuke tried to squirm and bang against the foot, but Naruto was too busy enjoying his ramen to notice anything. Occasionally Kiba would take a peek under the table and look at Naruto\u2019s socked feet. He could see Sasuke\u2019s impression on the bottom of the sock; squirming weakly in hopes the giant fox boy would notice him. Naruto caught the dog ninja looking under the table a couple times, but just assumed he still had a thing for his feet. It didn\u2019t bother him\u2026his feet WERE pretty sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh, that was good.\u201d Kiba said as he relaxed back in his chair and caressed his stomach. Naruto, just finishing his as well, did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026now that our stomachs are full, lets have some fun with these guys!\u201d Naruto snatched his two shrunken victims up before they could finish eating and carried them back into his room. Sasuke howled in pain as he was once again being pounded into submission under Naruto\u2019s footsteps. Kiba followed him inside and watched as he placed the two on the floor and moved to take off his socks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey, what are you doing?\u201d Kiba asked, stopping Naruto from removing his sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it look like I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m taking these off so I can play with them barefoot! You know they love their master\u2019s feet!\u201d Naruto grinned down at the two, who looked up in fear at the looming giants above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to take those off to torture them, dope! There\u2019s plenty of other thins we could do. I\u2019m sure the smell of those socks are just as bad as your bare feet. When was the last time you washed them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right\u2026well what about Sasuke? Are you going to take him out so he can join in on the fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah\u2026not just yet. He feels really good under their and I think he deserves a little longer. Let\u2019s just use these two; I think Shikamaru\u2019s still new to being our slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re right\u2026\u201d Naruto placed his hands on his hips and grinned down at Shikamaru. \u201cYou\u2019ve been pretty obedient so far, little man, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to go any easier on you! Just ask Konohamaru; you\u2019re in for a rough ride!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guessed as much\u2026\u201d Shikamaru replied, sighing and putting his hands on his pockets. \u201cI saw the way you treated Konohamaru and Sasuke. Guess I\u2019m in for the same deal\u2026what a drag.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He kicked off one of his sandals, and put Konohamaru in the the removed one. Konohamaru was a little relieved. Unlike Naruto's sandals, Kiba's didn't smell so bad. He could actually breathe, without the need of holding his nose. \"Mine may not smell as bad as Naruto's, but there's still some sweat and dirt. I think you already caught on as to what you have to do.\" Kiba suggested. \"You want me to clean them, right?\" He asked. \"Exactly. But with your tongue. Now get to it.\" KIba ordered as he kicked the sandal lightly with his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru cringed a little, but he still prefered this than Naruto's sandal. Without any second thoughts, he started to slowly lick the inside of Kiba's sandal. Kiba watched on while he quietly chuckled to himself as he watched his little slave \"clean\" his sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto grinned as grabbed Shikamaru and placed him on his bed. He put one of his socked feet onto the bed as he sat on it, while his other foot with Sasuke in the sock was hanging down. He moved his socked foot closer to Shikamaru, and smirked as Shikamaru held his nose. \"Ughh...this is going to be such a drag.\" Shikamaru complained. \"Well you better start sniffing my socks, or you'll be under them.\" Naruto grinned. Shikamaru sighed as he got closer to the giant sock. With much regret he took a deep sniff as he inhaled the stink. He backed up a little, but decided that in order to get this over with quickly, that he had to take as much sniffs as he can until Naruto is satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Naruto's sock, Sasuke's face was being pushed deeper into Naruto's sole as he twitched his toes in comfort. \"Grr...hey loser! Get me out of here!!!\" Sasuke screamed as he started to bang on the foot. Kiba turned his head lightly and saw that Sasuke was still banging inside the sock. Kiba was curious as to how bad it was smelling, and he slightly brang his face next to Naruto's sock and took a slight sniff. Naruto noticed this and he giggled. \"Hey Kiba, if you wanted to smell it, you should've just told me.\" Naruto laughed as he moved his foot and placed it right on Kiba's face. Kiba immediately backed off, rolling on the floor in disgust. \"Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Narutoooo!\" Kiba screamed as he still rolled around. \"What? You wanted it.\" Naruto chuckled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru was still taking deep whiffs from Naruto's socks. He was starting to feel sick from this. The smell was just too bad. Shikamaru just collapsed as he fell on the bed tired. \"You did a good job, Shikamaru.\" Naruto said. \"Well we're over this, right?\" Shikamaru asked. \"One last thing. Take a tour on the inside! I'm sure that you'll like it.\" Naruto grinned as he slipped off his sock. He wiggled his toes and took a whiff himself. \"Ugh...the stink from my socks has even gotten to my feet. Oh well...\" Naruto said as he grabbed Shikamaru. \"In you go.\" Naruto smiled as he dropped Shikamaru inside the sock. Shikamaru began to cough from the disgusting smell as his nostrils were full of it. \"Be careful, 'cause here comes my big bad foot!\" Naruto smirked as he twitched his toes again and began to put on the sock. He pulled on his socks and grinned as he felt Shikamaru flattened against his sole. He scrunched his foot a little so Shikamaru could smell the most. \"How's the smell, Shikamaru?\" Naruto laughed. \"Get me out of here!\" was all that Shikamaru could say. \"Hehehehe\" Naruto grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Konohamaru, he was still licking the insides of Kiba's sandal. \"Ugh...\" He sighed as he sat on the sandal, panting. \"So, you're done, huh?\" Kiba asked as he chuckled. Konohamaru just panted. \"Good. I think you deserve a rest now.\" KIba said as he took Konohamaru out, and slipped his sandal back on. \"Yep...feels clean.\" He smirked. \"I'd give you my other one to clean, but you look like you're tired, so we'll do this later.\" Kiba smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled as he took off his sock again, and let Shikamaru out. He saw him, all tired and coughing. \"Man, Naruto! It reeks inside! Ugh!\" Shikamaru said still disgusted. \"Yeah, well...we are talking about MY feet, so the smell would be obvious.\" Naruto chuckled. He grabbed Shikamaru off the bed, and placed him next to Konohamaru. Kiba and Naruto grinned at eachother as they had both got some service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had it! I'm getting out of this dope's sock!\" Sasuke said as he took out one of his kunai. Without any regret he instantly poked Naruto's huge foot with it's sharp edge. \"Ouch!\" Naruto screamed, as he felt something stab him in his sole. He brang the foot onto the bed, and started to take off the sock. \"Hey, no, don't!\" Kiba said. \"Something bit my foot! It's probably a bug, and I'm gonna squash it. No one messes with Naruto Uzumaki!\" Naruto said as he slipped off his sock. Kiba held his nose as the putried smell was unleashed. Nothing was seen to fall from it, but Naruto spotted something between his toes. He scraped it off, and the \"thing\" fell on his bed. Naruto looked carefully at it, and saw that it was none other than Sasuke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke?! I thought he was in your sandal Kiba!\" Naruto frowned as he turned to Kiba. \"Eh heh heh...well, I...\" Kiba muttered. \"I put him in your sock because he pissed me off. I then told you to put them on, on purprose. He got what he deserved.\" Kiba grinned as he saw Sasuke glaring at him angrily. \"It wouldn't have hurt if you actually told me. I would've done it anyway.\" Naruto said as he smirked evilly at Sasuke. A bulge was starting to form in Naruto's pants. He was enjoying making Sasuke smell his feet, especially as he knew how Sasuke hated them. \"My feet feel a little sore. How about you give me a nice good foot massage?\" Naruto grinned as he put Sasuke down on the floor. He took the sock off of his other foot, and threw the pair of socks on the floor. He then placed his other foot infront of Sasuke. \"Haha, I think I'm going to watch this.\" Kiba laughed as he took a seat, as Naruto wiggled his toes. \"No way, loser! They stink!\" Sasuke said as he cringed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point. You can massage them AND smell them.\" Naruto grinned evilly down at Sasuke. \"I will not!\" Sasuke stubbornly disagreed. \"Do it, or I'll flatten you under them!\" Naruto threatened. Naruto's bulge got bigger. Naruto grinned as he was starting to become aroused. He put his hand inside his boxers and started to slowly jerk off at the sight of him, lording over the puny and defenceless Sasuke. Sasuke's disobedience was turning him on even more. He wanted to crush Sasuke's spirit, if not his whole body now. \"C'mon!\" Naruto said as he inched his stinking foot even closer. \"I said, NO! Keep that thing away from me, you hear me!\" Sasuke backed away as Naruto's smelly foot started to tower over him. \"Ohhh, tiny little Sasuke...you're so easy to squish...oh yeahhh\" Naruto moaned as he lifted his stinky gigantic foot over Sasuke, twitching his toes in impatience to step on the tiny Sasuke.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba watches, mouth open, as Naruto looms over Sasuke with his foot hanging above. The look of horror and disgust on the small Uchiha\u2019s face was perfect. The way Naruto seemed lost in the moment, hand in his pants, started arousing Kiba. His brushed his fingers over his own bulge, feeling it twitch behind the fabric of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, Sasuke, can you imagine how humiliating it must be to be squished under my big, bad feet?\u201d Naruto asks as he flexes his toes, looking down onto Sasuke\u2019s eyes with cloudy blue ones. \u201cI almost feel bad for all those ninja I smashed under these. Living their lives\u2026doing their duty\u2026and then just snuffed out under the sole of a kid like me. Do you want to become a stain too, Sasuke?\u201d Naruto brought his giant foot even closer to Sasuke, the fragrant fumes making the raven haired teen dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No\u2026\u201d Sasuke mumbled as he continued backing away from the foot until he tripped over a crack in the foot. He started crawling backwards now, his eyes glued to the sweaty bottom of his former friend\u2019s foot. \u201cGet away from me! You sick bastard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke forced himself back to his feet and tried making an attempt to run away, but turning his back to Naruto was as far as he got. Naruto\u2019s foot slammed into his back and pressed him into the floor. Sasuke cried out as the huge foot of the bigger male weighed down upon him. A moan escaped Naruto\u2019s lips as pinned his weak rival to the floor. He grabbed his erection and took it out of his pants; stroking the meat in clear view. It was at this point that Kiba reached into his own pants and took out his semi-hard dick. He started stroking and pumping it as he stared at Naruto and the power he held over poor, little Sasuke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026Naruto, that\u2019s so hot\u2026\u201d Kiba remarked in a whisper as he jacked off, not sure if Naruto even remembered he was there. Meanwhile, on the floor nearby, Shikamaru and Konohamaru watched the two giants fondle themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerverts\u2026\u201d Shikamaru muttered as he looked away, trying to hide a blush on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201d Konohamaru replied as he looked down at the floor. Occasionally he would take quick glances up at the giants, making sure the older boy next to him didn\u2019t notice. Little did he know\u2026Shikamaru was also stealing a few glances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Sasuke,\u201d Naruto rolled the tiny prodigy onto his back and started gripped his small head with his toes. \u201cPart of me hopes you never submit to me. Your disobedience gets me so aroused\u2026thinking you can stand up to someone as big as me.\u201d Naruto started pressed Sasuke harder into the floor, making it seem like he was going to flatten the tiny teen. \u201cThen again\u2026I also love the idea of you groveling at my feet like a good slave. I suppose I\u2019ll win either way!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba\u2019s eyes were half closed as he panted like a dog. His tongue was drooping out of his mouth and sweat covered his face. He couldn\u2019t control himself\u2026there was just something about Naruto being so dominate that turned him on. The fact that Sasuke was the one who was being dominated helped too\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shinobi masturbated for several more minutes. Sasuke\u2019s struggles got weaker under Naruto\u2019s foot as he was smothered into submission. Kiba was the first to reach his climax. The dog ninja howled softly and collapsed back on the bed as his cock twitched and shot his load all over him. Naruto, who had more stamina than the average ninja, lasted a bit longer until he came all over his foot. His bare foot was covered in white strings of semen and some got between his toes where Sasuke\u2019s face was. When he was done Naruto tucked his flaccid penis back into his boxers and covered the Uchiha\u2019s face with his sole. He smirked evilly as he smeared the white stuff over his rival\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a sad sight\u2026\u201d Naruto mumbled as he took his foot off the shrunken boy and stood there, towering over him with his hands tucked into his pockets. Sasuke was curled into a ball below him, shivering and covered in sweat and cum. Naruto didn\u2019t feel any pity for the smaller teen; only content for what he had reduced the cocky Uchiha to. </span></div></div>",

We could have another session when I get back.\" Naruto said as he laughed. \"Hey, Naruto...\" Kiba said as he slightly blushed. \"What?\" Naruto asked as he turned to face him. \"I-I was thinking...if...uhm...I...if...\" Kiba said stammering unable to finish. \"Man, what's gotten into you? Is there something you want to say?\" Naruto asked as he neared Kiba. \"Well...uh...I-I...y-your...uh...\" Kiba stammered still not being able to express his thoughts. \"Don't tell me it's you Hinata. You transformed into Kiba, didn't you?!\" Naruto asked as he started to pull Kiba's cheek. \"It's not Hinata you idiot!\" Kiba said loudly as he slapped Naruto's hand off of his cheek. \"Listen Kiba! If you want to say something go ahead! I don't have a lot of time though, because I can see that army coming.\" Naruto said as he looked through the window. \"Wait a second! You want to be the giant to stomp 'em, don't you?!\" Naruto asked as he realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we already got ourselves a deal about that. I-I wanted to ask you something...but it's awkward for me.\" Kiba said. \" I'll say this again. If you want to tell me something, then do it already!\" Naruto said as he stomped his barefoot onto the floor, slightly shaking Sasuke. Kiba sighed and took a deep breath. \"W-well...if I was shrunk again, w-w-wh-what would y-you do t-t-to me?\" Kiba said as a big blush appeared on his face. He didn't like it before, but he wanted Naruto to torture him now. \"Well, pretty much the same when I shrank you before.\" Naruto said as he grinned. \"Oh, okay.\" Kiba said calmly. \"Alright. I'll be leaving now. It's time I taught that army a lesson or two. Maybe I could even go to the Hidden Sand. At a giant size, I'll get there for about 10-20 minutes.\" Naruto said as he giggled. \"Can you give me the shrinking scroll? You only need the growing scroll, so you wouldn't need that.\" Kiba said as he asked for the scroll. \"Hmm...you have a point. Fine.\" Naruto said as he reached into his pockets and gave Kiba the scroll. \"Thanks. And...uh...enjoy your rampaging.\" Kiba said. Naruto waved with his hand as he opened the door, when Kiba noticed that Naruto didn't take his rank sandals. \"Hey, Naruto. You forgot your sandals!\" Kiba said. \"I didn't forget them. I'll leave them here. I want to smash that army with my bare feet. Same for the Hidden Sand too.\" Naruto said as he giggled and closed the door. Kiba chuckled as he looked at Sasuke, Shikamaru and Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you stupid, Kiba? We could somehow get the shrinking scroll and shrink you too.\" Shikamaru said as he sighed. \"So what? It's not like you'll be able to regrow yourselfs. The growing scroll can do that and it's with Naruto. Even if you shrink me, you won't get anything good out of that.\" Kiba said with a smile. \"Besides, Naruto's sandals are just over there. If anyone tries to do something, you're going inside them.\" Kiba said. The three shrunk genin shivered as they looked at the gigantic sandals which had green fumes coming out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto had just arived at the gates of Konoha. A 3000 man army was there looking at him silently. \"Surrender yourselfs.\" Naruto said as he pointed towards the army. The army burst with laughter as they looked at the barefoot boy. \"You've got to be kidding us. A mere genin against 3000 people?! You're bad at jokes.\" The army leader said as he laughed. \"Not to mention that it's pretty weak of Konoha to send a mere genin against an army. Are you underestimating us?\" The leader asked as all laughter stopped. \"Oh yeah? And what if that genin was 40 times your size?\" Naruto asked as he smiled. The army burst out laughing again. \"Well, you don't look 40 times our size, Leaf brat. Infact you're like a runt. You're not very tall to begin with.\" The leader said again as he laughed. Naruto just took out the scroll, did a few handsigns and put it back in his pocket. \"What? You called your mom?\" A man from the crowd said as they still laughed. Naruto just grinned at this. They had no idea what was going to happen. \"Alright kid. That's enough for now. Let's just finish you so we can destroy Konoha once and for all.\" The Sand Ninja leader said as he got serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the blonde's body began to grow in size. The army stared in awe and bewilderment as the blonde fox boy started to expland in size and slowly tower over them. \"Y-You've gotta be kidding me.\" The leader said as he started at the blond tower as well. Naruto finally stopped growing at about the size of 100 feet. He looked down at the army with a huge grin on his face. Naruto's foot could atleast cover 800 shinobi now. \"Like I said, what if I was 40 times your size?\" Naruto asked as he grinned. No one dared to say anything. The army slowly pulled back from the giant. \"Ao, climb that mountain over there. We'll have radio communications. I want you to have a good look of him and tell me what he's doing. From here, I can't pretty much tell.\" The leader commanded. The ninja nodded as he started to climb the mountain so he could get at the top. Naruto grinned as he looked all over at the army. They were like puny ants just waiting to be squashed. Naruto wiggled his toes in impatience. As he wiggled the toes, some of his foot smell came out. A big green \"fog\" reached a few shinobi who were close to his feet. They all began to wriggle as the green fog smelled awful. It was like a poison. They fell to the ground suffocating. After about a minute, they stopped wriggling, as they had literally died from the poisonous fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck happened?\" The leader gritted through his teeth as he saw some of his shinobi fall to the groud...just like so. \"Ao, can you tell me what happened?\" The leader said through a radio communicator. The ninja over at the mountain's top was speechless. He realized what happened. \"Well, sir...if I'm not mistaking, that green fog was...well...uh...foot odor.\" The ninja said. \"IT WAS WHAT?!\" The leader screamed. \"FOOT ODOR?! Don't screw with me!\" The leader yelled. \"I'm not doing that sir. It came from his feet.\" The ninja said. \"Grrrrrrrrrrrrr......that Konoha brat! Some of my men were defeated by FOOT ODOR?!\" The leader screamed still not being able to assimilate that thought. 'No one...NO ONE has humiliated my army like this before! You'll pay...\" The leader gritted again through his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. I haven't washed my feet from some time, and the smell is probably poison to you at that size. Hmm...hey, I got a better idea. I'll defeat most of your puny army just with my foot smell. That way less of you will have the unlucky fate of being smashed under them.\" Naruto grinned as he rubbed his sweaty sole with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gone and done it now. Men, CHARGEEEEE!\" The leader screamed as he pointed towards the blond giant. All the men lifted their puny kunai and shuriken in their hands and started to run towards Naruto's feet not realizing that they were running towards their doom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  Naruto put his hands on his hips and stood tall before the Sunagakure army. Very tall. One hundred feet to be exact. The charging men tried stay strong as well, but as they got closer to the blond giant\u2019s feet, they began to understand that they didn\u2019t have a chance. The green fog that was Naruto\u2019s foot odor met their assault head on and everyone in the front lines instantly felt its effects. Their shurikens and kunai fell from their hands as they dropped to their knees; clutching their throats. Naruto smiled as dozens of bugs writhed around him in agony\u2026he didn\u2019t eve need to lift a finger; just a toe. Even as their comrades suffocated, more Sand ninja attempted to get close to Naruto\u2026only to meet the same fate. The bodies were quickly piling around the giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, you sand ninja sure are pathetic.\u201d Naruto said as he raised one of his feet and brought it over to a group of ninja. He wiggled his toes above them and watched as they all keeled over; unable to be so close to the foul foot. \u201cYou\u2019re dropping like flies! I\u2019m afraid you might MELT if I got any bigger\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sir, they\u2019re all\u2026they\u2019re all dieing!\u201d shouted Ao\u2019s voice over the leader\u2019s radio. \u201cWe can\u2019t get close to him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen try fighting him from afar!\u201d shouted the leader, his face showing just how pissed off he was that his men were being killed off by mere foot odor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not working either!\u201d shouted a voice next to the army leader. He watched as hundreds of ninja threw their kunai and shurikens at Naruto\u2019s feet, but none of them even made a scratch. Some ninja attempting using jutsu on the feet; firing wind blades, fire balls, and torrents of water at them. Naruto didn\u2019t show any signs of pain or discomfort. He just yawned and took a step forward, killing off some more ninja with his toxic foot fumes. He noticed that fewer ninja were trying to attack him head on and instead resorted to using fruitless ranged techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot going to come to me, eh? Well\u2026I\u2019ll just come to you!\u201d Naruto grinned evilly and raised his right barefoot over the army. The men underneath Naruto\u2019s shadow had no time to run and only watched as the instrument of their doom fell upon them with inhuman force. The bare, sweaty foot crushed several shinobi flat into the ground and Naruto enjoyed feeling their weak little bodies pop under his superior form. These were the lucky ones, however. They were given quick with only a moment to smell the foot before it squished them. All those that survived the footfall were doomed to a horrible demise. They tried to crawl away, but the green fog consumed them and they died within minutes. Long, musky minutes. \u201cHow does it feel to be crushed under the great Naruto Uzumaki?!\u201d the fox boy shouted before stomping into the army again, turning several more proud shinobi into tiny stains on his sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t watch this anymore!\u201d the leader exclaimed before making a few hand signs and thrusting his hands into the ground below. The earth under the giant trembled before two domes of earth formed around Naruto\u2019s feet, sealing them. Naruto looked down annoyed at the attempt to stop him. \u201cThere! Now your demonic feet are sealed! Men, now\u2019s our chance! Topple the giant brat!\u201d the leader pointed at Naruto again and the remainder of his army (which was only a little under \u00bc its original size) charged the teenaged behemoth. They attacked Naruto\u2019s legs and lower abdomen with jutsu, but it all failed to even pierce his clothes. Some began running up the giant by focusing chakra into their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think this can stop me?\u201d Naruto asked, smirking at the leader. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need something a lot more powerful!\u201d The giant grunted as he started lifting his foot. The Suna leader watched with amazement as one of his domes started cracking and crumbling; ultimately shattering to pieces as Naruto\u2019s foot burst out and came smashing down on some more ninja. Naruto did the same with his other foot while also using his hands to brush away all the ants that were climbing over him. Those that weren\u2019t crushed by his tree-like fingers were knocked to their doom. One very unlucky ninja landed right between Naruto\u2019s toes. The soft flesh cushioned his fall, but he spent the last minutes of his life in total agony and humiliation as Naruto\u2019s odor became his whole world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-We have to retreat!\u201d shouted a frightened ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut there\u2019s nowhere to go!\u201d replied one of his comrades. Before either could decide on what to do, they and several other of their fellow ninja were cast into shadow. They looked up to see Naruto\u2019s grinning face high above before his foot came down upon them. Naruto didn\u2019t squish them like all the others, but rested his foot upon them and let them squirm and flail under his sweaty sole. Being so close to the source of Naruto\u2019s stink and actually being drenched in his perspiration\u2026the poor Sand ninja didn\u2019t last a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, snuffed out like bugs!\u201d Naruto boomed before he pressed his foot all the way down, mashing their corpses into pulp. He grinned down at the leader of the army; the look of anger and hopelessness on his face was priceless. What remained of his army was in chaos; they had no idea what to do. If they tried to fight the invincible giant they would die like bugs. If they tried to run from him they would die like bugs. They were all doomed the moment they decided to try and invade Konoha.</span></div></div>",

He's literally crushing them!\" Ao's voice said over the radio. \"You stay there at the top. We'll see what he does. I'm ready to die, but if he's thinking that I'll die like some BUG, then he's got another thing coming!!!\" The leader screamed up at the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much of the army was left now. About just 20 ninja, the leader and Ao. Mashed corpses could be seen everywhere flattened in huge footprints. \"W-w-we're getting out of here!\" the rest of the ninja screamed as they began to run away. \"You cowards! COME BACK HERE! I'll have you assassinated the second I get back at the Sand! COWARDS!!!!\" The leader screamed as he shook his fist. \"Ao, get them back here!\" The leader said by the radio. \"Hey, Ao! Are you there?!\" The leader seconded as he turned back to look at the top with his own eyes to find nothing. Ao had escaped himself! \"NO! You cowards! ARGHHHHHHH!\" The leader screamed as the threw the radio set. \"Those idiots!\" the leader cursed as he glared at the blond giant. Naruto was amused by this to no bounds. \"Hahahahaha!\" Naruto laughed as he saw everyone running away. \"Gee, looks like your own people left you. Aren't you going to run away as well? Or...are you underestimating me?\" Naruto said as he frowned at the puny ninja. \"I'm not going to be defeated by some BRAT. Why don't you come back to your normal size, hm? I'll give you a good beating, you oversized scum!!!\" The leader threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. It's sooo much better squishing your enemy like a bug. I could just smush you under my foot.\" Naruto grinned as he wriggled his toes, sending foul odor to the shinobi's nose. \"God! Do you ever take a bath?! Your feet reek!\" The leader said as he plugged his nose. \"Hey, they don't smell! Everyone has odor problems. I just work very hard, unlike you!\" Naruto said as he crossed his arms. \"What a stupid brat! I'll defeat you, and then I'll---\" \"Man, I need to take a sit.\" Naruto groaned as he interrupted the leader. He turned over and positioned his gigantic orange clad butt above the tiny shinobi. \"Hey what are you doing?! NO! Nooooooooooooooooooo!\" the leader screamed as the gigantic butt came down on him. \"Ugh, I needed to sit down. Soo, what were you saying?\" Naruto grinned as he asked the leader who was crushed to death under his butt. Naruto grinned as he let out a fart on the smashed lump under him. \"Ooops.\" Naruto innocently spoke as he chuckled. He did a few handsigns and shrank down back to his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I know, Gaara and that creepy puppet guy should be somewhere around here. I better go find them...and take care of them for good.\" Naruto grinned as he put on his sandals, and went out further into a forest. It was not long before he noticed a building which looked suspicious. His suspicions were confirmed as he saw some of the sand ninja who ran away from him earlier. \"This must be where Gaara and that guy are.\" Naruto thought as he snuck in the building. It wasn't even a building. It was something which looked like a secret base to Naruto. Naruto slipped his sandals off as he entered the base, hiding them in a corner so no one would notice. The sandals were making too much noise on the wooden floor for him to keep them. Naruto gasped as he heard Kankuro's voice coming from a room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I better join with the others.\" Kankuro said as he was alone in the base, with the other ninja supposedly going back to the Sand. Naruto carefully looked in the room to see Kankuro...AN INCH TALL! \"What the!\" Naruto's eyes bulged as he was surprised. He didn't even do that! \"Good thing I shrank myself to this size. If that Naruto guy gets here before I leave, I'll be able to sneak away unnoticed. Heh...this must be the best escape plan I've ever came up with.\" Kankuro said to himself as he was proud of his idea not even thinking that this might backfire on him. \"So he shrunk himself, huh. And he's thinking that I wouldn't notice him! Is he thinking of me as some stupid guy?!\" Naruto gritted his teeth in a comical way as he held his fist. \"Hmm...I guess I'll play along.\" Naruto made an evil grin as he wanted to show Kankuro how wrong he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then deliberately started to stomp his bare feet into the floor, so he would make Kankuro aware of his presence. \"Ah, someone is coming!\" Kankuro said as he jumped on the floor, sticking himself to the wall, hoping that whoever was coming wouldn't notice him. Naruto then entered the room with his hands on his hips. \"Someone must be here! Oh, where ever they could be?\" Naruto said pretending that he didn't know about the inch tall Kankuro on the floor. \"Crap! It's that Naruto guy! I better beat it before he sees me!\" Kankuro said as he looked up the giant orange blond. Naruto took a step forward and placed his bare foot right next to Kankuro. \"I better not see any small ninja or they'll end up as stains under my heel.\" Naruto suggested as he still pretended not to have seen Kankuro. Kankuro gulped as he heard that. He scrunched his nose as the orange foot was emitting a nasty smell of sweat. \"They smell horrible! Uagh!\" Kankuro said as he held his nose and started to run away, which was absolutely nothing for the blond ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was getting weaker and weaker as Kankuro was managing to get away from the foot. Just as he thought he got away, the smell became as strong as ever. Kankuro's eyes bulged as he saw a huge shadow over him. He slowly turned back to face the giant, only to see a sweaty orange sole and Naruto's grinning smile. \"Heheheheh...got you.\" Kankuro grinned. Naruto raised an eyebrow as he saw three other tiny ninja come out of nowhere! He hadn't seen them! \"You honestly didn't think that I didn't notice you noticing me, did you?\" Kankuro said as the three sand ninja stood next to him. \"So what? You're ants.\" Naruto giggled. \"We're strong ninja. That's what we are.\" Kankuro said with a smirk. \"No, you're not. You're 4 bugs that I want to step on.\" Naruto mustered an evil smile as he twisted his bare foot into the floor, imagining as if he was twisting their tiny bodies under his mighty heel. All 4 of them gulped, but wouldn't go down without a fight.</span></div></div>",

The fox boy lifts of his arm and sees that it\u2019s really damp under there. Nevertheless, he takes a big whiff of his pit. Afterwards, he recoils in disgust and waves his other hand in front of his nose. \u201cPee yew! You\u2019d have too be tough as nails to survive in there!\u201d Naruto smirked down at Konohamaru as he pulled up his sleeves, exposing his lightly haired armpits. \u201cAre you tough as nails, Konohamaru?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet I am!\u201d Konohamaru shouted, pumping a fist in the air. \u201cI defiantly won\u2019t pass out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood answer!\u201d Naruto shouted back as he picked up the shrunken academy student and, after giving him one last smirk, shoved him into his rank pit. The boy didn\u2019t struggle in his grip, but winced a bit as Naruto\u2019s  short pit hairs pricked him all over. He only started to acknowledge the horrible stench when the giant put his arm down, trapping him in there. \u201cYou\u2019re next, doggy boy!\u201d Naruto called down to the pint-sized ninja, who was still collapsed on the ground from his experience with Konohamaru. Naruto pinched Kiba between his fingers and, using just one of those fingers, pushed him into his other pit. Because of Kiba\u2019s powerful nose, ridiculously small size, and the fact that he was tortured by Konohamaru seconds ago, he stayed conscious for about three seconds before he took one sniff of Naruto\u2019s B.O. His face twisted with agony and he passed out. Naruto, seeing that Kiba wasn\u2019t moving, just chuckled and lowered his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, what a weak pup.\u201d Naruto mocked Kiba, not caring whether his fellow ninja was dead or just unconscious. His attention turned to his right pit, where he could feel Konohamaru squirming. \u201cYeah, keeps squirming like that, kid! I\u2019ll know if you\u2019re still conscious if you keep moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both his slaves tucked away in his pits, Naruto leaned back against the tree trunk and relaxed while listening to the noises of the forest. Because only a bit of light filtered in through the trees, the forest was pretty cool and Naruto didn\u2019t get much sweatier than he already was. That didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t stink like a cart full of moldy cheese, though\u2026</span></div></div>",

He was in a dark forest when something caught his eye. He thought it was a bug and almost passed it by when he noticed that this bug was the size of his pinky finger, and was wearing jeans and a T-Shirt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" He said as he stooped down and couldn't believe his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Shikamaru said picking it up by it's leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held it upside down in front of his face, his eyes scanned it's body, sure enough, just as he'd thought, it was a tiny human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that Shikamaru picked you up and held you upside down at eye level. You were between the stage of being asleep and awake. However when Shikamaru did this, you became fully aware that you were hanging upside down from a great height. At first you thought it was just a dream, but then you felt Shikamaru's less than gentle hold on your foot.  You rubbed the sleep out of your eyes and yawned, then you saw his gigantic face peering at you like a child who had discovered something new. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to scream, and Shikamaru was surprised that it was pretty loud for your size. He cupped a finger over your face and told you quite simply, \"Shut up squirt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis finger was smothering you, Shikamaru realized this and took his finger away to find you gasping for air. He chuckled smugly, realizing how he could have killed you with but a finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...This mission sure is a drag.....Lucky I got a puny like you to make it interesting!\"</span></div></div>",

Once it was off, he casually dropped you onto it. The bottom of the footwear was really sweaty, you could only imagine what the foot must be like. You were about to know first hand as Shikamaru lowered his foot back into the sandal. You yelped in terror and tried to run away, but got pinned anyway. Half of you was compressed underneath the shinobi\u2019s sole while the other half was trapped between his toes. It smelled horrendous, like Shikamaru hadn\u2019t bothered to bathe in weeks. He probably thought it was too troublesome. The foot was also sweating like a pig, the perspiration slowly making its way into your clothes. The toes wiggled around you and splashed droplets of sweat in your face. Despite your uncomfortable position, you were helpless to do anything but look up at the ninja\u2019s smug grin. Your position gave you a great view of his gigantic, towering form. He had total control over you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Well, time to get moving, I guess.\u201d Shikamaru scratched the back of his head and continued his trek through the dark forest, which expansive treetops blocked much of the sunlight. You felt the giant\u2019s foot lift up and come back down, the simple movement putting some pressure on your fragile form. You tried to ignore the pain and the view of the giant and tried to focus on what was happening. One minute you were drifting off to sleep and the next you woke up in the world of Naruto, the size of an insect, and being used as an insole for Shikamaru! How did you end up like this? You had no answers, and wondered if you would survive long enough to get any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of walking, the young shadow ninja decided to speed things up a bit and started jumping from tree branch to tree branch. This was bad for you, as the pressure being put on your body was increased as the giant jumped. In addition, you saw first hand how fast the speed of a ninja was. The world was going by you so fast that you could barely make out anything anymore. The movement, combined with the stench of Shikamaru\u2019s foot, started to make you dizzy. You hoped he stopped soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Shikamaru sensed something other than the forest ahead. The smell of the air was different and he could see light. He was still a bit far from his destination, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to take a quick break here. Perhaps he could play with his tiny find a bit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell in the air got stronger as he got closer. It was\u2026</span></div></div>",

The young shinobi took a few steps forward, leaving a few impressions of his sandal in the sand. He took a big breath of fresh air and exhaled. He had heard his destination was near a beach and was hoping he\u2019d come across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is nice. I can\u2019t even remember the last time I visited a beach.\u201d Shikamaru said to himself as he kicked off his sandals and planet his bare feet into the warm sand. He made sure to clutch you between his toes, so instead of being sent flying with his sandals, you were pressed into the sand with his foot. You tried to ignore the heat against your back as the giant wiggled his toes in the sand. You usually liked the beach, but now the sand was practically cooking you. You continued to look up at Shikamaru as he slipped off his jacket and fishnet shirt, leaving him bare chested. He just put his hands on his hips and stared into the sea, daydreaming. You tried to look away from him, but his gigantic and superior form kept pulling your gaze back. He was like a god to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly noticed said god was leaning down, his treelike fingers spreading his toes and grasping you. You were pulled free of his foot and brought up to his face. He grinned at you and continued to grin as he sat down upon the beach and then laid himself down on it. You were carelessly dropped onto his tanned chest; it lifting and dropping as he breathed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake a break. You probably need it after all that time in my sandal.\u201c The giant said to you as he leaned his head back against his arms and looked up at the clear sky. He thought he\u2019d just lay here for a bit and soak up some rays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have a mission to get to? Should you really just be laying down on the beach like this?\u201d you questioned as you stood up on the boy\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe mission isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d he sighed as his eyes were transfixed on you again. \u201cJust relax. Isn\u2019t this place a lot nicer compared to that damp, dark forest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to disagree. Ever since waking up in this world, the only thing you\u2019ve known much about is Shikamaru\u2019s raunchy foot. Now you were on his chest and it was starting to get hot and moist from the sun. Shikamaru saw your discomfort and it brought a smirk to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot comfortable, eh? That\u2019s okay, I know someplace you can relax.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You immediately turn around and make a dash across the lazy boy\u2019s chest, toward his stomach. You don\u2019t get very far as a shadow engulfs you and Shikamaru\u2019s palm smacks you against his abdomen. The impact makes an audible splash as his palm hits a layer of sweat. He grabs you by the back of your t-shirt and brings your hurting body back to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t try to run away from me. It\u2019ll become too much of a drag to stop you every single time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can gather up enough strength to struggle, the shadow manipulator brings you down to his left pit and sticks you against the damp flesh. He starts to lower his arms and only releases you once his arms as squished you firmly into place. He rotates his shoulders a bit to get comfortable before placing his hands on his stomach and resuming is gaze into the sky. Inside the pit, you attempt to struggle against the relatively hairless skin. The few hairs that do exist serve to smear more perspiration in your face. You\u2019re forced to breath the fumes released from his pit and wonder if you\u2019ll run out of oxygen anytime soon. You might sweat yourself to death before that happens. His pit is scorching hot and the heat from beach doesn\u2019t help at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world suddenly flips and you accidentally slam your head into a pool of fresh sweat. Some gets in your mouth and nose and you cough hysterically. There\u2019s also some in your eyes, but you can\u2019t move your hands to rub it out. You\u2019re forced to shut your eyes as they burn and hope your tears can wash it out. Your giant captor has rolled over onto his stomach, allowing the sun to beat down on his bare back. You hear him sigh in bliss and silently hope he gets sunburn. </span></div></div>",

His hand was sweaty and covered in sand, but you didn\u2019t have to but up with it for long as you were quickly brought down to the boy\u2019s stomach and pushed into his navel. You struggled furiously but the shinobi was leagues above you in terms of strength. When he finally took his hand away and brought light back to your world, you found yourself chest-deep into his bellybutton. You watched him look at you past his chest and smirk before pushing you all the way in with a single finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right about one thing: it was snug, but not in the comfortable way. You were trapped by walls of moist flesh and unable to move an inch. Your mouth was right next to some lint and you couldn\u2019t help but get some in your mouth when he pushed you down. Unable to move at all, you were forced to swallow the glob of filth. All around you were the noises of his inner body. The sound of his stomach gurgling worried you a bit; what if he planned to put you in there? His stomach wasn\u2019t the only thing around you, as his powerful abdominal muscles hugged you from all sides. You wondered if he\u2019d forget you were in here and unconsciously sit up, effectively crunching you like a nut. You shuddered in fear and tried struggling some more, hoping you could get yourself out. A few minutes later and you hadn\u2019t moved an inch. He, on the other hand, was moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the muscles around you tense and put pressure on you as Shikamaru got to his feet. Luckily, he was still aware of your existence and made sure his body didn\u2019t crush you. You still felt like you could burst any second, though. You waited for the lazy ninja\u2019s fingers to pull you out, but they never came. What was he doing out there?</span></div></div>",

Your team mates were embarrassed of you, your parents never had time for you, and all your missions either ended in failure or with you in the hospital for several days. Despite all this, you walked through the Leaf Village with a proud look on your face. Why? Because everything was about to change. On your last mission (which ended horribly) you had learned a new jutsu from a strange old man while passing through a port town. The jutsu supposedly had the power to shrink anyone it was used on. Thinking that this could be your chance at becoming a successful ninja, you decided to test it. But on who? There were plenty of people around, but they all seemed boring. You wanted to use it on a fellow ninja to show that you were better than they were. After several minutes of searching through a market district, you came across the perfect target. The familiar sight of a Leaf headband was all you needed. You casually strolled over to the ninja, who was apparently buying something from a stall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, could I speak with you for a sec?\u201d you asked from behind the shinobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d the ninja turned his head to look at you.

You\u2019re an amazing ninja and I really want to be like you. I thought if I used a shrinking jutsu on myself I could sneak onto you and be with you all day long! Please forgive me, sir!\u201d You bowed your head to finish what can only be called a major suck-up. The orange ninja gave you a strange look and chuckled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always like a fan, but shrinking yourself? That\u2019s going a bit too far, don\u2019t you think? You\u2019re kind of weird. What\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaoru. Kaoru Shin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, well Kaoru. You must be one die-hard fan of mine. You can hang out with me if you want. You just had to ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled nervously. \u201cYeah, sorry. It\u2019s a bit too late, though. I can\u2019t seem to return to normal size.\u201d Naruto\u2019s eyes widened as he heard this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?

There was no telling what this unpredictable giant would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you idolize me so much, you can be my new pet!\" Naruto said this with a big grin on his face, like he knew he was saying just the right thing to make your day. You, on the other hand, had a totally blank look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked in a deadpan voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto laughed and said, \"Speechless huh? I would be too! I mean, I'm pretty amazing and now you get to spend all your time with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head a little and said, \"But...but...what about getting me to normal size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to go back to normal size? You already went through this much trouble to be close to me, you can't turn back to normal, so you can be close to me for the rest of your life! Doesn't that sound great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! No it didn't! It sounded hellish! Who would want to be at the whims of a massive trouble maker? Your life would constantly be in danger! As you thought this, Naruto noticed your hesitation and his face grew stormier. He gripped you more tightly and said, \"Unless of course you were LYING before and you really WERE trying to shrink me. Because if you were...I'd have to punish you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the hint. You quickly shook your head and said, \"No! No! That sounds absolutely wonderful!

Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tucked you into his jacket pocket before running off. Well this was just great! You were in an even worse fix now! Naruto had absolutely no intention of helping you and was keeping you like a kid who keeps a mouse. And, judging by Naruto's personality, it would be quite hazardous. The jostling finally ended after about five minutes of constant, nausea inducing motion, and Naruto's hand appeared again, reaching into the pocket and pulling you out.

The giant blond placed you down on the counter, behind a few salt and pepper shakers so Teuchi and his daughter couldn\u2019t see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, Naruto!\u201d Teuchi greeted with a kind smile. \u201cWhat\u2019ll it be today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne bowl of pork ramen, please. Extra large!\u201d Naruto replied, his mouth watering at just thought. Teuchi nodded and went into the back with Ayame to prepare the order. When they were gone, Naruto turned to you and smiled down at you. \u201cYou ready to pig out, Kaoru? My treat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I guess, but how am I supposed to eat ramen at this size?\u201d you asked, not even capable of holding a pair of chopsticks right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that!\u201d was Naruto\u2019s only response before turning away from you and waiting impatiently for the food. By the time Teuchi came out with Naruto\u2019s steaming hot bowl of ramen, but teen looked like he was going to die from starvation. As soon as the bowl was placed in front of Naruto, the fox boy reached for his chopsticks and began chowing down. After gulping down the first mouthful of noodles, he mumbled a thanks to the restaurant owner before picking up several more and slurping them down. After consuming a piece of pork, Naruto took a second piece, but only took a big bite of it. He brought the remaining portion of the pork down to you and urged you to take it. You did and thanked him before stuffing your face. What was only a small, insignificant piece to Naruto was an entire helping to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, you had polished off the pork and was already getting full. Naruto was still eating away; even he could finish such a huge bowl too quickly. Teuchi and Ayame knew Naruto\u2019s eating habits all to well and purposely packed the bowl with a lot more contents. When Naruto glanced down at you and noticed your empty hands he said, \u201cI guess you liked that! You should try this broth; it\u2019s fantastic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could get a say in whether you wanted to try it or not, Naruto picked you up with the chopsticks and dropped you into the ramen. You landed with a small splash and quickly swam back up to the surface, gasping for breath. Luckily, the ramen wasn\u2019t as hot as it was when it had first been brought out. It was kind of warm and steamy, kind of like a hot spring.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since I\u2019m already here\u2026\u201d you say to yourself before dipping your face into the broth and gulping down the warm liquid. Maybe it was just because you were so small and the tastes were intensified, but the broth tasted delicious! After swallowing your third mouthful, you noticed Naruto wasn\u2019t picking at the ramen anymore. Looking up, you saw that he was staring right at you with envy in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, it must be awesome to swim around in ramen! I wish I could do it; it\u2019s always been a dream of mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought your dream was to be Hokage?\u201d you ask the genin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Oh, right! Swimming in ramen is my second dream.\u201d Naruto laughs and you laugh along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty nice, I guess. It\u2019s like a hot spring with yummy tasting water. I\u2019m going to smell like ramen now, though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a bad thing? You\u2019ll smell great! Good enough to eat!\u201d Naruto laughed with you again, but this time your laugh was more of a nervous chuckle. Naruto could probably eat you at this size. It wouldn\u2019t be very hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your little discussion about Naruto\u2019s weird dream, you both went back to eating your lunch. Every now and then you would swim over to a piece of meat and nibble on it. You knew well enough to stay away from those giant chopsticks, though. Naruto could easily mistake you for  apiece of meat and snatch you up without looking. Speaking of not looking, Naruto was acting kind of odd while he ate. His eyes were closed and every mouthful he savored was followed by a moan as it went down his gullet. This must be how he always eats ramen; completely entranced in the smell and taste while oblivious to the world around him. Once Naruto had slurped up the last of the noodles, the bowl was now empty\u2026save for you. Like he always did, Naruto put down his chopsticks and picked up the bowl with both hands, ready to drain the remaining broth from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026Naruto, don\u2019t forget to take me out.\u201d you reminded, but Naruto wasn\u2019t listening. His eyes were still shut and his mind was currently in his ramen paradise. \u201cNaruto!!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Within seconds you could feel yourself getting pulled towards the dank cavern. You quickly turned your body and started swimming for you life, dodging left over chunks of meat and vegetables. Naruto was insatiable however and didn't pause to take a breath or anything. He just kept drinking and drinking, tipping the bowl up higher and higher. Your arms and legs felt like they were on fire they were exerting so much effort to keep yourself from becoming a snack for for the hungry fox boy. You glanced behind you and saw Naruto's enormous face looming almost right behind you! You gasped and strained, forcing yourself to move faster. Suddenly, a shadow engulfed you. Still looking ahead you saw Naruto's lips pass by overhead, his teeth hanging down like stalactites in a cave. You felt yourself fall onto the wet, slippery pink muscle that was Naruto's tongue and continue sliding back. His powerful throat muscles were dragging you closer to his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NARUTO! HELP ME!!!\" You screamed frantically hoping against hope that Naruto would hear you, but he could not. He was lost in a ramen flavored fantasy, his senses all focused on enjoying the noodles, broth and meat...unfortunately for you you WERE the meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour muscles cried out in protest as you attempted to escape this fate, but it was all futile. The cavern slammed shut, throwing you into a darkness that reeked of ramen, Naruto's breath, and the sweaty scent of your own fear. Naruto swished the brother around in his mouth, savoring the taste. You felt yourself get tossed around, slamming into his teeth, getting washed under his tongue, getting pressed to the roof of the mouth, before Naruto finally gulped, sending you and the broth down his esophagus. The tight muscles massaged your body all over as it dragged you down, down, down until you passed through the end of it and landed with a wet plop onto a pile of soggy noodles. You quickly got to your feet and ran to the stomach wall, slamming your fists against it. \"NARUTO! SAVE ME! PLEASE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. Not only had you shrunk yourself in front of this hyperactive ninja but now he had eaten you! You thought giving yourself over to Naruto would save you from a fate like this but instead it had condemned you! Talk about bad luck! There might still be a chance though if Naruto could hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, however, merely burped and patted his belly. \"Thanks Teuchi! That was great!\" He pushed the bowl towards the man and got up, walking away. He smiled as he remembered how good the ramen had tasted. He still couldn't remember that you were in the bowl he had just finished eating and he couldn't hear you screaming his name. His burp had flushed most of the air out of your environment, leaving you light headed. Another one would probably send you into unconsciousness. You didn't know how long you had before the digestive juices started eating away at you. So you resolved to get yourself out of this fate. You put your hands together and attached chakra to to the soles of your feet. Closing your eyes you concentrated until you were sure you had it before running towards the stomach wall. Your feet clung to the living wall and you ran up it, heading for the esophagus again. You had never been very good at this but it was amazing what a life or death situation could do to help you succeed. You managed to jam our arm into the closed exit and force your body into the tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Naruto suddenly felt something moving around in his stomach. He held it worriedly and said, \"Oh wow...what's going on in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, as usual, the only way anything was getting back up the esophagus was through vomiting. Naruto kept his gorge down and, therefore, you were soon tossed back into the soup of his stomach. Damn...was there no way out?</span></div></div>",

The familiar sound of his stomach gurgling brought a smile to his face. \u201cI guess you enjoyed that as much as I did, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Naruto said to his gut as he patted it again as continued toward his apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatted\u2026petted\u2026pet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s eyes went wide as he suddenly remembered you. He reached his hands into his pockets to see if you were there, but all he felt in them was loose change and a few balls of lint. The blond did a 180 and rushed back toward Ichiraku. Once there, he stormed in and began searching the counter top for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey Naruto.\u201d Teuchi greeted the young ninja again. \u201cDid you forget something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026yeah. I think\u2026\u201d Naruto mumbled as he moved the salt and pepper shakers aside. You weren\u2019t here either\u2026but that could only mean one thing. Naruto\u2019s face turned white as he touched his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*gurgle*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox teen bolted out of the restaurant, leaving a very confused Teuchi and Ayame to exchange glances with each other. Naruto ran through the village, but not too fast. If he moved too quickly, he risked speeding up his digestion process. He looked around desperately for somewhere secluded and finally found an empty alleyway with no one around. Naruto ran into the ally, took one last glance around to make sure no one was looking, and reached two fingers into the back of his throat. Upon touching his uvula, the expected response began\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto clutched his stomach before puking out his lunch on to the rocky ground. He hated wasting a good meal like this, but he had no choice in the matter. He couldn\u2019t digest his meal when you were PART of that meal. After about half the contents of his stomach were expelled on to the ground, Naruto wiped his mouth with his sleeve and spat out the bad taste in his mouth. His eyes began scanning over his vomit, searching for anything that wasn\u2019t a ramen noodle, piece of pork, or vegetable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, please don\u2019t be too late! I couldn\u2019t have digested you that fast!\u201d Naruto started to sweat at the thought of finding your burnt skeleton or of you still being in his stomach, succumbing to his enzymes. He was just about to reluctantly initiate another gag reflex when he spotted something in his discarded lunch. Something humanoid. Naruto plucked it out of the soupy mixture and shook a bit of the juices off. Just as he thought, it was you. You were unconscious and a little red from the intense heat of the teen\u2019s powerful stomach, but you\u2019d live. Naruto sighed and wiped some sweat from his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, that was a close one! Another minute or so and you might have been Uzumaki food! It\u2019s going to be a lot tougher than I thought keeping someone as small as you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you safely gripped in his hand, Naruto ran toward his apartment building. Once there, he headed for the kitchen where he gently cleaned you off with a napkin. Once you were decent, he walked into his bedroom and placed you on the bed. Sitting down next to you, the genin looked at you closely while thinking about what he was going to say to you when you woke up. You would probably hold some contempt toward him for eating you\u2026</span></div></div>",

It smelled bad even from this distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Kaoru. I haven\u2019t showered in awhile. I\u2019ve been too busy with missions and my training to worry about that. But hey, that just means there\u2019s more for you to smell!\u201d he grinned toothily like a little kid. You definitely didn\u2019t want to go near his feet, so you began to back up. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it! I\u2019m not stepping on you or anything, so be thankful for that. All you have to do is just walk up to them and start sniffing. Not so hard right?\u201d When you didn\u2019t move, he began to glare. \u201cWould you rather I DID force you under them, puny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got the message and ran over to his feet. At four inches, his feet were bigger than you by just his toes. To you, they were still bigger than feet were supposed to be! Swallowing hard, you approached the middle of the two feet and started to sniff the flesh deeply. Your nostrils burned like fire and made you jump back in total disgust. If this had been a jutsu, you\u2019d probably lose the battle because of it. Naruto grinned at your reaction and inched his feet closer. \u201cNot done yet. I want at least five sniffs before you're done. Any less and I\u2019ll just make you smell something WORSE.\u201d You couldn\u2019t imagine what could be worse, but you didn\u2019t want to find out. Once again, you braced yourself and took another long sniff of the foul soles. It took all your energy to not jump back again, but your head still started to spin. A third sniff made your stomach upset and you tried not to puke. If you did that, Naruto would probably kill you. Just two more breaths and you were done. You closed your eyes and took a fourth smell and\u2026  </span></div></div>",

You opened your mouth to say something, but instantly stopped when Naruto had completely removed the shirt. It was no surprise he was very fit; he was a ninja and all. You were one too. However, maybe it was just because you were so small, but he now looked three times as more intimidating than before. Naruto started to rub his shoulder and sigh. \u201cAhh, this feels great on a hot day like today.\u201d The young ninja caught you staring and smirked. \u201cYou like?\u201d he asked as he put his hands on his hips and stared down at you. You shook your head, which was covered in sweat due to your fear. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be shy. I can imagine how scared and puny you must feel. But you know what?\u201d Naruto snatched up in his hand and brought you up to his sneering face. \u201cYou deserve it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox boy sat down on his bed as you prepared yourself to be brought over to his sweaty pit. Surprisingly, he laid down and placed you on his bare chest instead. He then folded his arms behind his head to rest it on, exposing both his armpits to the room. \u201cDid you think I\u2019d give you a hand or something? You have to get over there yourself. Get moving.\u201d he commanded as his azure eyes never left you. You looked over his chest and tried to decide which pit to walk over to. It didn\u2019t really matter, so you chose the left and started walking. It wasn\u2019t a long trip or anything, but Naruto\u2019s eyes were watching you like a hawk. You felt uneasy as you walked over his pec muscle and around his nipple until you reached the end. Under you was his exposed armpit and you began to ponder how to do this. You got on your hands and knees and leaned over the edge as far as possible. You started sniff the air, which smelled familiar to you. The air was always thick with the smell of sweat after a long training session with your teammates. You had never actually smelled their armpits before but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough, shrimp. You need to get closer.\u201d Closer? How were you supposed to get closer? You took a moment to think before laying down on your belly and inching yourself off the edge. You were a ninja, so you were used to physically demanding tasks. You had enough body strength to hang your entire upper body off his chest so only your lower half was keeping you from falling. When the pit was only inches from your nose, you started to smell it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pupils dilated in shock. For just a second, you lost complete control of your chakra. It was THAT bad. When you regained control, you noticed you were slipping. You immediately regained your balance. Naruto chuckled above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep doing it just like that. I\u2019ll tell you when you\u2019ve had enough.\u201d you obeyed and continued sniffing. You never took a big sniff like before, for fear you\u2019ll close control again. The small sniffs still burned your nose and made you sick. It was horrible and Naruto\u2019s staring wasn\u2019t making it any more comfortable. You lost track of time and you just took a breath every few seconds. Naruto liked seeing you suffer, but started to grow bored. Therefore\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just don't let anything like this happen again!\" He said that last thing with a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded again and made the hand signs to release the jutsu. \"Release!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...why aren't you turning back to normal?\" Kiba asked, looking over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know! I'm stuck!\" You shouted looking nervously up at Kiba. The world was already a scary place...but. now, trapped at this tiny size, it was absolutely terrifying. You started to shiver, wondering what was going to happen to you. Kiba frowned and looked you over. He stood up and said, \"Well I can't just leave you here like this. You're coming with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put you in his pocket and started moving. You were even more nervous now. You knew Kiba could be a little...rough. But he had just given you good advice and had said he'd let your indiscretion slide so maybe he wasn't all bad. You decided to just wait it out and see what happens. Finally, the movement stopped and Kiba pulled you out of his pocket. You looked around. You were in what you assumed was the dog ninja's room. It was your typical teens room, messy, clothes strewn about, a cluttered desk, the bed was unmade...and there was a pervading smell of teen musk. It was strong...but not unpleasant. You looked up at Kiba who was smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright kid, you're going to be staying with me until we can figure out a way to help you. But if you want to stay with me you're going to have to do something to earn your stay. Since you're too small to do much around the room you're going to have to do things for me! Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure. Thanks for taking me in.\" You replied, wondering what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sat on his bed. \"Sure! We might as well make the most of this and have some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and said, \"So, what do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked down at you and said, \"Something personal, since you can't do anything to help around the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped you on the ground in front of his sandal clad feet and said, \"I've been walking around all day and my feet are sore. Why not rub em down for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the huge feet in front of you and hesitated. This...could be difficult. You weren't sure what to do. You could always ask him to do something else. But Kiba might not like that...he was being really generous taking care of you and he might not like you being ungrateful. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

Kiba smiles at your agreement and you watch him unstrap his sandals and kick them off. He placed both his bare, giant feet in front of you and wiggles his toes with anticipation. You take in the sight of the enormous feet for a few moments before climbing up the left one. Kiba chuckles a bit from the feeling of something so small crawling over his skin. Once you reach the top of his foot, you get on your hands and knees and start rubbing. Kiba closes his eyes and sighs, enjoying the feeling of his sore feet being rubbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I just remembered. I\u2019m letting you stay in my home, but I don\u2019t even know your name!\u201d Kiba exclaimed down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Kaoru\u2026\u201d you reply, not looking up from the giant\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. I\u2019m Kiba, but I guess you already knew that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to rub his feet, you begin to realize how much they stunk. Kiba had just said he was on his feet all day, and the smell really showed that! Nonetheless, you began crawling over every inch of the expansive foot, massaging the sweaty skin as you go. Eventually, Kiba tilts his foot and you lose your balance and tumble onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! Kiba, please be careful!\u201d you yell up at the giant chunin while rubbing your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, sorry little guy. You alright?\u201d he asks you, hoping the simple movement on his part didn\u2019t hurt you at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so.\u201d You swing your arm around to make sure nothing is broken. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good. Since you still have two functioning arms, you can get back to work!\u201d Kiba says as he lifts his foot, showing you the sole of his foot. You plugged your nose after getting a whiff of the air; it was even worse than the top of his foot! \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re not going to chicken out, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and approach the sole. It\u2019s covered in sweat and grime\u2026and you have to touch it. Grimacing, you slowly reach out and begin massaging the flesh. The sole feels wet and gross under your hands, but you continue to rub it anyway. You did say you would do it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh\u2026yeah. That feels nice.\u201d Kiba moans as he relaxes on his bed. You aren\u2019t nearly as relaxed\u2026the odor radiating from his foot starts to make your eyes water. You rub his sole the best you can for a few minutes before he puts it down. You think you\u2019re done\u2026until you look up and see the giant ninja pointing at his right foot. You groan and clamber atop his foot, giving it the same treatment as the left. By the time you\u2019ve finished massaging his sole again, you\u2019re coughing from the lack of fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Kaoru, did they stink that badly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026but I\u2019ll be fine. I just need a moment to rest.\u201d you answer him before collapsing on your back and taking a breather. After Kiba\u2019s allowed you to rest for a few minutes\u2026</span></div></div>",

Now, it's time to earn your food.\" He scooped you up gently into his hands and laid you on the bed next to him. You wondered what he meant...it soon became clear as he pulled off his jacket and then the wire mesh shirt underneath that. He laid down on his stomach and said, \"Massage my back would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at him and said, \"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed onto his pants and started climbing up. It took a little effort but you managed to get up on his back. It was broad and tanned, smooth to the touch and very warm from his body heat. After being down by his sweaty smelly feet this was much nicer. You got down on your hands and knees and started applying pressure to the muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww yeah! That feels good Kaoru! Keep it up!\" Kiba said, closing his eyes and enjoying the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and kept going. You liked that Kiba was pleased with your work and it made the fatigue you were feeling from before disappear. You moved slowly up his back, making sure to knead each muscle gently and carefully but also with enough pressure to loosen them up. Kiba grunted and moaned from all the attention, clearing enjoying it. You were starting to enjoy it yourself. It was nice to have someone to take care of you. Your teammates and family had all treated you like dirt so having someone actually want to keep you around was like a dream. So what if you had to rub his feet or back a few times a day? It's not like you had anything else to do with your time....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally finished around his shoulders and said, \"Okay Kiba. I'm all done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba didn't respond. You looked down at his face and saw that he had fallen asleep. Wow...you must be really good at this. You smiled to yourself. At least you were good at something. You slid off his back and onto the mattress, looking around the room. It was decent sized though it looked smaller than it really was thanks to how cluttered it was. It could take awhile for Kiba to wake up so you decided to explore for a bit. You peeked over the edge of the bed and noticed a pile of old clothes on the floor. You jumped off and managed to land in them. They broke your fall quite nicely but they reeked of sweat and male musk. It was overwhelming. You quickly clambered out of them and looked around. Everything seemed so much bigger at this size. The desk, the dresser...they both towered above you like buildings, while each of Kiba's shirts was like a circus tent to you. Suddenly you tripped over something and fell on top of some white material. You take a huge whiff and suddenly realize that you had just fallen face first in a pair of Kiba's used briefs! The stink of man filled our nostrils. You quickly got up, blushing heavily, moving swiftly away to a different area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried moving a pencil that was on the floor but it was like moving a downed tree trunk. To think that you'd be reduced to something so weak. You suddenly started feeling nervous. You were incredibly vulnerable at this size. Anything could kill you! You wanted to be next to Kiba again. At least with him you knew you would be taken care of. Unfortunately...he was all the way up on his bed...and you were all the way down on the floor. There was a chance you could climb up there but you were already tired from all the foot and back rubs. The only thing you could do was wait for Kiba to wake up...</span></div></div>",

The thought of him not seeing your small form on the floor and accidentally stepping on you was a bit frightening. Maybe sitting in the middle of the floor wasn\u2019t the best idea\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could decide to do something else, you saw a bit of movement coming from Kiba\u2019s bed. The giant began to stir and soon he was sitting up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes and yawning loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI fell asleep?\u201d Kiba asked himself as he glanced at the clock. He began to remember the reason he had fallen asleep and started searching the bed for you. When he couldn\u2019t find you, his eyes scanned the rest of his room. By some stroke of luck, they fell upon your tiny form on the ground. Kiba smiled once he saw you and hopped out of bed, shaking the floor under you like an earthquake. You watched as the shirtless teenager made his way over to you; his bare feet creating booms on the floor. You knew from the kind smile on his face that he wasn\u2019t planning on hurting you, but you still felt the need to get out of his way. Before you could decide to do this or not, the giant dog ninja was already standing over you. His big, bare feet were placed on either side of you and you had to strain your neck to look him in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, little guy. What are you doing all the way down there?\u201d Kiba asks you, not seeming to notice that he was really intimidating you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. You fell asleep and I decided to explore around your room. It realized it\u2019s kind of dangerous to be away from you, though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, well sorry for falling asleep on ya.\u201d Kiba apologized. \u201cThat back rub felt amazing, though! If you\u2019re that good, I might never want you to return to normal size!\u201d Kiba laughed loudly after saying this, although you couldn\u2019t tell if he was joking or now. You watched Kiba move away from you and back to his bed, where he picked up his shirt and jacket off the floor and slipped them back on. As he zippered his jacket, he walked back over to you and said, \u201cNow that you\u2019ve earned your food, wanna eat?\u201d Kiba lowered his hand and allowed you to climb on top of it. Once you were resting in the palm of his hand, the chunin left his bedroom and made his way to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to have?\u201d you ask him, knowing that whatever it was, you\u2019d probably only be eating scraps at your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you did such a swell job on the back massage, I\u2019ll let you choose. There should be something in here\u2026\u201d As Kiba said this, he had arrived in front of the refrigerator and opened it. You suddenly felt a bit chilly as the cold air from the fridge hit you. You looked into the fridge and saw that it was, like Kiba\u2019s room, messy. Leftovers from several nights ago were still wrapped up and many of them looked rather moldy. \u201cTake your time in choosing. There\u2019s plenty of options!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, there were plenty of things to choose from, but only a handful looked the least bit appetizing. After some careful searching, you picked out two things inside the refrigerator that appeared edible enough. You could only pick one, though\u2026</span></div></div>",

Kiba spreads his toes apart exposing heaps of moldy cheese toe jam between each toe. \u201cWell get to it slave\u201d, you move your face closer to the first to gap. The smell is a lot more intense than is soles or toenails. It smelt nothing like pizza more like moldy cheese and vinegar and he wanted you to eat it.

Kiba said putting is arm down and trapping you in his sweaty stinky pit. You where kept tangled in kibas jungle of pit hair forcing you  to inhale is man must. You heard kiba put his jacket back on keeping the odor and heat in his armpit, you heard him speak. \u201cAlright slave get comfy where going on a mission. Kiba ran out the door and into the outside heat of the leaf village. After a couple minutes you could feel the temperature increase and kiba started to sweat really hard in his pits. The sweat burned your eyes, drenched your clothes, and got into your mouth on a few accounts sometimes swallowing it on accident.  After being trapped and forced to endure Kibas stench and sweat he stops and speaks to you. \u201cBe prepared slave your almost to suna so it\u2019s going to get a lot hotter and I\u2019m going to sweat a lot more so get ready hehe\u201d you did not want to experience kibas pits in the desert heat but you hade no choice. Within 10 minutes the temperature was boiling hot and kibas pits where sweating buckets. Your eyes where on fire and now you where being forced to swallow mouthful after mouthful of the salty sweat. And the smell oh my god the smell. His once bearable onion odor was now a mixed odor of vinegar,onion, and cheese. Kiba was right it got a lot worse and there was nothing you could do to help it. While being imprisoned in the raunchy pit kiba was looking for the lost man for a while until he say some bandits surrounding a man on the ground. You here him warn you once again. \u201cAlright slave looks like your about to experience first hand your master kick some ass get ready and don\u2019t die haha.\u201d Kiba approached the bandits and confronted them. \u201cHey leave the man alone and leave or get your ass kicked which one will it be\u201d. Kibas words got the bandits attention and they faced him. \u201cGet outta here kid before you get hurt or worse dead\u201d one said.  \u201cYeah scram brat before things get messy\u201d another said. \u201cFine have it your way\u201d kiba shrugs and pulls out 3 explosive kunai and 2 smoke pellets. \u201cGet ready you punks\u201d. Kiba yelled before throwing one smoke pellet at the ground and one Kunai at the crowd of bandits. Kiba begins moving and fighting the bandits, your knocked around in his armpit trying to grab onto his hair but slipping off because of the sweat that poured on you.

Kiba picks up the man and returns to the village. Once reports to tsunade he goes home and starts to remove his Clothes. \u201cMan slave that was a easy mission made me pretty smelly though haha\u201d. Kiba removes his Sandals, jacket, and pants now just standing in his black underwear. He lifts his arm and plucks your sweat drenched body from his pit. \u201cHow was your first mission slave, pretty smelly I assume haha\u201d. \u201cYeah it was, your pits absolutely reek I hated every minute of it\u201d. \u201cWell you better get used to it where gonna have a lot more missions together\u201d kiba says placing you down by the end of the bed.

You walk up to the rancid walls of sweaty smelly flesh and use all your strength to massage kibas feet. \u201cAhhh yes salve you are so good a massages but don\u2019t forget to smell and lick them\u201d. You take deep inhaled of Kiba\u2019s stench not wanting to make him angry. The cheese vinegar odor makes you gag a little and your eyes tear. Your hands feel disgusting touching the greasy flesh and the smell doesn\u2019t make it easier. You lick the slimy sweat of kibas feet thinking it would make the stench go away. You put much effort into licking and swallowing the greasy slimy sweat hoping your master will give you a break for your hard work. You hear kiba moan and then speak. \u201cYeah good slave worship your gods stinky feet\u201d you look up and see kiba using his own hand to massage the bulge in his sweaty worn underwear.

Kiba spreads his toes and exposes a new set of slimy toe cheese. Your use your tongue and lick up all of kibas toe jam. It didn\u2019t taste as bad because it was fresh and there wasn't that much but the smell was till horrible. The same smell as before moldy cheese and vinegar. It takes you a few minutes to complete clean all of the sweat and junk form the first set and even longer from the second set. Those ones seems to hold a lot more toejam and sweat and just at smelly. Once you finished the second set you looked at kiba, he had his eyes clothes while rubbing his bulge through his boxers. You finished the last 2 sets and your stomach started the hurt either because of the cheese odor, the toe jam you ate, or the sweaty slime you licked up either way you where stuffed.

Your crawl out from under kibas rancid underwear and see kiba laying on the bed with his hands behind his head exposing his semi erect dick and Black Forest of pubic hair. You stare at kibas huge dick in disbelief. He\u2019s not even fully hard but it\u2019s so big.

Kiba picks you up and places you on his ball sacks now right in front of his circumcised cock. You could smell the sweaty stench emoting from his balls and pubes. Kiba strokes his own dick a few times before in sudden Movement kiba forces your face into his sweaty meat and starts rubbing you into the underside of his shaft. \u201cOh yeah slave your really good at pleasing you master, your the perfect jerk off tool!\u201d. He stops grinding you into his shaft and demands you. \u201cUse your hands and for now just massage my dick\u201d. You walk up to kibas huge stinking appendage and put your hands on the flesh. It\u2019s hot and sticky on your hands and the smell his balls and pubes are emitting is strong like pure sweat and man stench. After a while of massaging kibas dick he gives you a new command. \u201cAlright slave lick it\u201d kibas words set you off a bit you didn\u2019t wanna lick the monster thing but you had no choice. You stick out you tongue and give one long lick on the shat it was salty but didn\u2019t taste bad. You keep licking until you hear kiba moan. Now that kiba is fully erect is dick head starts to leak pre cum. The slimy liquid slides down Kibas dick and it reaches your tongue. The state is salty and pungent. While you lick the bottom of the shaft kiba starts jerking off the other half. He moans, \u201cYour tiny tongue feels so good on by hot cock slave keep licking\u201d. While you lick kibas moan grow louder and louder till he screams. \u201cHERE IT COMES SLAVE GET READY FOR MY CUM!!\u201d and with that announcement you feel kibas cock pulse and his balls tighten then rope after rope of hot ninja cum shots out his cock and lands on his chest. The streams get weaker and the rest falls down on kibas shaft. \u201cLick me clean then you can eat it off my abs\u201d. You obey your master and lick all the salty stringy cum off his now softening dick. Once you finish swallowing all the spunk kiba picks you up and places you on his 6-pack to clean it off. You lick the cum off his pack and the sweat from the mission. \u201cWow slave that was amazing, your gonna make a incredible servant from now on.\u201d \u201cThank you master\u201d you say in response to kibas praise. \u201cwell slave I don\u2019t know about you but I\u2019m beat I\u2019m going to bed.

Before you could question him, the 17-year old raised one of his bare feet and stomped down on you, crushing you against the wooden floor. You squirmed from underneath his smelly boyfoot as the red vested teen just laughed out loud. He raised his foot off you just enough to allow your hands to move. \u201cStart rubbing, puny!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts! I\u2019m the big guy here, so you have to do what I say. And I say, \u2018rub\u2019!\u201d Luffy ordered, still keeping his goofy tone of voice. He wiggled his toes, further urging you to get to work. You submitted and started to rub his sole with both hands. It reeked like the giant hadn\u2019t taken a bath in weeks, yet was also surprising soft like a little kid\u2019s. Soft or not, you knew he could probably crush you if he tried hard enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, my name\u2019s Monkey D. Luffy. Don\u2019t forget it again, slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuffy\u2026\u201d you repeated, not wanting to forget it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep. I\u2019m a pirate aiming to become the Pirate King.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPirate King?\u201d you repeated again. \u201cYou\u2019re a pirate?!\u201d You may have lost your memory, but you still knew what a pirate was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you got a problem with that?\u201d Luffy asked. You couldn\u2019t tell because his foot was in the way, but the pirate was grinning down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no. Not at all.\u201d you answered. Pirates were supposed to be dangerous; did that mean this guy was dangerous? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of rubbing the sweaty sole, Luffy lifted it up and was about to replace it with the other one when he noticed you had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Where\u2019d you go?\u201d Luffy wondered as he looked around until his eyes fell on his sole. You had become stuck to the sole and was carried up when Luffy lifted the foot off the ground. He chuckled and gently scraped you off his foot before placing his other one on you. \u201cNow do this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou complied and started rubbing again. You were glad the boy didn\u2019t wear boots or anything; his feet would probably be a lot more stinky if that were the case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026where are we, by the way?\u201d you asked, glancing around but not being able to see much other than the floor due to the foot that was pressing down on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot sure. Some town on some island. I just happened to stroll in and rent this room.\u201d Luffy explained, putting his hands on his hips and looking out a nearby window. \u201cIt\u2019s funny you don\u2019t even remember your hometown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean I used to live here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026yeah, a long time ago. I saved you from almost being stepped on and you\u2019ve been my slave ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026I\u2019ve always been this size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d Luffy said, continuing to lie to you. You somehow believed him, but were still cautious. After you had rubbed this foot enough, Luffy gripped you with his toes and picked you off the floor. He brought his foot up to his face and gazed at you, smiling very widely. He was very flexible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice job on the feet, puny. What should we do next?\u201d</span></div></div>",

But that didn't give you any comfort in this humiliation, his feet stunk and were sweating all over you. Every bit of sweat that formed between his toes and on his sole made contact with you. Your face being very close to his toe crotch, the sweat poured onto your face, in your eyes and in your mouth. It tasted bitter and salty and the smell wasn't too pleasant either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy seemed to notice your discomfort and giggled, \"Hee hee. I haven't bathed in ages, after all I am a pirate! Hope the smell suits you little slave!\" He said giving your head a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you-\" Just as you were about to ask him a question, a big droplet of sweat went into your mouth and you began to choke.

He took a huge smell of the sweaty pit and came out smiling, with grease smeared on his face of course! \"Mmmmmm.\" He said stretching his neck back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say you were a bit surprised at his stretching abilities.

Luffy strolled over to a corner of the room and picked up a small, blue bag. You thought the bag was his until he started pulling objects like pencils and notepads. Not things a pirate would have. You next though the bag could be yours, but that was impossible. It was way too big to be used by someone as tiny as yourself. After awhile, Luffy finally found what he was looking for and pulled out a candy bar. He threw the rest of the bag onto the floor without care and stared at the snack in his hand, licking his lips. The Straw Hat pirate quickly unwrapped the bar and brought the piece of chocolate up to his nose for a sniff. He seem to enjoy the smell just as much as his own pits\u2026which was weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as he took a bite of the bar and munched on it loudly, closing his eyes and moaning in delight. You stared up in envy, wishing the candy bar was yours (it actually was). Luffy suddenly opened his eyes and noticed your pleading stare. He swallowed the bite and looked down at you, his eyes staring into yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want some?\u201d he asked simply. You nodded instantaneously. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026you\u2019ve always licked up my sweat and toe jam for your meals. You\u2019ve rarely even had human food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but, Master Luffy.\u201d you whimpered, deciding on calling him that if you really were his slave. \u201cI\u2019ve already been exposed to tons of foot sweat. If I eat any now, it might make me sick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy seemed to think about this for a bit. He defiantly didn\u2019t want his new slave vomiting all over his foot. He had done a good job of rubbing his feet and he did make a good insole, so it couldn\u2019t hurt to give him  a small reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but just this once. Then it\u2019s back to salty sweat and toe jam!\u201d You smiled up in joy as your 17-year old master stretched his arm and plucked you out of his sandal. He dropped you on the other end of the candy bar and you found yourself hugging the piece of chocolate with glee. You licked the surface of it and an unimaginable taste filled your mouth. Since you couldn\u2019t remember anything, you wondered if you had liked the taste of chocolate. You couldn\u2019t see how you couldn\u2019t!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you licked and nibbled on one end of the bar, Luffy munched on the other loudly. He was enjoying it just as much as you were. It wasn\u2019t as good as meat, but it did taste good. You were so mesmerized by the chocolate bar that you didn\u2019t notice Luffy had eaten all but a small fraction of it: the fraction you were on top of!

You watch all of this with your mouth hanging open at Luffy's lack of care for you, but then you remember your place and bow your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy pats his stomach and says \"Mmm... that was tasty, not as good as meat though\", then he looks at you \"Hey slave, you like it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're still hanging upside down so its hard to talk, he notices this and throws you into then air then catches you and holds you the right way up. You recover from your dazed state and respond \"Yes master Luffy, thank you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... you've always loved the taste of my sweat, even more than human food... but now that you've forgotten how it tastes, how 'bout you try it again... I bet you'll love it even more than chocolate, lets see\" He smiles that impossibly large smile again and lifts the arm that isn't holding you. The putrid smell spreads almost instantly and when you get a whiff of it you gag and cough, you could feel the sweat in the back of your throat. Luffy chuckles at your reaction and starts moving you towards his pit. You gulp and get ready to get close to the sweaty pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closer you get, the stronger the smell gets, and just when you think you can\u2019t take any more you realize you're right in front of the sweaty skin of Luffy's hairless pit. Your face is millimiters away from the sweaty pit and you keep thinking that if Luffy shoves you in there you will pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start licking!\" Luffy shouts with joy. Not wanting master Luffy to be angry you nervously stick out your tongue and give the pit a small lap. The taste is horrible and just for giving it that small lap grease splatters all over your face, which eventually also falls into your mouth. Since you don't want to make Master angry, you continue lapping up the sweat. The more you lick the worse it seems to taste, until you get to a point where the taste makes you shudder and your face is completely coated in grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you're finally done licking the sweat out of his pit, your tongue feels so sore that you think its going to fall off. Luffy lowers his arm and brings you up to his face \"How was it, slave?\". You're still shuddering from the taste, but just to please him you say \"Y-yes master L-luffy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd like it... well how about we do something else?\" Luffy says smiling as lowers you to...</span></div></div>",

Your foot is good enough.\u201d you replied, taking another breath of the polluted air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly! My feet are nothing compared to my pits! Have a sniff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could utter another word of protest, Luffy stretched his arm down to grab you and then snapped it back up to his face. The sudden movement from the teen\u2019s feet to his face left you with a sense of vertigo. Before you could get your sense of direction fixed, Luffy shoved you head first into his sweaty armpit. Upon instinct, you took a breath through your nose an were almost paralyzed by the smell. He may not look like much of a pirate, but he sure as hell smelled like one. The smell made you want to be anywhere else but here and you struggled in Luffy\u2019s grip. He wouldn\u2019t let go and firmly held you against the slightly haired flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, Master Luffy! Get me out!\u201d you cried, wishing to plead more but couldn\u2019t since the young pirate shoved your face deeper into his armpit hairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter you take a big, long sniff. I\u2019ll take you out after that, I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated for a moment but decided to obey. You squeezed your eyes shut and took a good, long sniff of your master\u2019s pit. Your face went green halfway through and you tasted vomit in your mouth, which you painfully swallowed. You waited for Luffy to save you from your torture\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuffy, aren\u2019t you going to take me out?! You promised!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I? I don\u2019t remember saying that.\u201d Luffy replied, grinning impossibly wide before he started to rub you over every inch of his armpit. Your shouts were muffled by his damp skin as he used you like a deodorant stick. He eventually took you out and inspected your miniscule form. Your hair was covered in grease and your face looked pale. Once you were back in fresh air, it started to gain some of its color back. The Straw Hat captain brought you up to his nose and smelled you, rearing back in disgust afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you smell terrible! Almost as bad as a zombie, but they\u2019re a bit smellier. Trust me, I know!\u201d Luffy exclaimed, putting his hand on his hip and smiling as if he was proud to have smelled a zombie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-can we do something else now? Please?\u201d you begged to the giant pirate. For a second it looked like Luffy was thinking pretty hard, but his expression quickly went back to his playful grin. </span></div></div>",

And weren't you planning on going somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy scratched the back of his head, still with that grin plastered on his face. \"Well....Oh yeah!

You could only imagine how pissed off that would make the pirate\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay down there? You look a little green.\u201d you hear Luffy say from high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d you lie, not wanting to upset your mater. You watch as he shrugs off his worries and resumes eating. He\u2019s sitting at a table with piles of food gathered around him. He holds a big chunk of meat in his hand and fit\u2019s the entire thing in his maw before sucking it off the bone. After barely chewing the meat and swallowing, he picks up a giant bowl of rice and devours it in a few seconds. A big piece of fish is next, which he eats in two bites. You can only watch with hungry eyes as he pigs out. You\u2019re amazed at how fast he eats and wonder how he can eat so much and yet not gain any weight. This pirate was able to stretch himself, though, so it wasn\u2019t like he was normal\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so busy watching the giant feast that you didn\u2019t notice the stray piece of ham until it hit you in the face. With you hands pinned to your sides, you resorted to smelling the delectable piece of meat (which was like a double serving to you) and licking its juicy surface. You got about five licks in before it was taken away from you. Luffy had stretched his neck so he could bite the scrap off his toes. You watched almost tearfully as Luffy chewed the ham right in front of you before swallowing it. Traveled through his long throat and disappeared into his body. The teen saw your begging look and gave you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, were you tasting that? If you\u2019re so hungry, why not lick up my toe jam? There\u2019s plenty there for you.\u201d Luffy glances at his toes, which he wiggles a bit, before snapping his head back above the table. You turned your head to look at the crusty toe jam that has build up on Luffy\u2019s toes. It was the furthest thing from looking appetizing\u2026but you were SO hungry. Luffy said you could eat it, so it must be safe to eat\u2026right? You took a sniff of it; it smelled just like his rank feet. If you ate this stuff, there was a chance it would upset your stomach enough to make you puke again. This time, you might not be able to hold it in\u2026</span></div></div>",

Luffy wiggled his toes on your face letting his sweat fall in your mouth for the millionth time. You swallow your dignity (and his foot sweat) and attempt to take your first lick at the disgusting \u201cfood\u201d. Once you make contact with the gunk you instantly gag and choke on the taste. Luffys Toe-gam smelled the same as his unwashed feet but tasted MUCH worse. His toe gunk Tasted like moldy cheese that was marinated in sweat, extremely cheese and salty. Luffy hears you gag and in response says. \u201cHey slave you better not vomit on my toes, if you do I have to punish you to teach you a lesson\u201d. You rethink your decision because you weren\u2019t sure if you could eat even a few mouth fulls of the cheese junk without vomiting. While you listened to luffy eat his real food you lie there thinking and inhaling his funky sent. After giving it a thought you decided to try again to eat some of the \u201cfood\u201d provide by your masters toes. You stick out your tongue once more and lick the sticky cheese stuff from the toe gap. Getting a mouthful of the disgusting tasting gunk you try your best to swallow it down without gagging or vomiting. You manage to swallow the mouthful you had after a while. The fell of hit going down your throat was slimy and it burned going down. \u201cWow nice job slave you took it like a champ, there\u2019s plenty more though if your still hungry\u201d. You stuck your face into the gunk and took a few bites then put your head down to swallow the cheese substance. The second time wasn\u2019t as bad as the first time but it still pleasant. After getting used to the taste it was much easier to eat it without vomiting, still gagging though when you ate to much or the mouthful was just to cheese and salty. Minutes passed and you finished eating the toe jam form the first set of toes. Luffy sees this and speaks, \u201cwell done slave you must have been real hungry if you ate ALL my toe jam, I bet it was delicious.\u201d Luffy got up and tossed his plate in the trash. \u201c if your still hungry I\u2019m sure zoro has a lot of toe jam you can eat, and sanji might have some to!\u201d You nod in disagreement telling him you\u2019ve had enough. \u201cWell ok, since we both have full bellies we are going to do some training, it\u2019s real hot out and I\u2019m sure to work up a pretty good sweat\u201d. </span></div></div>",

Luffy started running to the training sight sweating hard and smiling knowing your drowning in the liquid. Your stuck in the hot smelly raunchy space inhaling the sent and drinking the salty sweat. You thought you yourself he\u2019s only running but he\u2019s sweating so intensely. After about 30mins of traveling to the training sight luffy finally made it. Already extremely sweaty and smelly luffy lifts the arm your under. \u201cHey there slave we just arrived at the training sight\u201d. Luffy too a sniff of his pit. \u201cPhew, I haven\u2019t even started training and I already reek. I don\u2019t see how you can stand it, get ready now the fun begins\u201d. Luffy but his arm back down eliminating the light and little fresh air you had. Luffy began training and sweating like never before. You where practically drowning in his pit sweat you had to swallow every few seconds just so you wouldn\u2019t die. The smell increased 10 fold from this point the once bearable oniony smell became a extremely smelly odor worse than his toe jam. While your clothes your getting drenched in his salty sweat you could feel your skin getting covered in his pit grease. Suddenly luffys stoped in his tracks causing you to become nauseous from the quick change in pace and the intense stink. Luffy spoke to someone you wasn\u2019t you. \u201cHey ZORO come spar with me!\u201d. Luffy called to another crew member Apparently named zoro. \u201cHey luffy I guess we can spar for a while but it\u2019s really hot and I reek so let\u2019s make it quick\u201d. You thought to yourself great now not only his he training he will be fighting with another crew member. Luffy and zoro began sparing and you where knocked around inside his sweaty pit. Your eyes started to water and sting from the sweat and you gaged at his rancid odor. Luffy was fighting hard with zoro both working up a intense sweat while you where close to vomiting several times. After about 45 horrible minutes there spar came to a end. \u201cWow zoro you really got  strong since the last time\u201d. \u201cYeah you did to you actually came close to beating me loser\u201d. \u201cWell I\u2019m going to go shower I\u2019ve been sweating buckets all day and I reek zoro said\u201d. \u201cAlight see you back at the shop buddy\u201d. Yeah later\u201d. Zoro said and left. Luffy brings is arm up and pulls you out his stinking sweaty pit. \u201cMan that was a great workout slave I really stink\u201d. He says taking a long hard sniff of his pit then sniffing you. \u201cYuck you smell worse than I do hehe, don\u2019t worry once we get back to ship you can shower but for now.\u201d Luffy lowers you to his feet and shoves you between his cheese toes while he makes his way to the ship.</span></div></div>",

While he runs sweat,dirt, and toe jam falls on your face covering you in slime and in your mouth making you gag and choke. \u201cAlright slave where at the ship but before you shower we have to make a pit stop. Not wanting to be stuck the cheese toe gap you grown but also get a mouthful of toe sweat for your troubles. Luffy knocks on a door but no one answers. He giggles and enters anyways. Luffy walks in and hears the shower running, you realize he\u2019s in zoros room looking for something. Luffy searches the room and finds a pile of clothes zoro had on while they spared. He searches through the pile of sweaty smelly clothes and finds what he is looking for. \u201cJackpot\u201d you hear luffy say he leaves zoros room and walks back to his own. Still inhaling the horrid scent of luffys toes he finally makes it to his own room where he sits on the bed and removes his sandals. \u201cAlrighty slave where finally back home and you can shower to get all my stink off, you really need It. Luffys grabs you from between his toes finally freeing you from the smelly prison. And with his other hand he grabs a small bottle from the floor and place you and the bottle on his bed stand. \u201cNow slave since you like sweat so much and I don\u2019t wanna waste any water on showering i thought of a alternative way for you to get clean hehe\u201d luffy reaches in his pocket and pulls out both of zoros stinking sweat soaked socks. Luffy takes a whiff of the socks and starts coughing. \u201c phew zoros feet smell much worse than mine probably because he uses she same socks all week and never takes of his boots\u201d. \u201cHere have a sniff I bet you\u2019d love them. Luffy tosses the rancid socks right on top of you. Your stuck under the rank cloth and you sniff, the smell was 100x worse than luffys toe jam. The once white socks was now blackened with yellow cheese spots and they where absolutely drenched in sweat. Luffy picks the socks of you also picks you up. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve hade a smell of his socks you can have your shower\u201c. With that luffy drops you into the bottle he placed earlier. He drops you down and you where still clueless to why he had zoros disgusting socks. Until you looked ups don saw luffy holding the socks above the bottle. \u201cHope you know how to swim slave hehe\u201d he shouts down to you. You finally know what he means when he began to wring the sweat out of zoros socks into the bottle. You started to panic because the bottle started to quickly fill with rank sweat straight from the rancid socks. The sweat started to rise quickly covering your knees fist. Then your waist, and then passing your shoulders and finally your head. In instant you where fully submerged in zoros socks sweat. You hold your breath and swim to the top of the bottle. Luffys wrings the last few drops of sweat from the socks and they fall on your head. The bottle was almost complete filled with rancid smelly socks sweat. \u201cWow Zoros socks sure did hold ALOT of sweat, it filed the whole bottle, enjoy for bath slave\u201d. Luffy then walked into the bathroom leaving you there swimming in sweat. You could barley stay above the liquid the sweat drenched your cloths almost forcing you to drown. The whole experience was horrible. The smell of pure foot sweat was absolutely disgusting. You couldn\u2019t find a way out of the glass prison. So you stay there marinating in the rancid liquid till luffy gets back.</span></div></div>",

However after a few minutes of this, he felt discomfort from having his feet still in his shoes, they were slightly too small for him, after his feet had grown since purchasing them, and thus wearing them all day had caused them to become sore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling his seat back, he pressed down upon the back of one shoe with the other, kicking it off, before doing so with the next one, and reached down and picked them up and tossing them aside, before he rolled his seat forward again, returning to his studies and letting out small sigh as he flexed his toes inside the socks, enjoying the feeling of freeing his feet after a long day at school<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Light's POV end</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped under a giant's socked foot. The sock itself was slightly damp from Light's sweat, to a normal person there wouldn't be too much of a smell unless they were right next to his feet, but to you at your size, the scent was magnified. Light's socks were filled with his natural foot scent, as well as the leathery scent of his school shoes, all of which was being forced into your nose as you couldn't move your hands up to block it, and any chance of breathing through your mouth was cut off, as soon as you opened your mouth to try, you were greeted with the taste of his sweaty sock entering your mouth and soaking into your tastebuds. </span></div></div>",

I think I\u2019ve worn these socks for a few weeks.\u201d Ash brought the sock up to his nose and breathed in deeply.

You\u2019re making a mistake, I\u2019m-\u201d you tried to finish, but was interrupted yet again as Ash dropped you through the opening of his footwear. Once you hit the soft bottom, your nose took in a big smell of the place and you plugged it from smelling any more. You were unable to stand up in the cotton prison and just sat there art the bottom, looking around for a hole or something. Even for socks that had seen a lot of action, you couldn\u2019t spot a single tear. Before you even thought about trying to climb out, you felt Ash move the sock elsewhere. When you saw the top open wider and the bare foot of the young preteen lower itself into the sock, you knew no amount of nose plugging was going to save you from the stench to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Ash slipped his foot all the way into his sock and felt your tiny body get pressed flat against his sole. The giant Pokemon trainer looked down at the bottom of his sock and noticed the imprint of your minuscule form jutting out from the white material. Ash just laughed at your pathetic state and placed both his socked feet on the floor. The next thing you knew, the giant was standing up and the true danger of being this size became known to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure Ash\u2019s foot was placing on you was intense. You felt your body compress under his sweaty foot as he tested out how much weight you could take. You screamed when the pressure reached a certain point, but only got foot sweat in your mouth. Now you were choking on salty liquid and getting crushed to death. All from a 10 year old. Things couldn\u2019t get any worse\u2026</span></div></div>",

He brought his foot up on his knee to see something that looked similar to Han Solo when he was frozen in carbonite in Star Wars. The back of your head could be made out through the soaked sock, along with the rest of your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh chuckled quietly as he stripped his sock off, which required some effort due to his sweat and the material acting as an adhesive together. <br>\r\nWhen it was finally off Ashie boy sighed a bigger sigh than before and spread his toes, letting the cool air blow between them. The cool air on his hot feet felt really good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you were, trying to peel yourself off of the youngster's sticky foot.

It tickled a bit and he giggled, both from the feeling and the knowledge that you had finally complied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween his toes, you were quick to start lapping up as much lint as you could. Ash had lessened the pressure on your head, but now you had to withstand a whole new torture. You tried to swallow the vile clumps of damp lint as soon as they entered your mouth, but found the taste just lingered on your tongue. The wet lint wasn\u2019t easy to swallow, either, and you actually had to chew some of it just to get it down into your stomach. Each time you did this, you resisted the urge to throw it back up. You were afraid of the giant youngster getting angry at you and squashing you between his toes, so you just forced your stomach to accept the \u201cfood\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, you found no more pieces of lint anywhere in your general vicinity It was now all inside your gut, giving you a stomachache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll done?\u201d Ash asked when he no longer felt your tongue brush against his skin. When he felt you nod, he brought his foot up against himself and pinched your head between his thumb and index finger. Slowly he peeled you off the sole, watching your shirt unstick itself from the sweaty surface. After you came off, he brought you up to his face and grinned toothily at you. You knew by the look in his eyes that this boy had only just begun\u2026 </span></div></div>",

He looks a bit frustrated for being interrupted. But he sighs and brings one of his shoes up to you. \"You'll stay in here while I'm downstairs.\" Ash says dropping you into the smelly shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are again greeted with the smell of the youngster's foot odor, the insole feels damp and squishy as if it contains some sweat itself. Ash looms over the shoe, staring down at you while he slips his feet back into those dingy socks he was wearing. <br>\r\nAsh stands up and walks out of the room without another glance to you. He closes the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you are assured that he won't be back for awhile, you crawl on all fours to the opening of the shoe and try to climb out.<br>\r\nLuckily for you one of his shoelaces is draped into the shoe, allowing you to climb out easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are out, you look around the messy room.

Delia, who was in the middle of washing the dishes, strolled over to the door and opened it. At the doorway stood Gary, another Pokemon trainer like her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, why if it isn\u2019t Gary! I haven\u2019t seen you come over here in such a long time!\u201d Delia exclaimed, inviting the preteen in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh called me over. Said he had something \u2019awesome\u2019 to show me.\u201d Gary told her as he walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really? I wonder what it could be?\u201d Ash\u2019s mom put a finger up to her chin as she thought. While she did this, Gary waved to her and made his way upstairs to his rival\u2019s room. When he reached the top, Delia was still standing in front of the door in a daze as she tried to recall anything \u2018awesome\u2019 her son had received. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary didn\u2019t know exactly which room was Ash\u2019s. He probably would have checked every room if he had not heard the boy\u2019s familiar voice behind a slightly opened door. Gary pushed the door all the way open and witnessed Ash standing in the middle of his room, repeatedly stomping his foot against the wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you regret trying to escape now, huh shrimp?\u201d Ash spoke to his shoe as he continued to punish the floor with it. He didn\u2019t notice Gary until the later closed the door of his room. \u201cOh, hey Gary! How are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSkip the formalities, Ash. What did you want to show me? I don\u2019t have all day; I\u2019m a very busy guy.\u201d Gary said as he folded his arms across his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, let me get him. You\u2019re gonna love him.\u201d Ash slipped his socked foot out of his shoe and picked the footwear off the ground. Gary watched as Ash turned the shoe around in his hand and something fell out of the opening. The ten-year old adventurer tossed his shoe away and grasped the object in his hand tightly. He approached Gary, who noticed he was holding something like a miniature person.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that a doll? You still playing with dollies, Ashie boy?\u201d Gary started to laugh hysterically until Ash shoved his \u2018doll\u2019 in his face. Gary got a better look at it and realized it was moving on its own. It seemed to be a very small teenager, perhaps a few years older than themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile being held in Ash\u2019s grip, you took in as much fresh air as possible. You knew by the way things were going that you weren\u2019t going to get much of it. After discovering you trying to escape, Ash had stuffed you back into his shoe and punished you by stomping you into the insole repeatedly. He might have been teaching you a lesson: try to escape again and he really will stomp you to death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you blinked your eyes open, you came face-to-face with another youthful boy. It was Gary Oak, Ash\u2019s long time rival. What was worse than one giant ten-year old? Two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh, what the heck is that?\u201d Gary asked, poking you with his finger to make sure you were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Team Rocket spy! I caught him sneaking around in my room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTeam Rocket? But\u2026he\u2019s not wearing a uniform.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh, because he\u2019s in disguise! He was going to steal my Pokemon. Too bad for him they aren\u2019t here right now.\u201d Ash grinned widely, taking pleasure in your ill luck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let me guess\u2026you\u2019re punishing him.\u201d Gary was still bewildered that his friend was holding a tiny person in his hand. Did Team Rocket really possess this kind of technology? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! Want to join in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary looked at you one more time, using his big, black eyes to gaze into your own small ones. You knew Gary was a lot more mature and serious than Ash. Sometimes it was hard to imagine that he was just 10. You hoped that the giant trainer could see the desperation in your eyes and realize the mistake his rival had made\u2026</span></div></div>",

Ash would usually get angry at the tone, but this time he didn\u2019t really care. He gave you one last grin before dropping you in front of the seated Gary. You stood up and almost immediately fell back down again as you stared up at the towering figure of Gary. The preteen trainer gave you an evil smirk as he raised both his damp, socked feet over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady for these bad boys, bug?\u201d Gary asked as he flexed his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026don\u2019t do this. I never did anything to you!\u201d you yell up at him, but he replies by scoffing and slamming one of his dirty socked feet on top of you. Your body was pinned under his sole while his toes casually gripped your head and smushed you into the fabric of the sock. The smell was far worse than Ash\u2019s and you wanted to wiggle free, but Gary was making it so you couldn\u2019t even move an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care. I\u2019m your god now and it\u2019s the job of subjects to please their gods.\u201d Gary explained to you as he smothered you under his sock, enjoying the feeling of your body under his control. After a couple minutes he took the sock off you and you were able to wobble back to your feet. This, however, made Gary displeased. \u201cDid I say you could stand, bug?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up, confused, just as Gary moved his foot in front of you and flicked your face with his big toe. It felt like something hard was just tossed into your head and you went flying back. After a few tumbled you came to rest directly between the socked feet of your other god, Ash. The black haired boy grinned down at you and hovered his foot over your fallen body. Instead of stomping down on you like you expected, he used the foot to kick you back over to Gary. You slid across the floor until the young Oak\u2019s foot stopped you. Once again you were smothered in wet, smelly sock and whimpered into the fabric. Your tears, however, were simply absorbed into the sock and added to the gallons of sweat that they had soaked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think there are any more tiny Rocket spies around?\u201d Ash asked his rival, glancing around suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d Gary responded, not really listening to Ash\u2019s question. He wasn't entirety convinced you were with Team Rocket, but that didn\u2019t bother him. All he cared about was that you were small and he was big. He loved being the big shot around town and now he had a tiny slave to worship him like a god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gary rolled you under his foot, he sighed and wiped his forehead. Looking at his sleeve, he saw it to be drenched in sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it supposed to cool down when night falls? Why is it still so hot?\u201d Gary complained as he wiped his sweaty palms on Ash\u2019s bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a massive heat wave.\u201d Ash replied, also looking quite sweaty. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help that my air conditioner is still in storage.

Right now, these kids didn\u2019t think of you as some shrunken human. You were just a stick of deodorant to be passed between them. Just like Gary, Ash twisted and dragged you all over his hairless pit. You were starting to get sick, but not just because of the smell or the taste of these boy\u2019s pit sweat. You were supposed to be older than them, but they were dominating you so easily. It was humiliating and you wished you were back home. Instead of answering your prayers, your giant god just mocked you some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it smell in there, shrimp? Worse than Gary, right?\u201d Ash asked as he smiled triumphantly. It wasn\u2019t enough that he was forcing you to smell his B.O., he had to torture you with words too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wish, Ashie boy!\u201d Gary taunted as he folded his arms across his bare chest. Even though he was having fun with him, Gary refused to be inferior to Ash in any way. Even if it involved who was smellier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, you were practically an expert on preteen perspiration. You where covered from head to toe in both youngster\u2019s sweat.

You were soaking up sweat in this pit for about five seconds before a knock on the bedroom door alerted the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you two doing in there? You sound like you\u2019re having a lot of fun.\u201d came the voice of Ash\u2019s mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re just talking about our travels, mom.\u201d Ash lied, knowing his mom would probably believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026and will Gary we spending the night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh glanced over at the other shirtless boy for an answer.

I\u2019d love to.\u201d Gary replied, giving a thumbs up to Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how wonderful! How many years has it been since you and Ash had a sleepover? I\u2019ll go make you boys a snack right away.\u201d Soon after saying this, Delia\u2019s footsteps could be heard leaving Ash\u2019s door. A few seconds later, however, they came back. \u201cBy the way, what\u2019s that awful smell? I can smell it from out here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026that\u2019s\u2026\u201d both boys stuttered nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew it, it\u2019s you boys! Just because you\u2019re off on your adventures doesn\u2019t mean you can neglect to bathe regularly. If you\u2019re going to be staying in my house, I want both of you to take a bath tonight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, but mom\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts, young man! What reason could you possibly have for smelling like a Skuntank?\u201d Delia shouted back, making both youngsters jump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, mom.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mrs. Ketchum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.

He was pressing you so hard into his flesh that you thought your face would break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, Ash. In this heat, we\u2019ll start sweating again in no time. Plus, a cold bath will feel nice on a night like this.\u201d Gary explained while fanning his face with his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d Ash replied, taking your tortured little body out of his pit. \u201cI\u2019ll take mine first so I can get it over with\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

You aren't scared of little old me are ya?\" Gary said bringing you closer to his face, ignoring the way you smelled now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't answer and shook even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cold or something?\" Gary said looking concerned, even though he really couldn't care less about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't answer, you were too scared. <br>\r\nGary sighed and lifted his arm, in turn causing you to struggle for freedom in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary just laughed quietly at your feeble attempts to escape. \"Don't worry squirt...This is just to make sure you won't get away while I do something.\" Gary said as he tucked you deep into his still sweaty armpit and lowered his arm, trapping you inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of running water could be heard from the bathroom down the hall, Ash probably would be in there awhile, unless he thought he could sneak some stink past his mom by not scrubbing very well.

You watched as he flexed his toes and you couldn\u2019t help but imagine yourself getting squished underneath them. It was certainly possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this!\u201d you yell at him, still showing some residence to your master. \u201cJust let me go before Ash comes back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlah, blah, blah! Stop complaining, shrimp.\u201d Gary responded as he slammed his heel against the bed, shaking it enough to make you lose your balance and fall onto your face. \u201cI don\u2019t really care what you want. What I want is what\u2019s really important here, and I want you to cool off my hot feet with your tongue. Before that, though, you can get used to them by giving them a good rub.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what? N-no!\u201d you decline and start to crawl back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, bug. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m forcing you against them or anything\u2026unless that\u2019s what you want.\u201d Gary smirked as he cracked his knuckles in an attempt to frighten you. It worked as you practically dove for his feet and started rubbing the sweaty sole. You watched Gary\u2019s expansive form lie back on the bed as gave a sigh of approval. The large boy focused on the feeling of your tiny hands rubbing his much larger feet. It wasn\u2019t the best foot rub, but yet it was also the best Gary had ever had (and trust me, he\u2019s had plenty). Gary Oak had always had people flock around him like a celebrity, but having a small human to worship him like this was one hell of a power trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could get used to this.\u201d Gary muttered as he closed his eyes and pictured himself doing all sorts of things to you. \u201cI wonder if Ashie boy would consider selling you to me. If not, I could always steal you from him. What\u2019s he going to do about it?\u201d Gary laughed out loud, his booming voice startling you a bit. \u201cWhat do you think about being my slave, buggy boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026uhh\u2026\u201d you don\u2019t know what to say, but your silence wasn\u2019t the answer Gary was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI asked you a question and I expect you to answer.\u201d Gary cracked an eye open and gave you a glare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026would love being your\u2026slave, M-Master Gary.\u201d you choke out the words like they\u2019re dirty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood answer.\u201d Gary took the foot you were rubbing and replaced it with the other. \u201cNow do this one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed his foot without anymore words being exchanged between you. Everything was silent except for your occasional cough as you took in too much of the young trainer\u2019s foot fumes. Once you had rubbed as much of the sole as possible, your god\u2019s voice spoke up once again\u2026</span></div></div>",

Were you really going to lick them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got your answer soon enough when Gary got impatient and thundered, \"Lick!\" causing you to rush over to his heel and begin lapping at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary chuckled in amusement as he leaned back against Ash's pillows and closed his eyes again, relishing in the power he held over a tiny human being. You however, were getting far less enjoyment out of this. The stink and heat coming off of Gary Oak's feet was tremendous, and the sweat tasted salty and burned your eyes when it seeped into them when you pressed your face against his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you had covered most of Gary's sole in saliva, after you did the same to the other foot he placed both feet flat on Ash's sheets and spread his toes invitingly. You looked pleadingly up at Gary's cruel, amused boy face. But he only glared at you, \"What? You thought you were done? Not a chance shrimp! Now get to licking my toe cheese outta there before I make you into a new batch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were approaching the gap between Gary's toes, Ash came in wearing pajamas. \"Hey Gary, your turn....And get your feet off my sheets! You're getting toe crap all over them!\" Ash yelled at Gary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blah blah blah. Whatever. Hey, since you're all cleaned up and won't be able to torture him for awhile, let me take him in the bathroom and use him as soap!\" Gary said, and without waiting for an answer, he swiped you up and ran into the bathroom and locked the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After locking the door, Gary grinned at you as he placed you on the sink. He walked over to the tub and turned on the warm water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Master Gary, you\u2019re not really going to use me as soap, are you?\u201d you ask, watching as Gary started to undo his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am, slave!\u201d Gary answered without turning around to face you. He then pulled down his pants and his underwear with them. You had a great view of his cute, young ass, but now wasn\u2019t the time to admire such things! You watched Gary reach for the soap dish and removed a small slab of soap from it. \u201cAshie boy hardly left me anything, see? That\u2019s where you come in!\u201d Gary put the soap back and turned to smirk at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary turned off the water once the tub was full and walked over to you. He snatched you into his fist and grinned amusingly as you struggled. The young trainer walked back to the bath and lowered himself into it. Once he relaxed into the water, with only his head and chest visible, he dropped you into the lukewarm water. After doing this, the giant squirted some shampoo in his hair and rubbed it in. Once his hair was covered in bubbles, he laid down in the water and let his hair rinse in the tub. This simple movement caused a large wave to sweep you toward the back of the tub. When Gary leaned back up, another wave sent you slamming face-first into his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, eager to be my soap, shrimp?\u201d Gary asked, picking you up in his giant hand. You saw that Gary\u2019s hair, usually spiky, was drooping wet and made him look much different. You didn\u2019t have mush time to take in the sights, however, as Gary quickly grabbed the small soap fragment in his other hand and mashed it into your body. He lathered you up with soap before slapping you once again against his hard chest. He dragged you across every inch of the smooth skin, making sure to clean it all. Knowing where he\u2019ll probably scrub next, you take a deep breath as Gary dunks you underwater and drags you across his flat belly. When you break the surface again, he lifts his arm and scrubs his armpit. He ignores your whimpers and soaps up his arm next. You\u2019re being given no time to rest in this ordeal as he switches hands and scrubs his other pit and arm. To finish up his upper body, and swings his arm behind him and washes as much of his back as he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick dip in the water, he brings you up to his grinning face and asks, \u201cHow are you holding up, soap?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026stop.\u201d you manage to whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop? Why would I stop when I still need to do my legs! Haha!\u201d Gary laughs as he uses the remaining soap bar to lather your body up more. Once you\u2019re ready, he lifts one of his legs out of the water and starts scrubbing his thigh. After that his knee, followed by a long drag down his leg to his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did a good job of licking my foot clean, but we still need to get between those toes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary forces your small, frail form between each one of his toes. You try and close your eyes and pretend your somewhere else, but it doesn\u2019t work so well. Toe jam gets all over your body and some smears over your lips. You accidentally take it in and groan at the taste. After getting between his last two toes, the giant preteen repeats the process with his other leg. When he\u2019s all done, he dips you in the water again and brings you up to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how was it, slave? Don\u2019t you feel squeaky clean now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough and splutter something Gary can\u2019t understand. While the water may be washing away all the grime you had picked up off of Gary\u2019s body, you don\u2019t feel the least bit clean. Not at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary pulls the stopper from the tub so the water can drain before standing up and exiting the bath. As he does this, you slip out of his soaked hand and land on the soft rug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops, sorry about that, shrimp!\u201d Gary mocks as he grabs a towel. You stare up at your young god as he dries off his hair and body before wrapping the towel around his waist. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I have to get some pajamas out of Ash\u2019s room. You just sit tight and don\u2019t move!\u201d Gary warns you as he leaves the bathroom, leaving the door open a crack. Despite his warning, you wobble to your feet and set your eyes on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to get out of here. I\u2026have to find a way back to normal!\u201d you say to yourself as you wobble weakly over to the door. Being used as soap by a giant boy was not a fun experience and it\u2019s left your body very weak. While your muscles scream at you to stop, you push yourself to the door in hopes of escaping these two cruel trainers. </span></div></div>",

Ever since Ichigo had seen you, he had decided that he wanted to have the best time that he could. So, he had snuck into Urahara's shop the day before, planning to steal a specific item. As you continued to rub, Ichigo popped the lid off of a small bottle which contained a weird, greenish liquid. Without hesitation, he drank the whole bottle, and dropped it on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo smirked. \"Nothing. Focus on what I ASKED you to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he asked, you started rubbing once again, not wanting to disappoint the massive teen in front of you. Meanwhile, Ichigo waited for the that serum to take affect. Soon, he would be unbelievably huge! You'd soon be more like a bug compared to him! Ichigo smiled as he began to feel his clothes tighten around his body. His pecs slowly pushed out, and part of his six-pack became seeable as a thin strip of skin was revealed where his t-shirt once covered. Soon, his biceps jutted out, ripping the side of his sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's thighs grew wider and lengthened, and his calves did the same. Small, oval like holes soon appeared all over his jeans as he continued to grow, while his massive bulge became unbelievably noticeable. As you continued massaging his feet, you had to constantly back up, which was getting annoying. You could hear the sound of fabric stretching and ripping, but couldn't see a thing because Ichigo's massive foot was blocking your way. For some reason, his foot seemed bigger than before.

You panicked, thinking this to be some sort of whacked out Sonic version of The Ring, then you saw a grassy field in the middle of the ring, you felt yourself drawn against your will towards the television. You tried to stop yourself but you couldn't help but reach out and touch the middle of the ring. When you did you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke to the sound of thunder, it was like it was inches away from you, fearing that a terrible storm was going to hit, you opened your eyes and tried to get up. However the sky was a beautiful blue, cloudless. You looked around as you sat up, two large mountains colored red and white stretched up on either side of you into the clear blue sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the thunderous sound again, this time directly above you, and you felt something wet dripping on your head. You reached up and felt the top of your head and pulled your hand back in disgust, it was covered in a slimy.......spit? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked directly above you and there, grinning down at you, drooling on you and chuckling madly, was your beloved Sonic The Hedgehog!

Should you try talking to him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026S-Son-\u201d you stuttered to say, but stopped when you noticed Sonic preparing to spit on you again!

You not realized that Sonic was a danger to you and did the only thing you could think of: run for the hills. It didn\u2019t go very well, though, as Sonic easily snatched you up between his thumb and index fingers. He WAS the fastest thing alive, after all. \u201cAnd where do you think you\u2019re going, little guy?\u201d Sonic brought you in front of his face and smirked at your tiny form.

Basically, I took this ring here\u2026\u201d Sonic bent down and grabbed a small ring identical to the one that was on your television screen. \u201c\u2026and used it to bring you here while also shrinking you. Tails is a genius when it comes to these things\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it\u2026why would Tails made something like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic raised an eyebrow as you asked this. He was curious as to why you acted like you knew Tails so well, but shrugged it off and replied, \u201cBecause ever since we came to this world, all the humans have been so much taller than us. Even the kids are taller then me! So, Tails and I decided to get ourselves a little slave to make us feel BIG, if you know what I mean. We couldn\u2019t just make a shrink ray, though. People would notice when someone suddenly vanishes. You, however\u2026you\u2019re not from this world.\u201d Sonic cracked an evil grin. You couldn\u2019t believe the words that came out of his mouth. You were still having a hard time grasping your new situation. One minute you were  normal twelve-year-old about to watch Sonic X, and the next you\u2019re being enslaved by the main character?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a bit to take all this in.

Heh heh!\" Sonic chuckled as he finally managed to pull his right shoe off with a <i>pop!</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighs in enjoyment as he wiggles his toes in the air, spreading and allowing a cool breeze that conveniently blows to pass between them. This breeze however passes the raunchy odor even quicker than normal over to you. And boy is raunchy the correct word!

YOU\u2019RE the one that needs to cool of, but Sonic only seems to care about his own needs. Sonic starts to reposition his feet so one of them is standing on its heel and directly in front of you. You stare up at it in awe; it\u2019s like a big, blue building! At your size of a mere inch, Sonic\u2019s foot is unbelievably huge!

How is someone as small as you supposed to clean my gigantic feet? You won\u2019t know until you try, so get trying!\u201d Sonic stomps the earth with his other foot, scaring you enough to make you dash over to the foot in front of you. You stop when reach his massive heel and begin touching it. Despite being a blue hedgehog, Sonic\u2019s skin feels very human. As you pull you hands away, you feel them unstick from Sonic\u2019s sweaty foot. You look at the thick, gooey liquid that covers your hands. You have to LICK this stuff? \u201cHurry up, slave, before I get angry again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot liking an angry Sonic, you press yourself against the filthy heel and begin licking. Sonic sighs in contentment as he feels your nice, cool tongue flick against his hot foot. You, on the other hand, groan in disgust as you taste the teen\u2019s sweat coats your tongue. You have to put up with it or else Sonic will dispose of you, so you continue to lick as much of the foot as you can. Eventually, you\u2019ve licked as much of Sonic\u2019s foot as you can from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing a swell job, little buddy. Now start climbing!\u201d Sonic orders as he flexes his foot, showing several curves in his sole. At your size, these curves are like ledges for you to hold onto. You do as Sonic commands and start to climb the wall of blue flesh, licking as you go. Sonic moans as he feels your tongue brush against the more sensitive parts of his foot. You climb up the foot as if it was a rock wall, your clothes quickly becoming soaked with the giant\u2019s sweat. The raunchy smell fills your nose and a few times it dazes you enough that you lose your balance and almost fall. Somehow, you manage to stay on Sonic\u2019s foot for a full half-hour, licking it as if it was some kind of giant candy. If it was candy, whoever made it should be fired and shot\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget my toes, little man.\u201d Sonic reminds you, wiggling his toes and causing a few crumbs of toe gunk to fall off. A few of these boulder-sized chunks almost hit you, but you manage to avoid them. You climb up tot eh top of Sonic\u2019s foot and make your way to the crevice between his big and index toes. You look into the space and almost puke at the sight. Blackish toe jam has filled the spaces between each of Sonic\u2019s toes. The stuff reeks of sweat and moldy cheese, but you know you have to clean between his toes as well. Gulping hard, you approach the large pile of filth and begin licking it up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is disgusting\u2026why is Sonic making me do this?\u201d you ask yourself after swallowing some of the gross toe jam. \u201cCan\u2019t he do this himself? He seems to like the taste\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMake sure to get between all of them, slave.

The several mile run would usually take a car several hours, but for Sonic it only took a few minutes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to show Tails his invention worked. He\u2019s going to be so-\u201d Sonic stopped when he noticed he was running toward a train track and a train was just coming into view. Instead of crashing into the train like something going his speed should do, Sonic effortlessly comes to a complete stop inches from the moving train. He places his gloved hands on his hips and whistles as he waits for the train to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you holding up, human?\u201d Sonic asks as he looks down at his shoe and squeezes your head with his blue toes. He feels you struggle against his grip fruitlessly and it makes him smirk. \u201cTell you what, kid. I\u2019ll take you out if you start licking\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic waits for a few seconds, not feeling anything but your struggles. Suddenly, he feels something small and wet slurp against the crevice between his toes and it makes him shudder with delight. That was too easy. His new human slave was already starting to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha\u2026good slave. But you know\u2026\u201d Sonic watches as the train finishes passing him and speeds off into the distance. \u201c\u2026I lied.\u201d Sonic hears a small scream from under his foot before he takes off once more, running across a nearby lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic soon arrives at Tails\u2019 workshop and switches to a walking pace as he makes his way inside. The workshop is pretty large and filled with mountains of tools and devices. It\u2019s such a mess that even though Sonic couldn\u2019t see his fox friend anywhere, he was probably hidden somewhere by a tower of junk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Tails! You here? I have some good news for you, buddy!\u201d Sonic shouts as he walks deeper into the workshop. He notices your struggles have died down a bit and he flexes his toes around your head to check if you\u2019re still alive. Sure enough, he feels some movement in his shoe as you beat against his toes. Having a tiny slave was going to be so much fun\u2026</span></div></div>",

Did the ring work?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic greeted his friend and began explaining all about you and what he'd done to you. Tails' grin got bigger and bigger with every detail, once Sonic was finished with his story. Tails inquired as to where you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wore him as my insole on the run over here! Wanna see him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy would I!\" Tails said eagerly, he tossed his goggles somewhere in a pile of junk and sat down on the floor with Sonic as his bud began to slip off the shoe containing you. Once it was off, Tails stuck up his nose at the rank odor that steamed off of Sonic's foot. But out of respect for his older friend he didn't say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic sighed and wiggled his blue toes in the air, feeling slime and sweat slosh between them. It'd been so long since he'd bathed, and he was planning on making it even longer, just to torment you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic put his foot down, and Tails looked closely. There wasn't anything in his toes though. \"Um...Sonic...There's no one in there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" Sonic pulled up his foot with his hands and inspected it. Sure enough, you weren't on his foot anywhere. \"Hmm...He's probably in my shoe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when Sonic shook his shoe upside down, you fell out onto his palm. \"Hey squirt! Thought you'd escaped! But then what are the chances of that huh?\" Sonic chuckled as he curled his tree trunk like fingers around you. You whimpered as Tails scooted over to get a look at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be so much fun Sonic!\" Tails said after looking at you for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Sonic smirked as he pulled off his other smelly shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails chuckled and pulled off his own shoes, revealing his own overworked sweaty bare feet. \"Ahhh...My feet are soooo sore from working in this lab all day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic grinned, \"How about we have our little bug slave give us both foot rubs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea Sonic!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard this of course, and didn't want any part of going back to Sonic's feet, you didn't want the new experience of Tails' feet either! However it wasn't like tinies got a choice in what they did when they were slaves to giants.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve already played with him, and I was the one who created the ring! Why do you get to go first?\u201d Tails\u2019 questioned, clearly not happy. Sonic just rolled his eyes and stuck a finger in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, little buddy. I\u2019m older so I\u2019m the Elder Master to this bug. Besides, don\u2019t you want to watch him rub my feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Tails looked down at you and then at Sonic\u2019s big, sweaty soles. \u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve always wanted to see one of these humans put in their place.\u201d The young genius\u2019s blue eyes gleamed as he imagined all the fun they were going to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2026start rubbing! It should be easy for someone who\u2019s already licked me feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped continued to shake as you looked over the large feet in front of you. Even though you had licked them\u2026even though you had suffered underneath them\u2026they were STILL not a sight you could get used to. Nevertheless, you couldn\u2019t refuse Sonic\u2026your master. Bad things would happen if you went against their orders\u2026very bad things. You reluctantly walked over to Sonic\u2019s left sole and started rubbing. The teenaged hero grinned toothily as he felt your small hands rub against his soft, greasy soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026just like that\u2026a little to the left, though.\u201d Sonic hummed and leaned back, loving the feeling of being treated like this. Tails just sat there with his legs crossed; his sky blue eyes fixed on you. He couldn\u2019t wait to have you rub his equally sweaty orange soles. The little fox boy giggled to himself, making you a bit nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Son-I mean-M-Master, this smell is t-terrible\u2026\u201d you complained while coughing. You didn\u2019t get an answered and looked up, past the male\u2019s chest, to see that Sonic\u2019s face high above. His eyes were closed and his mouth was curved into a smile. He either couldn\u2019t hear your petty complaints or just didn\u2019t care. You sighed with aggregation. You walked over to his other foot and proceeded to rub that. The toxic smell leaking of f the blue foot was intense; it made you sweat and your eyes water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt a warm and stale air hit you in the back. You turned around to see Tails\u2019 gigantic face inches from you. You shrieked and backed up against Sonic\u2019s sole. Tails chuckled childishly and stared at you while he laid on his fluffy belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you\u2019re so small\u2026that ring worked like a charm!\u201d Tails laughed again, blowing hot air into you as he did. Sonic, upon noticing there was no rubbing going on, looked down to see what the problem was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Tails, don\u2019t bug the slave when he\u2019s trying to work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww\u2026but Sonic, I want a turn now! I\u2019m his giant master too!\u201d Tails grinned widely and sat up; his large, orange-furred body rising before you like a mountain. You couldn\u2019t believe this giant fox was just eight-years-old! To think such a young kid had ruined your life\u2026and now you had to rub his feet?!</span></div></div>",

You slowly open your eyes and look around. \"W-where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully got to your feet and looked around. How odd. Everything seemed to...huge! You could make out a massive bed in one corner, a huge sock was laying almost right next to you, a gigantic desk was in another corner, a truly gargantuan closet was slightly open, clothes spilling out from it, and the carpet you were standing on came up to your waist! You were truly tiny, that much was clear. The only question was...how? You closed your eyes and thought back to what you had been doing. You were on your computer in your room...a quick glance revealed that this was, indeed, NOT your own room. You had been surfing the web, checking out a bunch of different sites, while watching Yu-Gi-Oh on the T.V. and your computer had started freaking out. The monitor had blinked and started making an electronic buzzing sound, smoke had started pouring out of the tower, the lights in your room had started flickering and the volume on the T.V. had increased to the point of it being screamingly loud. The next thing you knew you had felt an immense pressure in your head, you had fallen over onto your back and blacked out. Waking up, this is what you found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So something my computer did made me shrink...I guess...\" you said to yourself, pacing a little. \"But it also transported me somewhere...but where....and how was all of this even possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even begin to figure out an answer to this burning question the door behind you opened up with a bang. You jumped and looked behind you. There was a pair of massive bare feet just in front of you, the toes rising up twice your height! It really helped to truly showcase just how small you were. Your eyes traveled up, past a towering pair of jean clad legs, to a t-shirt covered torso, two strong arms hanging on either side of it, a dog tag of some kind dangling from this giant's neck, a mop of dirty blond hair on his head. Wait a minute...this outfit...that hair...could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Joey?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mistaking it. This towering behemoth was none other than Joey Wheeler....or...Katsuya Jounouchi...or whatever you wanted to call him. Aside from him being a giant of immeasurable proportions to you he was also quite fictional, making this situation even more insanely crazy than it already was. Somehow your computer managed to knock you out, shrink you, and transport you into a fictional T.V. show all at once. Your brain hurt even trying to think up a logical explanation for it. You sighed and just shook your head. Whatever. You're just going to have to deal with this. You looked up again and saw that Joey was looking around his room, not moving from his spot. It didn't take him long to find whatever it was he had been looking for, and he moved over to it. You could only look up in awe as you saw his massive foot lift from the ground, pass over your head and land with earth shaking force dozens of feet away. The second foot followed suit, propelling this massive teen forward to his desk. He sat down and turned on a lamp, pulling out his deck of cards and shuffling through them. This was as good a time as any! He was distracted! You had to get his attention before he started moving around again! You began to run as fast as you could toward his desk, the waist high carpet making it difficult to move. You rand and ran and ran but you never seemed to get any closer.  You stopped to catch your breath, the desk still so far away. This was ridiculous. But you had no other choice. You kept at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Joey was at his desk for quite a while, swapping out cards and thinking up strategies. It took quite awhile, but you managed to reach the desk. You slumped against the chair leg, catching your breath again, before heading over to the foot. You touched it, the skin soft with a slight scent of male body but no visible stink. He had probably recently showered. You pulled back your fist and punched the foot. Nothing. Not even a twitch. Okay...new plan! You leaned forward and bit the foot as hard as you could. This seemed to register as the foot twitched and Joey scooted his chair back, looking down at his foot. What does he see?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Joey looked down underneath his desk, you thought you had been successful in getting his attention. You hoped the giant blond could help you; both in getting you back to your world and protecting you from the many dangers of this gigantic one, himself included. You watched Joey lean down from his seat and reach a hand toward the floor. You thought he was about to grab you and braced yourself to be held by those tree-sized fingers. Unfortunately, Joey\u2019s fingers just missed you and instead scratched the spot where you had bitten him. After a couple seconds the giant duelist leaned up straight again, pushed his chair back in, and went back to fixing up his deck. Damn it all, he hadn\u2019t seen you! You were just too puny and blended in well with the teen\u2019s rug. If Joey had laid eyes on you, he probably thought you were just a speck of dust or something that was hardly worth his attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do now?\u201d you ask as you lean your back against Joey\u2019s foot and rack your brain. If only you could make it easier for Joey to spot you. \u2026that\u2019s it! He didn\u2019t see you before because you were hidden by the rug, but if you were to climb on top if his foot, he would have to see you! Your brightly colored clothes would stick out against his peach-colored skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and faced the boy\u2019s bare foot. Setting your mind to the task, you spread your hands over the soft skin and dug your nails into it. You began to climb, pressing your small body against the foot for support. Joey was completely oblivious to you scaling his foot; your fingers pressing into his skin didn\u2019t even register to the titan. Your first attempt to the climb the foot didn\u2019t go so well. You accidentally slipped soon after starting and fell back onto the rug. Knowing you couldn\u2019t give up, you tried a second time. You managed to climb half-way up the foot, but Joey happened to move his foot before you could reach the top. This simple movement flung you right off his flesh and sent you plummeting to the ground. Luckily, the rug was soft and softened the impact. As you laid there, recovering from the fall, you wondered if you could do this. No\u2026you had to! Joey could get up at any moment; this was your best chance to get his attention. You jumped back to your feet and rushed over to the foot once again. You put all your energy into climbing as fast as you could; time was limited. As the saying goes, third time is the charm. You manage to scale the entire foot and roll onto the top of it. You lay there for a moment to catch your breath and stare up at he huge behemoth. You started to wonder\u2026what if he still didn\u2019t see you? What if he reached down to scratch his foot again but didn\u2019t look down when he did it? His massive fingers might crush you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026I can\u2019t think about that right now.\u201d you tell yourself as you flip onto your stomach and prepare to take another bite out of the young duelist\u2019s foot. Before you can\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat should do it!\u201d you hear Joey say high above you. It was the first time you heard the giant speak. Suddenly, Joey scooted out of the desk and stood up, the slight motion causing you to start rolling down his foot. Before you could tumble over the edge and put all your hard work to waste, you quickly grab onto the small hairs that protrude from Joey\u2019s foot. This stop\u2019s your movement, but not his! Joey pushes his chair back into his desk, slips his deck into his pocket, and starts walking. Every rise and decent of his foot threatens to propel you right off it, but your grip on his foot hairs prevents that. You feel like you\u2019re on some kind of theme park ride\u2026without the safety measures! Thankfully, the ride is brief as Joey is only walking over to his bed. He seats himself down upon the comfy mattress and reaches over to the nightstand nearby. What\u2019s he reaching for?</span></div></div>",

There was nothing you COULD do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! HEY! JOEY! LOOK DOWN HERE! ON YOUR FOOT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour screams might as well have been whispered. Your voice must have sounded like a pathetic squeak to the mountainous teen. The sock was bigger than a circus tent, slowly laying down on the ground in front of Joey's gigantic toes. You could only stare as the cotton prison slid slowly over the foot, rising above your head, the heel lifting slightly to allow the garment to clothe the entire foot. As soon as he pulled it up the ceiling descended on you, pinning you to the top of the foot. The heat was intense, your tiny body pressed into Joey's warm, heated foot. This wasn't good...you were already starting to sweat! How long could you last in here? You could hear the springs on the mattress uncoiling, indicating Joey was standing up. He began to walk, your sweaty hands starting to lose your grip on the slightly oily hairs. This was getting worse by the second! You couldn't hold on like this forever! Joey walked for a few minutes, each step shaking you like an earthquake, before stopping. Thank goodness! You were starting to relax again when everything went dark around you, the heat increasing exponentially. What the heck? What was going on? You tried to look and then it hit you. It was so obvious! Joey was putting his shoes on! Damn! He was leaving the apartment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joey ran down the stairs, then down the street, the heat in his shoe started to become unbearable. Huge globs of sweat started forming, running down his foot. You were sweating yourself, your body and clothes dampening. Suddenly, a drip of sweat ran over you, soaking you to your skin and rolling past. You were now saturated in the duelist's sweaty scent. It was cloying but his foot wasn't dirty so the smell was bearable. Still, it was not a pleasant feeling to be covered head to toe in sweat, baking in an oven like environment. At least things couldn't get much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, life loves to prove you wrong today. Joey stumbles over a crack in the sidewalk, jostling his foot more roughly than with just a simple walk. Joey quickly catches himself and keeps walking, forgetting the incident almost instantly. To you, however, it was a devastating event. Before you even knew what was happening, you were tossed head over heels into the air, your sweaty hands slipping cleanly off the hairs, tumbling down his foot. Suddenly, the foot ended beneath you as you tumbled off the skin between Joey's toes, falling through the air, the two towers of toe flesh falling upward past you. You felt your body go limp. You'd heard that, if you ever fell a great distance, making your body totally limp could save you from death. It seemed to work quite nicely. You bounced off the bottom of rubber shoe and landed between Joey's toes. With every step, you rolled up the toe section before being slammed into Joey's sweaty feet. Back and forth this went, over and over again, until Joey mercifully stopped. You took a deep calming breath and instantly regretted it. The air was stale, hot, and filled with the scent of sweat. What was it, a hundred degrees outside? Why did Joey stop anyway?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you laid there at the bottom of the sock and between Joey\u2019s massive toes, you started to hear him talking to someone. The thick walls of the shoe muffled his voice, so you couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying. Honestly, you didn\u2019t care. You just wanted him to take off his shoes and socks so this hellish ride would end. After a couple minutes, Joey stopped talking but continued to stand in that same spot. What was he waiting for? Perhaps he was talking to a clerk of some kind and was now waiting for them to get back? A few more minutes passed and you could tell the blond giant was starting to get impatient. He began tapping his foot against the ground, unknowingly tossing you around again and slamming you against his raunchy feet some more. Finally, after about ten minutes, Joey started talking again and you heard something like a paper bag being grabbed. You didn\u2019t have long to wonder what it was, however, because Joey was on the move again! His foot lifted into the air, flinging you into the crevice between his toes, and then dropped down, causing you to hit the rubber bottom of the shoe. This happened again and again as Joey walked down the sidewalk. That short stop had been somewhat nice, but now it was back to this. It wasn\u2019t all bad, though. At least you weren\u2019t under the ball of his foot and being crushed by it. That would probably hurt\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey made his way back to his apartment, although you didn\u2019t know this. By the time he unlocked his door and opened it, you were barely conscious. The whole ordeal had been very tiring and you regretted every climbing on top of his foot. If you had just stayed on the floor, this wouldn\u2019t be happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt Joey stop again. As you got started on guessing the reason, you felt your world shift as Joey stepped out of his shoe. You saw the shadow of something pass over you and then grip the end of the sock. It was Joey\u2019s hand, and he was taking off the socks! You quickly grabbed handfuls of the cotton material and when Joey tugged his sock off, you went along with it. The skilled duelist carelessly tossed his sock away and walked away. When the coast was clear, you quickly crawled toward the opening of the sock and leaped out of it. You smiled happily as you took in a big breath of fresh air. No more giant, sweaty foot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly remembered your original objective and glanced around. It looked like you were in a giant kitchen. You spotted Joey nearby, standing at the counter and opening something. Since he was acting so casually, you guessed you must be in his apartment again. You watch from a safe distance as the towering teen turns around and strolls over to the kitchen table. In his hands are a paper cup filled with soda and what looked like a small bowl of chicken. It all suddenly becomes clear. Joey must of went out to pick up lunch somewhere and bring it back home to eat. All that torture you went through\u2026just because he felt like going out for lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey seated himself at the table and began chowing down on his lunch. Those pieces of chicken looked like they were covered in some kind of sauce, and boy did they look good. Joey was certainly enjoying them, judging by the way he hungrily stripped the meat of the bone. You caught a whiff of the chicken and started to drool. You needed to get his attention\u2026maybe he\u2019ll share his lunch with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes traveled underneath the table where you spotted Joey\u2019s two bare feet. As much as you detested them and wished to stay clear of them, you knew you had to get Joey\u2019s attention somehow. Thankfully, the kitchen floor was made up of white tiles, so if you tried biting his foot again he should spot you this time. You dashed under the table and made your way to the titan\u2019s feet. You messed up before, but now you were defiantly going to get his attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026or so you thought. The truth of the matter was, as soon as you got within a yard of those two giant feet, you knew you weren\u2019t going to be able to get his attention. No longer did the feet smell simply of male, but they now reeked! The short time they were in his socks and shoes had turned them into smelly, sweaty monstrosities. You weren\u2019t getting near them...and you defiantly weren\u2019t biting them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is this happening to me?\u201d you ask yourself as you fall to your knees. \u201cIt\u2019s just one stroke of bad luck after another! I\u2019m never going to get his attention! Lady Luck must have some grudge against me.\u201d You look down at the floor, stand up, and begin walking away from the feet. You needed to think of a new plan, and being near those raunchy things wasn\u2019t going to help keep your head straight. As you came out from under the table, you muttered, \u201cPlease just help me here! All I\u2019m asking for is a tiny bit of luck. Throw me a bone, already!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.\u201d you heard Joey curse above you. When you looked up to see what had happened\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*WHAM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey had dropped a chicken leg\u2026which had fallen right on top of you. The bone end of it had whacked you hard, knocking you out cold. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, you had ended up underneath the meat part of it. When Joey reached down and, just like his mother told him not to, picked the chicken leg up\u2026you came with it. Lady Luck must really, REALLY hate you\u2026or she\u2019s just a bitch.</span></div></div>",

You must have had one massively weird dream...oh yeah...you dreamed you had shrunk and got transported into the Yu-Gi-Oh universe. You snorted and laughed a little. How silly. Like something like that was even possible. You sighed and opened your eyes slowly, a bright light shining in your eyes. Early morning light always shined directly on your face. You blinked a few times and saw a strange, orb high above you, shining light down. It almost looked like a ceiling light but...it was way too big and bright to be a ceiling light though. You looked around and saw a massive dresser, a huge bed, a floor that was sooo far down...oh crap. It wasn't a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat up and saw you were laying down on a bed of cotton, inside a tiny box. Well, tiny to a normal human. It was quite comfortable for the teeny tiny you. There was no way this was an accident. You couldn't see him around, but Joey MUST have spotted you and put you here. The door suddenly opened and Joey appeared with a bottle cap and a a small amount of food in each hand. He walked over to the desk and sat down, setting the things in his hand down before looking carefully in the box. He grinned when he saw you were awake and said, \"Hey! You're finally awake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was deafening. You held your ears and shouted, \"Damn! Not so loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey frowned a little and then whispered, \"Sorry...I didn't think that would be so loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and shouted, \"It's okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey pointed at a small pile of chicken sitting next to a bottle cap full of water. \"Here. I got you some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eagerly jumped off the make shift bed and started eating the food. You had to lower your face to the surface of the bottle cap water and slurp it up to get a decent drink. Joey just watched you with an amused look on his face as you ate and drank. Soon, the chicken was gone and most of the water with it. You sighed and leaned back against the cap, happy that you finally got some food and that Joey was paying attention to you. You looked up and jumped a little seeing his massive face staring down at you. You looked into his eyes and said, \"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey whispered, \"Well, who are you? Why the heck are you so small? Where did you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up and said, \"First, can you tell me how I got here on the desk? The last thing I remember is getting hit on the head by a giant chicken bone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey laughed a little and said, \"Yeah, sorry about that. After I picked it up I noticed that you were stuck in the meat. You're lucky little guy! I almost ate you alive! I thought you were a dirt speck or something on my food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped and laughed weakly. \"Y-yeah...Thanks for making this bed up for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey gave a thumbs up and said, \"No problem! I couldn't just leave you on the cold wood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as Joey scooted closer. \"Now it's your turn. Who are you and where did you come from? Why are you so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged and said, \"You're not going to believe this, but here goes: My name is Daniel, I have no idea how I got so small, and I come from a different universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey blinked a few times and then started laughing, loudly. It ran through your body and made your ears hurt. He eventually stopped and said, \"Oh man! Sorry little guy but that's just nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? And your life has been perfectly normal right?\" you countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey thought about it for a second then said, \"Yeah...I guess you're right. Anyway, I'm not sure I can do anything to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded sadly. \"I'm just glad you finally found me. I was worried I might get crushed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey smiled and said, \"Don't worry. I'll take care of you for as long as it takes! Consider yourself lucky you ended up with me little guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as Joey flashed another thumbs up. He was a little goofy and a little dumb but he was a good guy. You felt like you were in capable hands.</span></div></div>",

Your face was also covered in sauce from the chicken you had just eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like someone needs a bath.\u201d Joey says. You notice his eyes are staring right at you and you look down at yourself. He\u2019s talking about you, and boy is he right. You stink like chicken\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I do\u2026but how am I supposed to do that at this size?\u201d you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, little guy. Joey has a plan!\u201d the blond teen replies proudly as he lowers is hand into the box and pluck you up. He placed you in the palm of his other hand and heads over to the of the two doors in his room. This door connects to a bathroom and a pretty small one at that. After switching on the lights, Joey places you on the sink and turns the water on. You now understand that you\u2019re going to be bathing in the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026is it really okay for me to take a bath in your sink?\u201d you ask as Joey turns the water off soon after switching it on. Since you were so small, the water level only needed to be a few inches or so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, little guy. My sink is your sink!\u201c Joey replied as he turned away from the sink and headed over to his bathtub. He reached into it and pulled out a bar of soap and some shampoo. You watched him place the two objects next to you before placing his hands on his hips and locking eyes with you. The two of you just stared at each other until Joey finally spoke up, \u201cWell, are you gonna undress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face turns beat red. \u201cW-What? Undress? You mean\u2026here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey blinks and suppresses a snicker. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy, little guy. We\u2019re both guys here, right? I\u2019ve got all the same parts as you\u2026although a tad bit bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook. I\u2019m not leaving until you\u2019re all set. I don\u2019t want you accidentally falling off the sink and breaking your neck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up at the giant teen for a few more moments before you lower your head in defeat. It doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s going to be leaving and you don\u2019t want to stand here all day smelling like barbeque. With a heavy sigh and a smile from Joey, you begin stripping down. You try to move as fast as you can, but your sticky clothes are difficult to remove. The entire time Joey watches you with hawk eyes and you feel incredibly embarrassed. You\u2019ve undressed around other guys before during gym class, but this was different. You were so puny and he was so massive. You knew the duelist\u2019s intentions were good, but it was like he was dominating you with his stare\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally stripped down to your birthday suit you walked over to the middle of the sink and looked down at the small puddle at the bottom. Before you even thought about sliding down there, you felt two tree-like fingers grip you around your naked waist and lower you into the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d you shout as Joey releases you. The teen looks a little surprised by your sudden burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, little guy. I just wanted to help.\u201d he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you could of asked first.\u201d you mutter under your breath, blushing a bit before sitting down in the sink. You wait for Joey to leave the bathroom but for some reason he\u2019s still there, staring down at you. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-? Oh, sorry!\u201d Joey exclaims as he picks up the shampoo bottle and squirts some of it onto his finger. He lowers the finger into the sink and allows you to take a bit of the shampoo to put into your hair. You thank him as you start scrubbing your hair. While you do this, Joey breaks off a small piece of the soap bar and drops it into he water. It floats next to you until you\u2019re ready to use it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll leave you to your bath, little guy.\u201d Joey says as he picks up your discarded clothes. \u201cI\u2019ll try to wash these while you bathe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Joey exit\u2019s the bathroom, leaving you alone at last. You relax in the water and allow the shampoo to rinse out of your hair. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you took your bath, Joey moved around the apartment, looking for something you could use as bed. He didn't how long you would be staying with him so he wanted to be ready for any inevitability. He had some cotton balls which would make a good pillow for you, a scrap of cloth for a blanket, and a match box you could easily sleep in. That would be good for the nights. He didn't want to just leave you laying out anywhere. With the matchbox, he could at least be assured that you'd be somewhat safe. He was about to carry it all to his room and come back into the kitchen to wash the clothes when he heard a knocking on the door. He looked confusedly at it, wondering who it could be. He wasn't expecting any visitors of any kind today. He set the cotton, cloth, and matchbox down on the table before heading to the door. He opened it up and saw Tristan standing there with a big grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Joey! You don't have to look so surprised to see me!\" Tristan said, patting Joey on the shoulder and walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here Tristan?\" Joey asked, closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan opened the fridge and started poking around. \"What, can't a friend drop in to say hello? Do I need a reason these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan opened a can of soda and guzzled it down, belching as he finished it. \"Whew...you don't mind right Joey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I got plenty more soda.\" Joey answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan opened up another and started drinking. \"Man, we don't do enough stuff together any more Joey. It always seems like there's something else to worry about in our lives. The only time we ever hang out any more these days seems to be when the world is in danger. Remember the old days, when we used to hang out at the arcade, and the pizza place and stuff like that? I miss those days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey smiled and said, \"Yeah, of course I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's go! Neither of us has anything to do so let's have some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey's smile faded a little and he said, \"I can't today...I'm taking care of something today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan groaned and said, \"Really? That sucks man! Aw well I guess it can't be helped. Can I use your bathroom though? I gotta go pretty bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey shrugged and said, \"Yeah, go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Tristan had closed and locked the door that Joey remembered you were currently bathing in the sink! He was about to knock on the door but decided against it. There was a good chance Tristan wouldn't even notice you. Once he was out of the bathroom Joey could get him to leave and then he would be in the clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan wasn't kidding. As soon as the door was locked he was standing in front of the toilet, unzipping his pants and pulling out his dick. He sighed as urine started flowing like a river. You, who had been relaxing, suddenly sat bolt up as you heard the sloshing water sounds. Looking up, from your angle, you could only just make out his hair. The sounds of Tristan peeing when on for awhile before the deafening flush went off and next thing you knew, he was standing right over top of you. You gaped up at him, his monolithic body stretching high above you. He was quite an impressive sight. His hand reached down and you realized, with a thrill of horror, that he was going to wash his hands! You could easily drown from the sudden flood! You waved your arms and shouted, trying to get his attention. Do you succeed?</span></div></div>",

Tristan turns the nozzle and a stream of cold water is released into the sink. The sudden gush of water sweeps you off your feet and you quickly find yourself floating as the water level rises by the second. You\u2019re forced to start swimming to keep yourself above the surface. Suddenly, a shadow passes over you as Tristan places his hands under the faucet and wets his hand. His giant hands break the stream of water for a moment, allowing for a short respite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTristan!\u201d you shout as you wave one of your arms at him. \u201cStop the water! Please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your chances of him hearing you are even less likely now that the sound of the water drowns out your voice. The high school student removes his hands from the faucet after a few seconds and reaches for the bottle of soap nearby. As the stream of water resumes, you continue to swim and try to remain above the waves created from the water. To Tristan, these waves are small, but to you they\u2019re life threatening! Can\u2019t Joey hear the water running?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the bathroom, Joey is in the kitchen and is in the process of washing your clothes using another sink. This explains why he isn\u2019t rushing into the bathroom to save you; the sound of this faucet covers the one in the bathroom. Just another slap from Lady Luck\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the massive teenager squirts some soap into his palm and starts rubbing his hands together. Once his hands are covered a thin layer of soap, he places them back under the faucet and washes them off. The waves stop again, but now something even worse is happening. The soap from Tristan\u2019s hands seeps into the sink and creates bubbles on the water\u2019s surface. You attempt to swim above the bubbles, but you\u2019re too small and they start covering you. You\u2019re forced to shut your else, knowing full well how much it hurts to have soap in your eyes. With your eyes closed, you don\u2019t see Tristan lower his hands into the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel something push against you and force you under the water. Tristan is unknowingly pushing a small human under the surface of the water as he rubs his hands together. Thankfully, you\u2019re at least saved from being pulverized between his palms. Instead, you\u2019re whipped around the water, unable to swim to the surface as long as Tristan is washing his hands. You can only keep your mouth and eyes shut until he finishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally removes his hands and you waste no time in breaking the surface. You gasp for air and open your eyes. The soap bubbles have spread out enough so they don\u2019t get in your eyes, but that suddenly becomes the least of your worries. You\u2019ve opened your eyes just in time to see Tristan lower his hands back into the water a second time! Unlike before, he\u2019s lowering them with his palms facing upward. His hands lower into the water on either side of you and you watch them move until they\u2019re directly under you. Oh no\u2026he\u2019s about to splash water in his face! If you don\u2019t move quickly you\u2019re going to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh!\u201d Tristan sighs as he splashes some water onto his face. He\u2019s a bit sloppy and some of it ends up on his shirt. He ignores it uses the nearby towel to dry off is hands and face. Once he\u2019s all set, he lets the sink drain and leaves the bathroom. As he walks to the door, he passes Joey who has just turned off the kitchen faucet. \u201cSee you later, buddy. We\u2019re defiantly going to spend time together during my next visit!\u201d Tristan tells his best friend as he pats him on the shoulder. As his fellow classmate leaves his apartment, Joey notices his shoulder is a little damp from Tristan touching him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joey's eyes widened in panic. No...no no no no no no no! It couldn't be! He ran into the bathroom and looked all over the sink. It was possible that he wasn't looking hard enough. You were tiny after all, practically a bug. His eyes scanned methodically but he still couldn't see you. He checked underneath all the soap, the bubbles, the drain was still plugged so you couldn't have fallen down there either. He slammed his fist against the sink. Where could you be? An idea suddenly bloomed in his head. What if Tristan taken you? No...he wouldn't just kidnap someone like that...What if you had somehow gotten stuck on his body? On his hands or face or something? Joey bolted from the bathroom and ran out the door. He looked around but Tristan was long gone, large crowds walking up and down the sidewalks. Wherever he was, it wasn't here. He pulled out his cellphone and dialed Tristan's number. Unfortunately he went straight to his message box. That meant that his phone was either off or out of batteries. He waited for Tristan's voice to stop giving instructions on leaving a message, the tell tale beep letting him know it was time to start talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tristan! This is Joey! Call me as soon as you get this message! It's important!\" Joey hung up after saying that and closed the door to his apartment, locking it as he did so. He wasn't about to just sit around and wait for Tristan to call him back. He ran, heading towards Tristan's apartment. There was a good chance he was heading back there, but an equally good chance he was spending the day out on the town. First things first though. He would check Tristan's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tristan was indeed walking around town. He was heading to a video game store to see if they had anything new, hands in pockets, trying to figure out why Joey, who was apparently all alone in his apartment, didn't want to spend time with him. He shrugged and just kept walking. Whatever he was doing it must have been important. He pushed open the door and walked into the game store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, you were clinging desperately to a shirt fiber, soaking wet and shaking like a frightened puppy. Tristan's every movement caused his body to shake, like a moving mountain, rocking you left, right, up and down. Your arms were already getting tired, clinging to the shirt, Tristan's warm, hard chest behind you. You had looked around as Tristan left the apartment, the people in this world blurry and gargantuan, moving mountains just out of view. It was terrifying to imagine getting lost in this place. You needed to get Tristan's attention and fast. You just hoped you had better luck getting Tristan's attention than Joey's. You looked up and then down. You could try and climb up to reach Tristan's bare skin and try to irritate it enough to get his attention, but there was no guarantee he wouldn't just swat you or brush you off, or smash you under his fingers as he scratched. Likewise, you could climb down and try to get to his hands or a pocket. It would be safer sitting in a pocket than just clinging to his shirt. Neither of these ideas were very appealing but there was little else you could do. You took a deep breath and started moving.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to climb up his shirt instead of down. His neck was closer than his hands and you didn\u2019t like the idea of clinging to his shirt for too long. There was still the risk he would brush you off or even crush you, but climbing down had its own risks. If worse came to worse, you would just have to deal with it when it happened. You were lucky with Joey, you might be just as lucky with his fellow jock classmate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed up to the collar of his shirt, Tristan was looking around the video game store unaware of the little bug on his chest. He had searched all over the store, but nothing caught his eye. The games he was looking forward too weren\u2019t coming out for awhile longer. Just as he was about to turn for the exit, he saw something at the corner of his eye. It was a large TV hooked up to a game system in which shoppers could play. The console was currently running a demo version of a flight simulator Tristan had been looking forward to for months. Like a little kid in a candy store, Tristan jogs over to the TV before anyone else can take the controller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you\u2019ve made good progress in climbing Mount Tristan. You were close to the top when a series of loud sounds and flashing lights grab your attention. Curious, you turn around and see that Tristan is playing a video game on a giant TV. To him the TV was already bigger than the one he had at home, but to you it was larger than a movie screen. The sounds from the game, which could be heard across the store, were ear piercing to you. You tried to ignore it and turn back to continue climbing up the folds of the shirt. This was your chance to make some good progress while the giant wasn\u2019t in motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, this game is awesome!\u201d Tristan exclaims as he uses his fighter jet to shoot down three enemies with one shot. \u201cYeah! Eat missile, chumps!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFigures he would like war games.\u201d you mutter to yourself as you climb. You knew from watching the anime that he had a military deck. It was only right he would also enjoy military-style games. While you were in the middle of these thoughts, you realized you had reached the end of Tristan\u2019s shirt. Your hand brushed against a few small hairs and you breathed a sigh of relief. The hard part was done with, now you just had to punch and scratch his skin so he notices you. Hopefully he won\u2019t mistake the feeling of your tiny hands as a simple itch\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hoist yourself up the shirt and prepare to scratch  his neck, a loud booming sound came from behind you. Tristan had just blown up the enemy\u2019s base and the result was the sound of  a very realistic explosion. You were taken by surprise and thought that something had actually exploded in the store. You lost your grip and fell\u2026forward\u2026right into the space between Tristan\u2019s chest and his shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as you tumbled into the shirt and desperately reached your arms out to grab something. His shirt, his chest hairs, anything! Luckily you do grab a hold of something, but it\u2019s not what you were expecting. Apparently, Tristan had decided to wear a necklace today and that was what had saved you from a plummet into the teen\u2019s shirt. It was a simple silver chain and your hand had went through one of the links. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was really close\u2026\u201d you tell yourself as you look down into the abyss of his top. It\u2019s kind of dark, so you can\u2019t make out every detail of his expansive body. You do know that you\u2019re probably between his pectorals. \u201cThis isn\u2019t so bad. Kind of humid, but at least his skin is still in reach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chain suddenly swayed as Tristan finished the demo he was playing and turned away from the TV. The sudden movement sent your nude form swinging right into his beefy chest. It was like hitting a brick wall\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! Son of a\u2026\u201d you curse as you use your free hand to rub the side of your head. You had better get his attention soon before you slammed into him enough times to knock you out. If that happened, who knows where you\u2019d end up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold onto the chain with both your hands and start kicking his skin. At first your weak blows don\u2019t register with him, but after the tenth kick you witness light flood into the shirt. Tristan had reached his hand in to\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked up after your tenth kick and saw what might as well have been the hand of God descending on you. Tristan had finally noticed you! The massive fingers grabbed the chain and slowly eased it out of his shirt, holding it up to his eyes. He scanned it, your tiny arm waving wildly while the other clung tightly to the now moving chain. Tristan's eye seemed to land fully on you a few times but he never seemed to actually SEE you. Throwing caution to the winds, you maneuvered yourself so that your legs were wrapped around the chain. You waved both arms and shouted your lungs out, hoping against hope that Tristan would finally be able to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you, this is exactly what happened. The massive brown orb focused down on you and widened in shock. Tristan brought his other palm up and you gratefully dropped down onto it. The necklace dropped back under his shirt and Tristan just stared at you for awhile. Suddenly, his huge fingers closed over you, plunging you into a stifling darkness. The world shook around you, knocking you on to your ass as Tristan moved around. Where he was going, you had no idea. The shaking darkness lasted for a few minutes before light was flooded back into your world as Tristan opened his hand and looked down at you. You looked around and saw huge gray walls surrounding you, a tiled floor, and it appeared that Tristan was sitting down. It didn't take long for you to figure out you were now in a bathroom and Tristan was sitting on a toilet. He had his pants up so thankfully he just came in here to talk to you in private...you hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan bent over and looked you over, poking at you with his other finger. You tried to push it away but was totally helpless to stop him. He chuckled at that then said, \"Who or what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shouted back, \"I'm a human! Just like you! I'm just...really small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan laughed again and said, \"Well, how did this happen? Did you lose a duel or something and this is your punishment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head and said, \"No, nothing like that...I...well, it's going to sound crazy, but I'm from another world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan snorted and said, \"Yeah, you're right, that DOES sound crazy. Why should I believe you? How do I know you're not some weird spy sent to watch me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, a look that he didn't notice. What, did Tristan actually think he was important enough to be spied on? Maybe...but either way this wasn't a path you wanted the conversation to take. You waved your arms and shook your head and said, \"Why would I have tried to get your attention if I was a spy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true...but you could be lying and just saying that you got my attention on purpose to throw me off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis expression was darkening every second, his eyes filling with suspicion. This wasn't good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen! I promise that I'm not a spy! I'll prove it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan narrowed his eyes and said, \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy! Just take care of me for a week! I'll be in full sight, you can watch me at all times, and if I do something suspicious you can catch me at it!\" This was a dangerous proposition. Tristan might consider you going for a walk to be suspicious. This was almost like giving him a blank check to do whatever he pleased with you. You didn't want to become the plaything of a god like teenager. Not to mention any kind of rough play could kill you at your minuscule size. Tristan appeared to be thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...alright. It's not like you could anything to hurt me anyway. My little toe is stronger than you!\" Tristan grinned as he said that. This only served to make you feel even more uneasy. Maybe getting his attention wasn't such a good idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Well, I was about to head home anyway so now I can take you with me!\" Tristan said, the grin on his face not abating. \"The only question is...where should I put you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan looked over his clothes and his body, trying to think of a good place to put you. He finally comes to decide on two different places...now, which was better...</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ll be home in no time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, which for some reason makes Tristan blush and turn his eyes from you. You felt him start to walk as he made his way out of the store and through the city. As he walked, you occasionally looked up and saw glimpses of other people and buildings pass by. You didn\u2019t dare poke your head out of the pocket, since any sort of action might support the idea you were a spy or something. Sometimes, you would catch Tristan looking down at you in the pocket. His quick glances only lasted a second or two, but it seemed like he was really interested in you. Then again, how often do you find a tiny teenager attached to your necklace?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally saw the scenery change when Tristan walked into a building of some sort. It must have been his apartment building, and he was now heading up the stairs to his designated room. Once the teen was in front of his door, he unlocked it with his key, headed on through, and closed the door behind him. You heard him lock the door and kick off his shoes before making his way into his bedroom. Soon after he entered his room, his giant hand plucked you out of his pocket and brought you up to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are! Home sweet home.\u201d Tristan looks at his messy desk and, using one arm, sweeps all the junk onto the floor. He then drops you onto the desk and takes a seat, his eyes immediately gluing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, first things first. We\u2019re going to go over some ground rules.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRules?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, rules. You\u2019re going to be living with me for a week, so I need to make sure you understand who\u2019s in charge. Rule #1: You must do everything I say. Think of yourself as a new recruit and I\u2019m your commanding officer.\u201d Tristan grins as he says this. Somehow you imagined he would not make a good high ranking soldier. \u201cRule #2: I must always know where you are. Don\u2019t go wandering around or moving when I tell you to stay put. I wouldn\u2019t want to think you\u2019re trying to escape or something. And finally, Rule #3: Staying with me isn\u2019t free! You have to pay your rent, but since you obviously can\u2019t pay with money, you\u2019ll have to pay some other way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026how, exactly?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t thought that far yet, but I\u2019ll defiantly think of something! You better be ready for it.\u201d Tristan points a finger at you and you nod, showing you understand. \u201cNow, why don\u2019t we start by you telling me why you were in my necklace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I was in Joey\u2019s sink when you were washing your hands. I ended up on your shirt when you splashed water in your face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026wait, what the heck were you doing in Joey\u2019s sink?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was\u2026taking a bath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that would explain the lack of clothes\u2026\u201d Tristan\u2019s travel downward slightly and you instantly turn away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026can I get something to wear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, I don\u2019t think any of my clothes would fit you, little man. Although\u2026\u201d Tristan scratched his chin. \u201cI think I have some army toys from when I was a kid. You might be able to dress yourself in an army uniform or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be fine.\u201d you tell him, simply wanting to cover up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see if I can find something in this mess.\u201d Tristan laughs nervously as he looks around his pigsty of a room. \u201cThis might take awhile\u2026don\u2019t even think about moving while I look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan turns his back to you and starts looking around his room. You sit down and wait for him to find something. Hopefully you won\u2019t have to spend the entire week nude. As you wait, your start thinking of Joey. He had really wanted to help you and you thought you were safe with him, but then this happened. You missed Joey\u2019s smile and the way he handled you gently. Somehow you knew Tristan wasn\u2019t going to be as gentle\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright! It took awhile but I managed to find something!\" Tristan said, sitting back down at his desk. He dangled an outfit over your head. It was indeed an army uniform, beige camouflage pants and shirt. He dropped them next to you and you picked up the pants. They were a little big...Tristan noticed and said, \"Hold on, I'll get some string you can use as a belt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled on the shirt and found that it fit more like a night shirt than a regular one...which meant you were even smaller than a child's army toys. It helped put things into perspective for you once again. You were tiny, fragile, and totally dependent on these massive teenagers. At least Joey had seemed like a nice, reliable guy. Tristan was obviously trying but he was still in a state of suspicion concerning you and he had laid down those rules pretty fast. You couldn't help but wonder what sort of things he had meant you could do when he said you had to pay rent somehow. What was wrong with him? Joey saw a helpless kid in need of help and he instantly started taking care of you. Tristan was immediately suspicious and had started slapping rules on you. At least he wasn't doing anything to hurt you...yet. You sighed and just hoped that Joey would notice you missing and at least start to put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Tristan long to return with a length of string you could use. He dropped it next to you and you pulled on the pants and tied the string around your waist, knotting it tightly in place. This kept the pants up, but the cuffs were still under your feet. You bent over and rolled them up, until they were just above your ankles. You had done the same with your shirt. You looked yourself over to see how everything fit...you looked completely ridiculous. You looked up at Tristan with a pained look on his face and he shrugged and said, \"Sorry little man that's all I had. It's better than being naked right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and said, \"So now what are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan seemed to think about it. He could ask you to do anything he wanted. That was Rule No. 1. You were a little leery of that rule. It was bad enough that he was planning on extolling some kind of rent from you, but what else would he want you to do? You had seen that gleam in his eyes earlier when he mentioned his army toys. You were pretty much nothing more than a toy to him now. You just hoped he treated you like a human and not a toy. Suddenly, he rested his head on his arms and stared at you, his eye only a few feet (to you) away. You stumbled back, your heart racing in shock from the sudden movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's it like being so tiny?\" he asked. He had a look of genuine interest on his face. You thought about it and said, \"It's really kind of scary. I mean, everything is like a million times bigger than it normally is. I'm totally at the mercy of anyone who finds me, a stray breeze could not just knock me over, but actually carry me away, insects and rodents are like giant monsters now...\" you shuddered after saying this. You never thought too hard about that before. You just hoped there wouldn't be any such creatures in Tristan's apartment. He had a pretty big smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I'm kind of like a god to you aren't I?\" A god? You didn't like that kind of thought process...not one little bit! You shrugged and said, \"Um...I guess you could look at it that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan laughed and straightened up, his massive body a wall of flesh and clothes above you. \"This is actually pretty awesome! I have my own personal little guy to do anything I want with! And you have to do whatever I say, no matter what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. This was exactly what you were hoping WOULDN'T happen. It seemed like everything was happening today the exact opposite the way you wanted it too. Tristan smirked down at you and pushed you over with his finger. He barely had to touch you. You got knocked back a few feet and landed hard on your butt. \"Ouch! What did you do that for?\" you asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I could.\" Tristan said, his smirk looking more and more evil. \"What are you going to do about it bug boy? Remember, you're mine until you've proven you're not a spy, so I wouldn't get an attitude if I was you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced and lowered your head. He was right. There was nothing you could do against a man so mind bogglingly bigger than you. He could smash you under a fingertip after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan noticed your sudden quiet and laughed. \"Good. Looks like I'm getting through to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back and stared at his ceiling, thinking up something he could do with you. He had a lazy smile on his face, totally at ease. He wanted to come up with something good. After a few minutes he straightened up again and said, \"Alright! I got it! You're going to play a game of endurance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what kind of game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you a choice! Game 1! Swim for Your Life! I drop you in a glass of water and see how long you can swim before you get sucked into my mouth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up in horror at him. He couldn't be serious! A game like that could easily kill you! You were about to argue when you remembered your position. You held your tongue and hoped that Game 2 would be better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Game 2! Dodge or Die! I set you on the floor and you have to dodge my huge feet! Let's see how long you last before my foot comes down on top of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was even worse! These were both deadly games! It was like choosing between dying by firing squad or dying by electric chair! Either way you were screwed! Tristan crossed his arms and said, \"Don't worry though. I won't kill you either way and if you win I'll reward you in some way. You don't have a choice whether or not you play, just which game you play. So, which is it going to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weight your options for a few minutes and look up at Tristan, your decision made. You choose...</span></div></div>",

He then carries the glass over to the kitchen table, sits down in a chair, and raises you over the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you a good swimmer, bug boy?\u201d he asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026dunno. I\u2019ve been to the beach a lot and always go swimming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? You like the beach? So do I! Maybe we\u2019ll go sometime.\u201d Tristan grins before releasing you and dropping you into the glass. As you plummet toward the water, you hold your breath and cover your face with your arms. Your ant sized body plops into the water, barely making a splash. You quickly swim to the surface and take a breath of air. You open your eyes and see Tristan looming over you with a big smirk on his face. \u201cRemember, you have to swim against the current to avoid ending up in my mouth. If you manage to avoid getting sucked up before I drain the entire glass, you win! If you enter my mouth, you lose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water ripples as Tristan grabs the glass with his giant fingers and brings it up to his mouth. Your entire vision is taken up by his handsome face and you start to wonder if it\u2019s possible to beat someone this big at anything. Tristan gives you one last grin before saying, \u201cOkay, soldier! Get ready to\u2026Swim for Your Life!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the game begins. Tristan slowly tips the glass and you see his large, pink lips part. The water in the glass begins to drain into his mouth at a slow rate. He\u2019s not consuming too much water at first, so you simply after to paddle backwards to keep ahead of the current. After a few seconds the glass is tipped a little higher and it starts to feel like you\u2019re in a stream. Your weak paddling isn\u2019t going to cut it and you turn around to really start swimming. The glass vibrates as you hear Tristan chuckle behind you. How can he be enjoying this so much? You\u2019d like to see him chuckle if he was the one swimming away from a giant teen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of the current grows stronger and stronger with each inch Tristan tips the glass. You look back and see his Adam\u2019s Apple bob up and down as his stomach is filled with liquid. You imagine yourself falling down his esophagus and ending up in his belly. That wasn\u2019t going to happen, however. Tristan had said he had no intention of killing you, so why worry? Then again\u2026accidents do happen. Tristan might not be able to control what goes down his throat and what doesn\u2019t and accidentally swallow you. He might close his eyes at the wrong moment and not see you enter his mouth. You were so tiny that he probably would never notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down. Just calm down\u2026\u201d you tell yourself as you continue swimming, ignoring the waves of clear water that splash into your face. \u201cEven if that did happen, he\u2019d just puke me back out\u2026right?\u201d Yeah, he\u2019d defiantly do that\u2026as long as he didn\u2019t think of you as too insignificant to bother with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were thinking over these fears, the water left in the glass suddenly shifted violently. Tristan took the glass away from his lips and placed it back on the table. The waves continued moving back and forth for a few moments before finally coming to a rest. You looked up and saw Tristan throw is head back and sigh with satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh! Nothing like a nice glass of H2O on a hot day.\u201d Tristan says as he wipes his mouth with his sleeve. He looks down at your confused face and smirks. \u201cSorry, little guy. Even big gods like me have to breath. Shall we resume?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for your answer, Tristan\u2019s fingers wrap around the glass once more and brings it up to his lips. You got ready to swim, set on NOT getting sucked into the titan\u2019s mouth if you could prevent it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tristan smacked his lips a few times before putting the rim of the glass against them, tipping it up and resuming his guzzling. You were already pretty worn out. To Tristan, this was just a simple glass of water he was drinking to quench his summer thirst. But for you, it was a life and death struggle to avoid getting swallowed like a pill. You put your whole body into it, your arms slicing through the water, your breaths coming in ragged gasps as the icy depths pulled you closer and closer to Tristan's mouth. You chanced a glance behind you and saw a terrifying sight. Water crashed and swirled, falling out of the glass like a waterfall, pooling in his mouth before getting gulped down with a sucking sound that came straight out of your nightmares. His hot breath frosted the glass with every exhalation, his eyes focused on your tiny struggling form, an evil glint showing that he was very clearly enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou focused ahead and kept pushing yourself. You weren't going to lose! This sadistic game that seemed to come out of nowhere wouldn't keep you down. You'd show Tristan what you were made of! The bottom of the glass was nearly in view! Just a few more seconds and you'd be home free! The glass tilted again, making you almost swim up a waterfall as Tristan gulped down the last remnants of the water. Unfortunately, he had tilted the glass to such a degree, that with the last of the water, so, too, did you end up. With a sinking sensation in your stomach you watched the bottom of the glass tilt fully above you, your body falling down, down, down the glass tunnel, drips of water still emptying into Tristan's grinning maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a splash you landed in the heated cavern that was Tristan's mouth, his teeth surrounding you like powerful, deadly structures, ready to crush and grind anything that strayed too close. You swam desperately toward them, trying to escape from this prison of hot flesh. With no warning, the teeth came crashing down with a sharp *click!* sending you into utter darkness. You still pushed and swam, fear and panic filling your mind as you heard the loud, swishing gulps of Tristan drinking the water in his mouth, the currents tugging at you and your baggy clothes, drawing you deeper and deeper into his mouth, almost directly over the pit that would send you to your doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck was on your side, however, as Tristan finished swallowing the last of the water, allowing you to land on his slippery tongue. You got to your feet and ran as fast as you could along it, trying to escape from falling down the throat. Your world was suddenly turned upside down as Tristan's tongue flicked, sending you rocketing up against the roof of his mouth before you were pinned down under the tongue. Light flooded your world again as Tristan opened his mouth, his huge fingers plucking you out from under his tongue. He put you on his palm and held you up to his face. He shook his head and said, \"So close, but you didn't quite make it soldier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair! You cheated!\" you accused, still scared that you had had such a close call. Tristan laughed and said, \"That's no way to talk to a superior officer! You're going to have to be punished for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan dropped you roughly on the top of his desk and stood up. He slowly peeled off his jacket and shirt until he was standing over you, his bare, muscled torso filling your vision. He was truly a frightening and powerful sight to behold. He flexed his bicep and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this bug boy? This is what you're up against! I would suggest now mouthing off again! To make sure you don't, you're going to get up close and personal with this body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. What did this power hungry teen have in mind?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you stared up at the titanic Tristan, the brunet just smirked down at you and decided he was going to make you feel as weak and puny as possible. He started flexing some more, making sure you knew how much work he had put into each and every one of his muscles. As you watched him strike pose after pose you were constantly reminded that you were in an anime. Most of the characters in anime had perfect bodies. No acne, no blemishes, no scars. Just a flawless body that looked like it was cut from marble. It would seem that not even a character from a card battling anime was an exception. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what you see?\u201d Tristan asks as he puts his hands on his hips and smirks down at you. \u201cMaybe if you\u2019re good, I\u2019ll let you worship me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?\u201d you mutter, snapping out of your trance. \u201cN-No, that\u2019s alright. I think I\u2026understand what I\u2019m\u2026um\u2026up against. You can put your shirt back on\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? No way, bug boy!\u201d Tristan shouts at you before he reaches down and picks your tiny little body up between his fingers. You\u2019re once again brought before his giant, youthful face. \u201cYou can\u2019t just look. You have to experience!\u201d With you in his right hand, Tristan suddenly raises his left arm over his head and reveals his hairy, sweaty armpit. He turns to face it, burrows his nose into the hair, and takes a deep sniff. \u201cMmmmmmhh. You smell that, bug? That\u2019s the smell of a real man!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unconsciously sniff the air and immediately regret it. The moment Tristan had removed his shirt he had released his body\u2019s foul odor into the room. The air had quickly become stale and difficult for a small life form like you to take in. You covered your nose with your hands, but this did nothing to stop your nostrils from feeling like they were on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! Judging by the look on your face, I take it you can smell it! Better get used to it, cause that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to be smelling for awhile!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even ponder what he meant, Tristan\u2019s hand suddenly jerked forward\u2026right toward his pit. You barely had time to scream before his fingers made contact with the hairy flesh. Your back was pushed against the sweaty skin, your new clothes instantly sticking to it as if it was flypaper. When Tristan removed his fingers, his thick armpit hairs brushed over you and you became stuck deep within the \u201cforest\u201d of the teen\u2019s armpit. One of the airs laid itself right over your mouth, so you kept yourself from speaking to avoid getting a mouthful of wet hair. You still needed to breath, however, and doing so was a hellish experience. It was even worse that being trapped in Joey\u2019s sock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy your punishment, soldier. Let it be a lesson to you!\u201d Tristan exclaimed before he lowered his beefy arm and your face was pressed up against a bulging muscle. With two walls of sweaty skin compressing you, you knew you weren\u2019t going anywhere. You could only sit there and listen to Tristan\u2019s footsteps as he walked. As he walked, his arm was rubbing against his torso and smothering you with sweat and hair. You were being completely overpowered by this giant with nothing but the smell of his male musk and bodily fluids. It was degrading and unfair\u2026especially since Joey had allowed you to take a bath just an hour previously. Now you once again felt dirty and in desperate need of a bath\u2026a bath Tristan would probably never give you unless it involved him having fun somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wallowed in your misfortune, another thought crossed your mind. Where was Tristan going? There was still bits of light peeking in, so he hadn\u2019t put his shirt back on. Surely he wasn\u2019t going to head out into public without a shirt, so he must still be in his apartment. You knew very little about his home, so you had no idea what was in it that could amuse the teen. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, the world stopped moving. There was silence except for the sound of Tristan's body's inner workings, and what sounded like springs...was he on his bed? The silence was broken by loud voices, flashes of light visible in the spaces between Tristan's body and arm. After a few minutes Tristan started laughing. From what you could tell...it seemed like he was watching TV! You sighed in relief a little bit. This could have been so much worse. Unfortunately, as soon as you breathed out you had to breathe in the foul, salty stench of Tristan's armpit. With all your rotten luck it was a hot day. The space, with a heavy arm on top of your back and wiry hairs in your mouth was boiling hot, feeling like Hell's sauna. You couldn't even tell whether the sweat dripping off your face was Tristan's sweat or your own sweat. It all mangled together in a warm, wet brew that soaked your whole body and invaded every single one of your senses. All of this was punctuated by Tristan's laughing. After what felt like hours of this torment, you finally lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later you slowly revived, looking blearily around your surroundings. You lifted your head slightly with a sickening squelch. Something felt off...was there...a breeze blowing? You twisted your body around and saw a welcoming sight. Tristan had lifted his arm! You were still suctioned onto his warm, wet flesh but you could clearly see the couch below you! Tristan had draped his arm over the back of his couch, revealing your frail body to the fresh air of his apartment! Well...the relatively fresh air of his apartment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were mentally celebrating this turn of events a huge, rumbling snore filled the air. No way...Tristan had fallen asleep! This was like a dream come true! Now was your chance to escape from this torment! You needed to get back to Joey, and fast! You...all the excitement drained out of you as you remembered your situation. You pretty much an ant, a piece of lint to the god like beings of this world. Even if you scaled down Tristan's body and managed to reach the floor, what then? It could take days just to get to the door of his apartment! The idea of making your way to Joey was completely ludicrous. Oh, if only you weren't quite so small! You were completely at the god teen's mercy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least you could find a better place to wait than here! You began working your arms and legs, slowly freeing yourself with a series of sickening squelching noises. Soon, you were clinging to a greasy hair, dangling high above the couch. You reached your hand out and gripped another hair. Slowly but surely you made your way out of the stinking pit of Tristan's...pit and over his chest. When you reached his nipple you lowered yourself onto the pink protrusion and rested. You knew you were tiny, but just being able to easily sit on this slightly hardened nipple with total ease really brought home how insignificant you were. Whether you liked it or not, you needed Tristan to survive. You cracked your back slightly and stood up, grabbing another hair. Time to get moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were dangling between his rather defined pecs, the hair you were holding onto snapped. Your heart seemed to stop momentarily, everything moving in slow motion as you plunged downward, Tristan's body flashing by him swiftly, like a cliff face. Was this it? Were you going die, dashed against Tristan's sculpted abs? No! No way you'd let yourself die in such an undignified manner! As you fell you began to reach out, trying to grab onto something, anything to stop your descent. But it was no use! You were falling way too fast! The only thing you could do was hope you had a soft landing! You closed your eyes and waited to see what happened.</span></div></div>",

However, the thought of slamming into Tristan\u2019s abs and breaking your neck haunted your thoughts. Perhaps if your eyes were open, it would come to a relief to see that wall of muscle passing you by. Did this mean you were going to land on Tristan\u2019s lap? Since you had your eyes closed, you couldn\u2019t see the surprise landing that was approaching\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as your body came into contact with something other than air, you immediately reached out and grabbed it. You knew what you had grabbed just by it\u2019s texture; hair. You continued to fall, however, but more of these hairs gathered around you and your decent soon came to a halt. You opened your eyes and looked around, seeing nothing but brown hair. You moved a bit, which caused you to slip out of the hairs\u2019 grasp and plummet again. Thankfully, the drop only lasted a second before you touched down on relatively soft flesh. You stood up and glanced around, seeing nothing but giant strands of hair everywhere. They each protruded out of Tristan\u2019s skin like a bunch of small trees. You smelled the air and got a nose full of male musk. Where the heck were you? You fell from his chest and this defiantly wasn\u2019t his abs\u2026you should of landed on his lap, right above his\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as you discover where you must be. The hair all around you\u2026the strong smell of musk\u2026it must be Tristan\u2019s pubes! That would mean the teenager was sitting on his couch butt naked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t happening\u2026 you mutter. Getting transported to the world of Yu-Gi-Oh was one thing. Getting transported to the world of Yu-Gi-Oh at the size of an ant was another thing. Getting transported to the world of Yu-Gi-Oh and ending up in a character\u2019s crotch?!  This was supposed to be a kid\u2019s show! Why was Tristan nude anyway? This WAS his home, so he can supposedly do whatever he wants\u2026that didn\u2019t stop you from having some theories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook these thoughts from your head and decided to start making your way out of this place. Looking up, you could barely see the sleeping titan looming over you past the pubic hairs. Since his body was that way, you turned around and walked in the opposite direction. You pushed aside the sweaty strands of hair as you advanced, feeling like you were in a jungle of pubic hair. For the next several minutes your entire world was Tristan\u2019s body hair and his odor. You found yourself wanting to get out of here more and more ever minute that went by. Once you got out of here, you\u2019d have to find a way to the floor below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you trekked forward, you noticed something ahead. Thinking it was one of Tristan\u2019s thighs or something, you ran toward it. Once you reached it and looked up, you realized your mistake. This wasn\u2019t one of Tristan\u2019s legs\u2026it was the base of his penis! It was a towering pillar of flesh to you, despite the fact that it wasn\u2019t even hard. You stared at it for a bit, taking in how much bigger it was than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026for a character from Yu-Gi-Oh, Tristan is massive in plenty of places!\u201d you tell yourself before walking around the massive organ and continuing on your way. You couldn\u2019t be distracted, not while Tristan could wake up any moment. If you had reached his cock, the end to this pubic forest shouldn\u2019t be much further! </span></div></div>",

Why else would you be so embarrassed about me seeing you naked? You are so adorable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first reaction was to push the finger away from you in shame, but you stopped yourself. You liked the fact that Joey wasn't angry. In fact, you hug the finger and look at Joey's massive face, \"Eheheh...

You stayed latched onto his finger as he lifted you out and placed you onto the countertop before setting you down gently. He then took off his shirt, revealing his slender chest. He was in decent physical condition, but nothing overly bulky. He poses a little as he looks down at you. You look up at Joey in awe as he does this, as if looking up at a massive god. He then used one hand to undo his belt and the button to his pants in one swift motion before leaning his bulge closer towards your position and zipping the zipper down very very slowly. As he did this, the teenage god's musk intensified more and more until it just slammed into you with each wave of body heat that emanated from his boxer-clad buge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done with that, he leaned back to his normal stance and let his pants drop to the floor. Stepping out of his pants, he put his thumb into the waistband of his underwear and tugged on it a little. As if possessed, you feel yourself moving closer as you walk towards the edge. You actually feel yourself about to fall off the edge when Joey uses a finger to stop you. You instinctively latch onto the finger as he pulls down his underwear, revealing his massive cock. You look down at it and it is incredibly huge. He grins and places you on top of it before stepping into the shower.</span></div></div>",

Lower and lower your gaze went until they rested upon Joey\u2019s two bare feet far below. Joey noticed you looking down at his feet and chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood choice, little fella. \u201c the giant duelist spoke before he lowered you down to the floor of the tub. Gently he placed you on the damp surface and then stood to his full height once again. You gaped up at the godly teen as he placed his hands on his hips and smiled down at you. \u201cReady to clean big Joey\u2019s feet, little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes!!\u201d you replied, almost jumping for joy at the thought of it. Joey\u2019s smile widened as he slowly lifted his right foot and took a small step forward. You gawked up at the beautiful foot as it positioned itself over you and began to lower as if it step on you. Your eyes remained transfixed upon the sole and when the sweaty, warm flesh touched your face you breathed in its odor with a moan. The foot continued to lower, forcing you to sit down under it. Soon the foot came to a stop just inches off the ground, leaving you sitting under it with perfect access to the entire sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock yourself out.\u201d Joey boomed from above and you immediately got to work. Your arms hugged the sole as best they could and your face was buried into the hot, musky skin of the giant\u2019s sole. You started to take in big whiffs of Joey\u2019s foot while simultaneously licking it with your tongue. Joey shuddered in enjoyment as he felt your small, cool tongue against his sweaty foot. You crawled around under the foot, licking as many places as you could. Joey\u2019s salty sweat was delicious and the fragrant musk made you feel like you were in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh\u2026so good\u2026I love your feet so much, Joey.\u201d you moaned between licks, trying to clean off as much sweat as you could. No matter how much you consumed, however, Joey\u2019s foot just seemed to produce more. You hoped the giant blond could forgive your insufficiency, but his grin showed it was fine as long as the two of them were enjoying themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you adore my feet so much, why have you been ignoring the left one?\u201d Joey asked, tapping his left foot against the damp floor of the tub. You gave the rough sole before you one last slurp before crawling out from under it and running over to the giant teenager\u2019s other foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Joey! I almost forgot!\u201d you cried up to the bigger male before ducking under his other foot and began hugging and licking it just like the other one. The amazing taste of his sweat filled your mouth while his manly musk was all you could smell. You loved it; you wish you could stay under his foot forever. Joey seemed to be enjoying the foot washing too and even started to touch himself while watching you work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure know how to make a guy feel big, little one!\u201d Joey boomed, flexing his toes in content. You peeked up at the five plump digits as they curled and scrunched above you. Your mouth started to water at the sight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Joey, could you lower your foot a little more?\u201d you asked. You backed up a bit as the massive foot of Joey lowered a bit closer to the ground. The giant didn\u2019t know what you were planning, but then he felt something latch onto his big toe! Inspecting his toe, Joey noticed you had jumped up and grabbed his biggest toe with your arms and legs. You were now holding onto it and licking it lovingly as it wiggled a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha\u2026aren\u2019t you just the cutest.\u201d Joey remarked as he leaned himself against a wall and watched you clean his big toe. You greedily lapped up as much of the delectable sweat from the toe as you could before slipping into the crevice between the toe and another. You moaned in joy as you were gently squeezed between the two digits while they rubbed a bit of sweat and toe filth onto you. You hugged Joey\u2019s index toe and started slurping over that next. Your giant crush bit his lip and spread his toes far apart to make things easier for you. You continued to climb around the toes carefully until you had coated each one in a thin layer of saliva. You were now laying on top of the toes and gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll done, little guy? That was awesome; we definitely have to do that again sometime!\u201d Joey grinned toothily down at you while you smiled up at his handsome, happy face. \u201cNow\u2026should we get on with the shower? Or is there another place you want to clean before that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I\u2026\u201d You stared high up at the looming giant and noticed a few trails of greasy sweat were dripping down from the boy\u2019s armpits. It was probably unbearably warm and smelly under his arms, but you loved the odor more than anything. You were practically worshiping it now, after all. Still\u2026you hoped you weren\u2019t being a nuisance to Joey. You didn\u2019t want to take up all his time just so you could get your fill of his masculine musk.  </span></div></div>",

You feel like you just had the worst hangover in your life... even though you dont drink last night! Or did you? Come to think of it, you cant remember what you did last night! Not that it really matters. None of it matters anymore.<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" you slowly got up from the warm hard flashy colored ground and gave a moment or two to clear your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" you groaned as you waited for the blur to fade away. And just as it did, youre greeted with the sight of a ginourmous silvery-blue winged beast turned away from you!<br>\r\n\"AAAAAHHH!!!\" you screamed and fell back at the sight of the colossal Godzilla-esque creature. Thankfully it paid no attention at all to the tiny morsel behind it... probably because it was more interested in the big fat juicy boy with a strange card-carrying device in front of it, practically sweating bullets at the sight of it's awesomeness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a sec. Is that a duel-disk on his arm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... looks like it's my move!\" quipped the thunderous voice behind you spoken from the Heavens itself! Strange... why does voice kinda sound like a badass Brock from Pokemon?<br>\r\nYou turned around and gazed up at the source of the godly voice and couldnt believe what you saw.<br>\r\nA gigantic boy that looked to be in his late-teens/early twenties giving off a menacing stare. This gigantic boy had short brown hair that covered the area above his menacing blue eyes, a necklace with a card wrapped around the collar of his black vest underneath a thick white sleeveless trenchcoat and carrying your puny little body atop a glorified high-tech card-carrying device mounted on his wrist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped as his giant hand big enough to crush your tiny body between his fingertips pulled out a card from house-sized deck!<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" the big badass looking boy smiled a menacing grin... a grin that could kill puppies! \"What a shame,\" he spoke in a voice sounding awfully familiar, \"guess I wont be showing off Obelisk this time around. Looks like I'll have to settle with the next best thing! And for that, I'll play Polymerization to fuse this Blue Eyes...\"<br>\r\nObelisk? Polymerization? Blue Eyes? That's when it hits you!<br>\r\n\"Holy crap...\" you whispered, hoping your disk-wielder didnt hear you, \"...please tell me that's not Seto Kaiba!\" It was! The big stuck up rich brat and rival of Yugi Moto from Yu Gi Oh! While part of you was wondering how this was possible, the other part of you was wondering why HIM?!  Of all the giant fictional character of this card-game anime you'd be at the mercy of, why Seto Kaiba?! He's not exactly the ideal person you'd wanna be at the mercy of if you were shrunken down to a bug! Sure he aint exactly evil, but he's definitely not friendly! In fact, you might stand a better chance on your own in this new giant world than being around him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I.... I must be dreaming!\" you tell yourself, \"yeah that's it! It's clearly a dream! I bet if I just pinch myself, I'll wake up and-\"<br>\r\n*WHAAAAAAAM!!!*<br>\r\n\"AARRRGGHH!!\" judging by the intense pain you felt after being slammed against the ground by a huge card, you were most definitely awake!<br>\r\n\"GO BLUE EYES ULTIMATE DRAGON!! WIPE OUT THE REST OF THIS LOSER'S LIFEPOINTS!!\" God, your ears!<br>\r\n\"GRRRAAARRRGGHH!!\" you heard a loud Jurassic Park roar followed by a huge explosion! It was self-explanatory what happened: Seto wiped out his opponent's LPs in one fell swoop thanks to his Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon! Yet another victory for Kaiba. The device powered down, ending the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw... no way!\" the other kid groaned as you slid out from under the card, \"I didnt even get to play my best cards yet!\"<br>\r\n\"Tough break,\" Kaiba shrugged uncaringly as approached the loser, \"you know the rules. Hand over your locator card and your rarest monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid lowered his head in shame and handed over his cards. You looked up at Kaiba, giving an intrigued yet still menacing stand at the rare monster.<br>\r\n\"Cosmo Queen?\" Seto raised an eyebrow, \"not bad. Had you played this sooner, you just mighta been able to beat me.\"<br>\r\n\"R...Really?\" hearing that got the kid's hopes up.<br>\r\n\"...Nah,\" and right back down they went as Kaiba stuffed the card in his pocket and walked off. Typical of the jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh....WWhhaaa!!\" unfortunately for you, you were desperately trying to keep your balance on Kaiba's duel disk as he headed off. It was quite a long drop to the ground if you slipped off!<br>\r\nSadly, it wasnt long before you nearly slipped off the disk and was left holding onto the edge for dear life with your colossal captor completely oblivious to the tiny guy on the verge of death.<br>\r\nIt looked as though you had no choice. If you wanted to survive, you'd have to shout for Kaiba's help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...that's what you'd do if you DIDNT already know what kind of guy Seto Kaiba is! You could already imagine what a rich snuckup snob like him would do if he saw you. He'd probably think your bug and flick you off his duel disk... or crush you underneath his thumb and wipe your bloody remains off on his trench coat and put on a new one! He'd probably use you as a tiny personal slave and force you to service him like rub his feet or wipe his deck clean (I said DECK!). Or he could completely deny your existence and think youre some kind of glitch in his duel disk system just like how he typically denies the supernatural!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, he might be your only hope of survival for quite a long while. And it doesnt look like you could hold for very long. So this begs the question: Which do you fear the most? A really really really long drop or a really really really big jerk's mercy?</span></div></div>",

Just your luck then that you were playing none other than Jaden Yuki, Duel Academy's top duelist.  The minute your life points dropped to zero everything around you felt like it was spinning att 100 mph.  Then you saw him, well you felt him first, the booms of his footsteps anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good game bro, now for my prize\" the teen says laughing as he reaches greedily for you.  \"Aww don't look so scared little fella you don't have to be scared of big ol' me\" Jaden says grinning toothily with you clasped in his hand.  \"I promise I'll be good to you, well you'll be good to me kinda the same thing right?  Seen as how I own you and all now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to shiver, this was all terrifying what were they thinking with these rules, if only you had faced an easier opponent, how was this kid still a Slifer anyway?  Jaden walks back to his dorm room and props himself up on the top bunk, \"Welcome home little guy, just you and me now haha\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you gonna do jaden?\" you ask, your voice quivering.  \"Hmmmm I dunno I'll let you get used to your position first\", \"What position?\" you ask not understanding what the huge teen meant.  \"Well your position in life, at my feet silly\" he says laughing \"You're mine now remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did not bode well for you, then Jaden spoke again...</span></div></div>",

Jaden was huge, he could do anything to you and there was nothing you could do to stop him. Making him angry by denying him was a very bad idea\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026strangely, you didn\u2019t seem to anger him. Jaden continued to smile at you while saying, \u201cWhy should I rub them myself when I have a perfectly good slave to do it?\u201d The teenage duelist places you at the end of the bed near his feet and begins unstrapping his boots. Once he\u2019s taken both of his boots off, he quickly slips off his white socks and tosses them across the room. You are now facing Jaden\u2019s bare feet, which you can already smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh\u2026my feet are so tried after standing all day.\u201d Jaden explains as he wiggles his toes in front of you. You spin around and try to run away. Jaden does nothing to stop you and simply watches you with amusement. You soon reach the end of the bed and your escape attempt ends there. You\u2019re on the top bunk\u2026there\u2019s no where for you to go. You turn back around just as Jaden lowers his foot onto you, pressing you against the sheets of the bed. \u201cYou can\u2019t escape from me, little dude. If I were you, I\u2019d start rubbing my feet! I can always own another duelist and replace you with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour start to panic underneath Jaden\u2019s sweaty sole. Did he just say \u201creplace\u201d? Was he planning on simply disposing of you if you didn\u2019t obey him? How can he say that and still smile?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stop, Jaden!\u201d you yell as the giant brunet uses his foot to drag you back over to him. \u201cI still have a dueling career to follow! I don\u2019t want to be your slave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChill, bro.\u201d he responds as he lifts his foot off you. \u201cYour dueling days are over. I own you now, so just accept it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden places his feet in front of you, still waiting for his foot rub. You know you have to do it before this guy decides to just crush you or something and go for the next duelist. You swallow your pride and start rubbing his let sole. The giant Slifer sighs in content and closes his eyes. Your small hands feel so good against his tired sole. As you rub it, you must endure the foul stench of teenage foot that poisons the air around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext foot.\u201d Jaden replaces the foot you\u2019re rubbing with his other one. As he does this, he accidentally whacks you with his toe and almost sends you flying off the bed. You\u2019re able to save yourself by grabbing hold of the sheets, but boy was that a close one! You couldn\u2019t believe Jaden had almost ended you with a single toe! \u2026and he didn\u2019t even notice! His eyes were shut tight. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any rubbing, little guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly recover from your near death experience and get back to the foot rub. You try your best to appease the teen; hoping he\u2019ll turn you back to normal if you do a good job. Unfortunately for you, Jaden has no intention of ever returning you to your old life. You\u2019re his now, from now until the day he gets bored of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was pretty good, little bro.\u201d Jaden said as he looked down at you. \u201cI have a feeling you and me are going to get along juuuuust fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs\u2026Is that all?\u201d you ask, already short on breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck no! We\u2019re just getting started, little guy!\u201d he replies, much to your disappointment. </span></div></div>",

His shoulders seemed to be a lot more... broad than most of the boys around the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden soon hopped back up onto the bed, looking down at you. You were right between his legs, the perfect view of his boxer-clad crotch before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have a LOT of fun!\" He said with a sinister grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw yeah...\" Jaden moaned. \"That's right...

Do it harder!\" He said, practically begging you to push yourself further. Back and forth, back and forth you had to keep working. A bet was a bet, and you were a man of your word, through and through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay... Th-That's enough...\" Jaden sighed. He reached over, and plucked you right up off his back. \"Wow! You really know how to massage a guy's back!\" Jaden smiled, thuroughly pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you lost a bet to him, and was a little upset that you were pretty much forced into eternal slavery, Jaden... Was a pretty hot kid. But you couldn't tell him that! Everyone knows he had the biggest thing ever for Alexia... Right? After all... Someone as cool as him would never be caught with someone who dueled as lame as you did... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden observed you closely. \"Hey... You thinking something?\" He asked. \"I don't want my little pet wearing out on the first night!\" He said with a toothy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP-Pet? Did he just call you pet? Wait, wait! You're just overthinking this! He just meant that you're his toy! There's no way he meant it the way you were thinking... Hey! Why were you thinking this anyway!? You liked chicks... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though... You were getting rejected every time... And no matter what you tried, you always ended up failing... At least the few friends you had were always there to cheer you up. Sure, they were no one special, but at the same time, they were always there for you. Your guys always treated you better than the ladies did... And here you thought beating Jaden in a battle would've gotten you that prestige... And here you are now, in the hands of the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Are you okay?!\" Jaden asked, wiping a tear he saw falling from your eye. There was no way he was going to release you, but at the same time, things wouldn't be much better for him if his new little toy suddenly decided to disappear... Forever. \"Hey... C'mon, cheer up, okay? I-I'll make you do something easier! It won't be hard on you at all, okay!?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiped your eyes, and sniffled a little. Everything might be okay... Being Jaden's slave shouldn't be too bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you ready?\" He asked with a bright smile. \"Okay! Here goes!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Walter and you\u2019re an 18-year-old traveling mage. You had never been interested in joining a guild and would rather do things your own way. When it came to magic, you didn\u2019t have a specialty, but learned a variety of techniques while on the road. While not an expert at any of them, you held a large arsenal you could use to surprise any opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day you were visiting the town of Magnolia and decided to stop by a diner for lunch. The waitress soon brought you your order of grilled steak and a glass of lemonade. As you picked up your fork and knife and cut into the juicy slab of meat, you saw the same waitress carry a large tray of good to the booth behind you. As you popped the first bite of your meal into your mouth, you wondered who could eat such a large portion of food. As you chewed and swallowed your steak, you suddenly heard the most obnoxious and disgusting sounds behind you. Whoever had ordered that foot was eating it like a complete pig. The sounds of chewing, slurping, gulping, tearing, and sucking were quickly making you lose your appetite. Your patience finally reached its limit when the loudest burp you had ever heard was released behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, do you have any manners?!\u201d you shout at the customer while spinning around. The pink haired individual turned his head with a \u201chuh\u201d and glared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d he asks as he swallows an entire chicken leg, save the bone. His stare is telling you that this is one guy you do not want to mess with. It\u2019s the look of someone who\u2019ll punch your lights out for just bumping into him. And his eyes\u2026you swear you saw sparks in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026sorry\u2026\u201d you mutter before turning your head back to your own plate. The man behind you says nothing and goes back to eating. As you take a sip of your lemonade, you begin to wonder why that guy seemed so familiar. Looking around, you noticed none of the other customers were batting an eyelash at him. Were they used to his rude eating habits? As you were chewing on an other piece of steak, it suddenly dawned on you. That pink hair, that white scarf, that black waistcoat\u2026and that stamp right below his right shoulder! That was Natsu Dragneel, the Salamander from Fairy Tail! You began to sweat as you realized you had just yelled at someone so powerful and infamous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, are you enjoying your meal?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d You turn to see the waitress from before. \u201cOh, yes, it\u2019s delicious. However, I must be going so I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to pay for it.\u201d You place the payment for the meal next to the half eaten steak and begin to walk toward the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a moment, sir. You forgot to pay for your friend\u2019s meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d You turn around and give the waitress a puzzled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe person who sat behind you.\u201d the woman points to the empty seat where Natsu was sitting. The remains of his meal were scattered all over the table. \u201cHe said you were a friend of his and would pay his tab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026WHAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaah, that really hit the spot.\u201d Natsu said to himself as he patted his toned stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you, wait up!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu turns around and sees you running toward him. You had finally caught up to the bastard in the middle of an alleyway behind some buildings. You slowed down as you got closer to the fire mage and glared at him angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?! Do you have any idea how much your meal cost? I just threw away almost a week worth of spending money!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Natsu scratched his head as he tried to remember who you were. A light bulb then lit up in that spacious head of his. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you! Thanks for the meal, buddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not your buddy! Why did you tell the waitress that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I just thought you\u2019d like to pay for my meal since you seem like an expert on manners. So thanks again; I appreciate it!\u201d Natsu smiled toothily. He was really starting to piss you off\u2026who cares if he was the infamous Salamander? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, \u201cbuddy\u201d, I\u2019m not letting you get away with ripping me off like this! You\u2019re gonna pay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna fight?\u201d Natsu smirked and clenches his fist. It suddenly bursts into white hot flames and you take a step back. You begin to sweat, but it\u2019s not because of the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate me! I know just the magic to cut you down to size!\u201d you exclaim as you point your index finger at the Fairy Tail mage. Natsu changes into a fighting stance as he realizes you\u2019re a mage too. You smirk as the tip of your finger begins to glow with a multicolored light. He won\u2019t be able to dodge this magic. \u201cReduction!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight floods out of your finger and fills the area. Natsu shields his eyes with his arms as the light becomes to bright for him to look at. You too cannot stare directly into the light and close your eyes. You feel the light all around you and it seems to cut you off from reality. You keep your eyes shut for several seconds until the light fades and it\u2019s safe to open your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s see how small he got\u2026\u201d you say to yourself as you look forward. To your absolute shock, you see that everything is bigger. The small strands of grass that poke out of the stone road are as big as you are! The sky seems so much higher up and you feel a small breeze threaten to knock you down. \u201cWh-what\u2019s going on? Why did I shrink too?!\u201d You don\u2019t understand at all. You had used Reduction to shrink things before\u2026although never human beings. Damn it, what a setback! \u201cI better reverse the magic or else\u2026\u201d You pause for a moment. \u201cSHIT, I don\u2019t know how to reverse it!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted when you hear a loud booming sound. You hear it again, this time closer. You think someone his heading toward you and you know their close when the booms are followed by small quakes. When the maker of the booms comes into view, you stare up in disbelief at the towering form of Natsu. Why\u2026why didn\u2019t he shrink?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did that guy go?\u201d Natsu questions as he glances around. \u201cSome kind of teleporting magic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Natsu\u2019s two giant, sandaled feet land directly in front of you. You can\u2019t get over how gigantic he his\u2026you barely reach up to his toes! The towering teen glances around, expecting you to attack him any second now. Your mind begins to wander and you think about what he\u2019ll do to you if he finds you like this. Your question is soon answered\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of your trance and look back up to see Natsu staring directly at you. You begin to tremble in fear while the intimidating mage simply stares at you. What\u2019s he going to do? Your position right now couldn\u2019t be any worse\u2026this might be the end of your traveling days...</span></div></div>",

Those huge feet could crush you without a second thought! After you were so nasty to him, what reason did he have to NOT crush you? It wouldn't even be considered murder! He could just scrape you off his foot like a bug! It wasn't looking good at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Natsu's face broke out into a huge grin. He started laughing and pointing at you, holding his stomach as he doubled over. \"Oh man! That's hilarious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fear quickly turned to confusion. \"H-hey! What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few seconds ago you were worried about becoming a smear! Now...you were actually yelling at him?!? Natsu didn't seem to care. His laughter eventually subsided and he sighed, wiping away a tear. \"You are! I mean, you go through all this trouble, getting up in my face, and then, just when we're about to start you shrink yourself into a bug! That's a brilliant battle strategy!\" The sarcasm was dripping from his every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flushed and muttered, \"Shut up you giant idiot. I can't plan for everything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu bent down and looked you over. \"This is actually pretty cool! You're just like a little toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shoved his foot close to you, his toe bumping into your body, making you stumble back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! My toes are bigger than you! Forget toy, you're a BUG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kicked his toe in annoyance and said, \"Stop it! I'm a respectable mage! I won't be treated like an insect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu flashed you a mischievous grin and said, \"Tough luck kid! You made a huge nuisance of yourself, yelling at me, and trying to start a fight with me! Maybe you'd like to meet my foot and learn your place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and lifted his foot up, his heel still firmly planted in the dusty street. He hovered his foot over you dangerously and all your anger evaporated. You just wanted to live! Let this idiot say whatever he wanted if it meant you could escape and undo this damn spell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! I'm sorry! Please don't kill me Salamander-sama!\" Sama? HIM?!? You grit your teeth. If it helped you live for now...you could always come back and blast this idiot later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu seemed to like that since he moved his foot aside and smiled at you. \"That's more like it! About time you apologized!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word he reached down and scooped you up in his hand, holding you tightly. \"What the hell are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu shook his head and said, \"Like I said before, you have to know your place. I'm a great and powerful mage and you...are a bug. So, you'll make the perfect pet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP-pet?!? No! This wasn't what you wanted at all! You opened your mouth to protest when Natsu said cheerfully, \"It's either that or getting stepped on! That's the only fate for a bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth snapped shut. Better to be a living pet than a dead smear. This would give you ample time to try and figure out a way to reverse the spell. You looked up at Natsu and said, \"O-okay...I guess I'll be your pet then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I already decided.\" Natsu said simply, dropping you in his vest pocket. \"Now stay put bug boy! I have to check in at the guild, then I'm heading home and we're going to have some fun together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood ran cold. Fun? What would a crazy guy like the Salamander think is fun? You shuddered. Maybe you wouldn't survive this ordeal after all...</span></div></div>",

No one had seen both you and him enter the alleyway, so no one questioned why only he left. The pink haired teenager made his way toward the Fairy Tail guild while you attempted to keep your balance inside the pocket. Despite your attempts, every movement Natsu made caused you to jumble around in the pocket. It didn\u2019t help that the giant\u2019s body heat (which was unusually high) was making the inside of the pocket heat up. It wasn\u2019t long before you began to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d Natsu shouted as he entered through the doors of the guild. He was greeted by a crowd of his fellow mages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Natsu!\u201d greeted Macao. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be back for another day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? That job was a piece of cake!\u201d Natsu replied, slamming his fist into his palm. \u201cI need something more challenging.\u201d Natsu turns his head to the master of the guild, Makarov. The short, elderly man was sitting in the same place he always was. \u201cHey, Master, let me take on another S-class job!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the 100th time, Natsu, no.\u201d Makarov replied instantaneously. \u201cYou know the rules: only S-class mages can take on S-class quests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPfft, fine.\u201d Natsu turned away and headed for the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeaving already, Natsu? Why not stay awhile and have a drink?\u201d Wakaba asked, holding his mug up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later. I have some things to take care of back at home.\u201d Natsu replied before waving and exiting the guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow strange\u2026Natsu usually always spends his time here. I wonder what he has to take care of?\u201d Mirajane pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu entered his apartment building, which was close to the guild, and made his way up to his apartment number. Upon reaching it, he fumbled with the knob a bit until he realized it was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did I put that key\u2026\u201d Natsu mumbled as he searched his pockets, but found nothing but you and a few coins. \u201cAh well\u2026\u201d Natsu held his fist back and punched down the door, sending it flying into the apartment and splitting upon impact with a wall. You climbed up the pocket and peeked out to see what the noise was about. Your eyes widened when they fell upon the ruined door. That was overly extreme\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHome sweet home!\u201d Natsu exclaimed as he walked into his apartment. The place was a mess; trash everywhere, dirty dishes still in the sink, and several scorch parks decorated the walls. Natsu clearly did not use the money he got from jobs to renovate his home, so what did he use it for? Dumb question; food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026shouldn\u2019t you do something about that door?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, I think my home security is the last think you should be worrying about, kid.\u201d Natsu replied as he grabbed you by the back of your shirt and dangled you before his face. \u201cYou should worry about yourself; being my pet isn\u2019t going to be easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu walked into his bedroom which, like the rest of the apartment, wasn\u2019t much to look at. I mean, his \u201cbed\u201d was nothing but a sleeping bag. The Salamander stood in the center of his room and placed you on the floor. He placed his hands on his hips and grinned down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, bug boy, let\u2019s have some fun. You understand that you\u2019re my pet now, right? That makes me your great and powerful master. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, whatever\u2026\u201d you replied, folding your arms over chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I don\u2019t think you do. Words are just words, after all. I think you need to be shown why you\u2019re the pet and I\u2019m the master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-how?\u201d you ask, fearful of what his answer\u2019s going to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

He smirked down at you, on your butt from the mini earthquake his foot had created.

Heh!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis  made you quiver in fear before the mighty feet of The Salamander who you had pissed off.  Much to Natsu\u2019s delight as he inched his feet close enough so that your face was pressed into his sole. Which expanded in all directions like a mountain of soft, wet flesh.  It was then that you got your first whiff of  the fire mage\u2019s  fittingly sweaty feet.  And it was ungodly.  Natsu\u2019s  toes wiggled above your head as your face was pressed deeper and deeper into the squishy flesh.  Then Natsu made his first command as your new master\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There\u2019s no way I\u2019m rubbing your disgusting feet! Who do you think you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m the big guy who can crush you like a bug!\u201d Natsu exclaimed, pointing a thumb at his heaving chest. \u201cYou WILL do as I say, or you\u2019ll find yourself smeared out under my foot sooner than expected.\u201d Natsu moved his feet closer to you, bringing the rank smell of them closer as well. You coughed and stared at the two walls of flesh. They really could crush you like you were nothing. To this giant Fairy Tail mage, you WERE nothing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-fine\u2026\u201d you surrendered and slowly approached one of the fleshy soles. You placed your palms onto the hard, yet strangely soft, surface and started rubbing. Not three seconds later, the giant Salamander retracts his foot and causes you to fall forward onto your face. \u201cOw!  What the hell was that for?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid insect, I didn\u2019t finish! I want you to give my feet a nice massage\u2026with your FACE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to WHAT?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I want you to rub my soles with your face, bug boy.

In fact\u2026\u201d Natsu grinned toothily and cracked his knuckles. \u201c\u2026I think I will! Then you\u2019ll have no choice but to use your face. Come here\u2026\u201d Natsu leaned forward and reached for you. Your eyes widened as you imagined those tree-sized fingers snapping your arms with no effort at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay! I\u2019ll do as you say; please don\u2019t!\u201d you cry as Natsu\u2019s fingers are just inches from your minuscule form. The giant simply smirks and sits back again. His two bare soles lay before you as he awaits your service. You gulp and approach the foot once again. This time, with much reluctance, you push your body against the living wall and rub yourself into it. Natsu sighs as his sole gets rubbed down with your form, making him feel big and powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026that\u2019s good! Don\u2019t forget to dig your nose into it and smell it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble at this and turn your head so your nose is buried into the sweaty foot that is Natsu Dragneel\u2019s. The musky smell of the sweaty mage assaults your nose and makes your eyes water intensely. Natsu doesn\u2019t take pity in your suffering and just leans back with his eyes closed. The massage lasts a full ten minutes, with you going back and forth between the giant\u2019s two feet. When the ten minutes pass, you stand before the towering Natsu a soaked mess. Your hair and clothes are stained with perspiration and your skin is tinted red from the immense heat that radiates off Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you stop, slave? My feet could still use some more rubbing!\u201d Natsu smiles and wiggles his toes in anticipation. You, however, do not share his enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026it\u2019s so hot\u2026\u201d you reply weakly as you wipe some of your own sweat off your face. \u201cLet me just rest a bit\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant Natsu doesn\u2019t take your desire for a rest kindly and scowls down at you.

Pleasing a giant wasn\u2019t easy! Pleasing a giant <b>Natsu</b> was near impossible! Unfortunately, because you failed to please him, your next plight began. Before you even noticed, Natsu reached down and snatched you off the floor. You suddenly found yourself off the floor and enwrapped by the teen\u2019s massive digits. Natsu brought you up to his face and your vision was filled with his scowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRest? You want to rest after just that? You really are a pathetic weakling!\u201d Natsu shouted, blowing hot air in your face. The giant Fairy Tail mage suddenly began squeezing you. At first the pressure was just uncomfortable, but then it soon became painful and you started screaming in agony. This guy was crushing you to death and he wasn\u2019t even breaking a sweat! Natsu saw that you were in pain and it amused him, turning his frown into a smirk. \u201cHehe, look at you. You\u2019re so weak that I could probably do this to you at your former size!\u201d Natsu snickered a bit and laughed at your puny being. His laugh soon ended, however, and he resumed scowling at you.  \u201cAlright, bug, time to continue my foot rub!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-but\u2026I can\u2019t!\u201d you blurted out as Natsu stopped trying to turn you into putty in his hand. \u201cYou trying to crush me hasn\u2019t helped, either!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, don\u2019t worry about it, bug. If you\u2019re too weak to fulfill your simple duties, then I\u2019ll just help you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you going to help me rub your-?\u201d you started to say, but was interrupted when Natsu took you away from his boyish face and brought you down to his feet. Instead of dropping you onto the hard floor like you thought, he instead smacked you against his sole! \u201cAH! What are you-mmmmmffft!!\u201d Your complaints were muffled when Natsu smushed your face into his sole and started rubbing you into the sweaty flesh. You screamed as you were handled like a sponge, wiping up the drops of salty fluid as you were dragged across the sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026yeah. Your small body against my tired sole feels great!\u201d Natsu comments as he starts rubbing you into the hard some harder and faster. He didn\u2019t seem to care about your wellbeing; treating you like you were an inanimate object meant to be used by him. He didn\u2019t just rub over his soles either, but also the top of his foot and his ankle. You were helpless in your struggles; the toned giant far too strong for you. Natsu made sure to slip you between his toes as well, rubbing you into the pockets of toe jam and cleaning them up against your will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the powerful Dragon Slayer had finished using you on his right foot, he did everything over again to the left. AT this point you had ceased your struggles and screams, too weak to continue them and knowing they weren\u2019t doing anything but making this experience worse. After Natsu finished giving both his feet the good rubdown they deserved, he opens his hand and lets you lay upon it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was great, bug boy! You make a good sweat rag! Maybe next time I can use you to scrub the rest of my body!\u201d Natsu grins toothily and flexes his arm. The last thing you see before you blank out from the in toxic smell of musk and sweat is Natsu\u2019s bulging bicep. The last thing you hear is his laughing\u2026</span></div></div>",

So without any effort at all, he lifted the door and fitted it back into the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fire Mage laid down on his sleeping bag with a sigh, it was kinda hot in this room.

He grinned as he sat indian style on top of the sleeping bag and observed you in his toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello bug, have a good sleep?\" Natsu yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were unable to answer due to the pocket of sweat in the toe crotch, But that was ok, Natsu wasn't expecting one as he gave you a tight squeeze. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cToday feels like a great day!\u201d Natsu exclaims as he stretches the rest of his body. The fire mage hops to his feet, slamming down on you and making you yelp in pain. Your cry is muffled by his cheesy, sweaty flesh and Natsu doesn\u2019t even notice it. The giant strolls over to the window and looks out it, taking a deep breath of air. He looks up at the hot sun and smiles. \u201cBetter than great, in fact! I have a tiny little bug to play around with.\u201d Natsu curls his toes around you again and makes his way into the kitchen, stepping on your shrunken body with each step. \u201cWhat better way to start the morning with a nice meal!\u201d Natsu snickers and pats his exposed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen begins opening his cabinets, searching for something to eat. Unfortunately, he finds nothing but dust, crumbs, and empty boxes. He takes out a box of cereal and shakes the contents out, but all he gets his a single stale piece. The Salamander opens another cabinet and spots a cockroach scurry by. Sighing, Natsu slams the cabinet shit and folds his arms over his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I need to do some shopping\u2026but there has to be SOMETHING I can eat!\u201d Natsu whines and glances around again. His eyes finally land on a loaf of bread next to the toaster. With a grin, Natsu takes two slices of bread and pops them into a toaster. When he tries to turn the toaster on, however, he finds that the bread won\u2019t go down. Further inspection reveals that the plug is broken. \u201cGrrrr!!\u201d Natsu bangs the counter with his fist, causing the two pieces of toast to shoot into the air. While they\u2019re airborne, Natsu opens his mouth and released a torrent of fire onto the pieces of bread. When they fall into his hand, they\u2019re now a light golden brown. Natsu smirks and opens up the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIck, smells like something rotted!\u201d Natsu fans the air in front of his face. \u201cDoesn\u2019t smell as bad as me, though!\u201d Natsu chuckles and take out the butter. After lathering his toast up, the Dragon Slayer sits down at his table with a glass of milk and begins eating. As he chews his first chomp, his eyes look under the table to find you still squirming under his foot. \u201cI bet you\u2019re hungry too, bug. Well, your breakfast is right in front of you!\u201d Natsu spreads his toes and wiggles them. \u201cLick up all the toe jam you can find, slave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream something in response to this, but it\u2019s muffled. Natsu thinks it\u2019s something like \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious!\u201d or \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m eating that!\u201d Natsu doesn\u2019t care what you really said, though. Knowing it was something disobedient-like, the giant responds by giving your head a quick clench with his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo back talk, little guy. Do as I say or else you\u2019ll BECOME toe jam!\u201d Natsu chuckles and grinds his toes together. The immense pressure his toes are inflicting upon you is enough to make you comply. Natsu feels your tongue start slurping against his flesh and smiles with content. He takes a sip of his milk and other bite of his butter and toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween his foot and sandal, you\u2019re being tortured with a breakfast of sweat and foot filth. The taste is so horrible that you have to stop for a minute to breathe (even though you\u2019re breathing in his foul foot odor). Every time you do this, Natsu squeezes you lightly with his toes to make you continue. The sound of his munching high above you sounds like he\u2019s devouring something huge. How can someone make so much noise from eating toast?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Natsu polishes off the last of his toast and licks the crumbs from his fingers. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t very filling, but I can always grab something toe eat at the guild.\u201d Natsu says as he pats his abs. \u201cHow\u2019s your breakfast, pet?\u201d Natsu looks down at his foot and notices you\u2019re still licking like a good slave. \u201cHehe, must be enjoying it.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I'm hungry too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu looked down at you as if noticing you for the first time, \"No way! You're a bug....And bugs get dirt to eat! So you get the dirt and slime between my toes for breakfast!\" Natsu smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would've glared up at him and started to shout, had Natsu not stood up at that moment and smushed your face into his toe flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu was out the door and walking down the street to the very same restaurant as yesterday, it infuriated you that he could go about eating breakfast while you lay there sucking on toe jam! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu sat down at a table and picked up a menu, he ordered what sounded to you like his usual one of everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natsu ate his huge pile of breakfast food, you began to feel so full of toe gunk and sweat that you weren't hungry anymore and decided to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you Natsu didn't notice you were slowing to a stop until he had sucked down every last bite of his own delicious, not sweaty meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Natsu had paid his bill and was walking down the sidewalk in the hot sun, sweating like a pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu strolled back to his apartment, completely forgetting that he was late in reporting to the guild.

He hurried down the hall toward his room and saw the door had been knocked down again, suspecting burglars (despite really not having anything of value inside his little room) Natsu sighed and strolled inside the room, expecting a few no balls hoods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he found was his rival Gray standing by the window and frowning at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray looked over at Natsu and smirked, \"The guild sent me to tell you that you forgot to show up, again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu sighed, \"I was eating breakfast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme guess, the entire restaurant's supply?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you!\" Natsu took a heavy stomp forward, only to stop and look down at his toes when he heard a tiny scream from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I forgot about shrimpy!\" Natsu said sitting down on the floor and pulling off his sandal, wafting a foul smell over to Gray, making him wrinkle his nose a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot about who? And why are you taking off your sandal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray came closer and his eyes grew wide as he saw what Natsu was holding. It was a tiny person, little enough to be squished underfoot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa....what the hell?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu grinned toothily up at Gray, \"Cool eh? He tried to attack me and accidentally shrunk himself...Pretty dumb right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray stooped down and poked you with his finger, \"Hmm....I'll say. So why was he in your sandal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that...He's my pet slave. He does whatever I want. Isn't that right squirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare up at the pink haired boy, and Gray laughs. \"Ha ha ha, Are you sure he does what you tell him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu looked up at Gray and glared down at you, \"Well....if you think you can do better, try him out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know I can break a puny like him!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gray bent down under the kitchen table and began untying his big, black boots. You couldn\u2019t actually see that he was doing this, but you knew that\u2019s what he was doing. Why did these giant mages want to dominate you with their feet anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike you expected, Gray slipped both his bare feet out of his boots and plopped them onto the tabletop with a loud boom. You took a few steps back from the bare soles as Gray smiled and wiggled his dingy toes. The bottom of the soles were clearly glistening and bits and pieces of dirt and dust covered his feet. As you retreated backwards, you felt another tremor go through the table as Natsu plopped his own feet behind you; his other sandal now off. Both teenage Fairy Tail members wiggled their toes and chuckled at your tiny form as you shuddered under their gazes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, buggy mage, first I want you to give my feet a nice rub!\u201d Gray ordered, bringing his soles closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, he\u2019s worshipping my feet first!\u201d Natsu said from across the table, glaring at the guest to his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI spoke first, so I\u2019m getting him first.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, this is my apartment so I\u2019M going first!\u201d Natsu retaliated, slamming his fist against the table. The impact of his large fist startled you enough so you jumped backwards\u2026right into Gray\u2019s foot. The ice mage smirked down at you as you did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww\u2026look at that; he likes my feet more. I guess that settles it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You just me him a few minutes ago and you already\u2026\u201d Natsu grumbled before finishing and folded his arms over his chest, clearly unhappy with this development. You look up at Gray and see him urging you to his foot. You know who Gray is and know he\u2019s a powerful mage on par with Natsu himself. You wouldn\u2019t want to get him angry at normal size, and you sure as hell don\u2019t want to piss him off when you\u2019re tiny! You obey is earlier command and start rubbing his foot. You dig your fingers into his hard sole, wanting to appease the giant as much as possible. Gray looks down at you with amusement, feeling mighty and powerful already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to take nice whiffs of it, too. You\u2019re going to be spending a lot of time with my feet once you submit to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp at the thought of being \u201chis\u201d and obey this as well. You push your face into Gray\u2019s sweaty sole and start sniffing, whining as you do. As you worship the superior mage\u2019s foot, Natsu taps his fingers against his arm and watches impatiently. He made this deal with Gray thinking he could break you easily, but by the looks of things you might turn to Gray\u2019s side first\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it my turn yet?\u201d Natsu asked, wiggling his toes impatiently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe patient, idiot. He hasn\u2019t even gotten to my other foot yet. Speaking of which\u2026\u201d Gray wiggles the toes of his other foot, silently telling you to get over there. You do so and begin smelling and rubbing that foot too. \u201cI want you to lick this one. Lick it nice and good\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-bu-.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do it!\u201d Gray tells you, his voice not showing a hint of remorse or respect for you. You were, after all, just a bug to him. You stick out your tongue and drag it across Gray\u2019s sole, lapping up the sweat and dirt on it like a good little slave. Gray reclines in his chair and places his hand son his stomach, relaxing to the gentle feel of your wet tongue against his warm sole. A few minutes pass and Natsu\u2019s patience hit\u2019s the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s it! Get over here, bug boy! Or else I\u2019ll smash you and no one will have you!\u201d Natsu yells, slamming his fist against the table again. You cringe and instantly trek across the table to Natsu\u2019s feet. Gray looks on in disappointment and sighs. He watches as you press yourself up against Natsu\u2019s sole and rub. Natsu casually tells you to use your tongue too and that soon gets to work on his sole. Natsu\u2019s feet are much sweatier and smellier than Gray\u2019s, but you had already gotten pretty use to them after almost getting crushed under them. Natsu is also more demanding than Gray, telling you to switch between feet and service them evenly. Before long not only is your arms and tongue tired, but your legs also become sore. Several minutes pass\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Gray, you did it again.\u201d Natsu suddenly says, his eyes not even fully on Gray. You turn around to see what he means and are surprised to see that Gray was now shirtless, his muscular and toned body uncovered for all to see. The stamp on his chest is also visible, showing his alignment with Fairy Tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Gray glances down at himself. \u201cOoh\u2026I didn\u2019t even notice.\u201d Gray doesn\u2019t make any movement to put his shirt on and instead sniffs under his arms. He looks at you and notice you\u2019re staring at him. The dark haired mage smirks and reaches across the table, grabbing you in his strong grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d Natsu asks, noticing no one was rubbing his foot anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just want to try something\u2026\u201d Gray replies as he raises his other arm over his head and brings you near the pit. Your eyes go wide as you stare at the fuzzy hair under his arm. The smell of male B.O. is all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what are you doing?!\u201d you scream, squirming in Gray\u2019s grip as you\u2019re brought closer an closer to the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, runt. You\u2019re acting like I\u2019m going to shove you in there\u2026\u201d Gray says as he stops moving you closer\u2026but your face is still touching his armpit hairs and only inches from his sweaty skin. \u201cI just want you to lick and smell something else that reeks. Are my pits good enough for you, bug?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re terrible\u2026\u201d you mutter as you cough and choke on the smelly fumes. Gray just chuckles and brushes your face against his hairs. \u201cGet to work, or else I might just shove you in there\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting stuck in his pit would be hell, you think, so you decide to avoid that and do as he says. You close your eyes and take deep sniffs of the pit. Meanwhile your abused tongue creeps out of your mouth and brushes against Gray\u2019s skin. The sweat that covers his pit is even worse than his feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm\u2026yeah. Lick it all up like a good bug.\u201d Gray says softly, loving demeaning you like this.</span></div></div>",

You have this feeling deep within the pit of your gut that anything else you might do to piss him off would only wind up putting your diminished existence in even more danger than it already was. You prayed that he would cut you some slack for being too exhausted to do any better (since it WAS him and Natsu who tired you out), and hoped that the situation would eventually begin to shed some light on your predicament...but as fate would have it, things made a turn for the worst. \"Oh Shiiit!!\"  you began to yell as his hand came towards you at a rapid pace. You tried to run hoping to avoid the colossal thing, but your attempts were feeble at best. Once he grabbed onto you, it became clear there was no way of breaking free. His grip was so firm and powerful it felt as if your very body would be crushed, and he wasn't even trying! this boy was clearly not someone you wanted to upset. Even though he is nicer than Natsu, he only saw you as a pathetic pet bug whose only use is to satisfy his needs. to you, this 'boy' was like that of a God, and not a very caring one at that. as his grip loosened, you started to wonder if he was going to put you down and forget your mistake, but what little hope you had developed was quickly crushed along with your face as he slammed your body face-first into the tiny hair fibers of his musky armpit. \"THIS is what I expect from you next time!\" he firmly proclaims as he uses his index finger and thumb to apply a second of pressure towards your neck, causing your mouth to open. The God-like Gray Follows up, by quickly letting go of your body from his two fingers and then slamming your body into his right armpit with his left hand, face AND tongue first.  As he gently rubs your face into the sweaty bristles of his pit, a gleaming smile rises on his face, loving every second of humiliation he's putting you through. \"Submit bug, and call me your God.\" He says in a softened tone. Upon hearing this though, Natsu begins turning flame red from the amount of time Gray is taking mixed with the fact that he is about to break you down and win without having to even abuse you as rough as he did. \"If this goes on, he'll win for sure!\" Natsu says under his breath as he begins to get up and reach for your body to regain his inturrupted turn. But  as he is about to make contact with you, Gray freezes Natsu's arm with his own free hand. \"I never said I was finished loser. If you want him so badly then let the twerp decide who he wants! Unless you're scared of the outcome.\" Natsu quickly burns out of the encased frozen state simply by raising his body temperature out of anger and frustration towards Gray's Grinning remark. But right as he is about to blow his top, he remembers that you were just shoved into his armpit! Even if Gray treats you better in terms of abuse, You're bound to come to his side after that humiliation. \"Alright then, so what'll it be, twerp?\"</span></div></div>",

All the while you lapped at his skin and smelled his musk, your face turning a shade of green as you did this. Gray let you worship his fit for a good few minutes before tossing you effortlessly into the air and catching you with his other hand. You were immediately brought to his other pit, which you did the same thing all over again. Natsu watched you from his seat, still looking pissed that Gray was hogging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Gray! I want some pit worship!\u201d Natsu said, standing up and stomping over to Gray. The ice mage rolled his eyes and took you out of his pit. You took this opportunity to gasp for fresh air (even though you could still smell the fragrant B.O. coming off of Gray\u2019s naked torso). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect me to give you any. Here; knock yourself out.\u201d Gray replied before he tossed you to Natsu. The grinning giant caught you in his hand and brought you to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe\u2026you\u2019re all mine.\u201d he whispered as he swung his free arm over the back of his neck, revealing the rosy haired pit his vest left uncovered. Natsu whipped you into it a second later\u2026a bit TOO quickly. He accidentally pushed your face into his stinky pit. As soon as your nose took in the horrid stench, you screamed in horror. Your scream allowed a load of sweat to make its way into your mouth. \u201cOops, sorry\u2026\u201d Natsu said as he inched you off his pit, but kept your face buried in his hairs. \u201c\u2026NOT! Now start worshiping!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned at the smell but began licking anyway. The sweat was hot and salty and the smell was making you suffer even when you weren\u2019t trying to take in big whiffs. As you did this, Natsu smiled widely as he knew his victory was insured. The rules of the deal was whoever broke you first got to keep you. By making you smell so much of him, Gray had involuntarily brought you close to the breaking point. Now all you needed to do was take in his manly musk and you\u2019d crack in no time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tongue was beyond sore by the time Natsu switched hands and made you service his other pit. It was covered in his pink hairs and pain coursed through your mouth every time the pink muscle touched Natsu\u2019s skin. You started to tear up, not only because of the raunchy odor, but because these giants were starting to break you. If things continued the way they were, you knew you wouldn\u2019t be the proud mage you once were. You\u2019d be nothing but a sniveling bug to whoever owned you. Natsu smelled so badly\u2026you might just become his. Maybe that wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Natsu was a powerful mage, not a weak one like you. He had a strong body worth worshiping. You wouldn\u2019t mind servicing him everyday for the rest of you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO! What were you doing? You wouldn\u2019t think that way! Maybe there was still a way to reverse this Reduction spell. You could still get back to normal and then you\u2019d\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel any licking!\u201d Natsu shouts at you as he shoves your face into his hellishly hot pit. You realized you had stopped licking his pit for a moment and got a face full of teen sweat for it. You immediately got back to work, lapping up the sweat on his hairs like a good  pet slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting your mind wasn\u2019t the only thing Natsu\u2019s musk was doing. As the sweat of the two boys filled your stomach, your eyes rolled into the back of your head. You felt dizzy and sick\u2026all this foot and pit sweat couldn\u2019t be good for you\u2026</span></div></div>",

You kept licking until your tongue felt incredibly tired and sore, followed by a sigh, inhaling deeply as you desperately trying to catch a breath.<br>\r\nGetting annoyed by the fact that you did a bad job, several times absently licking his pit, The fire mage began to shove you to his pit, making your face brushed against the smelly-wet flesh. He moved his hand repeatedly, shoving you deeper, didn't give any chance for catching a single fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, you began to feel losing your consciousness, not able to take his torture any further. Natsu advanced his face to get better view. He grinned evilly while chuckling at your state, mocking you, describing the images that you were just too weak and pathetic even compared to his feet and pit. And to your disappointment, you were just not worthy enough to serve his pit, knowing you didn't have such capability to worship your master body, his feet, his pit, his massive organ, and all his body in glory like a good slave, you just don't have that, proving how insignificant you were compared to your master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll those thought and dominating side of Natsu made you wanted to submit to him, after all it wasn't so bad having powerful master, as long as you serve him, worshiping him so he would show his mercy to you and the only reason for you to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you could feel the cold air, coming to a conclusion that you weren't at his pit anymore, taking this chance to get a good breath. In just seconds you were brought to his feet, but this was even worse, slowly Natsu raised his foot, keeping your underneath, then applied pressure slightly which caused you fell to your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick it!\" Natsu voice boomed as he commanded you to lick his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave a glance to him for a second, then start to lick his foot and you realized your tongue had recovered from the salt sensation earlier. Your hands touched his foot, forming pushing position as to hold his foot from stepping, smearing on you, but actually that was useless, his foot was more powerful than your whole strength anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's your master, bug?\" said the fire mage, demanding for an answer, while starring at Gray, giving a cocky expression to show him who's the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray just sighed, looking at you under Natsu's foot, still licking like a good foot slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter moment of good foot licking and worshiping, then you decided to..</span></div></div>",

And if you pleased him he might even reward you with his amazing body. The idea was looking more appealing by the minute, it would be so much easyer to simply give in and serve Natsu like the god he was, it sure beat pissing him off and making him torture you for your bad behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were being brainwashed into loving Natsu, you start thinking about how it was your fault you were being punished all the time and how the punishment didn't compare to the pain you felt for making master Natsu unhappy. You would give in to Natsu this moment and work your whole life to please him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're thinking this, Natsu gets impatient and increases the pressure on your body, then he repeats his question \"Who's your master, bug?\" He was looking straight at his foot, waiting for your response with a cocky smirk plastered to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately crawl in between his 3rd and 2nd toe to get a look at his handsome face, ready to submit to him. But just when you're about to answer you find youre obstructed by his toejam and you can't talk properly, so you greedily slurp it up and swallow hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu watches with a smile as you give his toes the love they deserve, he sees you have finally come to your senses and accepted him as your owner, master and god. Once you are done cleaning his toes, you look up and give him your answer \"I want to be your slave forever master Natsu, you will always be my master and i promise to worship every part of your godly body the way it deserves. I'm greatfull you let such an unworthy and weak bug like me be your slave and i promise i wont ever dissappoint you master\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu smiles down at you, which fills you with happiness, and then says \"Glad to hear it, slave\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray watches this develop with jealousy and storms off, but before he exits Natsu says to him \"Hey Grey you can come over any time to play with the squirt, it'll be more fun now that he's realized that were gods\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll come over soon\" says Gray and exits Natsu's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu smirks at you and picks you up, youre a little disappointed at being away from his godly feet and he notices this instantly. \"Don't worry you'll go back to them pretty soon, now the real fun begins...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at his handsome face as he gives his first command...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natsu pulled off his vest and pulled down his pants, kicking off his sandals, leaving himself in just a pair of briefs. It cupped around his groin very nicely, showing off what he had to offer. Natsu put his hands on his hips and grinned. You looked up at him in awe. Someone, with him standing there nearly naked, that cocky look on his face...he looked like he was a giant among normal sized humans, even though he was a normal sized human. You couldn't help but feel humbled and intimidated. You weren't about to show it though. You put a look of unconcern on your face and shrugged. \"So, what are you going to make me do \"master\"?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu scooped you up and sat down on the bed, his feet stretched out in front of him. He dropped you on top of his big toe and leaned back, his arms behind his head. \"You're gonna get a good look at your master's body bug! I want you to explore every inch of me, become familiar with every bit of skin and every bulging muscle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a big grin on his face and an air about him that just oozed the \"aren't you lucky?\" vibe. You sighed. What choice did you have? You slid down the toe, landing on the foot. It splashed slightly, sweat covering his foot after running around. You held your nose and quickly ran along the leg, heading for the knee. The leg suddenly lifted up and you slid down it, hitting your head against his foot, sweat splashing up over your face and getting in your mouth. You gagged and got to your feet, wiping your mouth. Natsu laughed and said, \"Come on! Climb up my leg! Put those muscles you hardly use to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou muttered angrily, wishing you could just fry his skin with your fire magic, but you knew this would be utterly pointless since he was a mage of fire and you were so small you probably wouldn't even irritate him anyway. You gripped the skin and small hairs and began to climb up. It was exhausting. Natsu may have been an arrogant jerk, but he was at least right in his approximation of your muscular prowess. You weren't very strong physically. You preferred to focus on strengthening your magical skills. You finally managed to pull yourself up on top of the knees and rested for a minute. You looked ahead of you and saw that you'd at least have an easy slide down his thigh to his...bulge. You shuddered. It would be big if you were normal sized. Staring at it now, at your current height, it looked offensively obscene. You stood up and were about to slide down, when Natsu pushed his leg down flat on the bed. You tumbled to your butt again, hearing his mocking snickers as you now had a bit of a trek ahead of you. You growled in frustration and started walking across his hard thigh. It was rather impressive, how hard and strong the muscle felt. He wasn't famous for nothing. A boy with his reputation would have to be strong. You walked across the thigh and found the smooth skin suddenly interrupted by a band of white. You had reached the bulge. You carefully began to walk around it but Natsu's hand blocked you. \"Nope. Don't think so bug. Get over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge hand pushed you roughly over until you were face first, pressed against his monstrous bulge. You pushed hard against it, trying to escape, but the hand behind you refused to let you go back. You gave up and grabbed at the bulge as roughly as you could, climbing up on top of it. It took awhile to scale and you could feel the heat of it rising up at you, the musky smell of an active man reaching your nose. When you pulled yourself up on top of it you stopped and sat, resting. Natsu was watching you with a big grin on his face. You blushed red and looked away. \"What do you think? Pretty awesome right?\" His hand came down and gripped the bulge, his fingers on either side of you. He squeezed it and said, \"Oh yeah, a bug like you couldn't even dream of something this big~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour temper was rising with every passing second. This stupid man...he was so arrogant! You briefly thought about casting a constriction spell around his crotch but knew that that would just make you a stain under his foot or hand. You waited until he moved his hand, climbed down the bulge, and started crossing his abs. Each muscle was like a mini hill to you, forcing you to walk up, then down, then up, then down, passed each row. His navel was slightly to the right of you as you passed, looking fairly deep, especially at your size. You couldn't get lost in it, but you still didn't want to fall in. Your way was made slightly more difficult thanks to Natsu's constant breathing. Every once in awhile he'd giggle and that would make going even harder, your tiny body rocking around. This was more tiring than you'd imagined it would be. Just as you reached his chest Natsu suddenly sat up and said, \"Hold on! I've got a great idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plummeted downward, landing on top of his bulge again. \"WHAT?!?!\" you screamed up at him, your anger overflowing. Natsu didn't care. He started standing up, forcing you to cling to his bulge as he got to his feet. He put his hands on his hips and looked down at you, hanging for dear life onto his bulge. \"Okay, now start climbing again! If you can make it up to my shoulder without help, I'll give you a break for the rest of the day. If you can't though...well, we'll keep on spending our quality time together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed up at his towering upper body, topped off by that pink haired head, staring arrogantly down at you. Your arms were already trembling they were so tired but you had been given a chance to improve your situation and you weren't going to let it pass. You began to climb again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you climbed to the waistline of Natsu\u2019s briefs, you took a moment to gaze up the Dragon Slayer\u2019s torso and plan out your route. It was a good thing Natsu was fairly ripped; his muscles made for good \u201cledges\u201d. You would have to use the texture of his body to your advantage if you wanted to emerge victorious. Once you planned out your strategy, you immediately got to work climbing his abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy to grab onto each of the abdominal muscles at your size. Each one was like a giant stepping stone to you. As you maneuvered around the teen\u2019s bellybutton, Natsu started chuckling and caused his stomach to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha, man this is so cool! I\u2019m like a mountain to you, bug!\u201d Natsu exclaimed, demeaning you further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that.\u201d you reply. \u201cTry not to laugh; it\u2019s making this even harder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu\u2019s only reply was another laugh. Clearly he was trying to say that he\u2019ll laugh whenever he feels like it. You ignored his arrogance and continued climbing. You started to feel your arms get weak and stopped to relax them. Hurrying through this would only doom you; slow and steady was the key. This wasn\u2019t the first time you climbed this much; you had encountered several climbable obstacles during your journey. You may not have been as physically fit as the Fairy Tail mage, but you knew how to climb a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally reached Natsu\u2019s chest, you knew things were about to become a bit harder. The only objects you could grab onto were the small hairs that decorated the Salamander\u2019s body. They were so small that you hadn\u2019t even noticed them when you fought with him. Grabbing handfuls of body hair, you made your way up Natsu\u2019s left pectoral muscle. The giant fire mage tracked your progress with his eyes and was actually surprised you had made it this far. He didn\u2019t really care whether you win or lost, though. It was highly amusing watching you scale his body and what was one day without playing with you? You were his now; he could play with you everyday if he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you climbed up his chest, you were struck with several close calls. While Natsu was trying his best to stay still, he couldn\u2019t stop his breathing. Every time he inhaled, his chest would inflate a bit, and would then deflate when he exhaled. These simple actions on his part made the climb much more difficult for you. You never believed you\u2019d be climbing a living, breathing mountain during your magical career. If you got through this, it\u2019d make for an interesting story. Just as long as you left out the parts about messing up the spell and becoming the pet to a stupid meat head\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got lost and thought for a moment, since a sudden movement by Natsu had made you lose your grip. If that was bad enough, you were right next to the boy\u2019s pink nipple. You accidentally slammed into it and quickly grabbed onto it to stop yourself from falling. Natsu released a small moan above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh\u2026be careful, pet. Those things are sensitive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell maybe if you had stayed still\u2026\u201d you muttered under your breath as you clambered over the round nipple, making Natsu shudder. After this, you used the hairs on his chest and climb up the rest of the way. Once you reached the teen\u2019s collarbone, you lifted yourself over it and rolled onto the broad shoulder. You began panting loudly as you rubbed your sore arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice job, bug. I didn\u2019t think you could do it. A deal\u2019s a deal, I suppose.\u201d Natsu says as he plucks you off his shoulder and drops you onto the floor near his feet. You laid on your back and stared up at him, wondering what he was going to do now.</span></div></div>",

Watching the giant yawn made you realize just how tired you were, letting loose an equally huge yawn. Natsu stretched a little and said, \"Well I'm too tired to think right now, so I'm going to take a nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded absently and turned around, looking for a place to sleep. Natsu seemed to be thinking along the same lines, since his massive hand easily scooped you up and held you tightly. You were suddenly wide awake and glared up at him. \"What do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu yawned again and scratched his abs. \"Shut up bug boy. I'm not going to just let you sleep wherever. In case you didn't notice there's a huge hole in the wall. How do I know you won't try and escape as soon as I'm asleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for a moment then groaned out loud. How stupid of you! You were so tired you hadn't even thought of that! Even if this idiot had just let you sleep wherever you wouldn't have even thought of escaping. And you called him a stupid meat head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu was getting more and more tired by the minute and was starting to lose his patience. He couldn't put you on the desk since you could probably just climb down and escape. The same liability presented itself with his dresser. He scratched his head and pulled open the drawers on his dresser. No good...the entire back of the dresser was missing. You'd be able to squirm your way out if he stuck you in there. He shook you a little and said, \"Hey, you can still do magic now can't you? Even though you're tiny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Of course! Just because I'm small doesn't mean I've lost any of my magic prowess! I can still wield spells of a powerful and dangerous nature!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu put his other hand over you to drown you out after you said \"Of course!\" and muttered, \"So I'm going to have to tie you down then...hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked all around his desk and happened to find a piece of string. \"SCORE!\" he shouted, picking it up. He dropped you on the dresser and pushed you down with one finger. \"What...are you doing?\" you asked, feeling the string digging into your back, thick as a rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't answer you. He just wrapped the string several times around your body and pulled it tight, forcing your arms down to your sides. You were strapped down so tightly you couldn't even move your hands. This effectively stopped you using any magic. Only lesser magic could be simply spoken without gesture or drawing. This put you in a very bad position. The Salamander could put you anywhere now and you wouldn't be able to even think of escaping. He scratched his chin as he looked down at you, an evil smile on his face. \"You know...I COULD just leave you here on the dresser but what fun is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood ran cold at this question. What exactly was this mischievous teen thinking? You didn't want to know but you realized, since it involved you, you'd find out soon enough. Natsu laid down on his bed, holding you up by a bit of loose string, one arm behind his head. He was grinning widely at you and said, \"I want to keep you close little bug...real close! You can't be getting any ideas of escaping. Since you were so good with your climbing, I'm even going to give you a choice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved you down, down, down, to his feet. He pressed you up against the sole, your face peeking between two of his toes. \"You can sleep down next to my awesome feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed and tried to pull yourself away from the sweaty things. He had been on his feet all day and they were dirty and sweaty. It was a totally unappealing option. Surely nothing could be worse than that. You shouted out, \"I want the second option!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu blinked and said, \"But I haven't even told you what it is yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! Just let me sleep there you giant idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu grinned, the evil in it more noticeable and said, \"Alright. You asked for it runt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe roughly shoved you to your new sleeping arrangements. Your eyes widened in horror. No...he couldn't be serious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu laughed at your expression and said, \"That's right! Your bed is now going to be my...\"</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s\u2026disgusting!\u201d you yell as he stops laughing so he can respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInside? No, no, I didn\u2019t say that! You\u2019re going to be sleeping on top of it.\u201d Natsu says, patting you against his crotch. You still hate the idea, but now it doesn\u2019t seem TOO bad. At least his privates are trapped inside his boxers so you don\u2019t have to\u2026 \u201cJust kidding!! You\u2019re going inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu laughs again as he takes you off his boxers and slaps you against his hard abs. As you\u2019re pinned against his stomach, you can only watch as his other hand grips the rim of his briefs and peels it away from his skin. It\u2019s like some kind of monster slowly opening its mouth. The once dark inside is flooded with light to reveal exactly why Natsu seemed to proud of his junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was HUGE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! I can\u2019t see your face, but I bet you\u2019re gaping.\u201d Natsu guess correctly, causing you to quickly shut your mouth. However, you can\u2019t take your eyes off what can only be described as a monster. Natsu\u2019s manhood would be bigger than yours even at normal size! The thing isn\u2019t even completely hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I changed my mind! I\u2019ll sleep by your feet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo late, little bug.

You struggle desperately, but the fire mage\u2019s hand won\u2019t budge an inch.  You are eventually pushed into Natsu\u2019s briefs and roll right into his cock. Natsu shudders as this happens and his cock twitches a bit from the contact. Meanwhile, you\u2019re laying on your stomach and therefore have a face full of the pink fuzz surrounding Natsu\u2019s crotch. It\u2019s sweaty and the smell of musk is overpowering. \u201cHehe, you look comfy in there, bug. Nice and warm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll onto your side and yell, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this! You told me you\u2019d give me a break if I beat your challenge, didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am giving you a break, little guy. You\u2019re getting a nice rest\u2026in my crotch!\u201d Natsu bellows with laughter again. You glare at him hatefully and start kicking wildly. The string is preventing you from moving your arms, but you can still move your legs. Your weak kicks do nothing to the giant Natsu, but it still seems to irritate him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to sleep with you kicking around in there. Settle down or else you\u2019ll be sleeping in HERE.\u201d Natsu pats his abs a few times and you instantly quiet down. The last thing you see is Natsu\u2019s satisfied smirk before he releases his hold on the boxers and it snaps shut. You are engulfed in darkness, with only enough light to see the mammoth cock next to you. Before you can think of another way to convince Natsu to put you somewhere else, you start to hear obnoxious snoring and snorting coming from outside. The bastard is already asleep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay as well try to get some shut eye\u2026\u201d you say to yourself as you try to get comfortable. This is impossible, however, since you are lying in a field of pubic hair. The tiny pink hairs irritate your skin and the musky smell pollutes the air. It doesn\u2019t stop there as heat continues to build up in the boxers, causing you to sweat and further add to your discomfort. His feet seem like a cozy bed compared to this. \u201cWell, it can\u2019t get any worse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clearly have not read too many books, since whenever this is said, it ALWAYS gets worse. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wriggled and kicked around a little, Natsu not noticing your movements now that he was deep asleep, trying to make yourself more comfortable. It wasn't easy. After about twenty minutes of wriggling, kicking, and repositioning yourself you managed to make a small little indentation int he pubic hair, the curly pink hairs servicing as a bed underneath you. Your constant movement, along with the oil and sweat, had matted the hairs down enough that they weren't constantly pricking at you. It was still a hellish experience in a humid, smelly, disgusting environment but at least now you could get some sleep and hopefully not wake back up until he was taking you out of here. You just hoped that this didn't become your permanent bed. You shuddered at the very thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes hadn't been closed for more than a handful of minutes before you were awakened by a loud moaning sound. This wasn't the simple tired snores of the slumbering mage. This sound was more...intimate. Your eyes snapped open and you gazed at the massive dick next to you which, to your horror, was twitching lightly, veins slowly rising along the length of it. Suddenly, your prison contracted around you, your entire world shaking around, tossing you directly on top of the huge organ. Pressure surrounded you, forcing you against the soft, almost silky, flesh of the Dragon Slayer's dragon. It seems that Natsu had grabbed himself in his sleep and appeared to be playing with himself. You could hear an indistinct moaning come from the still slumbering mage. It almost sounded like a name, but you couldn't make it out. You had more pressing matters to worry about after all. You kicked your legs and tried to push against the cock and against the hand holding you down, but your feet constantly slid around on the sweaty skin and a single finger on that hand was far stronger than you. You could only lay, face pressed tightly against the musky flesh, and wait for it to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when you thought you couldn't take it another second, your prison was suddenly filled with fresh air, the heat disappearing in a flash, the smell...still there, but not as potent! You looked around and saw that Natsu had hardened to the point that his boxers couldn't contain him anymore and had the hardening tower of flesh had poked through the flap, popping the button keeping it closed in the process. Natsu giggled stupidly in his sleep and his had released you, moving just below you to grip his dick and start pumping. Every pump moved you closer to his head, than farther away, then back up close to his head, then far away again. This went on several times until you started feeling nauseous. On the fifteenth rise up towards the head Natsu got a little overzealous and jerked his hand too hard, sending you flying up into the air...only to land directly on his cock head. The flesh was pulled tight as a drum, a flushed purple color suffusing it. It was already slick with pre, your clothes getting covered in the stuff, your hair slicking back with it. A little even got into your mouth. You spit wildly, trying to rid yourself of that rank taste, and your giant captor just kept moaning and jerking himself, whatever dream he was having sending him to the moon. You slipped and slid around the pre, nearly falling off the head. The only thing that saved you, was the string getting a glob of pre dried over it...it took you a few seconds to realize just where you were and when you did, you wished you would have fallen off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was draped perfectly over Natsu's slit. You struggled and cursed your misfortune, trying to do whatever you could to dislodge yourself from the hellish flood that was soon to be unleashed. However, your struggled were all in vain. You could feel a rumbling from the organ beneath you, Natsu's face flushed, his moaning getting louder, the slit widening slightly...this was it...you braced yourself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SPLOOSH!* A volcanic eruption, focused directly on your back, launched you into the air, cum coating your entire body in an instant. Your tiny body flew through the air, landing smack on Natsu's abs. Before you could so much as breath, another sticky glob crashed over you, quickly drying you to the youthful giant's abs in seconds. A few more loads landed on or near you, Natsu sighing in satisfaction as he fell back into a deep sleep. You were now in an even worse situation. Natsu's scent clogged your nostrils, making you gag. Eventually you couldn't stand it anymore and lost consciousness. It was a mercy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you sleep, you dream of your encounter with Natsu in the alleyway. The cocky fire mage thought he was so big, so you were going to cut him down to size. This time it worked and you watched him dwindle down before your eyes until he was the size of an ant. The once cocky mage was confused about what had happened, until he sees you towering over him like some kind of god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s the big bad mage now?\u201d you ask him as you raise your foot over the tiny fire ant. The look of awe and hopelessness on his face is priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are awoken by the feeling of warm water striking against your back. You open your eyes, but see nothing but peach colored skin. You try to move, but you\u2019re stuck to the wall of muscle. Your memories of last night flood back into your head and you groan. You were still stuck to Natsu\u2019s abs by his dried cum, but now it seemed he was awake and standing up. Where was that water coming from though? You manage to look up, past the teen\u2019s muscled chest, to his youthful face. He\u2019s staring at the wall with his hands in his hair, scrubbing it with shampoo. You only now realize he\u2019s showering. That would explain the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my little pet is awake!\u201d you hear him say as he glances down at you. \u201cJust in time, now you don\u2019t have to sleep through your punishment!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Punishment?! What for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor disobeying me, bug. What else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t understand! How did I disobey you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? I told you your bed was my crotch, but when I woke up you were sound asleep on my stomach! I don\u2019t remember telling you could sleep there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dumbfounded and you\u2019re retaliation supported that. \u201cI had no control over that! You were the one who jerked off in your sleep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you shouted in anger, you felt yourself start to unstick from Natsu\u2019s stomach. The shower was washing away his dried cum, and with nothing to hold you in place you were about to slip free. As you started to freefall to the ground, Natsu\u2019s hand appeared under you and you safely fell into it. Tree sized fingers curled around you and brought you up to the giant\u2019s grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuses, excuses. I don\u2019t want to hear them.\u201d You watch Natsu grab something nearby and hold it in front of you. It was a piece of soap. \u201cNow, tell me bug, do you think this tiny thing is enough to clean my huge body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t reply, but glance at the piece of soap. It was just a tiny fragment that could fit between his fingers. It would most likely fun out before Natsu finished cleaning half himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI asked you a question.\u201d he whispered before giving you a quick squeeze. It was more than enough to get your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s not.\u201d you respond, wincing as his fist almost crushes you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect, and that\u2019s where your punishment comes in. You\u2019re going to be my replacement soap! Doesn\u2019t that sound like the best punishment ever?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen in shock. His soap? He was going to use you as his soap?! That means he was going to rub you against the whole extent of his body. That wasn\u2019t the job of a pet, it was the job of an inanimate object! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you can\u2019t! We had a deal! You said you\u2019d give me a break!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid our deals already expired, bug. We slept through the night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo\u2026it couldn\u2019t be. All that work you had done to climb him\u2026what was it for? To be put in his boxers and tossed around while he masturbated? That wasn\u2019t a break at all! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2026hold still.\u201d Natsu coos as he brings the small fragment of soap closer to you. You try to struggle, but your hands are bound to your side by the string. Here you were, once an experienced mage, now reduced to a bar of soap for a much stronger mage. Fate sure was cruel\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With absolutely no dignity, Natsu pressed you, face first, against the soap. You barely managed to hold your breath before you were slammed against the soap and rubbed up and down it, your clothes instantly becoming tacky with the stuff, your hair getting tangled, your eyes stinging. When he pulled you away you gasped for air and barely managed to get your eyes open before you were pressed, hard, against the giant mage's chest. His powerful hand guided you all over the slick, slippery skin, which was surprisingly soft for such a battle hardened warrior as the great Salamander. The only bump in your ride was when he passed you over his nipples, shivering slightly every time you passed over them. They were hard enough to jab you slightly, making your experience even more uncomfortable. He even held you in two fingers and slid you down between his pecs, sweat and grime attaching itself to your body as you passed into this dark crevice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout so much as a preamble, he moved you from chest, down to his abs. The water ran down and around every valley and crevice like a waterfall, making Natsu's body truly a majestic sight to behold. He passed you over every ab individually, making sure he scrubbed to get all the dirt off of his body. When all of his abs were sufficiently washed, he rubbed some more soap into your hair and pushed you headfirst into his belly button. You yelled out as you were shoved unceremoniously in there, your hair being used as a scrubbing brush to clean out his navel. Bits of dirt and lint got caught in your mouth and no amount of frantic spitting could dislodge the material from your mouth. When Natsu pulled you out, he snickered and said, \"You'd better not spit on my clean body bug boy or else I'm going to have to punish you worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly stopped spitting, not wanting to prolong this torture any longer than it needed to be. He ran you over his shoulders next, moaning a little as he did so. \"Man, I'm so sore! I think I'm going to make you my personal massage toy! Your hands may be tiny but I'm sure you could use some magic to make the job easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't say anything. There was no point in arguing since you'd just waste your breath and it was hard to speak anyway when your face was pressed against a bicep. After he was done with his arms, he lifted one of them up and sniffed his pit, wincing as he did so. \"Man, I really worked up a sweat yesterday! Ah well, in you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat actually splashed over you as you were slammed against the moist pit, the pink hairs there surrounding you in an oily, scratchy prison bringing back all the awful memories of your time last night. Luckily for you, he didn't make you spend much time in there...unfortunately, there was two of them, meaning you spent just as much time in an armpit as you did across his chest and abs. You were only halfway done with your punishment and already you were exhausted, dirty, and downtrodden. You just wanted this to be over so you could catch a rest. At this point you didn't even care WHERE you rested, as long as you could just lay still for awhile. That was unlikely to happen though. He scrubbed you good against his crotch, running you over his shaft, through his pubic hair, around the head, and over and under the balls. His inner thighs were next, followed by his bulging calves. He was pretty well built so it just made more body for you to clean. You thanked your lucky stars that he also only cursory passed you over his ass cheeks and down his crack. Finally, you were on your last job...the feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu sat down and grinned down at you, lifting up his foot and wiggling his toes. \"I wear sandals so my feet are always on display little guy. You're going to need to work extra hard to get them clean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and started running you over the top of his foot. This wasn't so bad, though the tops of his feet were dirtier than the average foot due to his choice in footwear. However, when he revealed his sole to you you cringed in disgust. It was spotted black and dirty, sandy grit and other bits of debris decorating it. You held your breath and closed your eyes as you pressed against the foot. Natsu scrubbed for a few minutes before noticing you were barely cleaning the foot. He frowned and lathered you up again, pushing you back against the foot. It went much better this time, your body able to scrub away the grime until only a gleaming pink foot was left. Natsu grinned and ran your body between his toes, getting the crud out from between the digits. He did a repeat performance for the other foot, actually putting you between his big and second toe and wiggling it, the thick digits moving your body around like a piece of lint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finished, he grabbed you, got to his feet, and ran you under the water, getting you as clean as he could with the soap he had left. \"There, better than nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped you on the sink and turned off the water, drying himself off with a towel before grabbing you and taking you back into his room. He dropped you on the dresser and got some clothes on, leaving his shirt off. He picked you back up and started pulling off your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What do you think you're doing?\" You shouted, batting at his fingers with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock it off. You're going to massage me and I don't want your dirty nasty clothes all over my clean body.\" Natsu said, tearing off your shirt and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou covered your boxer clad bulge and said, \"Okay! Okay! That's enough! My boxers aren't dirty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu shrugged and got onto his bed. \"Alright, my back is really sore, but so are my feet, so I'm giving you the choice of which you want to massage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weighed your options...the back was less likely to smell...but there was a lot more of it...which would be better?</span></div></div>",

The giant mage rolls over so he\u2019s lying on his stomach and carefully drops you on his back. You\u2019re standing in middle of his back between his two shoulder blades. You take a moment to look around and see how much you\u2019re going to be massaging. His back is like a field of skin, squeaky clean thanks to his shower. Like the rest of his body, it\u2019s also fairly broad and muscled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the hold up?! Hurry it up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going, I\u2019m going.\u201d you reply as you get on your hands and knees and dig your fingers into his soft skin. You don\u2019t know how he expects you to give him a decent back rub at your size, but it was his orders. Orders that you were clearly not fulfilling\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, bug! I can barely feel you. Put those tiny muscles of yours to good use. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing the best I can!\u201d you shout back, making him fidget in irritation. The quick movement of his back causes you to lose balance and fall face-fist into a layer of muscle. You yelp and cover your nose in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay back there?\u201d he asks, not being able to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine\u2026just fine.\u201d you reply sarcastically as you take your hands away from your bruised nose. It doesn\u2019t appear to be broken or bleeding, so you were lucky this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, since you seem to be so pathetically weak, why don\u2019t you try out some of your magic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy magic?\u201d you repeat. \u201cYou want to see some of my awesome magic? Fine by me!\u201d you exclaim as you get to your feet and curl your hands into fists. \u201cLimbs of Flame!\u201d You slam your fists together, creating a small spark. Suddenly, your arms burst into flames. It\u2019s a good thing Natsu removed your clothes, since you tend to burn off your shirt sleeves whenever you use this magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, that feels warm.\u201d Natsu burrows his face into his arms as he prepares for you to really start getting to work. Like before, you get on your knees and start rubbing around his muscles. This time your fingers are surrounded in flames, so Natsu gets a whole different experience. No only are you helping to loosen up his sore muscles, but you\u2019re also giving him a soothing tan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m using this to rub his back.\u201d you mutter under your breath as you move to another area of his back and start massaging there. \u201cThis magic is meant for burning people to a crisp, not giving them back massages!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, bug, my lower back feels kind of itchy. Think you can take care of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour lower back? I\u2019m still rubbing up here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, toss something down there to take care of it. Know any magic that can give me a good scratching?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026I might know something.\u201d you tell him. While one of your flaming hands massages his back, the other is raised and pointed down toward his power back. \u201cWind Blade!\u201d A blade of condensed air shoots out of your palm and travels down Natsu\u2019s back before striking him a few inches above his clothed butt. The pink haired Salamander moans in delight as the sharp blade of wind touches his sensitive skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat felt great! Keep doing that! You scratch my back and maybe I\u2019ll scratch yours.\u201d he jokes, chuckling a bit. While you use one hand to massage his upper back, you shoot wind blade after wind blade at his lower region to satisfy his itch. This goes on for about halt and hour and you\u2019re beginning to run low on magical energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatsu, am I almost done?\u201d you ask, your own body beginning to feel sore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost. Just do my shoulders and that\u2019ll be it for now.\u201d he says. You don\u2019t care if he\u2019s disappointed in your lack of stamina or not; you just want to get this over with. You walk up to the giant\u2019s shoulders , but before you can start rubbing, Natsu gives you a different order. \u201cYou know what would feel good? Try whacking my shoulder with those flaming fists of yours. Don\u2019t hold back either; give it your all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already have been giving it my all.\u201d you mutter again before rearing your fists back and pounding them into Natsu\u2019s shoulder. The fire mage moans loudly through his teeth as your fists connect with his flesh. Every strike you make warms and soothes the muscles in his shoulders, getting them all set for another hard working day. While you can\u2019t see it, Natsu\u2019s youthful face shows complete bliss. His new pet had so many uses, he couldn\u2019t wait to try out more of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten whole minutes of walking around Natsu\u2019s shoulders and punishing away, your magical energy finally runs out and the flames on your arms go out. You collapse on your hands and knees catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was that?\u201d you ask your captor, hoping he would treat you well as thanks for your hard work. </span></div></div>",

I'm talking to you! How was that?\" Still nothing. You got somewhat shakily to your feet and started jumping up and down in an effort to get him to notice you. How rude he was being! You had just wasted your entire reservoir of magical energy to make this lumbering oaf feel better and he still had the gall to ignore you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing nothing more than wearing yourself out even more, you slumped over and just laid still on Natsu's warm, toned back. It was actually quite relaxing. You had only been laying there for a few seconds when you heard a faint rumbling noise. Listening more closely you discovered that it was in fact Natsu making the noise. He was snoring! He must have fallen asleep after the massage you gave him! Well...that answered your question at least. Your massage was good enough to actually make the hyperactive giant fall asleep. You, of course, didn't mind in the slightest. This was like a gift from above. With Natsu asleep, you yourself could finally take a well deserved rest. You cracked your knuckles, rolled your neck, and leaned back, closing your eyes as you spread out between Natsu's shoulder blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed before your eyes sprang open again. What the hell were you doing? This was your chance! Natsu was asleep! You got to your feet and started running down his back, almost tripping and falling as you did so. How could you be so stupid? He was asleep, totally unaware, and you weren't tied up anymore! This truly WAS a gift from above! You could finally, finally make your escape! You stopped at his waistband and slid down his back, landing softly on his mattress. Breaking into a shambling run you made it to the edge of the bed, only to look down and see you were very high up. Normally you could cast a spell that would make you lighter or break your fall so you could land safely on the ground, but with your magical energy drained you had to come up with a more mundane way of getting down. Your eyes scanned the floor, looking for something, anything, to break your fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regretted thinking that anything would do when you saw the only feasible thing within your jumping range was a pair of used boxers, bunched up near the bed. You grimaced, remembering your time pressed close to Natsu's crotch. The last thing you wanted to do was go anywhere near anything that had been near to Natsu's manhood. But if it meant escaping this torture, you were willing to deal with it. Taking a deep breath, you ran and jumped. Your heart was pounding as you sailed through the air, aiming for the discarded underwear. If you made so much as an inch miscalculation in your jump you would become nothing more than a stain on the floor. Luckily, you were right on the money and landed on the thickest part of the boxers. Unfortunately, the smell was also strongest here. It was like jumping into a pool full of pungent man sweat and musk. You got tangled up in the cloth and it took a good five minutes to extract yourself. When you were freed from the boxers you sniffed your bare arm. Ugh....just like last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't waste any more time. Natsu was still asleep, his snores even louder than they had been before. Fortune was finally shining down on you for once, the hole that Natsu had created made it a simple task of leaving the room. With a light heart, you leaped over the small amount of wood left of the wall, and landed safely in the hallway of the apartment. Freedom! You ran as fast as you could down the hall, only to nearly fall down the stairs. Damn...too high. You were going to have to wait until your magic restored itself before you could try and make a full escape. In the meantime, you had to hide yourself. If Natsu woke up and found you gone...it wouldn't be pretty.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No matter how much you didn\u2019t want to be in this apartment any longer, your great escape had been put on temporary hold\u2026by some mere stairs. You were going to have to wait until your magical energy came back before you attempted getting downstairs. You couldn\u2019t just wait here in the hall, however. This was an apartment building after all; there were bound to be other people living here besides Natsu. The last thing you wanted was to be so close to freedom only to be stepped on by some random passerby. Thankfully, this building seemed to be pretty worn down. The only people that lived here were those with little money and desperate for a place to live. Thanks to this, many holes decorated the walls. You decided to hide away in the nearest one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran over to the small hole, which was just big enough to fit your small body through, and squeezed in. You wince as the rough wood brushes against your bare body. With a little effort, you pop through the crack in the wall and tumble in. It\u2019s dark, with the only light coming through the crack. You can\u2019t tell how big the \u201croom\u201d you are in is, but you can make out a few cobwebs. There didn\u2019t appear to be any spiders or creatures around, but you bet this apartment held it\u2019s fair share of creepy crawlers. Hoping nothing would show up, you sit against the wall and rest. You could use some sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026but now wasn\u2019t the time for sleep! You couldn\u2019t just sit back and do nothing while your energy replenishes. You had to come up with a plan for what to do once you\u2019ve escaped the apartment. Natsu wasn\u2019t the only giant. EVERYONE was huge to you now. Even the smallest child brought you great danger. Thankfully, you were confident that with your large pool of magic you would be able to avoid them. You simply had to stay isolated until you figured out a way to reverse the Reduction magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs times passed, you occasionally heard (and felt) booming foot steps outside. Each time you feared it was Natsu, awake and prowling the hall in search of you. You were reminded each time of his sleeping state due to his loud snoring, which could be heard throughout the apartment. You were glad no one woke him up to complain. They were probably all afraid he would spew a fireball in their faces if they disturbed his sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took an entire hour before your magical reserves were full again. During that time, Natsu showed no signs of waking. Now he just had to stay asleep until you reached the outside. After that, he could rage, shout, and spew fire all he wanted. You\u2019d just laugh from a safe distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making sure no one was in the hall, you made your way out of the crack and toward the edge of the stairs. You gazed down at the lower floor and smiled. You were finally going to be rid of the Salamander once and for all. You spread your arms out and watched the air around you begin to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWind Sphere.\u201d you whispered as the air around you formed a bubble. You lifted yourself a few inches off the ground before pushing your hands forward and directing the bubble into a decent. You slowly made your way downward, watching the stairs pass by step-by-step. Eventually you reached the bottom and released the magic. The bubble popped and you landed on your feet. The front door was right in front of you\u2026it was even open a crack! Freedom was so close! You broke out into a dash and ran for the door, getting closer and closer by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026and then the door swung open. You stopped dead in your tracks as you found your escape route blocked. There, standing in the doorway, was a young man around Natsu\u2019s age. He had black hair and wore a white coat. The giant teen started walking into the apartment, his boots creating loud booms. You were still a ways in front of him, so you quickly got out of his path and used an invisibility spell. As the giant got closer, you realized it was none other than Gray Fullbuster, another Fairy Tail mage. What was he doing at Natsu\u2019s apartment? Whatever it was, it most likely involved Natsu himself, which would require him to be awake. You had to get out of here before that happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gray approached the stairs, he suddenly came to a halt. You watched him just stand there for a moment before his eyes glanced down at the floor. He was looking right at you! His icy stare sent chills down your spine. How could this be? You were supposed to be invisible\u2026he shouldn\u2019t be able to see you! And yet, the ice mage\u2019s eyes were looking your way. Finally, he spoke\u2026</span></div></div>",

He seemed to notice he spooked you since he held up his hands and said, \"Hey, it's not like I'm going to crush you....whatever you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a human mage of course!\" you shouted, sick of being treated as some lowly creature beneath everyone's notice. You had tired of it while stuck with Natsu and you weren't about to let it start with this new guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human mage huh? Then why are you so small? I've never seen a human your size.\" Gray persisted, poking you gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoved the intruding fingers out of the way and said, \"I had a little trouble with a Reduction spell...I just haven't figured out how to reverse it just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray looked thoughtful for a moment and said, \"Hmm...a Reduction spell huh? I never knew something like that even existed. Sorry, but I can't help you out. I'm an Ice Mage after all. I specialize in that kind of magic. Sorry buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and said, \"Well, I figured that. I can reverse the spell on my own, I just need some time to think. And to do that I must get as far away from Natsu Dragneel as I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray looked surprised and said, \"What? Why? What's wrong with Natsu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed derisively and said, \"Well he's been keeping me as a pet, that's one thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray actually looked somewhat amused before saying, \"No, that's horrible...what else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered as you remembered and said, \"Nothing...never mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray laughed and snatched you up in his hand. This shocked you, as his tree trunk like fingers were wrapped tight, with no chance of loosening. He looked you over and said, \"You know, you've got a real attitude problem kid. I can see why Natsu wanted to keep you as a pet. You probably mouthed off against him or something am I right? Good way to get yourself killed. You're lucky you JUST ended up a pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked defiantly into Gray's eyes and said, \"How dare you! Put me down this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray shook his head and said, \"Nah, I got a better idea. I'm NOT going to put you down AND I'm going to take you back to Natsu. He's probably worried sick about his 'pet'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray chuckled at that and carried you upstairs, you struggling with all your might, to no avail. All your hard work, your careful planning...all gone up in smoke! Who could have guessed that Gray would be so willing to help Natsu? Well...considering their bond as rivals, almost being as close as brothers, maybe it wasn't so far fetched. Gray stopped as he saw the hold in Natsu's wall, shaking his head at the fire mage's antics. He opened the door and walked over to Natsu's bed, kicking the man out onto the floor. Natsu woke with a snort and gazed blearily up at Gray. \"What the hell do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting your lazy ass out of bed that's what. Haven't you noticed something missing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu just blinked stupidly for a few seconds before his eyes widened. He instantly turned and started ripping up the bed, looking for you, an angry expression on his face. Gray kicked him again and dangled your semi nude form in front of him. \"He's right here numbskull!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu glared at Gray before turning that intense gaze on you. \"So you thought you could escape huh? Fat chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe roughly grabbed you and shook you in his hand. \"You're going to get it now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray grinned and said, \"Going to punish him huh? Mind if I join in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu laughed and said, \"No way! The more the merrier! Let's really give this guy something to remember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great...now instead of one giant menace you had to deal with two. How wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...how should we punish him?\" Gray asked, kicking off his boots and shedding his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Natsu pondered for a moment before answering...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLet\u2019s torture him with our feet!\u201d  Natsu suggested as he grinned at you. Here you were\u2026once again in the fire mage\u2019s clutches. Your great escape had gone up in smoke and it would be no surprise if you were next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like fun.\u201d Gray replied as he folded his arms over his bare chest. You had to wonder why Gray had shed his jacket in the first place. Did he want to be shirtless like Natsu? Where these giants trying to make you seem even smaller and weak? It was working\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying anything else, Natsu opened his fist and let you plummet to the ground without care for your wellbeing. Thinking fast, you cast enough Wind Sphere around yourself which absorbs the impact of the fall. before you could even think of trying to escape in it, Natsu brought his bare foot down on the sphere and covered under his sole. He started applying pressure and attempted to make the air bubble burst. You tried using your magic to keep the sphere materialized, but Natsu was way too strong for it. He was barely trying, and yet the sphere soon collapsed under his foot. With nothing to hold it back, Natsu\u2019s foot came down upon you and whacked you into the ground. You gasped as Natsu knocked the wind (Get it? Wind?) out of you and pinned you against his wooden floor. He slowly started to press down on you and you whimpered as your body was compress against the floor. Was he planning on just crushing you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, this didn\u2019t seem to be Natsu\u2019s intention. The pressure let up before it could cause any fatal harm, but it didn\u2019t last. The pressure was slowly reapplied until your body was it its breaking point. Like before, he eased up and allowed you to continue breathing. He was toying with you and showing you he could stamp out a bug at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow does it feel, kid? You should never of tried to escape! You were lucky Gray found you, because if I did I might of just killed you on the spot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026I feel real lucky\u2026\u201d you muttered under your breath. Natsu moves his foot a bit so your head is poking out between his toes. You stare up at his towering form and watch him grin slyly before bringing his toes together and giving your head a good and painful squeeze. Since Natsu had taken a shower earlier (at your expense), his feet weren\u2019t as smelly or sweaty (because you had wiped it all away). It was still the bare foot of a teenager, however, so it wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable to be under. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Natsu, let me have a shot!\u201d Gray says, getting bored of just watching his friend torture you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock yourself out, but try not to knock him out too soon!\u201d Natsu jokes before he takes his foot off you. You struggle to your feet, but as soon as you\u2019re standing Natsu brings his big toe over to you and flicks you in the chest. It feels like he just punched you in the chest and your body is sent flying backwards\u2026right into Gray\u2019s foot. You look up and tremble under the ice mage\u2019s glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou realize you deserve this, right?\u201d Gray asks as he places his hands on his hips. \u201cA kid like you needs to learn when to shut up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill yous stop calling me kid!\u201d you yell, sick of them calling you that. \u201cI\u2019m the same age as you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026seriously?\u201d Gray cocks his head in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026yeah\u2026why is that so surprising?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just\u2026you don\u2019t LOOK eighteen. I mean, just look at us.\u201d Gray casually raises his arm outward and flexes his bicep. You stare at the bulging muscle for a moment before you turn to Natsu. The pink haired Dragon Slayer grins proudly before he flexes both his arms. Several veins pop to the surface as Natsu growls and smoke starts to rise from his nostrils. He\u2019s defiantly trying too hard\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze travels down to your own body and you realize the two Fairy Tail members are in a completely different league than you. You have SOME muscle, but it doesn\u2019t even compare. Your abs are only slightly visible and your arms look like they could be snapped in two during an arm wrestling competition with either of them. The only impressive thing is your legs, but that\u2019s only because you spent a lot of time on your feet. The life of a traveling mage was full of walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re eighteen!\u201d Natsu says as he continues to flex. \u201cI thought you were, like, thirteen this entire time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Shut up!\u201d you scream at him. \u201cI\u2019m a grown adult!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go again with that attitude of yours.\u201d you hear Gray say before you look up at him again and see his bare foot coming down on you. You don\u2019t have time to scream before it hits you in the back and forces you face first into the floor. Unlike Natsu, Gray\u2019s foot reeked to high heaven and was covered in sweat. \u201cIf I could, I wish I could do this to all the wannabe mages who think they\u2019re experts at magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray begins to smother you under his foot, greasing you up with his sweat and rolling you around like a ball. Natsu has finally stopped flexing and is watching Gray torture his pet. He was a natural at this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Gray, why did you come over here? I doubt it was so you could play with my new pet.\u201d Natsu asks, not taking his eyes off his fellow mage\u2019s foot. Gray doesn\u2019t stop smothering you as he answers\u2026</span></div></div>",

Gray Fullbuster and Natsu Dragneel were boyfriends? Impossible! You'd heard about them, always fighting, always trying to outdo each other...how could two men like that be going out? Then again...they did have a close, brotherly bond. Maybe that bond went deeper than most people thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure on you was suddenly increased as Gray leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Natsu, pulling him in for a kiss. The mages of fire and ice met, lips to lips, and kissed, Gray's tongue already darting out to separate the Salamander's lips, to enter his mouth. Natsu suddenly pushed against Gray's chest, forcing him back a few steps. He irritably rubbed his mouth and said, \"Idiot! I told you not to do that in front of people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray glared at him and shouted, \"What people? You consider your bug pet a person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu blinked a few times then grinned idiotically. \"Oh yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another thought he ran forward and tackled Gray, forcing him to the ground as he kissed him deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Gray had been knocked back by Natsu's push, you had found yourself free and in the clear! You had gotten up and started running when Natsu tackled Gray, forcing him to the ground, his foot rising up and smacking you hard in the back. With a yelp you went flying through the air, barely having time to put up a Wind Sphere to avoid being turned into paste on the wall, landing softly on Natsu's mattress. You got to your feet and dusted yourself off, looking over at the boys. Natsu had managed to hold Gray down and was making out with him furiously. What an idiot! He just left you totally unattended...again! You ran to the edge of the bed and were about to jump and float down to the ground, when you caught sight of Gray and Natsu again. You blushed as you watched them. How ridiculous! Acting like savage animals when you were still in the room! But then again, you weren't a human in their eyes. Just another pet, a toy even. Even though you despised both of these teens for thinking this way about you...you couldn't help but find their movements...their intimacy...quite appealing to watch, their muscular bodies moving in unison. Natsu seemed to be the one on top, moving with a furious strength that almost made you shudder. But Gray wasn't a passive lover either. He was keeping up and, as you watched, he flipped Natsu over and took over. It seemed like a constant battle for the top. So, they were rivals even when it came to making out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head and called up the Wind Sphere again. You floated slowly down to the ground, landing softly. Unfortunately, Natsu and Gray were rolling around, blocking both the door and the hole in the wall. You were too nervous to even attempt getting close to them. You didn't want to be crushed under their bodies. But what could you do?</span></div></div>",

They were in the middle of another passionate kiss with Gray laying on top of Natsu. They broke the kiss and just stared at each other with lustful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna do it on the floor?\u201d Gray asks, a sexy grin on his face. Natsu returned the grin with one of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good\u2026but I think the bed would be more comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026you have a point.\u201d Gray said before he picked himself up off of the fire mage. After helping his boyfriend to his feet, the two men made their way over to the bed. As you watched the two pairs of bare feet stomp against the floor, you knew that if you didn\u2019t find a place to hide now it would be too late. Too late decided to come first as both the Fairy Tail mages spotted you on the floor. Before you could notice they had spotted you, Gray reached down and plucked you off the floor. He showed you to Natsu and grinned evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, how about we let this guy join in on the fun?\u201d Gray suggested, much to Natsu\u2019s confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are we gonna do that? Are we going to have a threesome with a bug?\u201d Natsu joked, chuckling a bit. Gray just rolled his eyes and told Natsu to watch. The ice-make mage sat down on Natsu\u2019s bed and placed you next to him. Instead of running like you should have, you just watched as the half naked giant took off his belt and threw it aside. With that gone, he quickly undid the buttons on his jeans and opened the fly to reveal his black boxers. With a sigh of relief, Gray put his hand into the front of his boxers and pulled out his throbbing dick. Like his lover, Gray was gifted\u2026very gifted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh\u2026I\u2019ve been keeping this guy under control for far too long\u2026\u201d Gray muttered as he gently stroked his penis. You were afraid of what the giant had planned and started backing away, but Gray easily snatched you up without even looking at you. You were dropped onto his meat without any warning and you desperately hugged it to avoid sliding off. As you clung to the pulsing organ, you had a pretty good idea about what was going to happen next. Your fears turned out to be true as Gray licked his lips and curled his fingers around his shaft. You felt the sweaty palm of his hand against your back as it crushed you into his dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray grinned at the feeling of you pressed up against his member and started to slowly stroke himself. He felt you get dragged up and down his length with no hope of escaping. You tried to struggle, but you should know by now that all struggles were fruitless. Gray\u2019s hand was just too powerful for you to fight against. After just tiring yourself out, you decided to just close your eyes and wait for this horror to end. You flashbacked to the previous night when Natsu had unknowingly jacked off with you. You had never wanted to experience that again\u2026and yet here you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmh\u2026Natsu, his tiny body feels so good against my dick.\u201d Gray murmured as he focused on you. You felt like a small pebble that had gotten between his hand and dick\u2026except alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better not be falling for my pet!\u201d Natsu angrily exclaimed as he put his hands on his hips and scowled at Gray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot.\u201d Gray spat back. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give you up for a lousy bug like this. He makes a good toy, but that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you were pressed up against Gray\u2019s cock flesh, the sound of his sweaty hand rubbing against his member filling your ears, you could still make out Gray\u2019s words. You despised the stripping mage, but knew he was right about one thing. At this size, no one would ever love you like these two love each other. You had never been interested in anyone, but that\u2019s only because you were waiting for that special someone. Now that special someone would never come\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to mock your sad revelation, Gray started to squeeze his cock and pump it. You whimpered as his strong fist threatened to turn you into paste against his dick. Gray either didn\u2019t care about your suffering or didn\u2019t notice it, because he just closed his eyes and moaned. His dick had become very sweaty under his palm and you were being splashed with a combination of hand sweat and cock sweat. The salty taste got into your mouth, but with your face pushed against his erection you couldn\u2019t spit it back out. You silently wished he would hurry up and climax before he squeezed too hard and squished you. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Gray continued moaning and rubbing his thick cock Natsu was looking on with a frown. He looked incredibly impatient. He was also getting really annoyed. Why was Gray paying so much attention to some insignificant bug when a powerful, built man like him was just sitting around watching? He snorted out a stream of steam and said, \"Alright! That's it! I'm going in!\" Without another word Natsu knocked Gray's hand aside. Gray glared down at him, his face flushed. \"W-What are you doing you idiot? I'm almost there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu grinned and replied, \"Then let me help you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth and took Gray's whole shaft inside...along with you! Before you knew what was happening you were inside a humid, moist cave, air crashing down over top of you as Natsu's breathing increased, his lips closing easily around Gray's length. He moved slowly, his tongue licking and wrapping around the soft, velvety flesh of the dick, coating you and it in a thick film of saliva. It was getting hard to breath...after nearly getting squished, tossed into an almost airless environment, and now almost drowning in saliva...you were beginning to slip into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God...Natsu...aaaaah...that feels so....nnnngh.....GOOD!\" Gray shouted the last word, holding Natsu's head in place as his hips began to buck into the fire mage's mouth. Natsu grinned around his mouthful, loving how easily he could bring the normally icy mage to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the tongue lashing stopped...only for the sucking to begin! You felt yourself come unstuck from the shaft, tumbled upward toward the head and nearly get sucked over it. With desperation you cling to the head, holding your body close to it. This wasn't happening! You couldn't let it all end this way! If your grip weakened even slightly you would end up getting sucked down into Natsu's bottomless belly. There was no way you could let that happen! Using a spell, you quickly adhered yourself to the tight purple flesh. Now you just had to hold out until Gray climaxed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, Gray and Natsu treated sex like they treated everything else...as a battle! Natsu was hell bent on making Gray climax as soon as possible while Gray refused to shoot unless Natsu worked his ass off for it. After fifteen solid minutes of sucking, Natsu's mouth working like a bellows while Gray held back, his body growing slick with sweat, Gray still hadn't climaxed. Natsu wasn't giving up though! He increased the heat of his mouth, making a soothing warmth pass through the cock. After awhile, he turned the heat way down, causing the dick to become more icy. He continued this process, making it hot, then cold....hot then cold...hot then cold...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were running low on magic power. There wasn't much left in your reserves...if this didn't end soon you'd be done for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Natsu...that's cheating!\" Gray muttered, his body twisting around on the sheets weakly. He was getting so close...Natsu merely smirked and kept sucking, dragging his boyfriend closer to him to deep throat more of his organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as you felt yourself get pushed practically down Natsu's throat. Looking down you could see the dark shaft of the Salamander's esophagus, leading down to your ultimate demise! No...not yet...you were so close!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it...it was coming...the moment of truth!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could feel your magic power getting dangerously low. You were running on adrenaline, scarping the tiniest bits of magical power from your reserves to keep the spell intact. This was going on longer than you anticipated\u2026why did they have to be so competitive?! Then, over fifteen minutes after the blowjob had started, it happened\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooooh!!\u201d Gray moaned long and loud. He had reached his limits and couldn\u2019t keep the valves closed any longer. With a violent twitch his cock erupted into Natsu\u2019s throat. Burst after burst of warm cum poured out of Gray\u2019s member. Instead of gagging, Natsu moaned himself and happily gulped down his lover\u2019s load. You clung to Gray\u2019s cock head, a weak smile on your face. It was finally over\u2026you had survived\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t over. Gray had held back his climax for so long that his release lasted much longer than the few seconds it should of. You held on desperately as the purple head twitched under you. Then your magical reserves hit rock bottom and all your efforts became wasted. The spell that was keeping you alive dissipated and you slipped off the teen\u2019s cock. Time seemed to slow down as you fell into the path of the massive organ. Your life flashed before your eyes and a look of disbelief was frozen on your face. As you passed in front of Gray\u2019s cock, a cum shot hit you dead on and sent you down Natsu\u2019s esophagus. This also happened to be the last one, as Gray removed his cock from Natsu\u2019s mouth shortly afterwards. As the ice mage collapsed on the bed, Natsu tilted his head back and swallowed the last of the spunk (and, unbeknownst to him, you).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, that was great\u2026\u201d Gray said as he panted heavily. His bare torso was drenched in sweat and his chest was heaving up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, tasted good too!\u201d Natsu replied as he licked his lips. \u201cThanks for breakfast!\u201d The Dragon Slayer grinned toothily and gave his abs a few pats. Gray just rolled his eyes at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you swallowed it all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what else was I going to do? It was coming out so damn fast!\u201d Natsu said as he laid himself down on top of Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you could of\u2026\u201d the icy mage began, but was interrupted when the fierily mage locked lips with him. The two kissed passionately again, their hands wrapping around each other and touching each other\u2019s naked torsos. They rolled around on the bed, once again fighting for who would be on top. Unlike last time, the battle only lasted a few seconds before Natsu had Gray easily pinned under him. The ice mage tried to sit up, but the fire mage simply pushed against his chest and kept him lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t even try it, Gray. You\u2019re all worn out after that blowjob and I\u2019m still full of energy! Just lay back and let me do all the work.\u201d Natsu commanded as he started fumbling with his pants. Gray snorted, but knew his boyfriend was right. He was too weak to declare dominance over Natsu\u2026this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, behind Natsu\u2019s six-pack, you had just been squeezed into Natsu\u2019s stomach. You pulled yourself out of Gray\u2019s sticky cum and looked around. The stomach was a lot smaller than you thought Natsu\u2019s bottomless gut would be. You crawled over to one of the organic walls and started banging on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me out! Let me out of here!\u201d you screamed as you bashed against Natsu\u2019s inner walls. The giant fire mage didn\u2019t seem to notice the movement, probably because his stomach was as strong on the inside as it was on the outside. In fact, the titanic mage didn\u2019t even seem to remember you! His complete focus was on the hot male beneath him. Natsu stroked his cock with one hand while he used the other to stretch Gray\u2019s entrance. Once he thought it had been stretched enough with three fingers, Natsu replaced the fingers with the tip of his erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go!\u201d Natsu exclaimed before thrusting into Gray. The ice mage gritted his teeth and groaned in pain as he was penetrated. Natsu pulled back his cock before slamming into Gray again. He laid down on Gray and kissed him, their muscular bodies grinding together. The thrusting motions Natsu was making was tossing around the contents of his stomach. You were flung around the hot cauldron, smashing into the walls like you were trapped in some kind of container that someone was shaking. You screamed, but neither of the giants could hear you. All they could hear was the sound of their own breathing and the bed thumbing against the wall. Was this it? After everything you had gone through; being used as soap, being tortured by his feet, climbing his mountainous body, and getting up close and personal with his cock\u2026this was your reward? To be digested by him and made a part of his body? </span></div></div>",

Natsu\u2019s stomach contracted itself around you and started squeezing you into submission. The gut of the fire mage had no mercy for succulent meat like yourself. You could barely move as your body was tenderized and bathed in stomach acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Natsu broke the kiss with Gray and moaned as he thrust against his lover\u2019s sweet spot. Gray, in his disorganized state, glanced down at Natsu\u2019s bare stomach. The teen\u2019s abs were flexing and clenching as he worked. Gray wasn\u2019t even thinking about you; imaging Natsu\u2019s stomach crushing you with its powerful contractions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you looking?\u201d Natsu asked as he grabbed Gray\u2019s chin and forced the black-haired mage into another kiss. Gray moaned and wrapped his arms around Natsu\u2019s muscular back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had barely been in Natsu\u2019s gut for ten minutes and already your naked skin was beat red. Natsu\u2019s stomach acids were quickly working on your skin, burning it and making you whine in pain. You didn\u2019t have any magical energy left and your life energy was starting to run out. There was no way a normal human could digest something like you so quickly. Natsu was no normal human, however. His stomach was where his fire came from. It was hot like a volcano and the enzymes were like lava. Tears dripped from your eyes as you realized this was the end. Your life was about to be cut short in the most humiliating of ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no\u2026\u201d you mutter as the stomach squeezes you powerfully; almost enough to break bones. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026learn magic\u2026for this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour last regret was your last thought; you fell into unconsciousness and knew no more. Natsu\u2019s stomach continued its relentless assault; slowly breaking you down and turning you into substance for the Salamander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh\u2026Gray!\u201d Natsu moaned as he finally came into his boyfriend. The ice mage reacted similarly and came at the same time, spraying his seed over both their torsos. Natsu panted for a bit above Gray before pulling out of him and collapsing on the bed next to him. The rosy haired Dragon Slayer wrapped his arms around Gray and cuddled. The two of them laid there in silence\u2026save for the gurgling Natsu\u2019s stomach was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNatsu, shut your stomach up.\u201d Gray said as he glanced down at his lover\u2019s abdominals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow? It\u2019s not like I can just te-.\u201d The last part of Natsu\u2019s sentence was replaced with a massive belch. Gray\u2019s eyes widened as Natsu burped right in his face; the belch carrying enough force to blow his hair back. When it was over Natsu smacked his lips and gave his gut a few pats. \u201cWhoa\u2026wonder what brought that on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe icy mage gave Natsu an annoyed look before turning his back to the other male. \u201cWay to ruin the mood, idiot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Hey, I can\u2019t help it! Everyone burps!\u201d Natsu brought Gray closer and nuzzled his face into the back of his neck. As the Fairy tail mage tried to comfort his pissed off lover, neither seemed to remember the little bug they had been playing with. That\u2026or they knew exactly what had happened to you, but paid it no mind. Who would give the food that entered Natsu\u2019s belly much thought anyway?</span></div></div>",

Their dicks throbbing with anticipation for release.<br>\r\nOutline of several bodies could be seen outside their giant balls.

Their bodies stuck to the shaft by the saliva. They could feel the warmth and the periodic throbbing of each member. Then both giants inserted their respective cocks into their mouth. Sucking it and licking off the people who were stuck onto it.

They were doomed to suffocate under Gray's junk and nobody could save them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Natsu\"<br>\r\n\"Gray that hurt, you don't just sit on people.\"<br>\r\n\"You were having fun without me and besides I thought of something fun we could do.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, tell me then.\"<br>\r\n\"Suck me Natsu. Also shove people inside of me with your tongue. It'll be great for the both of us. I'll do you next.<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, let me just get some bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gray shifted forward a bit to Natsu's face, the people underneath his sack were flattened by the repeated smacking of Gray's sack and Natsu's hard chest. Natsu proceeded to grab another crowed and he dropped them on the length of Gray's erect cock. Gray's cock was dripping pre with anticipation of what was about to happen. Gray's cockhead was right in front of Natsu's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay lets get this started\" Natsu yelled.<br>\r\nNatsu grabbed about 4 people from Gray's dick and stuck them to the tip of his tongue. He then poked his tongue onto Gray's slit and inserted all of them at once. Gray began to shift around on Natsu chest and then thought of an idea. Gray looked around and grabbed hundreds of innocent people.<br>\r\n\"Just a sec Natsu\"<br>\r\nGray then lifted his right ass cheek up and put all of the people underneath him. They were placed on Natsu's ab and then were crushed by Gray's huge ass cheek. Some were lucky enough to be spared but they were trapped between the warm confines of Gray's sweaty ass cheeks. Some were even sucked up his asswhole by all the movement Gray was making from his pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat uh su, more. MORE!!\"<br>\r\nNatsu then grabbed more people and put them all around the tip of Gray's dick. Natsu then inserted Gray's dick into his mouth and started slapping his tongue. As Gray was enjoying his pleasure he proceeded to grab people to put under Natsu ass.<br>\r\n\"Natsu lift your ass\"<br>\r\nNatsu then lifted his ass and Gray shoved a bunch of people below it. Natsu then let his ass drop. HIs ass either crushed or sucked up everyone underneath him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu continued sucking off Gray and Gray was reaching his limit. He started to shake his body, smearing the corpses underneath his ass. His cock stayed in Natsu's mouth. Natsu continued licking and sucking until it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsu. I'm going to give you some real breakfast.\"<br>\r\nGray then exploded. A white geyser flooded Natsu's mouth going down into his stomach. Natsu loved the taste of his boyfriend cum and savours every drop that came in. Gray then got of Natsu and sat on a stadium full of people. He was panting and dripping sweat, making it worse for the people underneath him. Gray looked down t the worthless nats and grabbed his dick. He then flipped over and sweared his cock all over the place. His hungry organ ate dozens of people and everything else in the stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu then got stood up. His feet crushing many people. He then walked over to Gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think instead of doing me we should just let our cocks have a feed.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Natsu and Gray then walked to a new city that wasn't aware of them. Along the way they crushed farms along with the people and animals in them. <br>\r\n\"Hey Gray, do you think this is better than being in the guild.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, everyone in the guild is nothing now to us. We could do anything with them and nobody could stop us. Not even the master could harm and dicks man. I mean we could swallow anything with them. The guild members would bow down to us.<br>\r\n\"You think\" Natsu said as he was picking his teeth with a farmer he picked off the ground.<br>\r\n\"I know\"<br>\r\n\"SO where are we going Gray\"<br>\r\n\"I think we should test how theory and go to the guild.\"<br>\r\n\"I couldn't agree more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Magnolia<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the citizens were going about their normal days as if they ever would, not aware of what was about to happen. Suddenly large earthquakes started to happen. One thump after the other the ground shook and it seemed like it would never stop. After about two minutes of this Natsu and Gray appeared over the mountains.<br>\r\n\"We're back Magnolia.\"<br>\r\nNatsu and Gray climbed over the mountain. Their muscular bodies easily scaling it. They were carrying their underwear but through it aside for later use. The whole town couldn't help but stare at their swinging cocks that slapped their muscular thighs with each step. Natsu and Gray looked down at everyone in Magnolia with an evil grin.<br>\r\n\"We'll be back for you guys soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu and Gray then walked over to fairy tail. Natsu positioned Himself in front of it while Gray did it from behind. <br>\r\n\"Hey guys we're back and we brought you guys a present. Said Natsu.<br>\r\nNatsu then spat on the guild creating a big hole in the roof. Everyone in the guild looked up to see the giant muscular forms of their hot guild mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in gods blazes, how are you two so big\" said Makarov.<br>\r\nNeither Natsu or Gray answered. They just lowered their bodies and positioned themselves so their huge dicks were facing the guild. <br>\r\n\"Are you ready Gray\"<br>\r\n\"You bet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu and Gray started to pound the guild with the erect dicks. They would go in and out over and over again. Both the giants were sweating a lot as they showered everything beneath them. As they were fucking the guild, many guild members were crushed or swallowed by their dicks. Erza was repeatedly crushed by Natsu's cock.<br>\r\n\"Take that Erza\"<br>\r\nNatsu's dick then swallowed her remains along with some other guild mates. Juvia on the other hand yelled out something to gray which made hime stop.<br>\r\n\"Gray my dear, I going to turn into water and go inside your privates my love.<br>\r\nJuvia then turned into water and flew into Gray's cock in. The feeling of the running liquid making Gray nearly explode with cum. In her water form she landed in his ball sac and was very shocked. She was no longer water. She was Gray's cum. Juvia fainted upon realising this as she laid in a pool of cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about twenty minutes of the repeated smashing of the guild both giants were ready to burst. They both stood up and aimed their cocks at the guild and fired. Their hot seed evaporating all the debree and remains of their former friends. Everything was melting. The town just watched in horror as they all knew that they were about to come to an end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both were on the ground panting but lucky Natsu had an unlucky Gajeel on the tip of his cock.<br>\r\n\"Salamander, how could you\" the bloodied Gajeel said<br>\r\nNatsu just smiled at Natsu wuth his cheeky grin<br>\r\n\"Cause it's fun bug.\"<br>\r\nNatsu then inserted Gajeel into his cock and he was never seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Natsu, go get your underwear. I thought of a game we could play.<br>\r\n\"What would that be\"</span></div></div>",

Rules are you can put them in any part of your underwear and if they get sucked in side of you well good for you. We can go anywhere in the world but we have to meet up here in 4 hours, okay Natsu. And I would recommend letting them go inside your because I sure am going to be putting them in me.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I will\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu and Gray then stomped over to where they threw their underwear and put them on.<br>\r\n\"Let the games begin\" Gray yelled<br>\r\nGray walked to the right and Natsu walked to the left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu was on the left side of Magnolia and he saw if first set of treats. He smiled down at the crowd with a cheeky grin and lowered his hand.<br>\r\nHe wrapped his thick fingers around the crowd and grabbed them. He brought them up to his face and spat on them.<br>\r\n\"Gotta make you bugs stick so you don't take up much room.\"<br>\r\nNatsu then lowered the crowd to his crotch where they could smell the manly musk and old cum from it. <br>\r\nHe pulled the waistband of his briefs and put other hand in his underwear.<br>\r\n\"In ya go\"<br>\r\nHe placed them underneath his gooch. He took his hand out and continued to look for more treats. Inside his undies the first crowd was suffering from the manly stench coming from natsu. Not only did it smell, it was extremely hot under his gooch and his movement made it even more worse. On the outside natsu had another crowd in his hand to put in his briefs but this time he open the back of his undies.<br>\r\n\"Hope you bugs like the smell in there.\"<br>\r\nNatsu shoved his hand in between his cheeks and put the crowd there. They were being crushed by his two meaty boulders of muscle that were Natsu's ass cheeks. Some of them were sucked into Natsu asswhole and were going to be in there for a while.<br>\r\n\"Oi bugs, catch this.\"<br>\r\nAfter Natsu said that he blasted one of his most powerful and gassiest farts he has ever done. This sent the people in his asswhole flying into his cheeks with the rest. The smell was the worst thing the people have ever experienced. It was hot, wet and it stank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of Magnolia Gray was getting his fair share of treats to package. Gray loved the thought of his scrotum dominating thousands of people. This thought made Gray hard and gave him more motivation to play this game. Gray grabbed his first crowd and shoved them right underneath his balls. He let his balls drop on them and sag all other them. He enjoyed the feeling of them wriggly underneath the weight of his privates. This made Gray leak pre. Gray thought of something but to execute his plan he would need more people. Gray sped up and grabbed crowds upon crowds to shove in his undies. He shoved them in the front all at once. On the outside you could see a huge bulge with bumps and human shapes in the fabric. Some people were even falling out due to how little space there was. They ended up falling to their deaths. In his undies there was constant movement and wriggling that caused Gray great pleasure.<br>\r\n\"Keep it up bugs, you feel so could in their.\"<br>\r\n\"Gray then squeezed their prison causing some of them to be crushed. A lot of the people were sucked into Grays dick which caused Gray to finally cum.<br>\r\n\"Ohh ohh It is CUMS\" <br>\r\nGray erupted in his undies. His seed went all over the people in his undies and some of them started to melt due to the semen's molten form.<br>\r\n\"That will happen a fair bit today bugs, get used to it. Gray then grabbed some people out of his undies and put them to his face.<br>\r\n\"You know I love sweaty cum bugs for a snatch. And look, I have some right here for me.\"<br>\r\nGray then opened his mouth and threw the people inside. He swished them around, keeping them in their for a long time before swallowing them.<br>\r\n\"Today is going to be great.\"<br>\r\nGray squatted over a crowd a sucked them into his ass. All of this domination was getting him hard again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what Natsu is doing?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There tiny bodies popping under the giant's mighty ass. Natsu, just like Gray had hundreds of people in his underwear that made it pulsate. People were falling out of the sides and human shape bumps were visible from the outside. Natsu was holding a large crowd in his hand but he planned to do something else with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What to do with you bugs. I don't want to put you guys in my undies yet or even at all. Should I eat you or crush you. Oh I thought of an idea.\"<br>\r\nNatsu was extremely sweaty as the day was hot and filled with movement. This made him come up with this idea. The crowd was in Natsu's right hand and they were very scared. Natsu lifted his left arm and brought the crowd up to his sweaty pit.<br>\r\n\"Ah, you guys are gonna feel so good under here.\"<br>\r\nNatsu didn't shove them in at first. He let his pit hairs tickled the crowd. He then put the crowd in his pit and closed his arm.<br>\r\n\"Lick my pit while your in there or I'll crush you right there.\"<br>\r\nIn his pit it was wet and hot. It smelled of manly sweat. The crowd started to lick Natsu's huge pit by obviously didn't like it. It was foul and Natsu knew this. Natsu then shoved a crowd into his other pit and repeated what he said to the previous crowd. The crowds stuck to his pits like glue and were unable to be set free unless Natsu pulled them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah fuck my ass feels empty. I think it need some worshipping.\"<br>\r\nNatsu leaned forward and grabbed and bunch of crowds, scurrying on the ground. He then peeled the back of his undies and shoved the people right between his cheeks. Most of the crowd were at the base of Natsu's asswhole while a lot of them stayed in his cheeks.<br>\r\n\"Alright bugs, in the cheeks and asswhole. Start massaging and licking or I will crush you with a shit.\"<br>\r\nEveryone in Natsu were scared as hell and obeyed his command. They started to rub and lick him and didn't stop. Natsu rewared everyone in his ass with a set of gassy farts.<br>\r\n\"There is your reward bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu then got up to look for more people to shove in his briefs. He spotted a huge crowd running at the edge of Magnolia. He stomped over towards them and smashed his foot in front of them.<br>\r\n\"Now where do you think you guys are running.\"<br>\r\nAll the people fell over due to the quake Natsu created.<br>\r\nNatsu sat down and wrapped is legs around the crowd so they could not escape.<br>\r\n\"You's are going in my cave bugs, have fun.\"<br>\r\nNatsu then picked up handfuls of people one after the other and shoved them inside the front of his underwear. Crowds upon crowds were shoved in there until there was nothing left on the ground. It was really cramped in there even for natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to get rid of some of you bugs.\"<br>\r\nNatsu put his hand in his briefs and grabbed his dick. He then vacuumed hundreds of innocent people with his dick. That all travelled through his shaft. The smell of old cum and pissed filling their noses. It was just like a slide that ended in a splash. Person after person landed in a pool of hot cum that started to eat away at them. Natsu could feel is balls swell with the hundreds of people his cock had eaten. His balls were crushing the people on the outside due to the expansion until Natsu exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy this guys.\"<br>\r\nNatsu cummed in his undies, filling them with his hot seed and the remains of the melted people. His undies had to be the worst place on earth. The people under his gooch were beginning to melt as the cum slid in the gap. The people in his ass were constantly bomb barded with gassy farts, passing out from the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance Natsu saw Gray stand up. He was looking at the sea. Natsu looked and saw.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their heavy feet crushing everything they land on. They reached the cruise ships and stood over their respective ships that they were going to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bugs, hope your enjoying your vacation, cause it's about to get a whole lot better.\" Said Natsu.<br>\r\nMost people were on the deck, watching the giant loom over them. The people closer to Natsu were being showered by his pre cum. Natsu then put one let over the ship and grabbed it. He was doing a sumo stance on top of the ship. His balls meters away from the decks floor.<br>\r\n\"Here is a little treat for you guys to enjoy.\"<br>\r\nNatsu then started to rub his balls all over the deck. The people on the deck were running for their lives but to no avail. Natsu balls came sooner than they knew it. HIs junk crushed hundreds of people. The repeated smacking of his balls flattened their bodies until there was nothing left of them. Others stuck to his sweaty balls. They were tortured with the foul stench of Natsu's manly musk. <br>\r\nNatsu eventually either crushed or attached people with his junk until there was no one left but the captain. He knew the captain was in his quarters hiding. Natsu grabbed is balls and moved forward, above the captains quarters.<br>\r\n\"Hey you pussy bitch, take this.\"<br>\r\nNatsu then let go of his balls and they smacked down on the roof. The roof collapsed under the weight of his junk and the captain was crushed by Natsu's junk and the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Natsu was playing with his ship Gray was enjoying what he was doing. Gray assumed the same position as Natsu did but Gray grabbed his dick. Gray then leaned down and started to suck up the people on the deck with his cock. They were all running, trying to avoid the incoming monster. Grays dick devoured person after person. They were just sucked up upon impact, never to be seen again. He sucked up everyone on the deck, not caring about the lesser life forms, only caring about pleasure. The people travelled through his shaft. all they could smell was old cum and piss. They all landed in his balls and started to melt straight away. One after the other wold splash and die in about ten seconds. Gray's juice was just too strong for the people. They were all reduced to nothing. <br>\r\nGray eventually was in front of the boat where to captain was. The captain was standing there without fear knowing that he was going to die. Gray's dick was right in front of him and he was preparing to be sucked up like all of this passengers. To the captains surprise Gray turned around and exposed his firm, muscular ass. He then grabbed the captain and shoved him in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giants finished with their ships. They were both about to release but the both held it in. Their was one ship left that needed to be destroyed. <br>\r\n\"Hey Natsu, wanna fuck.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing hot stuff.\"<br>\r\nThey then both looked at the remaining ship and smiled. They then hugged each other and let themselves drop onto the ship. The impact crushing a lot of people but most of them landed in the water. Natsu and Gray were smothering each other. Their hard erect dicks slapping each other with every movement. They began to roll all over the place, crushing a lot of people.<br>\r\n\"Gray, let's make out with them in our mouths.\"<br>\r\n\"Great idea.\"<br>\r\nThey then grabbed the remaining people in the water and shoved them in their mouths. They each had about two hundred people in each of their mouths. They then began to kiss and hump each other. Their tongues connecting, slapping all the people inside around. A lot of people were swallowed or crushed by the smashing tongues. Natsu and Grays then grabbed each other dicks and started masturbating each other. They were both moaning and sweating. The water evaporating from their hot bodies and boiling sweat. They were both reaching their limit but Gray was the first to release. He cummed all over the place. His cum mixing with the water. Gray then lied down and Natsu got on top of him.<br>\r\n\"Got to return the favour from before.\"<br>\r\nNatsu shoved hi dick inside Grays mouth. Gray begn to start licking and the people that were still attached to Gray's tongue were now stucks on Natsu member. Gray sucked, licked and blowed until natsu exploded. Shot after shot was fired into Gray. The people inside Grays mouth were all transferred to his stomach. They both collapsed and lied their for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they got out of the water and put their undies back on. The people inside their undies were brought up into the air and were watching the incoming sacks and asses approach them. They were then placed back under the giants privates and were about to be joined by more soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Natsu, let's split up again.\"<br>\r\nThey both walked in different directions to continue collecting more people to shove in their briefs.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked at the high school and noticed that the kids were out for lunch. All the kids heard were earthquakes until they all saw a giant looming over them holding cars. Gray used the cars to block all the exits then he sat down. He sat on a group of friends. They were turned into bloody stains on Gray's briefs instantly.<br>\r\n\"Hey tiny fuckwits. Are you ready to worship a god.\"<br>\r\nGray stretched his foot out at a large crowd.<br>\r\n\"You bugs start licking.\"<br>\r\nThe crowed, scared of the menacing giant started to lick and massage his foot.<br>\r\n\"That's good, don't forget to do the whole thing worms.\"<br>\r\nGray then grabbed two crowds and shoved each crowd into his armpits.<br>\r\n\"You guys start licking as well or I will crush you with my pits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gray was dominating a boy yelled at him.<br>\r\n\"Piss off to where you came from monster.\"<br>\r\n\"What maggot. Are you disrespecting your god.<br>\r\nGray then lifted the boy into the air and put him in between his pecs. Gray then flexed his pecs, crushing the boys in between the two meaty mounds of flesh.<br>\r\n\"Shit that was fun.\"<br>\r\nGray then picked up a crowd of girls and shoved them in between his pecs.<br>\r\n\"Do you love this girls.\"<br>\r\nHe then flexed his pecs again, pulverising the girls in seconds. Gray then picked up a group of students and put them on his arm. He then flexed his arm which made his bicep crush the innocent students into a red pool of blood.<br>\r\n\"This is getting me so horny right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray then flopped his dick out of his underwear. Some people from inside were still attached to it. Gray ordered a bunch of kids around.<br>\r\n\"Walk inside my dick right now.\"<br>\r\nThe students hesitated before Gray crushed one of them with his pinky finger.<br>\r\n\"WALK IN.\"<br>\r\nThe student then started to enter his cock. Hundreds walked in and were tickling the walls of his inner member.<br>\r\n\"Shit you bugs feel could in there.\"<br>\r\nHe then lifted his penis making them all fall into his sack to melt away. He then started to pump his cock and he was throwing it around. He was crushing students with the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of you get inside the school now.\"<br>\r\nThe student ran inside the main building and shut the doors. They were in different areas so Gray couldn't get them all at once. Gray then got on top of the school and yelled out.<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU READY TO PLAY DODGE COCK.\"<br>\r\nGray then started penetrating the school with his cock. Thrusting in and out in and out. He killed the students and teachers inside with his erect member. He crushed classrooms one after the other until he was ready to explode. He cummed, flooding the school with his seed. The cum was flowing out of the windows and the remains of people were flowing out as well. Gray had destroyed a school with a wave of his cum and that made him instantly hard again. He started to masturbate again and walk into the town. He kept on grabbing people and shoving them in his dick with his other hand. He kept this up until he was able to cum again. He aimed up into the air and fired. He let the cum drop down like napalm strikes and obliterate the town. Cum landed and caused massive craters. The streets were being flooded and the town eventually melted into nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people in his undies were being bashed by his sac from his constant movement of him masturbating. He put his dick back in his undies and walked off. <br>\r\n\"On to the next town.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well I'm thirsty from walking so I guess I have to have it.\"<br>\r\nGray cupped his hands and got some of the green liquid and drank it. <br>\r\n\"Mmmm, this tastes pretty good.\"<br>\r\nGray scooped up more of the liquid and after he drank that he started to feel weird.<br>\r\n\"Guess that doesn't sit well with the stomach.\"<br>\r\nGray continued to walk but was worried about his stomach. He started to experience a sharp pain throughout his body.<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain suddenly stopped and Gray felt the best surge of power.<br>\r\n\"What is this.\"<br>\r\nGray finally got his answer. Gray looked down and noticed the ground was getting further away. HIs feet were growing bigger, he looked at his undies and his bulge was growing bigger. He couldn't look straight down as his now big pecs were in the way of his vision. Gray continued to grow, his arms thickening, his legs becoming massive. The original two hundred feet giant is now half a mile tall.<br>\r\n\"Fuck yes this is awesome. I gotta bring Natsu over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the far distance Natsu was torturing some farmers with his smell. He was shoving them in his armpits and feet and making them worship them. Natsu heard some loud earthquakes from behind but ignored it as he thought it was nothing. They quakes suddenly stopped and Natsu was lifted into the air. He stopped at a giant's face and realised it was Gray.<br>\r\n\"How did you get this big man.\"<br>\r\n\"Drank some liquid not far from here, wanna grow big too.\"<br>\r\n\"Heck yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray then took Natsu to the green pond and told him to have to handfuls of the liquid. Natsu drank the liquids and felt nothing, at first.<br>\r\n\"I don't feel anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Just wait, it'll happen soon.\"<br>\r\nNatsu then started to feel a bit weird and then the immense stomach pains came. Natsu was holding his stomach and was panting  heavily. After about half a minute of this Natsu's pain stopped. Natsu stopped panting and looked at the ground. He noticed it was getting further away. He looked up at Gray and smiled. He was quickly reaching his boyfriends height. Natsu's muscle were expanding as was his mighty bulge. The people in his underwear were getting less room as the undies did not grow but they were still on him. He finally reached Gray's height and they locked lips.<br>\r\n\"This is fucking awesome, we can use more people.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's go do it now Natsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit of walking the two giant found a major city. It was packed with people that are just waiting to be used for the two giants pleasure. The citizens felt large earthquakes and looked up to see two huge giants looming over them. Now that Natsu and Gray were around double their original height they just looked so much more menacing. Their undies were so tight, exposing their bulges way too much. adding to the intimidating factor. They both say down, crushing double the amount of people they would of before. Their wide asses flattening building, vehicles and people in an instant. Natsu and Gray started to drool as they were now as hungry as ever. They both took off their undies and put the people inside in the city. They let their dicks flop out. They were ready to play with everyone in the city with their bodies but where to start. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their dicks were pouring out pre all over the place, making waves of pre cum that flooded nearby streets. Natsu and Gray just stared and wondered what they were going to do. This city had about twenty million people in it and they could do anything with them. They were both the horniest they have ever been but they wanted to savour it for a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu made the first move, stretching his thick, muscular arm outside to a big crowd. He wrapped his huge fingers around the crowd and brought them to his handsome face. Natsu had drool coming out of the sides of his mouth. He licked his lips and shoved the crowd in his mouth. His tongue slapping the tiny morsels around and then Natsu started to chew. Their bodies being pierced by Natsu's sharp teeth. Some were reduced to mush or chew in pieces. Natsu didn't care for anything anymore except for himself and Gray. Human's were now just a tool to them. They wouldn't chew before because they wanted the people to suffer. Now they just don't care, people are their food now, their toy. Natsu swallowed what was left in his mouth and then burped. He was far from satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray had already picked up a crowd and ate them in the same fashion as Natsu did. Now Gray had another crowd in his hand. He lowered his hand so it was under his sack. The people looked up and saw a massive hanging mass of meat that was meters away from them. Gray let his sack drop onto the crowd. His sack just rolled over everyone, the wrinkly skin dripping sweat and smelling horrible. Gray then grabbed the top of his sack and started shaking it, causing all the people underneath it to be crushed and turned into a pool of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu had his eye's on a pre school. He shifted over towards it as loomed over the playground. His drool, splashing all over the small kids. Natsu picked up the kids and lowered them towards his ass. He then inserted the toddlers into his ass and did a set of loud, smelly farts. Natsu then moved a bit a saw a pile of bones. His fart disintegrated the poor kids, turning them into a skeleton. Natsu then butt crushed their remains and continued to shove the surrounding people into his hungry asswhole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray then moved to go sit next to Natsu so they could get the people to worship their muscles. <br>\r\n\"Hey Natsu, lets crush them with our muscles.\"<br>\r\nGray then picked up a bunch of people and put them between his pecs. He then flexed his pecs, causing them to squeeze the innocent people in between them. Their bodies pooping under the pressure of the god's muscles. Natsu then lifted another crowd and put them on his abs. He then did a sit up, making all the people on his abs flatten underneath his heavy weight. Gray then decided to put more people on his arm and flex is bicep muscle. <br>\r\nBoth the teen giants then grabbed crowds to put under their armpits. They put them there then closed the arms on them. They then flexed their arm muscles which caused all the people in their pits to be reduced to paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so fucking fun, the fucking little cunts can't do anything to stop us Gray.\"<br>\r\n\"They are meant to die to us Natsu. Their pathetic lives are fucking meaningless.\"<br>\r\nGray then grabbed a huge crowd and lowered them to his penis. He stopped at the head and put around a third of the crowd in his cock. He then grabbed his dick with the people in his hand and started to masturbate. The people instantly turned into blood, which Gray used for lube. Gray then kept on grabbing crowd after crowd, pulverising them into his dick just for his pleasure. Natsu watched in pure ecstasy, staring at Gray pumping his cock. Natsu then leaped forward and diving onto Gray. Their cocks making contact, shivering with pleasure, showering all that is beneath them with pre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giants started to make out while grabbing people to place under their bodies while they do so. They would stuff them up their asses and in their cocks. They would grab crowds and eat them and then continue making out. They would fuck buildings, fuck the land, fuck people on the ground. They would just spear their huge dicks at crowds. Natsu then turned around so his face was at Gray's cock and Gray's face was at Natsu's cock. They then grabbed people to put in their mouths and dicks. Then they began to suck each other. They were rolling around, licking each other penis's and sucking them. They would put more people in when they thought they ran out. Both giants were reaching climax. Who cummed first</span></div></div>",

People were killed by their rock, hard muscles, their hungry asses and cocks, their tongues and teeth. People were being used for the giant's sex. They were the most powerful force in the world now and they could not be stopped. Finally Natsu reached his limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gray, enjoy this.\"<br>\r\nNatsu released into Gray's mouth. Shot after shot of hot cum fired out of Natsu's cock, bringing the bodies of all the people that were in his balls with the geyser. Cum flooded Gray's mouth, it was seeping out of the sides of his mouth but Gray intended to swallow as much as he could. The people inside Gray's mouth just drowned from the pool of swishing cum. Gray gulped down loads of cum with each swallow, bringing it to stop at his stomach. The remains of the people and the ones that were clinging to life were bound to melt in Gray's acidic stomach. Natsu stopped firing after ten minutes of pure pleasure. Natsu took Gray's cock out of his mouth and rolled over, crushing everything in his way with his wide, muscular back. Natsu needed to regain his energy for a while so he just laid there, much to Gray's disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Gray, can't suck you at the moment, need more energy.\"<br>\r\nNatsu then started to grab people surrounding him and shove them in his mouth. He ate crowd after crowd and when he got bored of eating he would just shove people in his cock. He dropped a huge crowd above his slit. The slit widened, ready to devour it's next meal. The crowd just fell into his dick, slapping the walls while falling, Causing natsu more pleasure. The crowd finally reached is sack and splashed into a pool of cum. Natsu and Gray's cum was not hot enough anymore so they didn't melt upon impact. Crowd after crowd was swallowed by Natsu's dick, giving in pleasure when they would struggle in his urethra. Natsu was ready to explode again. The contents in his sack were shaking around. The pool of cum started to rise and then it shot up. Natsu fired into the air and cummed fell onto his body. The cum globs landed all of his torso, housing loads of people in each glob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray just witnessed Natsu's napalm strike into the air. He walked over to Natsu, and leaned over him.<br>\r\n\"Mind if I have a feed.\"<br>\r\n\"Help yourself.\"<br>\r\nGray then started to lick Natsu's body, eating the cum globs with the people in them. Gray could taste the saltiness of Natsu's sweat and cum and the tender flavour of the people in the cum. Gray licked all over Natsu's body, even places without cum. He got over to Natsu's cock and licked the base. He started at the bottom and lick his way up to the top. Natsu was leaking pre all over Gray's tongue but Gray did not mind, he loved the taste. Gray finally got to the cockhead and started to insert his tongue into Natsu's slit.<br>\r\n\"Just a sec.\"<br>\r\nGray grabbed a crowd and stuck them to the tip of his tongue. They were coated in the giant's thick saliva. He then poked his tongue out a moved back to Natsu's slit. The people on Gray's tongue could the see the incoming monster. As they were getting closer the sit widened, welcoming entry. Gray then inserted his tongue into Natsu's slit with the people on his tongue. He wiggled around and the people fell into Natsu but to be released as soon as they splashed. Gray put all of Natsu's cock into his mouth, slapping it around, waiting for Natsu to release. Natsu then fired for the second time into Gray's mouth. Gray experienced the delicious taste of his boyfriend's cum mixed with people for the second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray took Natsu's dick out of his mouth and then grabbed heaps of crowds. He then started to insert them into his penis. Thousands were devoured by Gray's hungry dick. Some were shot back out by the pre leaking out of Gray. Gray then grabbed more crowds and started to masturbate. The crowds turning into lube for the horny giant. Gray let his dick swallow and kill tens of thousands and then he was ready to explode. Gray fired his seed, mixed with thousands of people into the air. Shot after shot launched up and then bomb barded the city. Some shots landed on Natsu while most landed on the city, crushing everything they land on. Gray collapsed after his release and fell on a stadium. They stadium started to overfill with his sweat. The people inside rising up towards Gray. Some were launched up into his cock while overs were launched into his open mouth. Gray began to chew to lesser life forms and then got up. He walked over to Natsu and started to lick his cum off him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gray, lets fuck the town.\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds fun enough, but how.\"</span></div></div>",

Their massive dicks were pouring out pre, drowning the people below them with their fluids. Natsu and Gray got up and moved to different parts of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray moved to the stadium he collapsed on. It was still wet from all his sweat but it was still filled with people. The people in the stadium craned their necks up to look at the muscular god looking down on them. Gray squatted so his cock was in range of reaching the ground. The sweat from his balls was showering the people underneath him. They could smell his manly musk, emanating from his junk. Gray then grabbed his dick and started to lower his cock down to the people. They could see the incoming cock head of the giant. The slit widened, leaking pre onto the people. They could smell the old cum from the head and they could feel the heat coming from it. Gray then shoved his dick onto the people. His cock sucked up the people in an instant. They travelled up his shaft and fell into his sack. They were instantly coated in Gray's hot cum. After Gray sucked up all the people he then started to smash his scrotum all over the place. His sack knocked down the stadium, leaving nothing but rubble left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu was in the work district. Buildings that were considered giant were only up to Natsu's waist. Natsu was stepping on cars and people alike before he got to a considerably tall building. The people in the building were staring at Natsu through the windows. Each level got a different view of Natsu's godly body. Natsu then shoved his dick into the building. His dick took up a whole room, sucking up all the people in that floor. They travelled through his shaft and landed in his balls. Natsu and Gray had become accustomed to eating people with their dicks now due to the pure pleasure they get from it. Natsu then started to move his dick around. It would smash through all the floors, sucking up the people one after the other. Natsu took down the building just by swinging his cock in it. On the ground were a group of kids looking up at Natsu. Natsu squatted above them and spat on the kids.<br>\r\n\"Why are you destroying our town Mr mean giant.\"<br>\r\n\"Cause it's fun.\"<br>\r\nNatsu then sucked up the kids with his cock, enjoying the feeling of them travelling through his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of town Gray was crawling on the ground, letting his dick smash into everything. It would swing around, knocking over buildings one after the other. He would suck up hundreds of people while doing this, not caring for their lives in the slightest.<br>\r\n\"Hey Natsu, I'm bored of this city. Let's just suck up everyone then finish it later.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah ok. I was getting a bit bored myself.\"<br>\r\nGray and Natsu then started to suck up everyone in the city with their cocks. Crowds were running in the streets. Above them would be a gigantic cockhead that would suck them into the giant's sacks. Crowd after crowd was devoured by the horny giants dick. Their sacks were swelling due to all the people inside. In their sacks it was cramped, hot and wet. People were smashing each other due to the little room there was. Natsu and Gray continued to cock vore everyone in the city until there was nobody left. They devoured everyone within minutes. They were all in the giant's sacks, wriggly around causing Natsu and Gray immense pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay lets sit down Gray.\"<br>\r\nBoth giants sat down on a bunch of buildings and then spread their legs. They toppled building after building just by the act of spreading their legs. Both giants then started to fondle their balls. They could feel the people inside their sacks struggling to survive. Their sacks were now triple their original size. Both giants were pouring out pre that carried some people with it. They travelled down in a waterfall of the giant's fluids and then were glued to the ground by the drying pre cum.<br>\r\n\"Natsu, do you know what I am thinking.\"<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so.\"<br>\r\nGray then pounced on Natsu, his balls in Natsu's face.<br>\r\n\"Let's eat.\"<br>\r\nGray and Natsu then put each others balls into their mouths. The people inside felt their chamber warm up and start to move erratically. They were being swished around by the giants sucking. Both giants then took the sacks out of their mouths and put in the cocks. They were slapping the cocks with their tongues and sucking on the tip. They would insert their tongues into the slits. Everyone inside the sacks knew what was about to happen. The cum started to rise in each of their sacks along with people. Natsu and Gray then fired into each other mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cum flooded their mouths, coming out of the sides. The people were launched into the mouths of the giants and then the stomachs. They were all apart of the giant boys meal. The cum and people all travelled down into their stomachs and started to melt. Nobody survived. The giants then took the cocks out of each others mouth and were lying down on the city panting. They city now was just rubble, covering in sweat and dried cum. Gray then went to snuggle up with Natsu, his dick slapping all over Natsu's hot body. <br>\r\n\"Let's go to sleep and when we wake up I have something fun in mind.\" said Gray</span></div></div>",

It hovered there for a while before flying off towards the city, looking for a new body to incubate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu decided to trek his way across town thinking of surprising Gray, but it was proving to be quite a challenge. The citizens look up in awe as a giant about twice the size of a tower was stomping around the city. It was a site to behold as each part was packed with power and muscle. However before Natsu could succeed in finding Gray he heard a tiny voice shouting his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu looked around until he saw a tiny Romeo standing atop a tower, hands cupped around his mouth. \"Natsu-nii! Wow! This is awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet it is!\" Natsu excalimed as he flexed his biceps in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come with you?\" Romeo requests as he idolizes Natsu greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Natsu said as he picked up Romeo and placed him on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu decides to test out his power by kicking a tower. With a kick, it comes tumbling down as Natsu turned around towards another tower and tries using his magic. \"Fire Dragon's Roar!\" he shouted as the buildings exploded into flame right before their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Gray was minding his own business sleeping in on a weekend after noon, not feeling like doing anything until he heard explosions from quite a distance away. Sitting up in response, Gray, without his shirt, looked out his apartment window only to see smoke from such a distance away. <i>Damn what did Natsu do again...</i> he thought as he plumped back down on his bed, not knowing of this size conundrum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of the city has evacuated from the giant Natsu as all was left was a playground for Natsu and Romeo. </span></div></div>",

It's used to make the stomach acids disappear so they could smuggle architects, but now it's got a new owner.me\". You felt excited this meant you could continue to have fun with Gray!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray then downed the potion as you watched the lump travel down his throat ecstatic that it would be you being downed soon.\" You ready little guy\"?.<br>\r\n\"Y..yeah\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray part his lips as he reveled the hot cave that was his mouth, unclenching his fist he placed you on his tongue before sealing you inside. The muscle began to envelope you in it's warmth and salvia feeling like a squishy blanket.you were sloshed around in Gray's mouth as he tasted your flavor along with the foot sweet still drenching his body. Soon the tongue unfolded but lifted slightly positioning you in front of his gullet.<br>\r\n\"Ready!\", boomed Gray<br>\r\n\"YES!\", as soon as you yelled the muscle tilted all the way up sending you down Gray's throat.<br>\r\nAs you slid down the walls of the throat pulsed and squeezed you. Rather then being uncomfortable it was really cozy as it felt like a big hug. As you continued the desent you heard the inner workings of Gray's body, including his powerful heartbeat and some rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you felt an open becoming falling into a wide and empty chamber. \"The potion must have worked\".<br>\r\nThe floor was squishy and the air was warm almost like a sauna.<br>\r\nSuddenly you heart Gray's booming voice.\"YOU OKAY IN THERE\"?.<br>\r\n\"YES\", you yelled s loud as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright little guy tell me when you want out ok\"?, said Gray patting his firm abs before laying down on the couch and enjoying the feeling of you exploring him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou layed down on the squishy floor taking in it's warmth and getting drowsy. You wondered what was in store next. Maybe you could explore Gray's chest or even be his seat cushion and be clenched in his firm butt cheeks.

But fate was on your side when the wizard known as Winston Chip took you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took you in and raised you as his own and even taught you a magic he perfected himself known as size up and down. He could change his mass from the height of an ant to the peak of a castle. He had began teaching you magic, but unfortunately while practicing one day a wyvern had attacked and before he was able to grow to his full size, Winston was struck down only urging you to run and save yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wandered around, withering in despair wondering if you should have stayed with him and gone with him. But you continued on with only half of your magic, all you could do was shrink and not many jobs could be complete with that kind of magic. You also weren't build like most wizards who had muscle you were scrawny and had little strength. But eventually you found hope both with the help of a guild and a very manly friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were ready to kick the bucket. No one would hire you for a job and you were getting Hungry. You thought it was time to go. And had it all planned out. You would shrink down and wait for someone to approach and accept your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the corner you saw the man who  would unknowingly be your executioner. Elfman Strauss the fairy tail member with Beast Take Over magic. You saw him trending the street and performed your magic. Within two seconds your body shrank to that of a inch tall. You ran out from the corner and watched as the male Strauss walked forward his sandal clad feet coming closer and closer. You closed your eyes and thought about how he wouldn't notice you, how with one step you'll be nothing but a stain on his sandal. All you would do at most is irritate him that a \"bug\" was on his sole. You felt the ground shake more and more and felt a shadow loom over you. But the shaking stopped but no feeling of being squished came with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious you opened your eyes and saw the front of the sandals that almost crushed you. But looking up over all the looming muscles you saw Elfman staring down at you. The man had a look of confusion. You wondered if this was an act and any second he would smirk and raise his foot over you and mock you before stamping you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise..</span></div></div>",

Kinda cute for an ayakashi.\u201d <br>\r\nThat was DEFINITELY NOT your mother\u2019s voice, and this was DEFINITELY NOT your bed! It was all mushy and slightly damp. Your eyes shot open right after hearing the boyish voice, and lo and behold above you was the grinning face of a boy with spiky black hair\u2026only\u2026.he was gigantic! <br>\r\nYou and the boy stared at each other for a moment before you started screaming. \u201cHey! Stop that! Its not gonna help things ya know!\u201d Yoshimori frowned.<br>\r\nYou stopped screaming, fearing the wrath of the giant who held you in his palm, you just resigned to whimpering and curling up into a ball.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong ayakashi? Scared? Heh.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cW-what? Why are you calling me that?\u201d Then it hit you, ayakashi, and this boy, you both had heard and seen them before. On the anime Kekkaishi! <br>\r\nYou considered blurting out that you knew who he was and all that, but then realized that if he thought that you were an ayakashi, then he\u2019d grow suspicious if you started telling him outrageous things like how he was a fictional character from a television show.<br>\r\nYou gulped, you were in a conundrum here, hopefully you can convince him that you weren\u2019t a demon. <br>\r\n\u201cYou may have taken a human disguise, but you can\u2019t fool me!\u201d Yoshimori proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re way too puny to be a threat though! A shrimp like you is only good for spying; which is what you were doing right!?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? No I-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo since you\u2019re not a threat I have no reason to destroy you. But there\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna set an ayakashi free! No matter how tiny and pathetic they are!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Yoshimori brought up his other hand and a thin blue thread came out of the square on his palm. It travelled all the way to you and wrapped itself around your body, \u201cHey what are you doing!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori ignored your question as the end of the thread began to wrap itself around his index and middle finger. He lifted it up and you came with it.<br>\r\nHe dangled you before his face, his smelly breath washing over you as he spoke. \u201cHow about I make you my eternal slave? That\u2019ll make you WISH for death! Ha ha ha!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No! You can\u2019t!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all you got out before the thread around you began to tighten excruciatingly, and you screamed out in pain. All you could see was Yoshi\u2019s smirk before you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blue thread was still wrapped around you and you were laying down on your back; unable to move at all. You followed the energy thread up until you spotted your captor high above. The boy\u2019s face turned smug as he noticed you\u2019ve woken up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, you sure are a weak ayakashi. I wasn\u2019t even trying to knock you out!\u201d Yoshimori stated as he shook his head, apparently disappointed with your lack of strength. The Kekkaishi had used just enough strength to put some hurt on an ayakashi, but to you it was immensely painful. \u201cOh well, I\u2019ll make sure to go easy on you in the future. \u2026or not.\u201d The 14-year-old laughed as he tightened the thread a little more, making you groan in pain. You desperately squirmed and tried to break the thread, but it was way to hard. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, shrimp. You couldn\u2019t even break out of a piece of string; forget about trying to break though a nenshi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d you scream, not giving up your struggles. \u201cI\u2019m not ayakashi! You\u2019ve made a mistake!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen rolls his eyes and responds to your plea by quickly stomping his left foot next to you, shaking the wooden floor. You tremble as you look to your left and gaze at the gargantuan bare foot that now rests there. You can smell the strong odor of male dripping off the foot and you stuck up your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I heard you say I couldn\u2019t make you my eternal slave before you passed out. Well guess what, pipsqueak?\u201d Yoshimori slowly raised his bare foot over you, casting you in shadow. Your eyes widened as the sweaty sole of the teen hovered over you. Yoshimori grinned and wiggled his toes in excitement. \u201cI can.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the young Kekkaishi brought his foot down upon you. You screamed in horror for a second before you were muffled by his warm sole. Yoshimori pressed you into hardwood floor for a bit, showing you how easily someone his size your overpower you. You began to slowly rub his foot against you, smearing your face and the rest of your body with musky perspiration. You whimpered as you quickly became hot and sweaty and your eyes watered from the smell. With your arms bound to your sides you were unable to cover your nose or do anything to get away from the massive foot. You could only lay there and endure the horrifying stench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it smell, pipsqueak? With school and Kekkaishi duty taking up all my time, I haven\u2019t had the chance to bathe recently. You better get used to it down there because you\u2019ll be seeing a lot of my feet during your new life!\u201d Yoshimori chuckled amusingly and took his foot off you\u2026only to replace it with his other a second later. He continued to rub you into the floor for several minutes, occasionally switching feet and even using both of them at times. The result was several long minutes of smelly, god-awful torture. What had you done to deserve this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Yoshimori took his feet off you and tugged on the blue thread. You were pulled up to him and caught in his fist. The nenshi was dispelled and your teenage master held you in front of his boyish face for a few seconds; surveying your weak form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m done, ayakashi. I\u2019m just getting started! I\u2019m going to make you wish I didn\u2019t see you sleeping on my floor and accidentally stepped on you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped loudly as you looked into Yoshimori\u2019s cruel eyes. Now you had the sickening image of the young giant stepping on you; flattening you into a pancake. Needless to say it wouldn\u2019t be very difficult for him\u2026</span></div></div>",

Is it time for school already!?\" He shouted. Without a second thought, you were dropped into his pocket as he ran around the room, getting himself ready for the school day. Before you knew it, you were dropped into his front pocket on his shirt. \"Now you stay there!\" He said sternly. \"If I catch you trying to escape, I'm going to squash you flat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as you look into the eyes of the acclaimed \"average-looking\" boy. He sure could pull off that dark, yakuza look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a choice, you lay down into the pocket, sighing a little as you do. There's not really much you could do or say to get out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Tokine!\" You hear Yoshimori shout. You remember Tokine. A real passive-agressive bitch, but at the same time, had a more level head than Yoshimori did. Maybe... If you could just pop out at the right time, she'd be able to save you! As a precaution, you look over your body, to make sure you're not wearing any brown. The last thing you wanted was for her to think you're a cockroach and want you dead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, you wore green. Hopefully now you wouldn't be mistaken for a bug. \"Tokine!\" You hear Yoshimori shout again. \"Hey! Wait! Why're you heading that... way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the sound of his voice, it sound like Tokine left Yoshimori behind! It was typical of her to not give Yoshimori the time of day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori sat at his desk, and reached in for his pillow. \"Geez...\" He brushed it off, and laid his head in it. \"Ah! Right!\" His large hand reached into his pocket and plucked you up. \"Now then... What to do with you...\" He said, smiling devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his friends could get to him, or before he could think of an idea, the teacher walked in. \"Alright, class! I hope you're hands are ready, because you're going to be writing a lot of notes!\" He said firmly. The entire class groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori then looked at you. \"Hey... You could take notes for me...\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No way! Your mechanical pencil is way too huge!\" You argue with the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\" Yoshimori took out the pencil, clicked it a few times, and broke off the tip. \"Here you go. Get to work.\" He held up his hand and made a nenshi, tying it around you, giving you just enough room to move around, but not to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do well enough, I'll be convinced you're a good ayakashi, and I'll set you free.\" He said. \"But if you DON'T... Well I'll just feed you to the other ayakashi later tonight!\" He said with a dark grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome the end of class...</span></div></div>",

They'll be on your quiz tomorrow.\" As the bell sounded, you were panicking. Yoshimori was about to wake up from his littlenap, and you were nowhere even CLOSE to being done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic, you scribbled some stuff down. \"Yoshimori is the best!\" \"Praise Lord Yoshimori!\" were amongst some of the comments left there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" A voice chimed in with a dull tone. Yoshimori had woken up not too long after the bell had rang. He looked down at you, half-asleep, but fully aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry!\" You shout up at the boy, \"I couldn't do it! The teacher was going way too fast, a-and I couldn't keep up, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Yoshimori said noisily. \"Stop! I told you what would happen!\" The nenshi tightened around your arms. \"You're coming with me tonight to be fed to the rest of your kind!\" He told you cruelly. All you could do was whimper as your fate was set in stone. There was no avoiding what was sure to be the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... To find someone who'd eat a bug like you...\" Yoshimori said later that night. He was all dolled up in his usual kekkaishi garb, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Yoshi, that's not--\" Madarou began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, Madarou!\" Yoshimori shouted at the dog spirit. \"I gotta find an ayakashi that'll eat this smaller one!\" He told his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's not... Hey! Wait up!\" Madarou said, following after Yoshimori who was already marching away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori kept surveying the area. However, to his dismay, there just seemed to be no ayakashi wandering the school this night! Maybe Tokine was just trying to show off by taking care of all of them so there would be none for him. Not like Yoshimori really had a problem with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!\" He said, looking at a new, strange ayakashi. It had three eyes, and claws that were dripping with... who knows what!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about that one!?\"Yoshimori asked. Before you could even reply, he tied another nenshi around you, and held you in his fist. \"Well, been nice knowin' 'ya!\" He said, tossing you out to the giant beast. You landed about halfway between you and Yoshimori, luckily making a soft landing in an overgrown patch of grass. Looks like Lady Luck had at least some sympathy for you... You could've splattered on the cold, hard ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast turned, and saw the glowing string. However, he didn't see you... He saw the much more filling kekkaishi that was on the other end of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't know this. All you could see was this huge creature looking in your general direction! You quivered as it began running right for you, it's footsteps creating monsterous stomps as it moved. It started going faster... and faster... Right for Yoshimori!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What're you doing!? You're supposed to...\" Yoshimori immediately retracted the nenshi. \"Ketsu!\" He shouted, creating a barrier. He just missed, and the beast jumped right over it. It dove forward, just managing to cut Yoshimori with one of it's stingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoshi!\" Madarou shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on! I got it!\" He said, \"Ketsu! Metsu!\" The beast was caputred and dematerialized in a matter of seconds. Yoshimori managed to work through the pain as the strange venom was already coursing through his veins. \"T-Tenketsu!\" He called. The remains were sucked up into Yoshimori's spear-like staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head slowly creaked over. You were free! But you couldn't believe your eyes as you saw...</span></div></div>",

Yoshimori was too doubled over in pain to say anything, but he at least offered a groan in response, as his body was starting to burst with new size. His clothes were already starting to slowly tear at the seams. \"It's an ayakashi that infects its victims with a special venom to make them bigger, thus making more of a meal out of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori just made a noisy moan as he continued to grow. Out of pure compassion, you had been running back over to see if Yoshimori was okay. This was, of course, only to realize that Yoshimori was getting larger, becoming more of a force to be reckoned with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, were the last thing on Yoshimori's mind, as he was still growing larger and larger. He eventually topped off at ten feet, three inches. He wasn't a giant, but among everyone at school, he would surely become a force to be admired! Or feared, if so he desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori's joints cracked as he stood at his new height. He rubbed his head as he looked around. \"Aw geez... What just happened...?\" He said, his body throbbing a little as he still felt sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoshi...\" Madarou said under his breath.

Blinking a couple times, your vision clears up completely and you see the gargantuan face of none other than Jin the Wind Tamer! You thought he was incredibly hot in the show, but not like this! You shout up at him, \"Where am I? What have you done to me!?\" He chuckles and answers you in his incredibly adorable, fast-talking irish accent, \"Well tha's easy! Y'see, I found a catalog layin' around the flat, probably been delivered by a messenger or some such. Interestin' li'l catalog, too! Had a whole buncha things in it fer demons tae enjoy! Well I eventually flip to one of the last pages and lo, before me very eyes, an advertisement fer sellin' shrunken humans! I grinned and chuckled a' the idea of ownin' my own teensy little human toy to do with wha' I wanted and I rung up the guy. Rando's the name, I think, then I sent 'im the payment and 'e sent ye over! Kinda funny, though. I didn't actually think the article was even legit and he'd send me some kinda enchanted doll er somethin'. Not the real thing! And now 'ere you are, ready for me to enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin leaned back as he laughed, reavealing just how big he was compared to you. You were barely an inch tall to him and, considering the plush interior of the box and how small it must be, you must have been put inside of a box normally used to hold a small piece of jewelry. You look up at the gargantuan wind demon. You were still in massive shock over what happened, but you can't deny just how amazing your position is right now. You can do little more than stare at Jin's massive physique. He was certainly built, but he had a somewhat childish face and demeanor, despite clearly being a full-grown adult. Jin grinned down at you, \"Aww... ye like what ye see, little one? It's tae be expected, I s'pose. Women and men alike go abs'lutely crazy over me an' I know how tae use that fer my advantage! If yer tha' interested, perhaps I'll leave the decision to what tae play up tae you! What'll it be?\"</span></div></div>",

But...lately...you've become a bit obsessed with it. o much so that it's gotten into another obsession of yours....macrophilia. Not that that's a problem, no, of course not. But now you've been having those little fantasies of what it would be like not only to meet the characters, but to meet them at a mere few inches, able to fit inot their hands and everything that stems from that little dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, life sucks, and fantasy is fantasy. Sighing, you know you can only wish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter deciding to take the long route home, cutting through an older part of town, you spot an old pawn shop. You'd seen it before, yeah, but never bothered going in. But it was one of those life-changing days(although it didn't seem like it), so you walk in anyways, browsing the aisles of dusty souvenirs and oddities and such. Suddenly, a pendant catches your eye....it couldn't be...but it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small necklace with the emblem of the demon's contract seal. You knew its markings well, and quickly snatched it up, approaching the register with your fanpiece of merchandise in hand. After giving the little bell a couple rings, a man in a dark suit and bowtie comes up, hair slicked back and a wry grin. \"Is that all?\" He asks, pointing to your find. You nod, glad to have stumbled upon it. \"Good, good. That's a special item right there. One of a kind...I think...anyways, that'll be...hmm....\" He tilted his head, mulling it over, \"Eh, what the heck, five bucks. No one else has wanted that for years, anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happily pay the guy and continue your walk home, putting on your new little trinket. Again, though, those thoughts keep coming back....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky above looks dark, rainy, really. No, just dark....like nighttime...like...sleeping...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes for a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen joly upright. You don't sleepwalk. What was...You then realize you really must've just dozed off. But around you is not where you remember being. It's a tiled floor, nothing too special, but very, very spacious. You look up, seeing wherever you are is huge, practically a mansion! Grinning you stand and start walking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a large shoe comes down right next to you. Startled, you dash over to the wall, looking up, but you can't even see the face of the large black figure that shadowed you. Large figure. A giant. You squeal inwardly, and feel the need to approach him, but he continues his walk. Without warning, you shout out at him, trying to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turns, and lo and behold, it is the Sebastian freaking Michaelis. You nearly faint when you see his blood-red eyes. But...were they looking at you? And with what emotion? Hopefully he wouldn't consider you a speck out of place in the perfect mansion...but that was only if he saw you...</span></div></div>",

Sebastian looked amused as he held his foot above you, he could simply crush you into paste but he wanted to make your fear last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSebastian mockingly tilted his stomper back and forth. \"You are a human, much like my master and the other inhabitants of this mansion. However, you are a mere insect here, your soul as well as your body is a puny presence in this world that I'll guess your not orginally from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in shock, feeling helpless as not only did the giant butler degrade you but he seem to know of you being transported here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ple-!\", just as you were about to beg for mercy, Sebastian held up a gloved finger and cut you off as he sternly gazed from above his black clean dress sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to plea for your life? None of that, I'd rather you look at the shoe that will end you rather then squeal pathetic ramblings.\", Sebastian said in a nonchalant scolding manner while keeping the threatening edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butler suddenly grew a larger smirk as he rose his foot above knee level. \"Now then, let us see if your body will be crushed as quickly as a insect. Don't move.\", Sebastian ordered before slowly bringing his foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were frozen in fear, the demonic smirk was covered as the polished dress show filled your vision as it had the intent of crushing you. The ground shook as Sebastian's heel crashed down to the floor, the sole looming over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Farewell, I'm sure your blood will adorn my shoe nicely.\", Sebastian said slyly as he began to step his foot down and bring the hard leather sole mere inches from flattening you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of the frozen state you ran towards the tip of the shoe. Darkness shrouded the area as Sebastian slowly brought down the dress shoe. Him wanting to draw out crushing you was an advantage as the shoe hadn't quickly stepped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hopped towards the light just as the hard sole was touching your head. However this wasn't victory as your waist didn't escape and was pinned beneath the tip of Sebastian shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Sebastian paused before flattening your still trapped legs. The butler sighed as he brought a hand to his forehead. \"I told you to stau still! You could have been crushed all at once, but now i have to break you in two pieces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the weight on your legs increased and Sebastian was about to crush them you let out one last plea. \"Please stop!

But next time,\" he steps closer, leaning into the gardener with a slightly unsettling smile, \"Remember that we do not use such harmful chemicals on the flora. Weed them out by hand...\" he pauses , then adds, \"Without accidently uprooting a tree.\" Finny exhales and nods, dashing off. The butler turns to continue about his business as well, starting to walk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't just let the demon get away! With a mad dash, you run over to the tip of one of the shoes, jumping on top just as it's lifting in step. Quickly, you scurry over to the pant leg, hanging on just at the butler's ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway whizzes by, like riding in a car...or maybe with the up and down of the steps, it's more like a high-speed carousel. After a few moments of that, which seems to drag on to you, he turns and enters the kitchen, getting down a cup and saucer to place on a cart. A couple seconds later, the teapot whistles, and he efficiently takes it up and places it down as well, grabbing a couple of cakes that were on the counter, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind getting the dinner preparations right this time?\" He says, and you notice Bardo enter the room, tossing a cigarette in the trash. \"Aye-aye! Of course, Mister Sebastian!\" He salutes, then goes to the pantry to pull out ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sebastian grabs the cart, you realize the base of it is low enough for you to hop on. With a quick jump, you're sitting at the bottom of it amongst a couple of pitchers of cremes and such, like one would see in some fancy restaraunt. He wheeled the cart out, and you could guess where he was heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick ride, Sebastian paused and knocked on a door. \"Young master?\" He called, \"Evening tea is ready.\" Ciel's voice replies with a brief, \"Come in,\" permitting the butler entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was your chance, the cart in Ciel's room and Sebastian stopped before the master's desk. You hop off, landing back on the butler's shoe, and start to scale his pant leg. Although that's being a bit difficult. Maybe there was another way up...? Or maybe now would be a good time to try calling out. After all, that demon obviously had excellent hearing, right?</span></div></div>",

After fidgeting around, you finally get sort of comfortable and peer your head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...for tonight's guests. They happen to actually be from a rival company, hoping to negotiate something. I want everything to be in order,\" Ciel says, taking sips of his tea, a slice of some cake lying beside that, \"Including the dinner preparations. Nothing is to be scorched...\" Not a second later, there's a knock at the door, \"M-Mister Sebasitan, sir?\" It was Bard's voice, \"You, uh, mind helpin' me out with something? I can't seem to get the turkey at the right, uh, temperature...\" Ciel gave his butler a look, saying, \"In other words, please keep Bard busy with something else while you make the meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowing respectively with a brief \"yes, m'lord,\" Sebastian turns and exits, and, to your surprise, moves his hand and stuffs your head back into his pocket. This confirms he knows you're there, but also that he'll deal with you later. Sighing, you adjust yourself inside the silken material and wait for Sebastian to take you back out. It was kinda of nice, though, and at least the butler hadn't mistaken you for a pest. Although now you were suspicious....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd ever-so-casually just plucked you up, like he knew exactly what you were. Not only that, but he seemed to be treating you like something to do later on on a schedule, like he'd planned this! You tried to peer out once more, catching a glimps of a partially-charred Bard trying to explain his mishaps, something about too much cooking oil and matches. However, once more, the butler casually shoves your head back down. He could even tell when you were just a tad out of place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing, you decide to stay still, waiting instead. After a few moments, you hear Bardo leave, and youre quickly whisked up out of the pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFace to face with the demon himself. His eyes scan you over briefly, and he lets out a sigh, \"I really don't have much time for you. I've got too many things to do at the moment, as you see. So, if you will please just be patient and still, I shall get back to you in a moment.\" He pauses, waiting for a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, that fanatical side of you just squeals at the sight of him, but you quickly cover your mouth, \"U-Uh, okay, I guess. But...y'know, it seems almost like you were expecting me to show up. Do you know what happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do have some speculations, but again, now's not the time. I will attend to you after I've finished my work.\" He starts to lower you back into his pocket, but you protest some, wanting to stay out, as it is kinda cramped in there. \"W-Wait! Maybe I can just stay out for a moment. I'll stay out of the way, don't worry.\" Immediately, he places you on the counter, replying hastily, \"Fine, but keep clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking up over to the edge, you sit and watch as the butler flawlessly pulls out some spices and herbs and marinades, while at the same time tending to the half-burned turkey and repairing it with ease. It was these moments, watching his perfection, that you had come to grow a real favor to Sebastian over the other characters. You swore at some moments, in his haste, that the demon would purposely dramatically pause to let the kitchen light shine over his face, like on of the freeze frames in the anime, or a manga panel, then continue on with the preparations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes, the dinner was back in the oven. Clapping his hands together once in conclusion, the butler grinned, \"Excellent. Seems I've finished that a whole minute early. So,\" he grabs you up, \"Perhaps, for now, I should put you somewhere a bit more convenient for the night.\" Without saying where, he exits the kitchen, putting you in his jacket pocket this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, he pulls you right back out, and sets you on a table. After gazing around you in awe, you know where you are. \"This is...your room, isn't it?\" The butler nods, and you giggle a bit, \"This is amazing. So--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe places a large finger over you, as if shushing you, \"As I've stated before, I still have other business to attend to. After that, though, I will return. Please stay put for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe briskly walks off, shutting the door and leaving you alone, a mere two inches tall, in his room. Walking to the edge of the desk, you look out. It looks exactly the way it's portrayed in the manga, pristine and perfect. You look down, seeing a chair that's seated right in front of the desk your on, and beyond that is the butler's bed, a closed window right above that. At the other end of the room is a wardrobe, and right by the desk is a fireplace. Overall, you find it's actually a lot nicer than your own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething at the corner of the desk catches your eye, a little partially opened drawer with paper clips in it, and some string. You could probably climb down with that. But he did tell you to stay put...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tying one end of the rope to the paper clip, which you attach to, of course, a large stack of papers, you scale down the leg of the desk until your feet hit carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing, up, you find that being this low to the ground really makes everything seem even bigger, and makes you feel so much smaller. Although where to go first...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA breath goes down your shoulder, making you freeze. Someone, someone very big was behind you. Turning, you come face to face...with one of Sebastian's cats. You know Ciel doesn't let the butler have them due to allergies, so Sebastian most likely kept this little secret in his room, away from the master. It's a cute thought, knowing the demon had a soft spot for cats, but now it seemed a pain, as that feline was eyeing you like you were some kind of toy or catnip or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeowing low, the cat reaches out a paw and swats at you, barreling you over despite the fact that you had your hands up to slow the blow. You tumble until your head comes to a hard snack against the chair leg. Standing, dizzy, you look up to see the cat's paw bat you again, sending you flying under the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to recover, you scoot as far under the bed as possible, seeing the feline's yellow gaze at the edge of the bed. It licked its whiskers and twitched and ear, tail flicking as its eyes scanned over you, as if calculating how to best torture from this point on. And slowly, like it was trying ot to startle you, its little mouse, it placed a paw forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran like hell to the far stand of the bed, jumping up and grabbing onto the rail. Mustering all your strength, you try to hoist yourself up like you were doing a pull-up. With an amused purr, the cat inched closer, practically grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, you get a leg over the rail, pushing yourself up on it. A blast of air fluffs your hair, making you peer down to see the cat looking up at you, its nose twitching just a centimeter away. With a playful meow, the cat reaches up a paw and taps you, an action that is enough to make you loose your balance and slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat's whiskers tickle you as he inspects with curious sniffs, almost making you let go. It ceases, and you let out a breath, looking at the cat's large eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light pink tongue brushes you roughly, followed by a soft purr. Panicking, you pull yourself up and out of the way of the cat, scrambling up the metal frame of the bed. Growling, the cat swats up at you, nearly catching you. Quickly, you climb up, almost at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe claw catches one of your legs, sinking in. Letting out a scream--with probably sounded like a rodent squealing to the cat--you let yourself be dragged down a bit, the pain too much. You don't even know how deep the wound could be, but you don't dare look, instead trying to focus on escape. The claw eases out, preparing to strike again and pull you down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paw hits empty air, though, as you've already booked it to the top of the bed, panting. Looking now at the wound, you feel like you were stabbed or something. There's blood, too much of it to really see the wound or how deep it is. A whimper escapes you, but you wipe back the tears as a soft thud lands at the other end of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering over the pillow, you see the cat glaring at you, tail flicking madly in the air as it growls. Looking around, the closest hiding spot you can find is in the pillow case, so you dive in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat pads over, half-growling, half-purring, its head reaching down to sniff around the entrance to your little hiding spot. Its other paw steps on the pillow just behind you, making you scoot forward. With a satisfied murr, the cat uses this tactic to try and get you out for some more playtime.</span></div></div>",

You shivered slightly as you sat in the quiet man's office, stripped down to nothing but a simple pair of underwear. You're a skinny boy, too weak to have enlisted in the army like you originally wanted, with pale skin and fiery red hair. You had a steely glint in your eyes as he watched the doctor write, adding your name to the records for this strange new experiment. You had originally heard about it weeks ago. The army was looking for any young men who were willing to fight to defend humanity through undergoing trialed experimentation. No health check was required, no background check, no questions asked. You had immediately jumped at the chance, grasping at this final opportunity to actually be useful in the effort against the Titans. No matter how many times you had tried to enlist in the army, the result was always the same: you were just too weak. You didn't have the constitution required to use 3D maneuver gear. You were too sickly. You were too much of a risk. The shame boiled inside you as you remembered these assessments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least now...now I'll be able to DO something!\" You thought, clenching your right hand into a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Luciano. I believe you know why you are here?\" The doctor asked, sitting down on a stool opposite you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes doctor. The trialed experiments.\" You said immediately, nodding your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely. However, we have not divulged exactly WHAT these experiments are. Before I ask you to sign the waver, you must know that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor!\" You interrupted desperately, leaning forward slightly, an almost hysterical expression on your face. \"Please...my brothers...they've all DIED out there, fighting those monsters. You don't know what it's like...to be left behind...unable to fight...to be so USELESS! I don't care WHAT these experiments are for or what they'll do...just...do them already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor's calm facade broke, but only for a moment. He pushed his glasses up higher on his nose and said, \"Very well. Then please sign right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly took the pen and scrawled out your full name, practically throwing the paper and pen back at the doctor in your excitement. The older man got to his feet and filed the paper away, picking up a needle and tapping the syringe lightly. He squeezed the plunger, a thin stream of clear liquid flying into the light. He walked back to your side, wrapping a piece of cord tightly around your upper arm before gently rubbing a cotton swab over the crook of your left arm. Once it was completely prepped, he poked the needle into your vein, depressing the plunger completely. The liquid felt like ice as it traveled into your body, coursing through your veins, making you shiver and feel lightheaded. The icy feeling didn't last however. Soon, a burning sensation replaced it, becoming more severe as time went on! You started to sweat, falling back onto the bed, your whole body shaking uncontrollably! Just when the pain was becoming too much to bare...you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooogh...\" You groaned, slowly sitting up, holding your head. \"What....was that supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision was a little bleary as you looked around, eyes unable to focus. You seemed to be on some kind of...broad, white plain, stretching out on all sides of you, as big as a field. \"How did I get here?\" You mumbled to yourself, slowly getting to your feet. Your vision was returning bit by bit, the strange, featureless plain starting to look more familiar...You looked up and around, taking in what seemed like a familiar location...the doctor's office...just...so much bigger! Everything inside it appeared to have expanded several times larger than was normal, the \"plain\" you were on actually the bed! You start to breath faster, feeling panic starting to set in. Before you could do so much as twitch, however, the door opened, thunderous footsteps reaching your ears as someone entered the room. You gazed up in awe at the man before you, standing taller than any Titan you had ever seen, bright green eyes staring intently down at you. He had short brown hair and was dressed in a familiar uniform, that of the infamous Survey Corp. He leaned forward slightly, eyes focusing more on you, making you take a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Eren Yaeger. You are?\" He asked in a formal tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-My name is Luciano...R-Ricci...\" You said in as loud a voice as you could muster, quivering in fear at this giant man before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEren nodded and said, \"Good. I've been selected to be your guide for the next few weeks of trials.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait...what kind of trials ARE these anyway?!\" You shouted, completely confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEren raised an eyebrow, folding his arms across his athletic chest. \"Didn't the doctor explain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou winced slightly as you realized you had cut him off, not giving him the chance to explain what any of this was about. \"N-No...\" You said, without elaborating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEren sighed slightly and said, \"Currently the doctors that live inside the walls are working on a serum that can greatly enhance human size and strength, similarly to how I....I mean...similar to the Titans.\" Eren seemed to sweat slightly before continuing. \"Basically, we have a far greater chance of beating these monsters if we can fight them on their level with our own ingenuity and skill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...why am I so tiny then?\" You asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. It's much easier to shrink a human body than it is to safely make it grow. The plan is to shrink down willing test subjects, those around the same age as those actually enlisted in the army, and observe them, to make sure no ill effects develop. With this information, we'll be able to hopefully restore you to normal size and, using your blood as a base, develop a formula to safely enlarge already human sized individuals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hopefully?! You mean I could be...STUCK like this?!\" You said desperately, the full weight of your hasty decision descending upon you. \"N-No way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEren's steely gaze seemed to harden even more. \"You signed up for this experiment willingly. Don't even think about trying to back out now that things look grim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for him to say...\" You thought bitterly. \"He's not stuck as a bug among humans...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEren's enormous hand suddenly reached out and grabbed you, his tree trunk like fingers a bit rough as he lifted you into the air, up to his face. \"I'm taking you with me back to the barracks for now. But you will be accompanying me at all times and do exactly as I say. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir...\" You said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Eren said, tucking you safely away inside his shirt pocket.</span></div></div>",

To you, it was like being in a large hammock, your tiny body easily able to stretch out fully at the bottom of the pocket, the lip of it raised at least ten or more feet up above your head. It really gave you a sense of just how tiny you really were, making you shiver slightly. It suddenly dawned on you that you were almost completely naked! It seemed completely illogical that your underwear had somehow shrank with you so you must have been changed at some point. The thought made your cheeks burn slightly. \"The least they could have done is give me some decent clothes...\" You muttered to yourself as you leaned against Eren's chest, closing your eyes slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steady back and forth motion of the pocket, mixed with Eren's strong, consistent heartbeat was making it hard for you to stay awake. It was almost like being lost at sea, though the constant presence of a human life right next to you also made you feel extremely protected. It almost came as a shock when Eren stopped moving, his gigantic index finger and thumb plucking you up from out of his pocket. He brought you up to his face and said, \"We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word he dropped you down on a large table, filled with at least a dozen little buildings, much like a village built for dolls. Your eyes widened slightly as you took this all in. Just how many people were taking part in this experiment? Eren sighed as he rolled his shoulders, watching you calmly as you walked up to the nearest building, opening he door and glancing inside. It appeared to be sparsely furnished but not unlike your own house. It was a simple, two room structure. A bed was pressed up in the corner, a small desk was at the opposite end, the other room containing a little toilet and a small bucket that was filled with water. You sighed slightly at that. It was foolish to think there would actually be running water. You were about to step outside when the roof suddenly lifted off above you, revealing the titanic Eren staring intently down at you. \"Is he always so...intense?\" You thought to yourself, staring silently up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where you'll be staying when you're not with me. You'll sleep here and you'll eat in the barracks. It's the big building right in the center of the \"town\".\" Eren explained before pointing at a small trunk you hadn't noticed when you first walked in at the foot of the bed. \"A change of clothes is in there. We only had enough time to prepare two outfits for you so don't mess either of them up. You can get one washed at the end of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded slowly at every direction he gave you. So this was what life in the military was like...regimented and precise. You opened the trunk and pulled out a simple linen tunic and pants, quickly pulling them on, glad to have something covering your pale, weak body. Eren watched this entire process unnervingly. \"No shoes?\" You asked him, looking up through the roofless house. It was almost like gazing up at some kind of god...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time.\" Eren said simply, reaching in and grabbing you again. \"You're going to have to learn to move faster as well. I can't constantly be holding back and waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could so much as squeak out a response, you were pushed back into the pocket, much to your frustration. Determined to not be kept down, you quickly got to your feet and reached your arms up, gripping as much of the pocket material as you could, pulling yourself up. With Eren walking, it was almost impossible to climb. After only a few minutes of climbing, your hands moving painstakingly slowly as they reached up over and over again, you had barely raised yourself even a foot (relative to you of course), your body dripping in sweat, staining your new clothes already. It didn't help that every time Eren increased his speed, no matter how minor it was, you found yourself getting smacked back against his hard chest, nearly dislodging you every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, at the brink of exhaustion, you managed to reach the lip of the pocket. You draped your aching arms over it, hanging half out, panting, sweat dripping from your forehead, disappearing into the wind before it could so much as touch Eren. Looking down you're struck with an intense feeling of vertigo. Eren's massive boot clad feet strode with purpose against the stone street, his eyes trained forward. You watched in slight horror as he stepped fully on a ladybug without even noticing it, the crunch audible even to your tiny ears. That could just as easily be you, if you weren't careful. You shiver slightly at the thought, almost wanting to drop back down into the pocket. Before you could make that decision for yourself, however, Eren started jogging down a flight of stairs, the sudden downward motion jostling your tiny body, sending you tumbling head over heels, right out of the pocket! You tried to let out a scream of pure terror and only managed a hoarse gasp, your body plummeting down past Eren's chest, his tight stomach, and past his waistline. Just when you thought it was all over, darkness enveloped you. You could feel yourself sliding against some tough material, the heat around you increasing greatly, a musky scent invading your nostrils. It wasn't until you were suddenly pressed up against a huge, peach colored, slightly damp mound that you realized what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had fallen right inside Eren's boot!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The temperature inside the boot was so hot as to be unbearable. Every second inside it felt like being within an increasingly hot oven, sweat already forming on your brow before sliding down your face, the same effect happening right in front of you on Eren's colossal foot. A large bead slowly trickled down the side of the foot, running directly into your face, the hot, salty liquid covering it like you had been splashed in the face! You sputtered and spit, pushing yourself back, bracing yourself against the musky flesh. You had barely managed to create a relative inch of space before you felt your bare feet slip against the leather, sending you directly under Eren's foot! Moving without thinking, you rolled, hoping against hope that, in the darkness, you were heading for the toe of the boot rather than the heel! Luck seemed to be on your side as you felt the rough enclosure of the toe section, just as Eren's foot came down directly behind you with a world shaking THOOM!, your tiny body bouncing up and down against the roof and floor of the boot. Groaning, you quickly turned over, wedging yourself into the tiny area of the boot, face to face with Eren's gigantic toes. The big toe alone appeared to be nearly as long as your own body, each one capable of smearing you into a red paste if you weren't careful. You gulped, watching as the toes seemed to clench slightly, bending at the joint, before rising slightly from the bottom of the boot, pulling it upward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of vertigo engulfed you as you were rocketed into the air, nearly dislodging your minute form from your hiding place, all because of the simplicity of the young giant taking a single step! The bottom of your stomach dropped out as you were suddenly plummeted back down to the ground, the force of the boot striking the hard road bouncing you again, your limbs already beginning to ache with the effort of holding yourself in place. The process repeated itself again and again and again, each time a fresh bruise blooming. It didn't take long before you started to slip, your body finally coming loose as Eren stepped down particularly hard, the next rise sliding your body down, right in the path of Eren's descending toe! You could barely muster a yell, the intense heat and brutal beatings rendering you weak and defenseless. Immense pressure suddenly pressed down on your entire torso, compacting your ribcage to the point you were sure it was going to crack, the sweaty digit effortlessly pinning you against the moist material of the boot. You gasped in pain, struggling slightly, trying to push against this unrelenting force...only for it rise off you again, bringing you a moment of respite to take a deep, gasping breath...only to swallow a mouthful of Eren's sweat, the hot liquid making you choke and sputter. Before you could even begin to recover from that, the toe was upon you once more, practically crushing you with pressure! It was like a torture out of Hell, repeated endlessly as Eren lightly jogged from the barracks to the training field, intending to practice with the other members of his division. He had no idea that you were currently trapped underneath his big toe, pinned down like a bug. You were so small you didn't even register as an annoyance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what felt like hours of torture, Eren stopped, standing still at the edge of the practice field, scanning it for signs of his friends. Inside his left boot, you let out a pained sigh of pure relief! Even though you desperately wanted to rest, you knew Eren probably wouldn't stay still for long. You briefly thought about getting Eren's attention, whether it be by rubbing or biting, but immediately squashed the idea. If you somehow managed to register any kind of recognition on Eren, he would probably only press down lightly, pulping your body as easily as he would a grape, probably not even noticing as he washed your remains off in the shower. You gulped, lifting your arms up over your head. When you had initially ended up under here, your arms and legs had been spread just enough that you could wrap them both around the toe, which you did, shimmying your little form out from under the toe, the slightly rough, musky flesh gently gripping and rubbing against you as you did so. You couldn't help but blush as you felt your crotch rub against it as well, a strange feeling passing through your mind and body. A feeling of...reverence? Acceptance? It was almost similar to a feeling you had once before, when you had spotted a particularly handsome man in a crowd, an immediate feeling of...attraction. You shook your head wildly, sweat flying from your face in tiny particles as you did so. This was NOT the time to be feeling some kind of weird...SOMETHING for a part of the human body that was currently able to kill you! Maybe the injection was starting to mess with your head...You grunted, pushing yourself out from under the digit just as it rose up once more, sending you tumbling backwards, head over heels into the toe section of the boot! You barely managed to brace yourself again, your eyes darting all over the boot, searching for some kind of solution...ANY kind of solution!</span></div></div>",

And why is the room so big?\" You asked yourself while you stood up onto your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you started to walk around the wooden floor you saw a lot of beakers were set on a nearby table.

Maybe if I'm lucky whoever it is might be able to help me.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you held your breathe while you watched the door as it was slowly unlocked before being pulled open.

Rather they be a pro-hero or not. People say having a quirk is what defines someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that case what does my quirk define.<br>\r\nMy name is Sai Hudo and my quirk is simply known as small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile some have flashy quirks to show off, mine has caused me more trouble then praise. My quirk as the name implies, let's me shrink in size to a inch tall. Also I become somewhat durable, key word somewhat. For instance if someone accidentally stepped on me I'd be fine but if force was intentionally added it will hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill another downsize is I can't shrink then grow back. If I shrink I'm stuck 1 inch for a unknown amount of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough others often teased me about my quirk, I have made a close friend. Izuku Midoriya was his name. Back in grade school I accidentally shrunk during recess but Izuku had saved me before the kids could trample me. We became close friends and despite his lack of a quirk I knew he could become a hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing friends with Izuku. I defended him whenever i could especially when Bakugo picked on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsuki Bakugo. At first he wasn't too hostile to me, but when I became close with Izuku he began to go all out. Pushing and insulting me.<br>\r\n\"Hmm! Your just as useless as deku\"!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think you can beat me! I'll crush you both no matter what size\"!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go meet All Might. In fact use your quirk I'm sure he'd love to introduce you too his boot sole\"! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treatment went on for years and soon Bakugo began using me. He's force me to shrink and would use me as a insole or just stomp me repeatedly all while evilly smirking. I still shiver when I remember him \"accidentally\" sitting on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill I once again find myself in a predicament. While exiting school I sneezed hard which activated my quirk. I groaned as I watched the gate grow taller and stretch into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I need to get away before students start crowding the entrance\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could move, a shadow engulfed me.

After blinking a couple of times, izuku crouched down darkening the shadow. \u201cAre you alright? Did Kacchan make you small again!\u201d, Izuku began to mumble as he twinkled with his fingers\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he put him in his shoe again?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDid he chase him?<br>\r\n\u201cDid he sit of him again?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZu-kun\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I going to help him?

Damn, I could never be be mad at a smile that pure.\u201d It\u2019s ok\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should I do? Do you want me to take you home\u201d, Izuku asked. \u201cNo. My parents are gone for the next week and at this size I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be easy by myself\u201d. Izuku looked off to the side for a second before brightly smiling. \u201cThen you can stay with me if you want\u201d. \u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah mom won\u2019t mind. Plus we haven\u2019t hung out a lot lately!\u201d, Izuku explained. I smiled before nodding.\u201d Yeah I\u2019d like that\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku hands twitched before he began to rub his fingers together. He looked nervous. \u201cCan...I pick you up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at his request. \u201cOf course you can Zu-kun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku slowly brought his hands down and gently cupped his palms around me. The ground grew warm and soft as izuku stood up carrying me in his hands. He\u2019s picked me up numerous times before, but always makes sure I\u2019m ok and comfortable with it. Izuku smiles softly as he brings me to his face, and I can\u2019t help but smile too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of students exiting the school alerts me and Izuku, and he begins to softly jog down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\nAs we made our way to Izuku\u2019s home, I asked to be placed on his shoulder. Albeit hesitantly, Izuku conplied. At my size I had enough space to sit on, I couldn\u2019t help but look down at the side walk Izuku treaded on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the U.A entrance exam is coming up right\u201d, I asked gazing up at Izuku\u2019s face as he looked at me a little nervous.\u201d Y..yeah they are.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly smirked as I looked the opening in his uniform collar. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Zu-kun! I\u2019ve seen these new muscles you\u2019ve got. You\u2019ll make it in no problem!\u201d, I declared slapping his shoulder. ( which probably felt like a weak tap)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku began to turn red as he looked away. \u201cS...SAI! I don\u2019t have muscles!\u201d. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at his reaction. \u201cCome on! I saw you work out yesterday. Those muscles are real! .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the way home was spent with me lounging on Izuku\u2019s shoulder, while he covered his red face.<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\nWe finally reached our destination, upon entering I saw Inko. Izuku\u2019s mother. \u201cWelcome home! Oh Sai-kun you\u2019re here too.\u201d, she said noticing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis parents are gone for the next week. Can he stay here?\u201d, Izuku asked. \u201cOf course, he can stay as long as he wants\u201d, she replied smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, we\u2019re gonna head to my room\u201d, Izuku informed Inko before heading to his room. Upon entering I was greeted once again by the sight of Izuku\u2019s All Might Heaven. Walking over to his bed he gently set me down on the covers, before kneeling down so his face was leveled with me. \u201cSo..how long do you think it will take for you to grow back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scratched my head thinking. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. One time I was small for only a couple of minutes. But another time, I didn\u2019t grow back intill a few days passed.\u201d, I explained watching Izuku gain a sad look in his eyes. Damn it! This problem was caused by me, and Izuku shouldn\u2019t feel bad for something I did. Walking forward I hesitated, before hugging Izuku\u2019s nose. I felt him jerk slightly. \u201cS..sai?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZu-kun I messed up and got small. You should\u2019t feel bad. I\u2019m lucky to have you as my friend and giant buddy.\u201d. I couldn\u2019t see Izuku\u2019s reaction, but I felt his palm gently press against my back, which confirmed the smile I saw as I pulled away. \u201cThanks Sai\u201d. \u201cNo problem\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku stood up, towering over me once more. \u201cI\u2019m going to get us a snack, I\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d. Izuku exited his room, leaving only me and his All Might collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the posters I couldn\u2019t help but feel intimidated. I admired All Might and wished I could be like him. But as I got older, I realized that my wish was unrealistic. My quirk wasn\u2019t cut out for hero business. All Might was a powerhouse, while my quirk is unreliable. I used to imagine All Might, with me on his shoulder saving people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I remember also the nightmare I had. <br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n(Sai\u2019s Nightmare)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI layed on a soft surface, in front of me was a giant table. I was confused, but booming footsteps brought my gaze up. I blinked in shock as All Might stood over me like a titan. \u201cA..ll Might!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, young Hudo!\u201d, All Might greeted with a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh..where am I?\u201d, I asked still astonished. \u201cMy place of course!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve come for your new job!\u201d, All Might declared.\u201dw..wait what job?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy as my new seat cushion!\u201d. Wait what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes young Bakugou said you provide great comfort!\u201d, of course. Even in my dreams Bakugou still finds a way to taunt me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Might turned around, allowing me me a view of his firm rump.\u201d Feel honored young Hudo! You are providing those who help others comfort!\u201d And with that All Might bend his knees, bringing his colossal rear over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn\u2019t move and could only watch as the area around me darkened and a large weight forced me down. As I was crushed down, the firm mass began to grind side to side intill I was sucked up into All Might\u2019s cheeks. Had it not been for the spandex I may have been sucked up all the way. In the dark warm flesh I was squeezed by the firm cheeks  and assulted by a sweaty musk. All Might simply read a newspaper, with his feet crossed on the table, while unconsciously clenching his cheeks, squishing me more. I luckily woke up, just as I heard a rumbling noise. <br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00e2 \u20ac\u201d\u2014-\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shivered, remembering the dream. I still looked up to All Might. But I also get nervous about maybe meeting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku luckily returned with some rice crackers. I tried to forget the dream as me and Izuku ate. But with the posters it wasn\u2019t easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile of talking, me and Izuku changed into our pajamas ( more like he changed and I just wore my boxers.). As we sat on his bed, I could tell Izuku was worried. \u201cHey, Zu-kun what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku looked away before replying.\u201d I\u2019m just....nervous about the exam. I\u2019ve been training hard and want to succeed so bad\u201d, Izuku confessed looking at me with the sad look again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about what to do. Maybe I can help him feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZu-kun how about.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, I pressed on. \"Come on! I want to help get rid of any stress you have built up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku soon calmed down before nodding. \"Ok. But if you want to stop then do it right away!\". I nodded and izuku began to skoot to the front of his bed before uncurling his legs, placing his feet on both sides of me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the soles they were mostly clean with only a little dirt and a few drops of sweat. Approaching the foot I stopped to sniff his sole. \"Do they smell Sai?\", Izuku asked worried. I shook my head at him, if being squished into Bakugou's sole has taught me anything, it's that you get used to foot oder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing both of my hands onto the soft flesh, I began to rub and itch the foot. Izuku's foot was smooth and not as ruff as Bakugo's. I couldn't help but press my body into his sole, feeling the warm flesh encass me in it's warmth and smell. As i rubbed, I looked up at Izuku. He had his eyes closed with a light blush on his face. He whimpered slightly as he grinned. I worked my way up to his toes and feeling bold, I gave a light kiss to his big toe, tasting the salty sweat. Izuku's eyes opened in surprise as he looked at me, I simply smiled and gave another kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs i kissed his toes, i noticed Izuku beginning to giggle. I began to think. \"Is he ticklish?\". So i smirked and decided to test the theory. I began to alter between kissing and rubbing between his toes, and soon Izuku began to laugh up a storm. \"Ha..ha! S-sai! Come on st-op it\", Izuku giggled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was way better then rubbing Bakugo's feet! Chances are he just be squishing me between his soles. And truth be told, I grew to like feet. Being close to Bakugo's feet almost every day, I found myself attracted to them and enjoyed it. The smell, the warmth, even being squished sometimes. I thought I could help heroes with my newfound pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou was somewhat encouraging saying. \"Ha! It sure as hell feels good squishing you Hudo! Maybe you'll get a job worshipping heroes feet!\".<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nAfter my tickle attack, I continued to rub and occasionally kiss Izuku's soles. As i arrive at the heel of the other foot , I licked the slightly ruff flesh and tasted the salty sweat before sitting down and leaning against the heel. Izuku smiled before leaning forward, blush still lingering on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sai! I feel more relaxed now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great. Now I want you to rock the entrance exam!\", I yelled pumping my fist up. Izuku nodded with a determined look. \"Y-eah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt Izuku's stride and couldn't wait to see him go far.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nWe soon decided to settle down for bed, I could only wait intill the morning to see if I turned back. I crawled onto Izuku's palm before he slowly placed me on his pillow. Turning off the light, Izuku crawled into bed and placed his head beside me and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Sai, I hope you grow back.\" Still being with Izuku, I wouldn't mind being small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. good night night Zu-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched Izuku close his eyes making him look peaceful. Feeling his warm steady breath helped me fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up hearing Izuku's alarm. Opening my eyes, I saw that..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Izuku soon sat up and rubbed his eyes, looking down at me he frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you didn't grow back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea. But it's ok, I don't mind!\", I tried reassuring my friend. Izuku soon smiled again and nodded before placing his palm down for me to climb on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Izuku carried me to the kitchen, he found a note saying his mom had gone out for errands and left breakfast prepared. On the table was a plate for Izuku and a small bowl for me. I had a bucket's worth of miso soup while Izuku had some toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku then sat in front of the TV, while I sat in his fluffy hair. Izuku beamed as they showed a report of All Might taking down a villian, I however got chills. The angle they showed All Might at made him look like a giant, and I felt like he was going to reach out and grab me. The report ended and izuku made his way back to his room and i jumped to his bed, bouncing as I landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to take a jog. I can turn the TV on for you.\", Izuku offered as he began to gather a workout outfit. Still, if I joined Izuku that would mean I could see his new body up close!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Zu-kun, I was wondering if I could join you.\" Izuku looked confused with the question. \"But Sai, i don't want you to swing around in my pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you could keep me....there.\", I pointed to his chest. Izuku blushed and covered his  pecs. \"Ah!...but..you can get hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zu-kun, Bakugou's put me between his pecs numerous times. He always flexes as hard as he can and I feel fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alright.\", nodding Izuku took off his shirt and I was greeted with his muscles. Under that cute look were toned arms, large pecs, and a clean set of abs. Izuku soon picked me up with his thumb and finger, and bringing me to the top of his pecs he slowly released me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sank into the crevice, and almost immediately the two muscles held me secure in place. This coupled with the warm skin and loud heartbeat, made me feel safe. Izuku then slipped on a white tank top and jacket, sipping it up halfway so that he would still be able to see me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking his way outside Izuku glanced at me again, I simply smiled and nodded. Izuku smiled and began his jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran I began to feel the effects. The pecs would squeeze me occasionally, though not much pressure was added. However the sweat that began to leak down onto me led to some problems, as the sweat made me begin to slip down the crevice. Luckily Izuku stopped for a break and seeing me slip, panicked slightly before readjusting me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my freckled friend jogged, reality began to set in. The heartbeat, that smile, and kindness would all be gone soon. Izuku could be going to U.A, while I'm off to a ordinary high school where I would potentially meet more bullies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could have applied to the other classes of U.A, but I didn't have much knowledge fit for the departments. The only option would be the Hero Course, but there's no way that's possible! <br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nArriving back at the apartment, Izuku headed to the bathroom. He turned the sink on just enough that water was dripping out for me to wash myself with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around as Izuku undressed, and hearing the curtain close and water start to run, I look at the plastic shower curtain. I could see the outline of Izuku scrubbing his tired muscles and even his cute butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually we both finished washing up and went back to Izuku's room. While he put on casual clothes I had to wear my uniform as it was the only thing that fit. Izuku sat criss crossed, while I sat on his thigh. He told me how he had been training and got help from \"someone special\", well that explains the muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought of my earlier worries. If being in the Hero course meant not only being with my friend, but also starting new. The least I could was try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zu-kun. I have to tell you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. What is it Sai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathed in, before looking into the concerned eyes of my friend. \"Izuku.....i want to take the entrance exam too!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku looked shocked at my proclamation. \"Sai are you serious!? I thought you didn't want to attend the Hero course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but... I don't want to to go to a different school. It wouldn't be the same without you or even Bakugou. So I'm going to try to get in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku's eyes began to tear up before he scooped me up and gave the biggest of hugs. He gave a closed eye smile, as I embraced him the best I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at a stray All Might poster staring triumphantly at us, I wondered if I could get over my fear by going to U.A.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nIn the time left before the exam, me and Izuku trained together as hard as possible. We rotated between a regular workout at normal size, and attempting to control my quirk better at small size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI soon gained some control by calculating my energy. By concentrating hard enough I could shrink and grow back, but if I used up all my energy I will automatically shrink again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile we trained, I attempted to know more about Izuku's trainer. But he always seem nervous and said they want to keep their identity private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after months of anticipation, the exam was here and after a rude welcoming by Bakugou and Izuku nearly falling, we made it inside. Things immediately started off bad when hero Present Mic came out and I was the only one who clapped, though I did get a cheerful thumbs up from the loud hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the challenge came for us to get points by fighting the robots. I was able to take three down by shrinking myself with a concealed knife, and cutting the wires from inside. Still after the third point, I began to feel tired and couldn't risk shrinking or I'd be stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was brought out of my thoughts when I saw the 0 pointer and Izuku running towards it! I threw away my knife, unaware of it hitting more robots. I soon saw Izuku jump and use a....quirk!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the robot was destroyed and Izuku was saved and taken to be looked at, i tried to find my weapon but with no luck.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nBack at Izuku's home I tried to cheer him up with a foot rub, but even that didn't do anything. While I felt defeated, i couldn't help but feel a tinge of hope would fall on us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we went to bed, I walked up the pillow to Izuku's sleeping face and gave a light peck on his nose. Smiling and curling up to his warm cheek.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nAfter some time, I received my letter from U.A, and since my parents were once again gone in a trip, I went to Izuku's. Arriving I was surprised when he happily informed me he was accepted. I soon opened my package and watched in surprise as All Might appeared in a suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings young Hudo! I'm here to inform you that your exam was a success! You managed to take down 5 eniemes alone, but it was that sixth shot that made the robot malfunction and detonate the remaining ones! I look forward to seeing you start your hero academia!\", and with that All Might vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku was excited and all I could do was jump off a chair and shrink, making simulated skydiving. Izuku though panicked, laughed and caught me in his palm.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nIt was soon the first day of high school and me and Izuku walked to school in the U.A uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn my first day I was.......</span></div></div>",

The tiny said, trying to cheer up Izuku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freckled giant gave a small grin at his friend's words. \"Ok...I'll think of something for us to do\". He still felt waves of nervousness hit him. All the training he did with All Might, his chance to become a hero. Everything was at stake for Izuku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter turning off his lamp, Izuku gently scooped up and placed Sai on his pillow before laying his head down next to him. When Izuku was with his tiny friend, he felt better. Sai would stand up for him if Bakugou tried anything, and face humilation at a tiny size as a result. But when Sai was small, Izuku found he liked it.

Over the years of knowing Sai, Izuku saw that no matter how much he was humiliated the tiny still acted strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drifted to sleep he wondered what being in Sai's shoes was like.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n(Izuku's nightmare)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a playground, a familar scene was playing out. Though much different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-kacchan don't hurt him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA younger Izuku had his fists raised, ready to defend the grade schooler behind him. A major difference was that Izuku was looking up at a giant Bakugou while being a mere speck on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young Bakugou smirked, punching his fist into his palm. \"You trying to be a hero Deku? I don't even need to use my quirk to crush a bug like you!\" The ash blond grinned sinisterly as the shadow of his sneaker covered Izuku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bakugou and his cronies walked off laughing, Izuku layed bruised in the center of a sneaker imprint.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing trying to get into U.A Deku?!\", Bakugou yelled at the small head poking out of his fist. Izuku nervously sweated as his bully's hot breath blasted him. \"You trying to get squished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Izuku could attempt to reply, he was thrown onto the seat of a discarded chair in the classroom. As he got his bearings, the freckled boy was covered in a shadow. Looking up he paled as he saw Bakugou's backside facing him and the blond smirking down at him. \"Guess I got to put you in your fuckin place again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku could only watch as his bully's large rump began to lower and cover his sky.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"Young man! Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis moment could've gone better. Izuku had been saved from a villainous sludge by his idol All Might! Unfortunately the shock of the situation made him shrink. Now the smiling hero was looking for the boy in confusion, unaware that with each step he almost crushes izuku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing unlucky in finding him, All Might signs his notebook before leaping away, leaving Izuku to mope.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n\"Kacchan! AGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his bully being consumed by the same slime monster, Izuku had started to run to him. This was prevented as the large hero Death Arms snatch him up in a fist before he could go far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young man it's too dangerous, especially if your this small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku tried to escape the fist, but the hero didn't budge in the slightest. Luckily All Might appeared and saved Baugou from harm. While Bakugou was being praised, Izuku was being scolded. This scolding from Death Arms was the biggest humilation yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the scolding came discipline. That discipline, being squashed beneath the blue clad ass of Death Arms, all while he casually talked and added pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now young man, I hope you learned your lesson. If I see you attempt this again, I just may have to keep you for the day.\", the hero sternly said as he peeled Izuku of the sweaty butt fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(End of nightmare)<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nIzuku stirred, the reality of Sai's problems hit him at full force. Being stomped, sat on, and having a fear of heroes was something he didn't want on a daily basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzuku soon......</span></div></div>",

You shrunk yourself again Hudo! Guess you really like being in your place!\", Bakugou mocked crouching down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shut up Bakugou! Can you just go get a teacher?\", I pleated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou just snorted before bringing his hand down, grabbing me in a fist. There was a firm amount of pressure and I could feel his sweat began to soak my clothes. As he stood up again, he brought me to eye level looking at me with his signature pissed off face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no! Deku pissed me off and feeling you beneath me is sure to cheer me up!\", Bakugou said smirking at the end. He began to make his way home and all I could do was pathetically struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Bakugou, my parents are going to won-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up Hudo! You damn well know your parents are almost never home! In fact, you're going to spend the week with me!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only cringe as the fist holding me tightened. I wonder when my life began to face humilation on a daily basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe when Bakugou began using me as his insole, purposely leaning on one foot to crush me. Or putting me between his pecs when he worked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the U.A entrance exams are coming up, and who knows what will happen once we don't go to the same school.<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nEntering his home there was silence, with the exception of a door being slammed. Walking into the home it was clear Bakugou's parents must have been out as his mother hadn't come out and yelled at him for slamming the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to his couch, there sat a table in front of it. Finally unclenching his fist, Bakugo rolled me onto the surface of the table. The explosive blond loomed over me smirking as i layed covered in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna change then we can get started\", Bakugo said making his way to his room. He suddenly stopped and looked back at me with a sneer. \"If you move from that table, your gonna spend the evening under my ass!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou brought his smirking face down to me, causing me to back away a little. \"And I had spicy curry for lunch\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard gurgles coming from Bakugou's stomach, causing him to snicker and pat his abs before leaving the room. Leaving me alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew better then to attempt an escape. Bakugou didn't mess around with his threats. Being shoved in his armpit taught me that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, thinking over my relationship with my bully. I had been teased for my quirk but none had taken it as far as Bakugou. Some would hover their foot over me to mock me, but Bakugo didn't hesitate to bring his down. I couldn't help but memorize all the insults he threw at me, or stomped into me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! Hudo you a hero? A villian would just squash you and get away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised Deku hasn't crushed you yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only both you and Deku were small, then I could crush two bugs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to rise to the top! And when I do All Might's going to be next to me congratulating me, while you a bug stand beneath us! Who knows? Maybe All Might will pity you and give you the honour of being crushed by him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather it be his insults or my unlucky encounters with him and others, my whole life purpose seems to revolve around being shrunk and humiliated. It even keeps me up at night with all the nightmares I get. <br>\r\n --------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n(Sai's Nightmare)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat on the concrete road. People were on the sidewalk cheering for the two titans looming over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou stood decked out in his hero outfit I'd seen from the sketches he'd drawn. Next to him stood All Might. From my view, his face was slightly covered by his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young Bakugou, you've risen to the top and have proven yourself worthy of being the #1 hero!\", All Might cheered placing a hand on Bakugou's shoulder. Bakugou smirked before bringing his gaze down to me, causing All Might to look down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Young Hudo you've decided to join us!\", All Might brought his hand down and scooped me up into his colossal palm. On the way up, I passed his toned legs, hard abs, and firm pecs. Finally I stopped in front his strong piercing eyes. I've never felt more like a speck intill now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to thank you! With your contribution to young Bakugou, it fueled his desire to become a hero!\", My contribution was being forced to worship him!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, I believe I shall award you for your help\", All Might placed me back on the ground, towering over me again. I noticed Bakugou still smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...hat Do you mean award?\", I began to get nervous as All Might cracked his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why giving you the honour of being crushed by me!\", All Might smiled not seeming bothered by his statement at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Might didn't hesitate as he lifted his right foot, hovering the white sole over me. My sky was filled with a giant boot and the faces of two titans, one smiling and one smirking while giving a mock wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then Young Hudo, I'll sent you off with my new attack! Florida smash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white sole blocked the two faces and came down fast. I could only blink as I was flattened into the ground with a crunch.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nThat dream really shook me up. It made me feel nervous whenever I saw any news of All Might. If I ever did meet the hero I wonder if he would be different compared to my dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had other dreams, such as a male with no nose saying I was a fake hero and squishing me under his steel-toed shoe. And even weird ones, like Endeavor mocking me and then swallowing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was brought out of my reminiscing when Bakugou re-entered the room wearing black pants and no shirt, showing off his toned arms, abs, and pecs. I couldn't help but blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in front of me, he looked more calm then before. \"Alright Hudo, do what you do best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying that Bakugou then.......</span></div></div>",

They had traces of dirt and sweat running down them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing better then to refuse, I walked forward and began rubbing the rough soles. The smelly flesh rose above me like a house and it took me a while just to finish massaging Bakugou's heel. Moving up, his sole became softer but more sweaty. The moist flesh gave into my fingers as I rubbed them, releasing their tension. The whole time I worshipped Bakugou's feet, drops of his sweat kept falling on me like rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I arrived at his toes and could see all of them spread apart. As i cleaned the gunk between his toes, I saw Bakugou with arms draped over the back of the couch and his eyes closed. He seem to be in pleasure as I heard him hum in satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I climbed down the foot, I felt myself falling backwards and land on the table. As i sat up, I noticed a shadow begin to cover me. Looking up, I saw the sole I just cleaned coming down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole squished me into the table, I felt the foot flesh envelope me in it's smell and warmth as it grinded me side to side. The pressure increased and as the foot rose I found myself stuck before falling back to the table. I heard laughing and looking between his feet, I saw Bakugou smirking and cracking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Hudo, you know I never miss a chance to crush you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing at my humilation, I began to walk over to the other foot to repeat the process. Rubbing his foot again, I began to think. While Bakugou could be cruel and seemingly only saw my life as something to fill with his stomps and taunts. I couldn't help but....admire him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trained hard and when he had goals he never gave up, always going intill he won. And him towering over me and raising his foot while smirking was.....hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at his toes again, I stopped my rubbing and I'm not sure what compiled me but i gave a kiss to Bakugou's big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking between his big and second toe I saw Bakugou look at me in surprise. Perhaps it's because I kissed him without him ordering me too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou soon....</span></div></div>",

Not make out with them like their your FUCKING GIRLFRIEND!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...i...ke....it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Speak the fuck up bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID I LIKE THEM!\", feeling a sudden boost of energy, I began to let out my feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like when you stomp me, I like smelling your feet, i like when you loom over me, I love being smooshed between your muscles! Heck I even like when you squash me under your ass and blast me with your hot FUMES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I'm saying is, I like worshipping you Bakugou!\", I finished finally taking in a breath after my rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at his face, Bakugou had a look of shock on his face and his blush darkened. After looking at each for a while longer, Bakugou \"tched\" and reached over with his other hand to grab the remote and turn on the TV. The fingers holding me lowered me down to his waist, just below his abs. Sitting on the warm skin, I turned to look up at Bakugou only to see him put his hands behind his head and watch the news. He wasn't ordering me to start rubbing his muscles, so I layed back onto the hill size ab and listened to the sound of his stomach rumbling.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n(No one's POV) <br>\r\nAs Bakugou watched the boring reports on the screen, he glanced down to Sai laying against his abs. The shrunken boy's reveal seem to ponder him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all the years he'd known him, Bakugou only knew Sai as a bug. Someone beneath him that he could literally crush. Bakugou always relished in having Sai treat him as some sort of god to serve and be humiliated by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the only one who took teasing Sai to the extreme. As he threatened anyone who tried to get him to worship them, claiming \"i'm was the only one who get's to crush Hudo!\". Which was....slightly noble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Bakugou saw the newest villian being taken down by All Might, and looking at Sai, he saw him stiffen as footage showed the #1 hero. He smirked, knowing how his taunts affected Sai's feelings about the Hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat may have been nightmares to Sai, where simpe dreams to Bakugo.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n(Bakugou's dreams) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 .Hudo and Deku both stood the size of specks in front All Might, The hero loomed over them like a god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All Might! All Might! Down here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero brought his gaze down to the two dots making squeaking sounds from the front of his boot. Raising an eyebrow, All Might simply lifted his boot up and brought it down onto the \"bugs\" with a satisfying crunch. Grinding the tip of his boot into the ground, and leaving only a small red smear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 .All Might crouched down, before leaping into the air. As the two specks looked around in confusion, as they noticed the area they were in getting darker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up Hudo and Deku gasped upon seeing All Might coming down from above, his large blue spandex rear positioned over them! With a BOOM, All Might landed on the two boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up however, there wasn't any red splatters in the butt imprint. Rather two panicked voices cryed out from in between  the two large cheeks. With a triumphed laugh, All Might clenched his cheeks and went on his way, taking with him two fans that would forever feel the pressure of their hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nOf course, Bakugo experienced other dreams. Such as him being tiny too, but sitting on All Might shoulder. Or All Might reaching down, grabbing Hudo and Deku and either crushing them between his pecs or even throwing them in his mouth saying they'll make great protein. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, hearing Sai's confession and looking at him sitting calmly on his waist, makes Bakugou feel different somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nIt soon got late and Bakugou let out a yawn. Luckily there was no school tomorrow, so he could sleep in and get some training down in preparation for the entrance exam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down again, Bakugou's eyes widened as he saw the tiny's form. Sai layed curled up against his ab, evenly breathing and fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his first instinct was to simply grab Sai. He held back for some reason, and slowly slide his hand under Sai and lifted him up. Turning off the TV, Bakugou began to make his way to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered his room Bakugo climbed into his bed, and rather then shove Sai in a sock like usual. He layed him on his nude left pectoral. Sai shifted slightly before curly up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell am I doing?!\", Bakugou thought looking at Sai. \"Well at least he's sleeping peacefully. Wait! What the fuck am I going on about!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing heavily, Bakugou closed his eyes wanting to clear his head with some sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Sai woke up to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up feeling a large weight poking my back. As i uncurled from my ball, I felt the warm and smooth ground shift slightly. Looking around i found a strange pink mount to my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flinched at hearing the sudden voice. Looking up, I saw Bakugou staring at me. I then realized that the pink mount was his nipple and I was on his pectoral. Feeling my face heat up, I sat in a seiza stance before looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou then placed his hand behind me, before sitting up in his bed. I readjusted myself as he brought the palm to his face. Luckily he looked more calm then usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hudo. All that stuff you said yesterday. Was it true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lowered my gaze to the palm as I blushed. \"Yeah...it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know when it happened but...i just started to like the smell of your feet. And when ever...you loomed over me, I thought you looked.....hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore went into it though. I think maybe because Bakugou always meant to stomp me. Whenever students, teachers, and even my own father stomped me, it was on accident. But whenever Bakugo saw me tiny, he'd give that hot smirk and march over to stomp me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth be told....when you go to U.A, I'm gonna miss servicing you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly felt my chin get lifted up. Bakugo placed his finger under my chin, his eyes were squinted slightly in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me that sad crap Hudo! You know even when I'm up on top, I'm still gonna need your foot rubs! \", Bakugou ranted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI widened my eyes at his words. \"You...mean it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! With all the shit I have to face, feeling you beneath me always makes me relax! Hmm, actually I've got a good idea! While I become the #1 hero, you can become the #1 foot messager!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou gave a cocky grin. \"Definitely! I can see a line of people, all waiting for you to worship them. Give em a real power boost!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt more happy by his words. I liked worshipping giants, and I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy a little guy making them feel big. Though I might need to make a male only limitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright enough of this sentimental crap! I gotta burn some sweat and get in shape for the exam!\", saying that Bakugou grabbed me with his thumb and finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought me to the top of his pectoral crevice. Letting go, I slide between the two muscles. I soon stopped as Bakugou gave a pec squeeze. I heard the powerful heartbeat and felt the skin warm me up as he made his way out of the room, making sure to give a flex to squeeze me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once I didn't feel mad about being taken by Bakugou. If anything I was the most happy I've been in a while. Now I was excited to join a workout session with the ash-blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Bakugou was going to.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sai trembled as Bakugou's angered face filled his vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck was that Hudo?!\", Bakugou yelled, his hot breath blowing Sai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....was licking your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger and thumb holding the tiny tightened, causing him to grunt in pain. \"Bullshit! I know what licking feels like, and that was a kiss you planted on my toe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou stood up from the couch, before looking at Sai with a sneer. \"If you wanna kiss me so bad, you can kiss my ass!\". Bakugou then turned around and released Sai, causing him to plummet to the couch below. The tiny yelled as he fell, landing on the cushion with an \"Oaf!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Sai sat up, he noticed the area around him darken. Looking up, his eyes widened as he saw Bakugou's black-clad ass falling onto him! Sai could only blink as the firm glutes squashed him into the couch. Sai pathetically cried out, as the hot muscles swished him around, applying pressure to silence his cries. He soon was sucked up into the crack between Bakugou's cheeks, only stopping because of the pants. The cheeks suddenly squeezed, crushing Sai between the musky flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou meanwhile, had turned the TV on, placed his feet back on the table, and threw his arms over the back of the couch. He paid little attention to the TV, focusing rather on the squirming he felt between his ass cheeks. Bakugou smirked as he clenched his butt and bounced, crushing Sai more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou soon felt his stomach begin to gurgle. Grinning evilly and smacking his abs, the blond got an idea. Leaning over to his side, Bakugou lifted up his right leg. Sai saw a peek of light from the crack and sighed in relief. The feeling soon turned to dread as he heard a rumbling sound and felt the cheeks holding him begin to vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bakugou! Wai-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFRRRRRRRRT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai gagged as a hot wind blasted him and assaulted his nostrils. Bakugou laughed loudly before clenching his cheeks again. \"HAHA! Like my hot air Hudo!?\". Before Sai could speak, another blast hit him just like an explosion. \"Hm! Yeah get a good whiff bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front of Bakugou's pants began to grow with each blast of gas. Bakugou smirked as he lowered his leg and relaxed, causally farting ever other moment on Sai. The bully relished in the tiny's torment, like a drug it was a high for him. Feeling Sai squirm beneath him like an insect was one of the greatest pleasures he could ever expirance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing more gas Bakugou sighed. \"If only Deku was a bug too!\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n(Sai's POV)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groaned as another stinky blast hit me. I felt my nostrils burning and my eyes tearing up. I could only lay in humilation as my giant bully assaulted me with his gas. Is this my life's purpose? Was I born with this quirk just to be humiliated for the pleasure of others? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back on my life, I'm convinced that theory is true.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear do you know where Sai is?\", my father said while shifting in his seat. Unaware I was beneath his dressed pant-clad butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Hudo-Kun, I don't mind sitting here.\", Izuku said holding me. Even though I knew he wanted to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hudo-Kun this is the fifth time you've been late!\", my teacher scolded, looking down at me panting between his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sai kiddo, maybe it be best that you go into a different career.\", my father told me when he saw me stuck to the sole of his leather shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for joining me on that jog Hudo!\", Bakugou smirked leaning on the foot I was trapped under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting sat on and stomped by my dad and others, really must be a divine sign. My dreams must have been true, getting crushed by All Might means that I really can't become a hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I layed defeated, getting blasted by Bakugou's farts. Waiting for his next round of torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugou then........</span></div></div>",

I wasn't in front of the school anymore! I was on a sidewalk and to my right a weed grew from s crack in the concrete. However before I could observe the area more a felt the ground shake and suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What kind of bug is that?\", you heard a voice boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up i was shocked to see Bakugo and his two \"backups\". But unlike before the bully looming over me resembled a grade schooler. I saw a young Bakugo in the old photos izuku showed me and the blonde before perfectly mirrored the child. Even at a young age they still look down at me like an ant to snuff out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bakugo! Hurry up and kill it!\"<br>\r\n\"What! Hell no I'm not getting guts all over my shoe!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shutter as i watch Bakugo swivel his foot into the grass. I'm starting to wonder how I can get out of another potential trample time. Suddenly i feel the ground rumbling again before..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground beneath me shook with the force a earthquake, causing me to fall onto my rear. As i look over I notice the weed growing out of the crack now was flattened by a huge..yellow..boot<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up i find All Might now donning his hero costume. His costume put his muscles on display and never have i felt more small. Still All Might was here again and this time I won't freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All Might! Down here!\", I shouted and waved my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Might brought his gaze down but it was aimed behind me at Bakugo and his group. \" Have to fear young heroes! For I am HERE!\", All Might beamed brandishing his smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugo and his group cheered at the hero's arrival, All I could do was pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me young heroes, what seems to be the problem\" <br>\r\n\"It's this bug All Might! It's bothering us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paled more then possible. Looking up i saw All Might finally set his gaze on me. I also saw Bakugo giving me the same look he gave before putting his foot into the same sock I was In. A toothy smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Might raised his brow a little as he bended down bringing his hulking form closer as his striking eyes gazed at me. I prayed that he recognize a human and not a insect. Finally All Might rose back up to his titan height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is certainly a strange insect you found\". Oh no... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then young heroes! How do you propose we deal with this villian?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should throw him in the trash!\"<br>\r\n\"We should see what's inside it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakugo's smirk suddenly grew even bigger as he spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SMASH him with you're boot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Might's head perked up at this. \"SMASH with my boot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Snuff out the villian beneath you're sole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Ha! Right you are my boy! Then I won't delay any further!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Might set his gaze you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now villian, your evil ends here. I shall squash your evil with justices stomp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Might's toned right leg suddenly began to rise. The clean white sole of his boot hung over me waiting to be stained. I was frozen in fear. Bakugo was right All Might doesn't see a human, he sees a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! Prepare to be crushed with justice!\",All Might yelled clenchin his fists and bringing his foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seem to go in slow motion for me. I saw All Might's triumph face be blocked by his sole. The large heel came towards me as one last sound echoed in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSQUELCH</span></div></div>",

But I was one of the people who didn't look at Endeavour in such a positive light, despite his large arrest rating and villain defeats he had to his name, he was still brash and unfriendly to most people who came across him, not to mention the large amounts of property damage and injuries that often occurred when he was involved. There were also whispers among some secretive chat rooms about his behind closed doors activities, but he had the money and influence to keep any claims from becoming to public. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite frankly, I thought he was an Asshole<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut currently, he was an Asshole who towered above my insect like form, and looked even more intimidating than normal, his fire covered hair and beard flickering in the soft breeze, arms crossed and eyes narrowed forward in an almost glare like expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to be looking at someone beyond the gate, but I couldn't make out who it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the crunch of his boots shift on the ground, I looked up and around hastily, trying to see if there was anyone, ANYONE! Else around who could help me, but saw no one in the immediate area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a split second decision, my body began moving as I ran towards Endeavour and leapt up onto his boot (<i>which thankfully wasn't covered in fire at the moment) </i>as he started walking. Gripping the leather as much as I could, which was luckily made easier from the tiny almost invisible scratch and scuff marks which to me made great points of purchase. Endeavour continued walking at a stiff pace, making me jostle around as I struggled to stand, waiting for his boot to come down to the ground again before taking off into a sprint and gripping the leg of it, grabbing hold of the nearest lace which to me looked like a large chord which I could grip with both arms, I began to make the climb upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing and free running were skills I had picked up over the years, mostly as a means of traversing around while shrunken....not that it did much good in some cases, especially when Bakugou would move faster than I could move and I often wound up under his shoe or in some rare cases, on his chair before being smothered under his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah! That's were worthless insects like you belong you little shit!\"</i> I could hear his voice echo in my head, before shaking it off and continuing to climb upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long I had made it up to the opening of his boot, gripping the edge and pulling myself up, gripping his pant leg to steady myself as I looked up once more, there was still a way to go, though maybe if you could find a spot where you could be felt? Which was unlikely as his hero costume's material, while having some give to your tiny size was relatively skin tight, showing off each of the Number 2's bulging and defined muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you contemplated what to do next, you were suddenly caught off guard as.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though it was a side effect of his quirk that his feet also would sweat more than normal, the same nitro glycerine infused liquid that his hands produced, though luckily he couldn't ignite the ones around his feet or else I'm sure I would have suffered even more under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumbling sound caught my attention as I struggled to move once more, the sounds of the outside world muffled through the exterior of the boot as Endeavour kept walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough after a few more seconds he came to a halt and I could feel the surroundings again shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he feel me!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to wiggle again as much as I could, I felt a surge of hope well up inside as light poked through as Endeavour once again shifted his boot, his foot sliding up slightly and freeing me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, freeing me from being trapped against his calf, as I fell down further and onto the moist spongey insole,  taking a moment to cough and gag at the moist feeling of landing on a bed of his foot sweat and absorbed odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up I was aware that I could now see, the first thing the still dimmed light showed me was the dark imprints of Endeavour's  toes and heel inside the giant (to me) boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up towards the opening, my eyes widened as.... </span></div></div>",

You agree with a nod. \u201cSWEET! thanks little guy I really appreciate it!\u201d. Ban reaches over to his boots unzips them and pulls them off revealing 2 size 15 feet and releasing a rank odor into the air. Ban relaxes putting his arms behind his head and putting both feet in front of your tiny being. \u201cWell get to it little guy\u201d ban tells  you in a demanding tone. You put both feet on bans huge left foot and start to massage at the sweaty walls of flesh. \u201cAhhh yeah your little hands feel amazing on my sore feet little guy, keep it up.\u201d You wish you could be enjoying this as much as ban was but it was honestly a horrible experience. His feet where wet and greasy with sweat and the smell they radiated was toxic, but you couldn\u2019t tell that to the man that saved your life. After a while of being at bans feet he ask for something else. \u201cHey your little hands would probably fell much better on my back, can you massage that next for me. You where relieved to hear that you had an escape from ban\u2019s smelly stompers so you accepted his proposal. Ban laid down on his stomach before picking you up and placing you on his muscular back. You had to admit this was much better than being at his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s it little guy that\u2019s the spot oh yeah\u201d ban groaned and moaned showing your obviously doing a fine job. Bam eventually got bored of his treatment and grants you a job well done. \u201cWell little guy I gotta say you did a much better job than I expected you to do hehe\u201d. \u201cOh I just remembered I never got your name\u201d. You proceeded to tell him your name before he cuts you off. \u201cAhh don\u2019t worry about it your names not important anyways, From now on I\u2019m going to refer to you as SLAVE, and I\u2019m your new MASTER\u201d. Slave?!?!, master?!?! You had no idea what ban had planned for you but it didn\u2019t sound good at all. \u201cWhile you where serving me I did a little thinking, since I found you that technically makes you my mine and since I have plenty of friends I don\u2019t need any more but I DO need a slave that I can commanded around and since your mine now I decided YOU can fill that spot\u201d. You waited to see if ban was joking with you but he just looked at you. \u201c HELLO?!?! Slave I\u2019m talking to you do you understand I\u2019m your master and you will do whatever I tell you weather you like it or not and if you don\u2019t I will squish you like a big hahah\u201d. Now bug which is it will you.....</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t want to be his slave forever but you also didn\u2019t want to be crushed under his huge stinking foot so you go with the option that does not result in death. \u201cThat\u2019s it slave I knew you\u2019d see it my way haha\u201d. \u201cNow I\u2019m guessing your really hungry after massaging me for the last hour and half but luckily for you i have some delicious food I\u2019ve been preparing all week that you can eat hehe\u201d. Your master was right, you where really hungry after not eating for such a long time and you where glad he was being so generous. Ban set you down infornt of his foot and places the sloe of his foot on the mattress so his toes where right Infront of you. \u201cClose your eyes slave your meal is a surprise\u201d ban was acting strangely and you had a bad felling about your \u201cspecial meal\u201d. \u201cNow open slave\u201d. You opened your eyes and saw ban holding open his two first toes exposing mountains of gooey slimy toe-jam. \u201cHehe bon appetit slave, this toe jam has been being preparing between my toes inside my boots for the entire week and your going to eat it all hehe hope you enjoy\u201d. He can\u2019t be serious!!! He really expects you to eat his gross cheesy toe jam no way! Aww what\u2019s wrong slave does it not look delicious, well you won\u2019t know till you try it so get eating or else\u201d. Your masters tone switched from childish to serious he wasn\u2019t kidding. You approach your masters toes and swallowing your pride you push your face into bans cheesy toe junk and get a mouthful.\u201cGood boy slave now chew and swallow and tell me how it taste\u201d. Your tongue feels like it\u2019s going to rot inside your mouth. The salty slimy goo tastes horrid and it makes you sick. \u201cWell slave how does it taste\u201d. I fear of making your master upset you tell him it\u2019s delicious. \u201cHaha I\u2019m sure it is anything form your master is delicious, and since you like it so much eat it all from my toe gap\u201d ban says spreading his toes once more for easy access. You put your face into the junk and ban closes his toes on your head to ensure you eat all his cheese toe jam. The mixture of sweat,dirt, and dead skin from bans toes makes your stomach upset. And the odor coming from the toes is much worse than what you experienced with his soles. The cheese vinegary odor mixed with the salty taste and the slimy texture makes the takes almost impossible but you feared what would happen if you didn\u2019t comply. You where almost done eating all the \u201cfood\u201d until ban opened his toes and yells. \u201cLOOK OUT BELOW HAHA\u201d. Before you could react you along with bans toe jam where drenched in something slimy and slightly yellow, it was SPIT! \u201cHehe you looked thirsty so I thought ide give you something to drink while you ate\u201d. Now not only did you have to finish the toe cheese you now had to lick up the loogie he spit on his foot. After a few more minutes you finally consumed all the toe jam and spit ban released you from his toe gap and examined it. \u201cWow nice job slave, you really cleaned your plate and since you liked it that much you can have it for every meal unless I prepare something else for you haha\u201d. You groaned at his statement. You couldn\u2019t imagine eating his toe jam 3 times a day for the rest of your life. \u201cHmmm what can we do next\u201d ban says putting his hands over his head thinking. </span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t respond to your masters words you just stared at him in disbelief. \u201cAlright I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s a yes hehe get ready\u201d. Before you could react ban swiped you up and set you on a chair next to his bed. You look up and see nothing but your masters ass covered by his tight red and silvers pants. \u201cHere it comes slave uuuuhhhh\u201d you can her ban straining hard to make sure he pushes out a good one. \u201cPFFtFPpFtP\u201d, ooooooh yeah slave get a whiff of that\u201d the devastating blast of ass gas throws you off balance and you fall over holding your nose. Before you could recollect yourself ban warns you. \u201cI\u2019m not done yet bug here comes another one\u201d then another ten second blast came out his hole. \u201cOhhh yeah slave that\u2019s the captains cooking for ya how does it smell hehe\u201d. Your masters farts were toxic. The extreme stench of spicy rotten eggs was burning your nostrils and making your eyes water. \u201cHere slave I want you to taste this one, OPEN YOUR MOUTH!\u201d Before you knew it ban lowered his entire ass on you and you\u2019re now open mouth was directly under his hole. \u201cPrepare yourself slave this will be the worse one YET.\u201d You heard ban Grunt and push until he released a 14 second long fart that smelled horrible and tasted even worse. The toxic gas tasted worse than it smelt and entered your throat causing you to gag and cough Intensely. \u201cHAHA wow I Can smell it from up here, it must be horrible for you down there HAHAH.\u201d Ban was in hysterics while he watched you choke on his vile gas. \u201cHahah oh man that was awesome now you know to never eat the captains cooking or you will have gas like me haha\u201d. The putrid scent was starting to fade and you were re gaining composure when ban picked you up in one and and grabbed one of his boots on the other. He held you close to his face while he talked to you. \u201cWell slave after getting those farts out my system and since we both have full stomachs how about we go train for a while\u201d your masters said as he blew his bad breath in your face. You didn\u2019t like the sound of training with ban but I doubt You had a choice. Ban gave you a smirk and dropped you inside his sweaty overused footwear. \u201cYour to small to train agains me but I can\u2019t leave you alone and you seem to really like my foot so you can spend time with it hehe\u201d you try to run to the front of the boot but end up being trapped under ban\u2018s toes. Ban put on his other boot and goes downstairs into the tavern where he found the others sins. \u201cHEY BAN!\u201d Yelled meliodas \u201cnice to see you ban\u201d said king. \u201cHey guys I was about to go training either of you wanna join me\u201d. \u201cSure ban I will said\u201d.....</span></div></div>",

You could hear the muffled voice above but couldn\u2019t tell who it was. \u201cAlright sounds like a plan captain let\u2019s go outside so we don\u2019t break anything\u201d. \u201cYeah that\u2019s probably the best idea and we can go all out like old times\u201d. You didn\u2019t like the sound of ban and another sin sparing with each other, that means ban will be sweating a lot while your in his boots. Ban and meliodas when outside on top of a hill where no one was around. \u201cPhew captain it\u2019s hot out here\u201d. \u201cYeah but that\u2019s even better now we can work up a good sweat!\u201d \u201cAlright captain don\u2019t hold back!\u201d \u201cOh don\u2019t worry ban I wasn\u2019t planning to!\u201d. There was a sudden movement, you could tell ban and the other one have begun there spare. In a mere matter of second the heat in bans boot increased and the stench got worse by the second. Ban and meliodas spar didn\u2019t slow down, they threw everything they had at each other pushing themselves to the limit but that was bad news for you. In the boot you where being smothered by ban\u2019s sweaty smelly toes. The boot absorbed most of the sweat but that didn\u2019t stop any from soaking your clothes and getting in your mouth, and unfortunately you couldn\u2019t escape the intense cheese odor that was consuming your senses. The heat outside made the boys sweaty terrible and you where getting the full experience of ban\u2019s. At one point in the battle ban must have forgot you where in his boot cause he kicked meliodas and that caused his toes to release you from their prison and now your underneath his sloe which was kinda a upgrade but still very smelly and sweaty. You noticed their battle came to a pause when both ban and the other one started talking. \u201cWow ban your really got stronger I gotta say I\u2019m impressed\u201d. \u201cYeah well I\u2019ve been training on my own for a while, say you wanna call it a day I got something cool to show you\u201d. Bans words made you worry, you prayed he wasn't going to show you to whoever he was sparring with. \u201cSure ban, it\u2019s to hot outside to continue anyways\u201d. \u201cAlright cool, come have a seat by me\u201d. Ban set down and the grass and meliodas sat next to him. Melodies got confused when he say ban start to remove his footwear. Once bans foot was released from the boot so was a stench that made meliodas wrinkle his nose. \u201cPhew ban what did you wanna show me besides your smelly feet\u201d. Ban only response was to stick his hand into the smelly footwear. After a while of felling around he found you and pulled you out. \u201cTA-da captain a tiny person!\u201d. Ban brought you out the smelly prison and you got your  first fell of sunlight all day. When your vision got back to normal you noticed the one ban was sparring with was none other than meliodas the dragon sin of wrath and captain of the seven deadly sins. \u201cWow ban that\u2019s AMAZING where did you find him!\u201d Meliodas asked in excitement \u201cwell I was training earlier today and found him on the ground so I brought him home and made him my personal slave till he dies hehe\u201d. \u201cWow that\u2019s  so cool, can we use him\u201d. \u201cWell since your the captain And we both trained really hard I guess I can share him with you, let\u2019s use him....</span></div></div>",

Ban turns to you \u201cHear that slave boy, your gonna be used to clean both ME AND THE CAPTAIN haha\u201d. You saw meliodas take of his shirt to revel his sweat soaked six pack abs and chest. He then takes off both his shoes and ban followed taking of his other boot. \u201cHey ban can I go first, i really wanna try him out heh\u201d. \u201cSure captain use him wherever you want\u201d Ban tosses you over to meliodas who gives you a evil grin before bringing his foot up. \u201cI haven\u2019t cleaned my feet in a long time slave hehe this is gonna be torture for you\u201d meliodas opens if first set of toes runs you threw them like floss making sure you collect any and all sweat and toe jam onto your tiny body. \u201cHahah this feels good ban, I doubt he\u2019s enjoying it tho hehe\u201d. You thinks that\u2019s bad, I made him eat my toe jam AND made him smell my farts after I ate your cooking\u201d. \u201cWow\u201d meliodas says before rubbing you between the second toe gap. \u201cI\u2019m surprised he\u2019s still alive your farts are deadly hehe but not as bad as mine\u201d meliodas says before lifting his leg and letting lose a loud stinky fart\u201d. \u201cEw gross caption that sick!\u201d \u201cHehe I know\u201d. Meliodas finishes cleaning his toes with you and he holds you by your shirt close to his face. Your body is covered him greasy slimy stinky toe jam and it\u2019s disgusting. The taste is always in your mouth and you can smell the cheese odor coming off your clothes. Meliodas sniffs you. \u201cPhew, ban your little slave stinks I think he needs a bath\u201d. \u201cOh don\u2019t worry I will give him one tonight, just make sure you bring me a pair of your used gym sock later\u201d \u201calright whatever you say, and as for you your gonna clean me to\u201d. Meliodas lifts his right arm and with the left and he shoves you into his sweaty greasy arm pit. His pits are WAY worse that his feet, you try to scream but you only get a mouthful of sweat and pit hair for your trouble. He grinds you into the moist cave covering you in pit sweat as well at the toe jam from before. His pits have a more onion and vinegar stench as opposed to the cheese odor his feet gave of. He Uses you to soak up all the sweat from his rank pits but before giving you back to your original master meliodas does one more thing. He holds you in one hand and with the other he reaches into his pants and digs around. Meliodas pulls his and out and sniffs it. \u201cPhew that\u2019s smells even worse than my armpits. \u201cHey ban you mind if I use him to clean my balls and dick\u201d. \u201cYeah I don\u2019t care, just don\u2019t kill him with the smell\u201d. Yeah hear that little guy, sorry about this but I gotta get clean somehow. Meliodas swiftly shoves you into his pants and rubs you all around his sweaty smelly man hood. The rank musk of pure sweat was all you could smell. Meliodas dick was hot and sticky and you could feel it against your skin after a few minutes of rubbing you around his sweaty pubes he pulls you out and brings you to his face.  \u201cWow ban your slave really works wonders, he\u2019s like a little sweat sponge hehe\u201d. \u201cYeah tell me about it, he\u2019s already cleaned my feet so I think I\u2019m just gonna use him to clean my pits.\u201d Meliodas tosses you back to your original master and he immediately grinds you into his armpit the amount of sweat that was drenching your clothes was unbelievable and the smell oh my gawd the smell was so rancid. \u201cHaha drink up slave it\u2019s all the hydration you will get\u201d.

You stumble to your feet and climb on bans ball sac and do what your master demands. You can smell the strong musky odor of bans unwashed manhood and sweaty pubes. \u201cOh yeah slave your good at this, keep it up yeah boy\u201d. Ban continued moaning while but all your efforts into massaging the sticky sweaty appendage. \u201cGet me hard slave lick my head\u201d. You hesitantly make contact with your masters smooth cock head with your tongue tasking the salty flesh. Ohhhh yes you keep it up keep licking your masters huge cock\u201d. Ban was obviously enjoying himself more than you where. Ban\u2019s dick started to grow with pleasure, the veins pulsing can supplying blood to the horny mans growing appendage bans dick finally stopped growing and was now standing at a massive 11inches and now rock hard.  He grasp his massive cock with one and and strokes off. \u201cLick the underside of my shaft while I heel off slave\u201d. Ban demands in a cold tone you push your face into the sticky sweaty flesh and lick up and down and swallowing any sweat you lick up along the way. Ban cock head starts to leak pre-cum and some of the drops splash on your head covering you in gooey seed  bans stroking gets faster and he\u2019s breathing gets heavier. \u201cLICK FASTER SLAVE MAKE YOUR MASER CUM!!!\u201d ban yells before grabbing you in his hand and using you to jerk off pleasing himself. Ban continues to grind you up and down his 11inch hard on, and using he pre-cum has lubricant. You hear your master moan and then let out a few grunts. \u201cOh fuck yeah here it comes slave\u201d. You feel bans dick tense up before he shoots his load of thick slimy cum on his chest and abs, bans stroking slowed down and his dick when soft returning to its original 7inches. \u201cOoh man that felt amazing, your tongue feels so much better than just my hand\u201d. You felt so humiliated, you had been forced to jerk off and worship the manhood of who you thought was a good person. Ban pics you up and places you on his chest. \u201cSlave your master demands you lick the liquid gold of his chest hehe\u201d. You get done on your hands and knees and begin lapping at the salty spunk that covered your masters six pack. While you where licking the remaining seed from bans chest meliodas walked in. \u201cHey ban how you doing\u201d meliodas asked. \u201cI feel better than ever captain ban said with a smirk\u201d. \u201cOh that\u2019s good to hear, well here are the things you asked me for\u201d. \u201cOh thanks, I almost forgot about that\u201d. \u201cAlright I will see you tomorrow ban goodnight\u201d. Meliodas Said before leaving bans room and closing the door. Once ban thought you did a good enough job he took to from his chest and dropped you into an empty beer glass on the desk next to his bed. \u201cSince your master is so kind and you look like you\u2019ve had a long day I\u2019m granting you a nice warm bath\u201d. You where relieved to hear that ban was rewarding you after being so cruel all day. \u201cBut like I said before, the boar hat has no water to spare but luckily for you\u201d. Ban then pulls out both of the socks meliodas wore to workout. \u201cThe captain was kind enough to lend me a pair of his sweat soaked socks\u201d. Ban was holding a pair of black ankle socks that where dripping with sweat from meliodas gym session. Ban gave the the socks a quick sniff and recoiled in disgust \u201cphew oh boy the Captain work out socks can probably kill a grey demon, these things are RANK\u201d. \u201cHehe get ready slave here comes the water works\u201d. You looked up and saw ban holding the socks over the top of the glass before he began ringing them out. Before you knew it the glass was filing with the foot sweat from meliodas socks. The glass was filling by the second and soon you where waist deep the the salty liquid. \u201cGeez how much does this guy sweat\u201d. Ban continued to wring all the sweat out into the glass before you where fully submerged in the salty liquid and the glass was about half way full. \u201cThere ya go slave a nice warm salt water bath haha, I will take you out in the morning goodnight for now and have fun\u201d. Ban them used the damp socks to cover the top of the glass and turned of the lights leaving you there in a dark,wet,smelly prison till tomorrow </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your name is Virgil, a 19 year old peasant who lives alone. You've had aspirations of becoming a holy knight but they are only pipe dreams, having the body of a starving child and the courage of a cowardly lion making it very hard to even try to become one. Instead you do odd jobs to make a living, gaining just income to get by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this rather normal day in Liones, you went out to the market just to get some food. Packed as usual, you maneuvered through the crowd, trying not to barge into anyone to hard as the last thing you would want is to cause a scene. You eventually got to the food section, stocked with bread, fruits and various meats. Deciding whether you wanted more meat or fruit, you were interrupted by a rather short man, cloaked in a brown coat with a hat concealing his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey squirt would you like to make a quick buck, looks like you need the money,\" the main stated, eyeing off your tattered shirt, one strap holding up your baggy pants and lack of shoes. You look down, not really wanting to buy into this man trick but he pulls out a sack of gold, smiling while shaking it a little in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine what is it that you want,\" you asked only for the man to grab your hand, pulling you through the crowd into a house, presumably his. He gestures you to sit down, walking into his kitchen, the sounds of water boiling filling your ears as you sit their in anticipation, the man's humming being the only sound accompanying the boiling. He eventually comes into the room with a bottle, seeing that he was in fact not boiling water but instead a green liquid which he politely asks you to drink. You are rightfully cautious but your sense of greed is getting the better of you, eagerly wanting that sack of gold. You quickly scull the bottle down, enjoying the rather sweet taste. The man stands their hands together, smiling as you down the drink. You finish the drink, wiping you mouth and looking at the man \"Sir what was in that drink may i ask.\" The man only smiles, making you want to question him more but you start to feel queasy, panicking internally as you try to make a run for it, putting your arm out only for you to start rapidly shrinking into your own clothes, quickly falling on the ground. You scurry out of your shirt sleeve, seeing the room you are in from a 1 inch perspective, the man smiling down at you. \"It worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis moment of glee is short lived as the door swings open, two holy knights come barging in, one with pink hair and the other a dirty blonde. \"Your kidnapping sprees come to an end here now criminal,\" the pink haired knight stated, his sword pointing at the man, lightning emerging from the tip, enveloping the man in a sort of prison. \"Guess you get to have the fun this time,\" the blonde knight joked escorting the man out of the building. \"I'll search the building for anything of note,\" the pink haired knight yelled, the other returning a hand gesture as he walked off. He looked around the house, seeing nothing out of ordinary but an alchemy set. There were no people present in the house so the knight was about to leave before a pair of clothes on the ground caught his attention. \"This man didn't seem to have a child hear so what are these,\" the knight questioned, leaning down before noticing to his shock a tiny naked boy hiding at the end of the sleeve. Falling on his ass, the knight quickly got back up before gently grabbing the tiny boy in his hand, bringing him up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are lifted up to the knight's face, his piercing blue eyes inspecting your tiny frame, shivering from the cold armor you are seated on. \"Hey little guy, are you hurt in anyway, did that man do this to you?\" You nod as your answer, unable to muster up any words. \"Well i'm going to have to take you as i can't leave you here. My shift is about to end and i can't go back to the castle until tomorrow. And I'm sorry about this but i can't have you out in the open so i gonna have to put you down there,\" the knights says, his face slightly blushing as he gestures down towards his crotch. \"It's pretty loose so i'll have to put you in the front.\" You slowly nod your head, accepting that this may be your best shot at getting back to normal. The Knight sets you on the ground, unbuckling his belt, still blushing. You look up in awe as he drops the belt down next to you, only to grab you, moving you over to the stretched opening of his undergarments, lying in wait is a mammoth of a cock, easily 5 inches longer than your average 5/2 length. He nestles you right next to it before shutting you in to head off home. The trip home is rather short but you can't help but be infatuated by his cock, so immense and thick, giving off a thick aroma that is sucking you. Before you give in you are taken out and plopped onto a bed, the knight going into another room, coming out in short pants and a brown shirt, tied at the top. He sits on the bed next to you, hands spread out. \"Oh. my names Gilthunder,\" the knight smiles. \"So i'm just gonna go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being in that suit of armor all day sure is tiring and I kinda need it,\" Gilthunder said with a smile on his face and one hand behind his head. Your flooring bounces as Gilthunder jumps of the bed, making you jump up in the air slightly. As he walks off thoughts of earlier race through your mind, taking over your mouth as you yell out \"WAIT!\" Gilthunder comes back to the bed his face down at your level, his deep blue eyes again staring right at you. \"What is it little guy,\" Gilthunder asked concerned, holding a worrying expression. You stand there looking in awe at the massive face in front of you, his chiseled jaw, plump limps and those luscious eyes. \"Uhh, Sir I would like to wash myself aswell if that's okay,\" you ask looking down at the bed sheet. Gilthunder chuckles in response, confusing you as you look up, only to see his hand quickly envelop you. You are covered in a war darkness before being set on the floor of another room, seeing a single stool and Gilthunder on the other side getting a wooden bucket. \"I'll be back in a bit little guy just gonna go fetch some water.\" Gilthunder leaves the house, leaving you sitting on the floor waiting patiently for his return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit for a short while, hearing the door open and close after around 5 minutes, Gilthunder walking in with a full bucket that he set down right in front of you. You think to yourself that there is no way you can climb up into that bucket. You want to question Gilthunder but your view of him is obscured by the bucket, so you walk around it only to see what you came for, Gilthunder standing tall taking off his shirt. You look up in awe at the giant of a man as he throws his shirt on the ground, his muscles glistening with sweat. As he goes to take off his pants he sees you on the ground looking up, liking having a little admirer watching him undress, boosting his ego a little bit. You look up infatuated as Gilthunder peels off his pants, revealing that huge cock in all it's glory. He walks over to the stool and sits, his legs spread high above you, letting his cock hang down. Completely ignoring you he leans down for the bucket, picking up and pouring some of the water down his chest and arms, splashing down on the ground near you. The glistening giant grabs a sponge and dumps it in water, lifting up his left arm as he brings it out and starts scrubbing, his right arm bulging with every movement. \"God I wish i was that sponge,\" you whisper to yourself, shaking your head as you come to your senses. You wonder when your gonna start washing as Gilthunder leans down with the sponge, squeezing the water out of it on you, smiling. You guess this is a fine way of doing it without having the water dumped on you so you enjoy what you can, looking up at Gilthunder as he washes his huge body, occasionally looking down at you while squeezing the sponge above you each time he goes to get more water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter washing you are back on the bed, Gilthunder lying down in nothing but pants. \"I'd usually let you leave but in your predicament you'll get lost or hurt so your just gonna have to sit tight. I don't know what to do with a tiny person so if you think of something speak up,\" Gilthunder states with a cocky smile, arms behind is head. This brings many fantasies to your mind as Gilthunder seems like he'll be open to anything with what he just said. You ask him is you can</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">I visit this site a lot, browsing through the stories and even adding a few additions of my own. I\u2019ve decided to try and start my own interactive. The plot is the usual: you\u2019re suddenly shrunken in an anime world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Rules and Guidelines~<br>\r\n1. This is a male only story. If you want a giantess or SW story, there are more than plenty. Females can still be there as background characters, but no interaction.<br>\r\n2. Practically any sort of interaction is accepted. Go wild.<br>\r\n3. No one-line chapters, unless it\u2019s a choice chapter.<br>\r\n4. Try to use a basic amount of grammar. Punctuation and capitalization isn\u2019t that hard. <br>\r\n5. Shrinking did not make you invincible, so death endings may be added without limit.<br>\r\n6. The main giant of a storyline cannot suddenly change without warning. For example; Sasuke jumps through the window, steals you from Naruto\u2019s grasp, and escapes.<br>\r\n7. This starts out as a shrinking story, but can also become a growing story. You or/and an anime character may grow. <br>\r\n8. Don\u2019t make a sudden ending. For example; Naruto puts you in his sandal and puts it on. You become his insole for the rest of your life. (The End)<br>\r\n9. Don\u2019t spam. Spam includes nonsense writing and stopping a storyline because you claim it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d. <br>\r\n10.Have fun.<br>\r\n11. <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>NEW RULE. ADDED 2/20/12</b> From now on you are not allowed to add JUST choice chapters! This is the same rule as in my \"Beneath his Notice\" interactive. If you add any choice chapters you MUST also add a real addition to the story. If you do not and several hours have gone by I will delete the choice chapters. </font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: I made the above rule larger because it seems many of you simply aren't getting it. Don't bother adding a choice chapter if you aren't gonna add a REAL addition immediately after. I'm just gonna delete your choice chapter(s) and the only thing you would have accomplished is wasting everyone's time.<br>\r\n</td>",
