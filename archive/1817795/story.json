The tour is almost over. So far, you've seen our conference rooms, our server banks, a few of our designers in action, and of course, our Teleporters. Now, we're actually a bit early. Our next event is a speech by our President,\" There were groans at this, \"But he follows strict schedules, and won't be here for a few minutes.\" There were more groans at this. \"But for now, any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can build a pokeball that always works, why didn't you before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first we had to know we could make a lot of them. Second, a pokeball does more than just catch a pokemon. It also keeps them safe, especially when they're seriously hurt. Knowing you can get your trusted partner to medical help takes priority over getting a new friend. It has to be able to both Capture and Autorecall, and the alpha-Master balls were having trouble with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the fire alarm buzzed, and a Silph Scientist came through the teleporter shouting, \"We're under attack! Everyone evacuate! It's... it's Team Rocket!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the children screamed and ran to the corners of the room. In the confusion, the guide walked over to the teleporter and called out: \"Don't panic, we can leave in this direction.\" Luckily, everyone heard her and began following her, trusting her to lead them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One we get out in the open, we can take either the stairs or the elevator straight to the ground floor,\" the guide explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party assembled at the north wall, right outside the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, unfortunately, we have a problem,\" The guide began, \"Everyone won't fit on the elevator. We'll have to split up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can handle this part.\" The teacher walked into the elevator and held the Door Open button. \"Okay, everyone cram in here. You have special emergency permission to push as much as you have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they did. Soon every student was in the elevator except one. The remaining child looked dissapointedly at the crowd along with the scientist and the Guide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I'm getting back out- ugh,\" The teacher began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no time!\" The scientist said, \"Go down now, We'll take the stairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of three took the staircase three at a time. The building shook from an explosion someplace on a higher floor, but they all leaned against the wall to keep their balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, at this rate Silph is finished,\" The guide was surprised when she realized that those words came out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Fifth floor... Fourth floor-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just where do you think you're going?\" a rough voice demanded. The three looked to the side and saw a Rocket member leaning against a wall to the south, just outside the opening between the stairwell and the main floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have time for you!\" The scientist said loudly. Then he pressed a metal sphere into the hands of the student next to him, whispering, \"<i>Hold onto this. And... tell her I'm sorry.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a tough guy, huh? You know how we deal with tough guys?\" the Rocket replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we settle Anything?\" the scientist shot back, palming another Pokeball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh-!,\" The Rocket began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>We battle Pokemon!</b>\" They said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Rocket member sent out a Ratticate, while the Silph scientist turned out to have a Magnemite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Run!</i>\" the tour guide hissed. despite misgivings, the child obeyed, and the two of them rushed down the next set of stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyper Fang!\" {Chomp!} \"Huh? That should have worked better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something we just discovered. I call it: \"Steel\"! Now, Thundershock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we'll see how brave you act when we're through with you-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost there- Agh!\" The kid turned around to see a long purple snake tail wrapped around the guide's legs. The snake it belonged to looked up and hissed at him, \"Arrr....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even a pokemon to defend yourself with?\" the Arbok's trainer walked into view, \"I wouldn't recommend going out at night.\" Then he looked at the kid, \"Hey you! Get back here! Listen to what a grownup tells you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guide broke in, \"Well, this grown up is telling you to wrugh...\" Arbok had begun squeezing tighter, \"Rrrrun for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid ran. Silph could take care of itself. Hopefully..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's as far as you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid stood in the exact center of the stairs between the second and first floor, staring at a Rocket Grunt standing at the bottom of them. Just how many guards were there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grunt continued, almost friendlily \"By the way, thanks. If Silph wasn't preoccupied with showing you around, our takeover wouldn't have gone so smoothly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and if you're wondering where your friends went, we've got them at the edge of town. They're safe. For now, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAT?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, now you're coming with... What's with that look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out...\" the kid held out the Pokeball from earlier, \"Of My Way!\" And released the Pokemon inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairs creaked under the weight of the large, blue, shelled, amphibious saurian that now sat on top of them. With her fins smushed against the wall on one side and hanging past the guardrails on the other, plus the stairs digging into her underside, she couldn't have been too comfortable, but as she looked back at her new trainer, something in her eyes showed that it didn't really matter to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Lapras?!\" The Rocket exclaimed in shock, \"No way a school kid could get a rare one like that! Is that one of the test animals? Oh you thief...\" A Sandslash appeared on the bottom steps, and the enemy trainer himself brandished a whip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Lets see, Lapras looks like a water type, which is good against ground types. I should be able to win this one.</i> \"Okay, Water Gun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poison sting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sand mouse fired poison stingers out of it's claws, while Lapras spat out a stream of water. The two attacks rushed past each other. Sandslash seemed to come off worse, as the water knocked it over, while Lapras took the barbs without flinching. However Sandslash got up, while Lapras suddenly let out a groan of pain as the kid saw her skin starting to turn purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Oh no, Poison Sting Poisons! I don't know how long Lapras can take this...</i>' \"Keep it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sand attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandslash shook itself, sand coming out of the chinks in it's armor, then threw some of the accumulated grit at Lapras' eyes. She blinked it away and managed to hit with another burst of water. This added another element of luck to the fight, but Sandslash was still losing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, enough going easy on you. Slash!\" The rocket ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more time!\" The kid ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandslash charged up the stairs, intent on driving its claws across the saurian's neck. However, it was also going to be easier to hit itself at such close quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandslash brought its claws sideways-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Across the sea pokemon's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLapras let loose another burst of water-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Right into Sandslash's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, they held that position...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rocket member gaped in shock as his prized fighter suddenly collapsed and dissapeared in a lightshow, as his pokeball autorecalled it upon sensing a loss of conciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?!\" The Rocket readied his whip and prepared to charge into battle himself, \"No way I lose to a kid li- gluble!\" and ran right into a water gun, being knocked over and left in a slippery puddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right, attacking a Pokemon yourself marks you as a target,' The kid remembered a safety lecture that had stuck in the mind, since it seemed weird compared to the usual pro-pokemon ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid returned Lapras to her Pokeball (hopefully that would slow down the poison), and carefully stepped down the stairs past the fallen villain, and towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Just who do you think you are?!\" The grunt shouted upon catching his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Indigo Jones! And I'll be coming back here soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo (Indy to his friends) sat down on a bench at the pokemon center. Saffron was in worse shape then they'd thought. Team Rocket hadn't just attacked Silph, they were patrolling the streets too. They'd managed to evade them to heal Lapras, but now what? Where should they go?<br>\r\nThey could leave town. The roads were guarded by the police, but he doubted they would stop him. Another big city, Celadon was to the east, while the creepy graveyard town Lavender was to the west, and they were connected to each other by an underground passage, so he wouldn't have to go through Saffron again to go between them. Meanwhile, the port city Vermillion was to the south, and there was also Cerulean to the north. They also had an underground connecting them.<br>\r\nBut did Indy really want to leave? Maybe they could try contacting the Pokemon League representatives in Saffron. Sabrina was known as one of the most powerful Gym Leaders ever. There was also the Karate King. He'd been kicked out, but he'd been considered strong before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the local eccentric Mr. Psychic. He couldn't hurt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Indy decided that they might as well go visit Mr. Psychic, since his house wasn't far away. Still, he probably wouldn't help much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trainer walked down the street, hugging the buildings to keep out of Team Rocket's way. Fighting them out in the open wouldn't help much, they could save that for when they had a bigger party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Psychic's door was unlocked, so Indy just walked in. It was rude, but spending too much time in the open would attract attention from Team Rocket that they didn't need. Hopefully Mr. Psychic would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! You don't need to say anything,\" The spectacled man said without getting up from his table. \"You seek help in ridding this city of Team Rocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... exactly right!\" Indy replied, astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Psychic turned to his guest, \"In a few hours, I wouldn't have needed my psychic powers to tell you that,\" He held out a purple compact disk, \"This is the only physical aid I can offer you. Be careful not to break it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndy walked over and took the disc. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Technical Machine. TM for short. If you place this near a suitable pokemon's brain, it will transcribe it's data into them, and teach them a new technique for battle. But the disc erases itself after use. This one is a powerful Psychic attack. Using it on your Lapras would be a good choice, but perhaps not the best one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks!\" Indy said sincerely, once he understood. \"But, is that really all you can do to help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, I am under house arrest at the moment,\" Mr. Psychic said, regretfully, \"I cannot leave. And if you want to form a team of your own to fight Team Rocket, I would advise you to leave town and come back later. The Gym Leaders of this town, for reasons of their own, have chosen not to involve themselves in the world outside their Gyms. Asking them for help now would be pointless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndy didn't understand why this would be, \"Why? Can't I make them change their minds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you could defeat them, but currently, that's not possible. You need to become stronger before you stand a chance against any of the powerful opponents in this town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how do I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave town and seek weaker opponents to spar with. As for where you go, that's up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I need more to go on.\" Indy commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you go North or South, you will face people closer to your skill level, but you won't be able to come back to Saffron for a long time. If you go East or West, the trail will be harder, but if you use your resources correctly, you may be able to open the gates of Saffron permanently. Then you can go in any direction freely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a lot to take in, but at least Indy knew they had a chance. \"Thank you. You helped a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're welcome. Do you have any more questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Just one. What happened to my class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Psychic paused before answering, \"Team Rocket is keeping a large group of people near the north Guardhouse. However, I don't know how strong their guard is. If he's at the same level as the ones inside Silph Co, then you might not be able to free them yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndy left the house silently, considering his next move. Was he really to weak to do anything yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He would find a way back sometime, though, that was a promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndy walked out of the house and through the clear streets. The Rockets standing on guard were overconfident now, and weren't stopping everyone who had to go out to buy groceries (Speaking of which, Indy was rather under-supplied at the moment. But that could wait for later.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unofficial trainer walked into the south guardhouse, one of the four that blocked the roads out of Saffron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kid, the road is closed!\" the security guard called out from behind his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean I'm stuck here with Team Rocket roaming the streets?\" Indy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard looked sheepish, \"Um, yes, I'm pretty sure that is the idea. No one goes in or out, so Team Rocket is trapped with no backup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long until help comes from the police?\" Indy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't know,\" the guard was debating himself in his thoughts, \"I'll tell you what. You seem to be a trainer, so I'm guessing you can take care of yourself in the wild. So I'll let regulations slide if you want to leave, but you won't be able to come back. And all the other roads from Saffron are closed too, if you planned to go around me that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndy knew that there would be a way back in eventually, and nodded to this deal. The guard waved Indy through the building and sat back down at his radio. \"HQ, what's our schedule again? This is thirsty work out here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndy looked down over a few ledges across Route 6, which led to Vermillion. There was a clear path through the grass and around a pond, but there were other people around: Trainers. And quite a few of them were keeping an eye on the path. Ironically, he could have had a faster time if he hadn't been a trainer himself, because then the others wouldn't have been interested in fighting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his left was the entrance to the Underground Path, a manmade tunnel that could take him north to Route 5 and Cerulean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now that he had time to rest, maybe now would be a good time to use that TM... or he could save it for later.</span></div></div>",

Consider a trainer who starts from the middle of the region, where the pokemon aren't as docile as the ones on route 1?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scenario: A school has arranged a field trip to the famous Silph Co. head offices. Suddenly, Team Rocket raids the city to take over! And these aren't the grunts they assign to Mount Moon to keep them out of the way, these are their seasoned veterans, and this is a mission that counts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the students gets ahold of one of the lab animals and makes a break for the exit. But, can this new trainer stand up to an international crime ring, with no prior battle experience at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n* The main character's gender should remain unrevealed.<br>\r\n* Remember that this is E-rated. You may be able to get away with violence, but no romantic content. (However, it is possible that this rating will change later.)<br>\r\n* I expect good spelling and grammar from contributors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuggestions:<br>\r\n* Be familiar with the locations your chapters take place in, and the canon characters you choose to involve.<br>\r\n* This story operates on the assumption that Pokemon from Routes 1 and the Viridian Forest really <i>are</i> much less experienced than the ones from Diglett's Cave, which are less powerful than the ones on Cinnabar Island. Likewise, Team Rocket sent their weakest members to Mount Moon to collect fossils, kept their intermediate members to guard Headquarters, and sent their elites to subjugate Saffron. (And on that note, recall that the test Lapras starts at level 15 or 20 in the games)<br>\r\n*Stick to pokemon native to Kanto, and know which ones live on the route the main character is in.
