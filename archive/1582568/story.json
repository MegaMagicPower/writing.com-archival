The deserted private train car, she could accept, and even all of the dead passengers weren't too upsetting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a moving, groaning, chomping corpse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit much for the young rookie, just recently assigned the position of rear security.

Her muscles were going numb. She tried to crawl away, only for her body to give out on her, as the last words she heard before losing consciousness were, <i><b>\"-- This is Wolf-Pack.

Suffice to say, Jill couldn't help but feel quite uneasy, considering it reminded her all-too-much of the Spencer Mansion. From there, her ears soon picked up the distant sounds of gunfire off in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta...Find...Help...\" She weakly said, attempting to stand up of her own volition, only to find herself on a rather shaky foundation, stumbling onto the floor in the process.

Stubborn as ever, the brunette weakly stood back up onto her feet, slowly making her way through the hallway, with a hand on the wall for balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, once she made it to the end of the hall, Jill soon began to smell something...delicious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! It wasn't that! She said to herself, shaking her head in the process out of initial denial, only for the aroma to hit her sinuses once more, causing her mouth to salivate instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting her teeth, Jill impulsively made her way out of the hallway and into the main area of what she can see is an extravagant penthouse, with the sparsely burning flickering of the buildings of the doomed Raccoon City not too far off in the distance from her view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't what she saw over the nightly horizon that garnered her attention, but rather...</span></div></div>",

However, what made the staggering S.T.A.R.S member uneasy was the woman's clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a pristine lab coat over a sleek-looking military-grade bodysuit, with ammunition pouches and straps adorned on her legs and hip-line. At first, the strange woman didn't seem to notice Jill's presence. That is, until she turned around to look through a microscope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there that Jill got a good look at the woman's face. She had the distinctive features of someone of Asian descent, wearing a compact respirator around her mouth and nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the currently fragile Jill, this strange woman soon took notice of her, casually walking up to her as she said, <i><b>\"-- Oh good! You're awake, Ms. Valentine! --\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing upon instinct, Jill tried to futilely defend herself from this unknown assailant, which proved fruitless as the masked woman casually hoisted the brunette's arm over her shoulder to support the physically frail woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"-- Easy there, Ms. Valentine. No use trying to defend yourself, I'm afraid. --\"</b></i> The woman retorted, as if being all too friendly with her like they knew each other, where the woman calmly placed Jill onto a sturdy chair, with Jill only mustering enough strength to ask, \"Who...Wh-Who are...you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the masked woman then examined the creatures in the containment tubes, jotting down several research notes in the process, she promptly answered back, <i><b>\"-- Who me? ...Think of me as an ally, Ms. Valentine? --\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"-- Here. Eat this. --\"</b></i> The woman said, holding up a slice of cake, something Jill thought she wouldn't see much of due to what had transpired in Raccoon City.

Thanks!\" Jill stated, looking at her heavily dressed compatriot, to which the woman then pulled out another tray, this time with a few more slices of cake adorned on the metallic slab. In response, the masked woman soon replied, <i><b>\"-- Not a problem, Ms. Valentine. After all, you looked rather malnourished when we found you. --\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We? ...Wait a minute--\" Jill realized, quickly jumping to the conclusion that this woman was probably with those gas mask-wearing soldiers that were chasing her earlier. Instinctively, she swiftly grabbed a nearby scalpel from the table, holding it in front of her in a defensive posture while she exclaimed, \"--You're with those soldiers, aren't you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously taking heed of her <i>\"guest's\"</i> threatened stance, the woman raised her hands some in a non-threatening gesture, turning around to face the scalpel-wielding Jill Valentine and answered, <i><b>\"-- Smart girl.

Same with my colleagues Vector, Beltway, Lupo, Bertha, and Spectre. Anyway, we're currently at the Apple Inn, which we made a temporary base in the wake of our... \"defection\" from Umbrella. --\"</b></i> Four Eyes explained, which seemed to ease Jill's nerves a little, whilst the small twinges of hunger began to sluggishly crawl up Jill's insides, as the former S.T.A.R.S member quickly said, \"...Okay, I believe you. But! That still doesn't explain what you're planning to do with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, like taking a bullet to the gut, Jill suddenly felt these painful hunger pangs coming from her stomach, causing her to keel over onto the floor, grasping her flat stomach in pain, gritting her teeth in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"-- You were infected with the T-Virus by one of Umbrella's creations. Fortunately, I gave you a dose of something special I cooked up to counteract this. --\"</b></i> Four Eyes elaborated, calmly walking up to Jill, and carefully taking the scalpel from her hand, only to receive Jill's scolding as she yelled, \"...Wh-What... Did you do to me?! AAAGH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill knelt down in pain, to which Four Eyes then kindly grabbed a slice of cake from the tray, presenting it to her akin to a peace offering, while she answered, <i><b>\"-- I call it... \"The T-Nebu Virus.\" I know you don't exactly trust me right now, but you need to eat, Ms. Valentine. Otherwise, the virus I concocted will just consume your body's muscle cells for sustenance. You see, it feeds on the body's fat cells and accumulates them to maintain a healthy host. And right now... --\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour Eyes calmly presented the cake slice in front of Jill's face and continued, <i><b>\"-- ...If you want to get back at Umbrella for all the trouble they caused, I recommend you start digging in.

However, she was willing to make the Umbrella Corporation pay for all the suffering they've caused, so she unwillingly swallows her pride while she went for the next cake slice, nearly oblivious to the eventual side-effects of the T-Nebu Virus would have on her in the near future, as her body very slowly began to <i>\"fill out\"</i> as they say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== 18 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the only thing she felt at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill was currently laying on a nearby couch, her belly painfully distended to near-bursting, as she felt this odd numbing sensation in certain areas. However, she could only focus on the pain she was feeling in her stomach region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Four Eyes was busily examining Jill's unwilling food baby, jotting down notes as to how her homemade virus would take an effect on Jill, along with any potential mutations she might potentially undergo, responding with a cheekily quip as she chirped, <i><b>\"-- How are you feeling, Ms. Valentine? Are there any other discomforts besides the obvious? --\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill could only respond with a frustrated glare for the moment, her hands currently preoccupied with grasping her stomach.</span></div></div>",

She expected such a huge town to be busy as hell, but she hadn't even passed a single car since arriving in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she slowed to a stop as she saw a tanker truck fallen on its side, blocking the entire street and decked out in yellow police tape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now how the hell do I find my way around this mess...\" She groaned, parking her hog and looking around until she spotted a nearby diner, \"Might as well ask someone for directions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about a minute for the girl to realize the door was locked tight, even though she could see somebody behind the counter, cleaning the floor.

Hello!\" She stopped after a few minutes, grumbling, \"Fantastic, the only person I've seen in this entire damn city, and he's an asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into the adjacent alleyway, either to find the backdoor or just a way around.</span></div></div>",

A young man in a wet jacket took one look at and pulled a pistol on her! Claire instinctively placed her hands into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't shoot.\" Claire screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get down!\" The young man responded. Claire didn't know why he said that, but she followed the man's sight and ducked to her right. A bullet whizzed past her head and blew a hole into something. Claire turned around and gasped at the sight of a man with a very large hole in his head. On closer inspection she did see that he appeared almost...rotten in appearance. With red marks of blood ,some parts of his scalp missing, and a few teeth knocked out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She questioned. The young man bolted right over to her and grabbed a hold of Claire's arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" He screamed. Off to the side of her, Claire hear hands smack against the diner's glass. She turned to the side to see more slackjawed citizens who shared similarities to the man who was ventilated behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these things?\" Claire cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But we're safer at the police station.\" The stranger answered. The two ran opposite to the way Claire entered, though now both were out in the open. Now whether it was the sound of their footsteps or the sound of the stranger's gunfire,who could've had said. But to get to the gist of the matter, a horde of the rotten came shambling out of overturned cars or broken windows. The stranger and Claire looked around until the man pointed at a police cruiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" He shouted. The two ran towards it,both dodged hands that could've held them tight.Both tugged at the handles and hoped they opened. Luck smiled down onto them and the two rushed inside. Fate also seemed to give the two a helping hand as the key to the ignition was still in its slot. The man floored it to the max. He drove off, Claire looked behind her to see the slowly shrinking forms of the dead mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two breathed a sigh of relief as the sped through the city streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Leon.\" The man spoke. \"Leon.S.Kennedy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire Redfield.\" Claire responded. \" Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon smiled back at her. \"Could you check in the glove department?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stared at Leon for a bit but complied, there a glock greeted her. She grabbed a hold of it to stare at its design. She also made sure that no bullets were chambered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it, you may wan-\" Leon began to speak but was interrupted by Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use it? Because if you're saying I shouldn't.\" She joked. \"So who are you anyways?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Currently a bum,was going to be a rookie today. At the police station.\" Leon absentmindedly spoke as he kept his eyes on the road. Claire was about to say something else but was stopped by the sound of a blaring horn behind her. She turned around and gasped at the sight of a truck crashing through the road. Leon saw the sight as well and cursed,he tried to maneuver out the way of wrecked cars while seeing the ever barring sight of the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crazy son of a bitch.\" Leon spoke. He stopped and Claire grunted in surprise. She was about to ask why they stopped until she saw the sight of a overturned gas-carrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out!\" Leon cried. He helped unbuckle Claire's seat-belt before he did his own. The two rolled out of the car and just in time for the truck to ram straight into the cruiser and in turn ignite the gas-tank. The explosion knocked the two away,though thankfully both were relatively unharmed. A small bruise and scrap were on Claire but she tanked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leon!\" She cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here!\" Leon answered. The two walked forward,doing their best not to touch the spreading inferno. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The police station is just down the road.\" He spoke. He pointed to his right. \"Its behind that building all the way at the end of the street. You're closer to it, so just follow the directions and you'll get there in ten or so minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" Claire questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon turned and pointed to the alley right behind him. \"I'll see where this will take me. I'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had many questions she wanted to ask but the sound of an agitated crowd of carrion eaters,as well as the heating inferno put a pause onto those thoughts. Claire turned her head around to see where she could go. Besides the street being filled with wreckage, it seemed that horde was coming behind her and that no drooling beasts were hidden in the field of ruin. She then looked to her left side to see a weather-torn advertisement which showed the name Kendo written on it. An arrow pointed to an alleyway which still had its lights on. Claire hopefully could've banked on the chance that someone was still there,or at least, give her a safer way to get to the police station.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She also didn't want to bank on any hidden biters to grab onto her ankles. So Claire trusted the advertisement's words that Kendo's shop was still open. The young brunette sprinted forward, she glimpsed behind  herself to quickly note the incoming shamblers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran through the alleyway's lights, the sight was somewhat comforting to the woman. Claire followed the path outlined by tthe name Kendo in bright white with a blue arrow background. Soon she arrived right in front of the store. \"Kendo Brothers Armaments and Supplies\" proudly flashed in neon, or in this case,burnt neon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire hesitantly grabbed a hold of the door handle and pushed forward. She slowly crept her way into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze!\" A voice said. It wasn't loud,but the tone of authority made Claire instantly seize up. She looked at the counter to see a middle age man, hefty in the middle but still fit somewhat fit, aiming a crossbow at her. He showed sighs of having some Japanese ancestry in him,but besides that he appeared like any other Mid-Western American.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't shoot!\" Claire said the second time this night. \"I'm not one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large man looked surprised at that, he lowered his weapon and paced towards Claire. She stiffened then relaxed as she saw him lock the door behind Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard him mumble about bought locks and other things. The man put down his crossbow onto the counter and stared at Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robert Kendo.\" He introduced himself. \"I haven't seen you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire Redfield. And if you don't know me,well, that's because I've just arrived here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Redfield?\" Robert's eyes widened at her surname.He seemed to calm down even more so at that.\"I know your brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" Claire asked. \"How? Where is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I personally make the city's S.T.A.R unit's weapons. Well,me and my brother anyways, and he's out of town. As to where he is, I don't know. I'd have a word with him if I did however.\" Robert grumbled. Claire slumped down at his words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although,you can try the police station,maybe that's where he's at.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire brightened a little from his statement. She was going there anyways, but the chance that Chris could've been there was reassuring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what's going on with the city,Mr. Kendo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert scratched the back of his head while he inspected his crossbow. A huff of air came from out of his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew. Once I even knew there was something wrong, the whole town's been infested by zombies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire internalized that tidbit however other matters took priority in her mind. She needed to head towards the police station and find some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much. Its been nice chatting with you but I have to leave. I can let myself out the front door if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. I'll lead you out back. My shop's leads right into alleyways. You follow ever twist and turn and you'll be at the police station's    ...east wing? I can't exactly remember at the moment.\" Robert explained as he moved away from the counter. Claire followed the man until she back outside. A wire fence stood before her, to her left she saw a closed door. Robert took a keychain out,he popped a key into the socket,twisted,the distinct sound of an unlocked mechanism echoed through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,again.\" Claire said. \"Why don't you come with me? If the police are still around, maybe we can bunker down with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. My store's my fortress. It has everything I need; food,water,ammo,and enough guns to- well it had enough guns until the looters came two days ago. I also have some other...obligations I need to finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert disappeared and Claire was just about to open the door that lead out of the wire fence. But Kendo walked back out with some ammunition. He threw the packages at her, Claire grabbed them straight from the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, a safety precaution.\" The gunsmith stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled and walked away from Kendo's shop. Into the unknown she went, hopefully nothing would attack on her journey to the station.</span></div></div>",

The blob didn't seem to like that at all, because it quickly oozed back into the building it came out of, as if it were hiding, leaving the plump Claire Redfield to fall on her much cushier ass in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had gained quite a bit of weigh, packing the pounds on said ass so much that her shorts were now starting to look like underwear. Her tits were so big, they had already tore her clothes, and her belly sagged almost down to her knees and covered her thick thunder thighs. She looked down, triple chin obstructing the movement, and began to whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire Redfield had suddenly become a total fatass at 415 pounds.</span></div></div>",

Curves bloated and rolls of flesh cascaded down her sides as the redhead swelled further and further until, at last, her legs gave in and she fell on her titanic ass, the ground shaking and her new found fat jiggling, yet the blob was nowhere near done. She quickly became immobile, soaring past 600 pounds, then 800 pounds, and then half a ton, and still kept being fed by the wicked monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had lost her clothes long ago as they lay in shreds next to her gigantic, naked, fat covered body. All the while, the pain became even more excruciating as her fattened cheeks obscured her vision and her gigantic tits crushed her lungs. Finally, the last of the blob slipped past her plump lips with a sickening plop as Claire. groaned in horrendous disgust and agony. She was nearly a ton now, and her body could not handle the massive change it had just went through. Then, to her horror, the pain increased, pressure building up inside of her as she began to swell more and more!

Her breast had also become considerably huge, the giant mams hardly being contained by what was left of her vest while her skinsuit had torn down the middle, exposing the deep cleavage of her soft, fat tits. She lifted her fat laden arms in the air, the doughy limbs having become considerably harder to move around than before. She brought her plump fingers to her shocked face, feeling her multiple chins and her great, puffy cheeks. Her thick thighs were nearly as large as tree trunks and encased in cellulite, and her ass sagged behind her, her massive cheeks turning her once comfortable shorts into a thong as the crack of her ass stuck out the top of the exhausted garment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire began screaming again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a half hour of howling and sobbing in despair, she was beginning to come to terms with this mess. And she realized that there were more important things to worry about, most of which was how to move.

This was getting ridiculous... first there were zombies, a citywide catastrophe, and now these disgusting blobs. She was also pretty sure that the last one was blueberry flavored, it was almost as if the things were meant to be eaten, like they were trying to get inside her, to make her fat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why... why the fuck would this thing want to get inside of me like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she felt her stomach grumble tremendously, so much so that it made Claire clutch her flabby gut in pain. It continued to growl, shaking visibly now, making Claire panic even more. Was the monster still, dare she think it, alive? Was it moving inside of her? What did it want with her now? Like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the pain subsided, Claire tried to decide on what to do now. She first tried to move, deciding that if she couldn't even do that, then her options were severely limited. Yet as she pushed with all of her strength, her pathetically blubbery thighs and legs could not lift the massive bulk of her body even a centimeter off of the ground. She kept trying for almost two minutes before she found herself gasping for breath, sweat beginning to drip from her generous curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... huff... hufff... I'm fucked if I can't even move...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. If she couldn't even get off her fat ass in this city, she was zombie chow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked herself over, disgusted by her blubbery form. Her clothing, amazingly still clung to her, although her belly had burst through her spandex underclothing long ago, her vest merely served as a secondary bra for her mammoth tits, and her already small booty shorts were little more than butt floss between her massive buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then she started to notice something else... her skin was changing color! While she used to have a rather light complexion, the redhead now noticed that her skin was starting to gain a light tint of blue... and the color was becoming deeper, even more prominent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..! What the hell?!\" She shrieked as she looked herself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery exposed, flabby section of herself was starting to turn deep blue. She even caught a glimpse of her hair, the locks of the former redhead's hair now having turned a deep blue as well. Now her skin was turning violet, and Claire was starting to worry...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took her all of her effort not to just go completely mad right now at the thought of her horrifying situation. She tried not to think of how much she weighed, she didn't even want to estimate it, she knew she was probably the fattest human being to have ever lived, something she was <i>far</i> from proud of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also didn't want to think of these bizarre monsters that now resided inside of her. It was bad enough that she was robbed of her mobility and had her clothes torn and ripped to little more than rags by the first one, but a second blob monster? That had to be the shittiest luck anybody has ever had. She was also pretty sure that last blob tasted like blueberry, one of Claire's favorite foods. She tried not to think about how tasty it was, nor about how she could still feel some of the creature squirming about inside of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... huff... is... hurrrrr.... bullshit....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted as she let out a massive belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard a scream... a little girl's scream! She had to be another survivor... one who was being attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if she was being attacked by one of these blobs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire tried yet again to stand. She grunted and groaned, huffed and puffed as she slammed her feet against the ground and pushed. But once more, it yielded no results. Claire wasn't giving in yet however, as her maternal instincts kicked in, adrenaline flowing throughout her blubbery body. She had to stand, she had to save the screaming girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd somehow, someway, Claire managed to get to her trembling feet, her entire blubbery body quaking and jiggling violently as she did so. Because of this, it was difficult to maintain her balance, but she managed, not wanting to go through this horrible process again. She grunted, wheezing for air as she tried to walk forward. It was difficult, and far, far slower than before she became a total pig, but she was still moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl screamed once more, and luckily for Claire the sound was coming from down one of the larger alleyways, one that she could actually fit her fat ass into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't...! Huff! Huff! Huff! Worry....! I'm... huuuurr.... urrrp! Coming...!\" She grunted, her voice deepened and suffocated by the strenuousness of walking with her new body, as well as the half ton of fat on her once lithe frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon found an open manhole, and heard the girl scream again. It sounded like she was just at the bottom of it. Claire wobbled, trying to make it to her as quickly as she could, but she was starting to feel... heavier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true that she was tiring far too easily from simply walking a few steps, yet unbeknown to Claire the blueberry flavored blob that had invaded her body wasn't done changing her yet. Claire's once white skin was quickly turning violet, and it seemed as though she was becoming even fatter as well, her clothes tearing even more now, with loud, audible rips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped and panted even more now, sweat literally dripping from her swelling curves as her steps slowed even more pathetically. Her vest burst apart, leaving her breasts to surge forward, the immense blue tits swaying  and wobbling back and forth. Her bra barely contained them, her nipples quite clearly exposed, showing that they too had changed color to a dark, deep blue, blue, sticky juice leaking from the tips. Her ass quickly tore apart her shorts, leaving her only in her underwear now, her massive cerulean buttocks jiggling and bouncing as they slammed into one another with each step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was now close enough to see down the manhole, spotting a little blond girl sitting against a wall, trembling before a monstrous humanoid figure. Claire couldn't quite make out what the beast looked like, but could see that it had disgustingly twisted red and black flesh, an assortment of eyes, some inhumanly large dotting across it's skin like boils. She kept trying to move closer, but was now starting to notice her ever slowing pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... what's happening to me.... just... huuuufff... a little.... nnnnggg.... further...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer entire body wobbled now, until she was mere feet from the manhole and was forced to stop. She tried to make her bloated legs move, but they simply trembled, and it wasn't long before she fell to her colossal ass, causing her entire flabby blue body to shake and wobble sickeningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately the force of the impact also spread out from where her gigantic rear hit the pavement, sending a small earthquake through the alleyway and knocking over a stack of crates that stood by the manhole, the heavy boxes tumbling atop of the entrance, cutting the girl off from Claire for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Huff! Huff! Huff! No....!\" Claire cried, tears streaming down her plump cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Claire should have been more worried about herself as she continued to swell and bloat, her whale-like form swelling like a balloon full of lard. If she could see past her multiplying blue chins or look behind her at her titanic backside she would have realized that blue, slimy juice was leaking, and then squirting from her nipples and ass. Her bra soon gave in, letting her massive blue breasts bounce free, even more violet juice streaming forth from her teats. Her panties soon followed as a giant fart erupted from her elephantine rear, her buttocks jiggling obscenely as juice squirted from between them due to the pressure. A large puddle of blue juice was now spreading from beneath the massively obese turquoise colored girl, and Claire could now smell the unmistakably strong sweet scent of blueberries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noo..... what's... grunt... happening... urghhhh... to me...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe belched loudly, spitting up a mouthful of blueberry juice that dripped down her several chins like drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire whimpered helplessly, then tried to call out for help, only to realize that she couldn't force the words, or even a scream up her blubber-ringed throat. Instead more juice simply spat forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was beginning to feel painfully stretched now as her flabby blue rolls continued to fill the alleyway, and Claire could only hope that the swelling would stop soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't do much else. </span></div></div>",

She groaned in pain, starting to pant as she stopped to catch her breath. This was utterly ridiculous, she had simply come to this disaster zone of a city to find her brother, who had been missing for months.  Yet instead she had found it in chaos, and had been attacked by a monster... an actual monster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and not to mention that in the course of only ten minutes, that very monster had turned the redheaded, once athletic woman into a <i>morbidly obese cow.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire felt like screaming. She was completely disgusted with herself. Claire used to be able to say that the fattest girl she knew was a ditzy pig of a blond she knew in highschool, a girl infamous for eating almost five times as much as the others at parties. Now, at nearly twice as much as what she weighed (almost 800 pounds after eating the entirety of that blob), Claire was now the fattest <i>anything</i> she knew. Yes, Claire thought she should be screaming in complete disgust and distress, and yet she didn't. It was probably stress and shock she assumed, lifting her soft, doughy arm before her plump face to examine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered how thin she looked in the mirror when she woke up this morning. Now she was afraid to even go near any sort of reflective surface. With nearly half a ton of blubber weighing her down, her fair skin now showing a slight pink hue from her increased body heat, her newfound rolls coated in a thin sheen of sweat, the young woman now looked more like a pig than a biker chick. She was surprised her clothes even still clung to her portly frame, even if her spandex underclothes had ripped in two, her belly bursting out the middle, and her vest was now pushed up her bare stomach, containing the overflow of her breasts, but showing off quite a large amount of cleavage. Of course the poor girl's shorts, the tiny garments hardly covering much while she was thin, didn't fare well at her current size either. Most of the blob had apparently gone straight to the redhead's ass and thighs, much of her buttocks quite clearly exposed out what once served as the legs of her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must... ungh... be how a motherfucking hippopotamus feels...\" Claire grunted to herself as she looked about the empty alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fart loosed itself from Claire's chubby buttocks, causing her to groan in annoyance as they jiggled slightly. She tried to look back at her pudgy ass, but found her view impeded by the rolls of blubber comprising her sides and back as well as the rings of fat about her neck. She groaned even more loudly as her stomach gurgled and sloshed, still digesting it's \"meal\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... fuuuuck me... this shit just... nnf... can't get any worse right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she heard a loud rumbling noise coming from the street on the other side of the alleyways. She gasped in shock, as what appeared to be the very top of the blob from before came into view over the rooftops, although this one was obviously much, much larger. If that one found where she was...</span></div></div>",

She trembled with fear, but she didn't make a sound, she hardly even breathed as she watched the monstrosity beginning to move away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then her stomach decided that it was hungry... letting loose the loudest gurgle yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's plump face turned pale, a chill spreading throughout her obese form as the blob suddenly stopped. The monster then turned its tentacle \"head\" towards her direction, as if it were spotting its prey. Suddenly the tentacle lunged over the building, quickly followed by the rest of its mass, a literally wave of doughy sweet slime creature pouring across the rooftops and rushing through the side alleys towards Claire's position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Claire Redfield, she couldn't budge an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh fuuuuck....\" Claire gasped as the massive building-sized blob monster slammed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ooze wasted no time in forcing it's way past her fat lips and tunneling down her throat. Her sagging belly almost surged forward once the bulky sweet-tasting slime hit it, filling upwards and becoming less doughy as the beast inside of it stretched it out. It didn't take much of the blob to satisfy the girl's once growling stomach. Unfortunately for her, there was still literally tons of the calorie-packed abomination left for Claire to consume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the blob seemed to effect her metabolism as the rest of the porky girl began to fill out even more. Her breasts filled out, rapidly outgrowing any known classification for their size as they tore her pink top and the black skinsuit beneath it to shreds. Her belly became even doughier as it folded into roll after roll of blubbery lard, and her limbs became further engorged in fat until they were all but useless. Claire quickly began to grow even more chins as her blimping cheeks and face sank into the rings of fat that collared her neck, and her black, lacy bra became strained not only by her massive breasts, but her sagging backflab as well. Her thighs and ass bloated as well, once more accumulating what seemed like the majority of the blubber as her mammoth buttocks tore free of her tiny shorts and spread across the pavement, her cellulite marked rump turning her panties into a thong as they were swallowed by mounds of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire could only groan and gurgles past the massive amounts of fattening sludge as it surged down her throat. She was being forced to swallow an average person's lifetime of consumed calories all at once, and all she could do was sit on her ever-widening ass and take it. Yet the blob still didn't seem satisfied as it poured over the immobile girl, flowing and forcing its semi-liquid mass around her immense curves and between her many, many rolls of flab.The helpless redhead couldn't help but moan... well grunt, in pleasure, her stretched skin feeling quite a bit more sensitive as the ooze seemed to caress and fondle her bloated body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet her eyes widened as the ooze squirmed it's way down her backside, slipping one of its slimy tentacles right between her blubbery asscheeks. At first it pushed only gently against her rump, as if examining her, but then it began to forcefully push against her panties .Pressing firmly against the middle of them until the overtaxed strings of her underwear finally snapped, the ooze to flowed straight into her rear, pushing the ruined garments straight in with them. Now Claire was being filled through two orifices, and despite her grunts of protest and her pathetically failed attempts at shaking her head, her body began to swell even more quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, the blob still wanted to increase the rate at which it was consumed and, to the young woman's terror, began to crawl beneath her massively bloated stomach. She squeezed her eyes shut, a deep, hot blush spreading across her fat cheeks as the ooze poked and prodded at her now exposed slit before cramming itself straight into her pussy. She cringed at the creature flooded into her most sensitive parts, and while she thought that there was no way this would aid its attempts at fattening her, she seemed to be proven wrong as once more her body began to swell even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to feel lightheaded then. The combined shock of this whole horrific situation, the physical toll of gaining thousands of pounds of new weight, and the blind sexual intrusions by the dough monster was becoming too much on Claire. It wasn't long before the gigantically bloated girl's eyes were rolling back into her head and she felt herself blacking out into a deep state of unconsciousness...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oooh...\" Claire groaned as her eyes fluttered open. \"Wha- Urrrrp- what happened?\" Claire could only grunt and wheeze heavily at this point from the insurmountable amount of pressure being placed upon her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Claire was so morbidly obese by this point that it had become a major chore for her to even take a single breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...big...huff...need...to...huff...get out.\" She grunted, grimacing as she noted that her voice was almost have an octave lower now than it had been at her original weight. Of course, though Claire was eager to find a way out of her predicament, the first blob had already rendered her immobile, and at this point...well to call her a literal mammoth might be understating it at this point, considering she was nearly as big as the building she was next to at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part is, she noted, was that her stomach was still painfully gurgling from indigestion, but it was getting strangely...stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...huff...that thing...huff...can't actually...be...ohhhh....alive inside me?\" She wondered in between gulps of air, only for the painful churning in her stomach to intensify even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh...URRRRRRP!\" She belched thunderously, \"w-what...is...URRPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her gag reflex kicked in as she felt something force its way up her esophagus. Claire spat the foreign object out only to find that a huge chunk of the blob had flown out past her lips and onto the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" She muttered, trying to get a good look at the blob she had expelled from herself, but could only catch glimpses of it past her titanic breasts and her mountainous belly rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she saw it start to quiver, shake, and tremble before it started to solidify itself into a more solid shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire curiously watched the blob's strange act, she felt the same churning sensation from before, and again, she felt another blob travel up her throat, and again she coughed it out. However, instead of stopping after just one blob, the churning continued, and Claire found herself spitting out blob after gooey, chunky blob out of her mouth for a solid five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...huff...urgh...no...urrrrp...more...\" she found herself tiredly whimpering after what had to be the fortieth small blob of goo she'd coughed up in a row. Fortunately for her, she noted with relief that the churning in her belly had finally stopped, and as she looked around she noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm a lot smaller than before...\" She noted with glee, figuring that she was now at least half the size she used to be, and while that was still around the 600 pound mark, it was a much better improvement than the literal whale she'd been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a groaning sound that surprisingly wasn't coming from her gut caught Claire's attention as she looked up directly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire could only stare in shock as the blob's transformation had finally revealed itself. All the blobs she had spat up had combined to make an entire body of slime. However, what was shocking was that the slimes had perfectly mimicked the shape, skin, and even clothing of a human body, one that was quite familiar to Claire...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...huff...way.\" She wheezed in horror, \"that...huff...can't- URRRP! Ohh...\" Claire had to stop as she let out another roaring burp through her mouth, struggling to even form a sentence through the gassiness of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hehehe...</i>\" Claire's eyes shot up as she heard a dark chuckle emenate from the much skinnier doppelganger in front of her. The doppelganger looked up to meet her gaze, her, or its eyes glowing an ominous shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Aww...what's wrong Claire?</i>\" It giggled, \"<i>too much of a flatulent fatty to even finish speaking.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...huff...you're not...urgh...me!\" Claire tried to accuse defiantly, but could only manage a borderline pathetic whimper at the not-Claire in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh, but aren't I?</i>\" It scoffed, winking in a teasing manner. \"<i>After all I am the one who looks exactly like your last known appearance, and besides, who is anyone going to believe is the real Claire Redfield? Me? Or the lard filled elephant in front of me?</i> It grinned maliciously as it sank a finger into Claire's dough-like monster of a tummy. \"<i>Face it Claire, with the way things look I might as well be called Claire instead of you at this point!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...huff...what are you...huff...planning?\" Claire inquired between her frequent gasps for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, simply adding more denizens to my little...family of sorts, like I did with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Claire groaned, \"you...huff...I'll stop you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe false Claire raised an eyebrow at her original counterpart and laughed. \"<i>Really? I'd like to see you even move two step from that spot first!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you...huff...mock...me!\" Claire grunted as she tried to push herself up. Try as she might however, no matter how much she strained her limbs, the most she could do is move her legs and arms a few inches before flopping them down uselessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh poor thing...</i>\" the other Claire cooed mockingly, \"<i>too stuffed to even move an inch, let me give you a boost!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" Claire barely had time to question what was happening before she felt a familiar churning sensation building once more. However, instead of being centered in her abdomen as expected, it was happening all over her body, and she was about to cry out when suddenly her limbs started moving of their own accord, and she felt herself push herself upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>There, feel better?</i>\" The other Claire inquired with a poisonous smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...huff...how did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ah ah ah!</i>\" The other Claire shushed her before suddenly Claire felt the foreign force acting on her limbs dissipate, and she fell flat on her rear, sending a small tremor throughout the area. \"<i>don't forget Claire, after you so kindly hosted us within your body we got to know it...quite well...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire could only blush as she remembered the pleasurable sensations that she'd felt hours before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That means that as of a few hours ago,</i>\" the fake Claire continued, \"<i>WE own control of your body now.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Claire groaned defeatedly, desperately trying to move, but couldn't even muster the strength to twitch a limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yes!</i>\" The other Claire shot back with a cackle. \"<i>And now I shall take my leave if we're done here, I have other...'friends' to find.</i>\" With that, the false Claire bowed to her real self and started to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Claire whimpered, \"you...huff...you can't!\" The doppelganger paused once more before turning around with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh but I already have.</i>\" The doppelganger put a hand to its chin in thought, \"<i>however, I must admit that it wouldn't do for me to search the entire city alone...</i>\" The doppelganger looked upwards, only for it to catch sight of something and grin \"however, I don't think that will be a problem come a few hours more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...huff...are you...\" Claire wheezed as she followed the doppelgangers eyes to the right, only for them to widen in terror at the sight of about five moderately sized blobs peering over the edge of the building, their focus seeming to be centered right on her. \"No...\" Claire whined pitifully, \"please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh come now Claire,</i>\" the doppelganger chided, \"<i>it's rude to refuse some new guests your hospitality just after serving me! After all...</i>\" It paused, watching the other blobs start to make a beeline for the helpless, fattened Claire, before turning its back on the ensuing engorgement. \"<i>the more Claire Redfields, the merrier...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire herself tried desperately to keep her mouth shut, however, against her own will she felt her mouth open up to greddily accept the group of blobs making their way towards her gigantic form, no doubt due to the influence of her doppelganger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the first blob made its way to her mouth she could only accept her fate as she felt her belly once again surge forward as she started packing the pounds back on. However, the other blobs, impatient as ever, saught to enter her from every place the could, and Claire could only moan as waves of immense pleasure rolled over her throughout the entire process. As the blobs kept coming Claire noted that she must have passed her previous weight and size, before her eyes once again rolled up into her head as she passed out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...</span></div></div>",

There had to be a way out of town, reloading her gun she was determine to find it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other villainous Claire had been searching the streets of Racoon for some time now having left the original Redfield woman to be a factory for more of her kind ultimately uncaring of whatever fate befall the real Claire, all that matter was finding more usable hosts...unfortunately many of the women she came across had already been claimed by the monsters roaming the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Useless</i>\" she muttered having snapped the neck of one such creature before tossing it aside with surprising ease that didn't match her physical build. Perhaps she shouldn't have rid herself of Claire so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever her eyes soon caught sight of a rather healthy young woman roaming the streets, the brunette was decently fit for her age and much like Claire she would be a fine \"creator\". Now all she had to do was win her trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Excuse me, over here</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called out waving in the other woman's direction apparently doing enough to catch her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer aim steady Jill was slightly surprised to find another survivor, another brave woman even, closing the gap between them the brunette noted that this other girl didn't seem to be armed with anything nor was she showing any cuts or bruises perhaps she had been lucky in her travels?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hi there my name's Claire, I was hoping I would run into someone still alive out here</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Other stated hoping to weasel her way into a friendship with Jill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire?

Pleasure to meet you Claire, what exactly are you doing out here on your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I could ask you the same but more to the point looking for assistance</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo escape the city no doubt thought the brunette that said while thankful to have some company something about this woman gave her an odd feeling...it was eerie similar to Wesker, or maybe once again her mind was thinking far too fast for it's own good.</span></div></div>",

Hoping to confuse the blobs Jill took a swift turn to the right, deftly vaulting over the fence in one smooth motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, this seemed to impede the blobs as she heard them stop at the fence she had made it over, and then slither in another direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost em for now I guess!\" Jill sighed, relieved that she had managed to shake them off of her trail for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heh, I wouldn't be so sure of that if I were you Ms. Valentine!</i> The familiar voice of the doppelganger cackled as Jill whipped around to find 'Claire' sitting atop the fence, looking no worse for the wear, her head showing no signs of the bullet wound that should have been quite evident in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Jill grimaced, gritting her teeth, \"I put a bullet straight through your skull at point blank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That you did</i>!\" 'Claire' nodded, flashing Jill a chesire grin in response, \"<i>and if I had been one of those insipid bags of rotten flesh roaming the city it would have been more than enough to end me!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then if you're not one of those...things, what the hell are you?\" Jill spat defiantly, while getting ready to run once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh, you're already quite familiar with my kind.</i>\" 'Claire' giggled, looking up, \"<i>and while I may not be as...slippery as my companions, I do have a knack for tactics, which by the way Ms. Valentine, I'm afraid your little escape ends here!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill, too wary to break eye contact with 'Claire' for even a moment, was caught off guard as something collided with her foot, rooting it to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw crap...\" Jill swore as she looked down to find one of the blobs keeping her leg firmly connected to the ground. Looking up, Jill took aim once more at 'Claire' and prepared to open fire. Her finger was pulling the trigger just as another blob collided with her hand and knocked the gun away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Claire' was now directly in front of her, chuckling at Jill's futile attempts at resistance. Jill, noticing the amusement of her aggressor, growled and swung her fist, connecting solidly with 'Claire's' waist. Much to her horror however, her fist stuck after making contact with the other woman, and as she tried to pull it away, she found that she could not free her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Done yet?</i>\" 'Claire' inquired, smirking at her prey. \"<i>It amuses me to see you struggle, though I must say you at least put up more of a fight than the real Claire did!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the hell up!\" Jill yelled, noticing that the crowd of blobs from before had finally caught up and were heading for her. \"You won't get awa- mmph!\" Jill's shouts proved to be her undoing, as one of the blobs swiftly entered her mouth without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally letting Jill's limbs go, 'Claire' looked on eagerly as the blobs began to stuff their newly acquired prey. The first blob simply made Jill a bit more chubby, her belly pooching out from underneath her sky blue top and her chest growing out to show some ample cleavage. The second blob turned Jill decidedly more into the fat category as her skirt began to show signs of strain. This was followed by a third and fourth blob until finally Jill was sitting at a whopping 450 pounds, panting heavily from the strain of her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...huff...the...huff...hell\" Jill breathed, her voice noticeably lower from the sheer girth that had accumulated on her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hehe, only step one of what I've got in store for you Jill!</i>\" 'Claire' giggled, placing a finger on her chin in thought, \"<i>but you know, I'm a good sport, so I'll cut you a deal! If you can get out of this alley before I do I'll let you go!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...huff...kidding me?\" Jill groaned, glaring at the creature across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'll even give you a ten second head start!</i>\" 'Claire' said, smiling in a sickeningly sweet manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the creature started to count, Jill tried as best as she could to lift herself up to her feet, but quickly found that her muscles were much less prepared to lift 300 pounds of extra weight. Shakily, as the count hit four, Jill managed to move her legs under her and slowly lift herself off the ground. However, she almost immediatley stumbled, her center of gravity being much different than before, and to make matters worse, her top, loyal as it had been up to now, ripped apart, letting her now titanic breasts spill forth, covered just barely by a simple black bra she had worn underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the count hit six she shakily took a couple of steps forward, breathing heavily as she steadied herself on the wall. As the count hit eight she had managed to make it five steps, but was already panting from exhaustion and sweating heavily from the exertion a simple walk had placed upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ten! Here I come!</i>\" Jill heard 'Claire' giggle, hearing the patter of footsteps behind her and then seeing the creature pass her, casually jogging in front of her to the alley exit, Jill dropping to her enlarged butt at the sight and letting out a groan from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well you tried your best, and hey even though you weren't the best runner,</i>\" Claire smirked, \"<i>you'll make a fine creator!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another second to spare Jill felt her mouth forced open once more, her eyes rolling in the back of her head as she fell unconscious. The last thing she felt was the proportions of her body, especially her belly, balloning even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>An hour later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the now engorged figure of Jill Valentine lay comatose, her body, just like Claire's, was being copied genetically down to the smallest atom, and eventually her body convulsed a bit, before finally spitting up most of the blobs. Her form looking around 200 pounds after the process was finally complete. The blobs she had spat up however, began to form into two different figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was none other than 'Claire', the entity that had landed Jill in her current predicament. Stretching and letting out a yawn, the doppelganger looked to the figure forming next to her and smiled in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second figure formed into a pale skinned girl with brown hair, a sky blue top, and a skirt to match, the faint red glow in her eyes the only indication of her non-human origin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Heh, I guess welcome to the team 'Jill',</i>\" 'Claire' greeted, extending a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Charmed and thrilled to be here 'Claire'</i>\" 'Jill' responded, shaking the other's hand and flashing a cold smile. \"<i>Should we dispose of the original?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nah, I've got a much better idea.</i>\" 'Claire' said, giving the unconscious form of Jill a calculating look. Extending her hand, 'Claire' broke off a portion of herself and stuffed it into Jill, who ingested one more. However, instead of expanding, Jill winced in pain, before twitching a little, her breathing stopped for a few moments, before resuming normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What did you do?</i>\" 'Jill' inquired, curious as to the other's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I made that portion of me destroy her current brain and replace it with a working replica made up of me.\" 'Claire' shot the other doppelganger a triumphant smirk. \"<i>She'll still function as normal whenever she wakes up, but if she encounters one of us again well...let's just say she'll be a lot more compliant with our wishes...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Terrific!</i>\" 'Jill' crowed, \"<i>now, shall we find others to spread our gift to?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>With pleasure!</i>\" with that, both 'Claire' and 'Jill' walked away, a pack of blobs following closely behind each one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The process of making more Claire copies had been cut from hours to minutes as the blobs worked together to record and imitate Claire's exact looks, personality, and genetic makeup before conglomerating back outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blobs hadn't even bothered to wake their gargantuan host, whose weight lay somewhere in the thousands of pounds currently, before forcing her body to regurgitate themselves, having more than enough control over Claire's body to serve their purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst it was one, then another, and another blob that Claire coughed up until finally 10 fully fledged copies of Claire Redfield stood gathered outside the now significantly smaller original body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So, what is the plan from here?</i>\" One of them asked casually, whilst stretching to test the confines of their new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Simple, we scout out the city as 'Claire' and then add whomever we find to our little...breeding circle.</i>\" Another replied while pointing back at the real Claire, who was still too exhausted to even fathom waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What about the original?</i>\" Another inquired, \"<i>The amount of copies we've made has brought her down to about 250 pounds, giving her back her mobility, and once she wakes up she will no doubt try to stop us...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hah! The original?</i>\" A fourth scoffed arrogantly, flicking its 'hair' back listlessly, \"<i>She could not handle even one of us even at her optimal weight, much less in her newly engorged form. She's no threat.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yet types like her do have a knack for the unthinkable...</i>\" Yet another clone pointed out. \"<i>I say we still proceed with caution.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Indeed,</i>\" the sixth Claire chirped, before placing a finger to her chin in thought, \"<i>in that case, we all split up and patrol the city, and if she just so happens to stumble upon us and is acting against us, we assimilate ourselves back into her body and...assume direct control from there.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Agreed.</i>\" All the Claires nodded in unison as they all went their separate ways to go find more unwitting citizens of the city to add to their ranks, leaving the unconscious Claire to continue her slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...URRRP...\" Claire awoke with a groan, a belch following soon after as she felt a major pain in her stomach flair up as she awoke from unconsciousness. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she saw no signs of the blob, but was surprised to find herself a whole lote skinnier than before, and while she was still very much a portly Claire, she found she could at least move and probably even walk around in this state, much to her relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also pretty surprising that my vest held up...\" she muttered while looking down at her chest. The garment was definitely put through its paces, and had the rips and tears to show for it, but sure enough the trusty item of cloth was still loyally protecting the modesty of her breasts even when her undershirt and bra had long since tapped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't really say the same for my shorts though...\" Claire sighed as she found that a very strained pair of panties was all that was protecting her bottom half from indecency. However, it suddenly dawned on Claire with no short amount of terror as to why she had shed so many pounds in such a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" She whispered, \"no no no! They made more of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the horrid revelation realized, Claire knew she had to somehow find a way to stop the evil versions of herself before they found someone else to fatten up and clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta...get...urgh...up!\" Claire grunted, before heaving herself up off the ground, making her wince as her entire body jiggled, though it was mitigated by the sole fact that she could even get up now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting the trail of slime left on nearby walls and buildings, Claire took a deep breath and set off down one of the streets with a determined waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that the best way to warn the citizens of the threat would be through the nearby police station, Claire wandered around aimlessly, trying to find a good landmark before she paused to take a breather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff...huff...all of...this...huff...stupid weight!\" She growled, glaring down at her fattened form. \"Can't even...hooo...walk fifty feet...urgh...without getting winded!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of catching her breath, Claire once again continued her journey. However, before she got too far, felt an all too familiar trembling sensation in her gut, much to her chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please no...\" Claire pleaded, \"there can't possibly be anymore of those blobs still in me right?\" Claire knew she was wrong as she felt the trembling get stronger and stronger as seconds passed. Yet, as the trembling sensation grew stronger, and Claire could even see her gut shifting and churning, she didn't even feel like throwing up or coughing a blob up like she did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...weird...\" Claire muttered, placing a hand on her belly as the churning intensified to try and calm it, \"maybe it-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hello?</i>\" A voice called out, making Claire freeze in her tracks as she heard her own voice call out from nearby. \"<i>Hello is anybody out there? My name is Claire! I could sure use some help!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire anxiously looked around for a place to hide while trying to pacify her growling tummy, finally choosing to hide behind a stack of crates nearby as she heard footsteps approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had only just sat down when she heard the voice ring out not 5 feet from behind the other side of her hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Could've sworn I heard something...</i>\" She heard the doppelganger grumble in frustration. As Claire held her breath in fear, her stomach's groans and churning got ever louder and stronger as she even felt like her stomach was <b>pulling</b> her towards the fake Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on come on...</i> Claire screamed in her mind, <i>just leave already so this stupid gut can shut up!</i> Luckily, it seems that the clone hadn't heard anything as Claire heard a frustrated sigh emit, and footsteps getting softer and softer as they headed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god...\" Claire sighed as she finally let her breath out. \"Huh...my stomach is starting to clear up too...\" she noted as she felt the groans and gurgles start to get weaker and weaker as time progressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe it only acts up in their vicinity?</i> Claire thought, wondering if she could use her stomach as some kind of radar to let her know when the doppelgangers were close. Shrugging the thought off, Claire hoisted herself up, dusted herself off, and resumed her search for the police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that a nearby store would at least have a map of the city, Claire waddlef into a nearby convenience store and saw two doors leading into the back. However, once again she felt the familiar trembling in her gut, making her gulp nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" she whispered, \"hope I don't pick the wrong one...\" Sighing, and giving her belly a pat for good luck, Claire made her way towards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire stopped before the left door in the hallway. Her stomach churned violently, which brought her feelings of unease to an all time high. She knew that by this point, it would likely be best for her to turn tail and run away. However, she also knew that if she ran away now and ended up abandoning the chances of finding a map of the area, then wandering around aimlessly without a destination would yield more of a chance of running into those blobs again, and somehow she knew that if they found her wandering around...well they might not be so keen on leaving her mobile or even alive if they found her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pausing for a few more moments Claire cautiously cracked open the door just enough for her to at least see some of the room. It was a standard, if not compact office that the owners of the store most likely used for paperwork and after hour accounting. Claire could see that there was really only a desk, a chair, and a filing cabinet, with no signs or noises to indicate that anything else was in the room. What made her anxious about entering however, was the fact that the light had been left on. So either the owners had forgotten to hit the lights on the way out...or something else had turned them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Claire muttered, \"here goes nothing...\" As she slowly pushed the door open wider, she took a cautious glance around the room, and much to her relief, there was nothing lying in wait for her, though she didn't completely relax since the churning in her stomach hadn't lessened any since entering the room. Choosing to ignore the rumblings of her stomach, she quickly scanned the room to see if their was anything of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo!\" Claire exclaimed, her eyes locked on to a map of Raccoon City, and while the map itself was frayed lightly at the edges and some of the routes had obviously been worn away, Claire could still at least find her way around the city a lot easier now that she had a sense of direction to go towards. With a quick nod of approval, she folded the map up and tucked it away. After searching around for anything else in the area, Claire decided that nothing else there remained of use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back into the main lobby Claire looked around to see if there was anything else that she could use in the store. Money would likely be of no use to her seeing as how the city itself seemed to be in disarray, and that carrying cash around would likely give her position away if any change was involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe some food?</i> She thought to herself, before looking down at the rest of her figure in disgust before muttering, \"nah, with this much weight on me I better not...\" Looking around once more, she spotted what looked to be a crowbar, still surprisingly usable. \"This may be cliche,\" she noted bemusedly, her hands weighing the feel of the solid chunk of metal in her hands, \"but this could definitely be a good thing to keep around!\" Giving it a few test swings, she smiled. While it may not have been the ideal weapon, in the right hands it could definitely get her out of a tight spot. Unfortunately, as Claire swung her makeshift weapon around, she misjudged the trajectory on one of swing, and ended up knocking over some of the products on the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BANG!</b> Claire reeled back from the force of her crowbar meeting the shelf, the display emitting a loud noise as the contact left a sizable dent in the wood. However, the damage wasn't what worried Claire the most as she froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach began to churn wildly as Claire heard a door open down the hallway and footsteps moving towards her location at a frenzied pace. Claire looked around in fear, wondering if their was anywhere to go. Her eyes caught the door to what looked like a walk-in freezer that had a locking mechanism on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had just started to make her way towards it when she saw someone emerge from the hallway she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Huh!</i>\" The clone Claire exclaimed, \"<i>well if isn't the original tubby Claire! I didn't think you'd be up and about so soon!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire grimaced, knowing that if she didn't figure something out fast she probably would be forced to ingest the blob again, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Aw come on!</i>\" The doppelganger giggled sweetly, \"<i>you don't have to look that unhappy to see me! Besides, you might as well savor the last bits of conversation of your life as much as possible right?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if I'd let you get near me!\" Claire grunted, tensing as she sensed a fight approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Heh, I thought that would be the case.</i>\" Other Claire scoffed, rolling her eyes, \"<i>that's why the others and I agreed to make sure to tie up this loose end if you ever showed up.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Claire noticed something about the other Claire, while she definitely had the figure and body shape of her old weight, she was also a bit more...transparent, as if she was not yet complete, which wouldn't make sense unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire turned to her left just in time to catch a smaller blob leaping towards her, and on pure reflex and adrenaline she swung the crowbar, knocking the blob away from her and into the wall. Claire heard another rustling directly behind her and while she was a bit slower, she managed to spin around and swing the crowbar just fast enough to catch a second blob attempting to ambush her and meeting the same fate as it was launched into the other wall with a resounding splat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, turning back to her main threat, looked just in time to see the other Claire running towards her. Claire tried to duck, but ended up tripping over her own feet as her momentum threw her off balance. Luckily, this managed to work in her favor as she heard a rush of wind sail over her head as she heard the other Claire land behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire got up hurriedly, her mind working at a furious pace to figure out what she could do to get away when her eyes landed on the freezer door. Claire thought for a moment before realizing that with her current weight even if she made it outside the store she wouldn't be able to stay ahead of the blobs for even a moment, and so she bolted as fast as she could towards the freezer door, grunting in disapproval as she felt her belly, breasts, and thighs jiggle vigorously as she moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, as she entered the freezer, Claire saw that the lights were off, which would work to her advantage. Slamming the door shut, she hid behind a nearby stack of frozen goods which was fortunately big enough to conceal her presence and quite near to the door. Hearing the door ripped open, and seeing light emit from the doorway which housed her own silhouette. Claire waited for a moment before grabbing a nearby box of off-brand frozen yogurt and chunked the box further into the freezer, away from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smirks as the box clatters to the floor and she hears a 'gotcha' from the doorway. Hearing the doppelganger leap towards the back of the freezer Claire got up and rushed out of the room, slamming the door shut behind her and bolting the lock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Heh, nice one...</i>\" she hears from the other side of the door, \"<i>but aren't you forgetting two very important things?</i>\" Claire looked up in fear as she saw the two blobs rushing her. Unfortunately, the earlier fight, short as it was, left Claire much more fatigued than she thought, and she was immediately pinned down by the two gelatinous foes. Claire could only attempt to yell out as they once again entered her mouth, each one working their way into her body as Claire felt her belly inflating more and more by the second, with the rest of her body slowly following suite as the slimy intruders rapidly digested themselves and placed the newly formed fat all throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire groaned, leaning back against the freezer door as she felt too exhausted to move. Luckily, since the blobs had been smaller, Claire hadn't gained as much as she thought, but if her engorged gut, and larger breasts were anything to go by, she still felt a whole lot heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...\" Claire groaned, before attempting to get up from her sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Not so fast!</i>\" the other Claire called from beyond the door, making Claire freeze in place. \"<i>Be a dear and unlock the door for me please would you?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff...As if!\" Claire hissed at her, before slowly standing up and stumbling towards the door, or rather, she would have, if her body had moved any. \"W-What the hell?!?\" Claire grunted frustratedly, trying to move her limbs, but try as she might her body would not obey her commands. \"Oh no...\" Claire gulped as she realized in terror what had happened. The other Claire had played its moves perfectly, and despite Claire's evasion of her doppelganger's traps, the other Claire had known that even one blob meant that Claire's chances of survival were significantly reduced, as ingesting the blobs would let the other Claire gain control of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Claire!</i>\" Her doppelganger sung, \"<i>I'm waitiiiiiing...</i>\" as if the words issued some unspoken command, Claire suddenly felt her legs turn around and her arm begin to stretch out against her will. Claire tried to do something anything, but the most she could manage was a shuddering stifle of her arm's movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Claire growled as she tried to wrest control of her body back, \"I won't...let. You. Win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Huh, you're actually managing to fight back?</i>\" The other Claire called out with a hint of amazement lacing its tone, \"<i>you must either be really stubborn or actually strong-willed, but I'm afraid it ends here.</i>\" Suddenly, Claire gasped as her arm once again extended much quicker, grasping the lock of the door before she could react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>NO!</i> Claire screamed internally, <i>I have to keep fighting!</i> Claire knew it was over if she faltered for even a moment, and managed through using all of her willpower, to keep her hand rooted in place, the appendage simply grasping the lock, but not turning it. Claire remained locked in the stalemate, neither side yielding until finally...</span></div></div>",

Then, after finding out absolutely nothing on that end, she'd been stuffed silly by slimy balls of goo that fattened her into immobility, and then finally, after somehow waking up and thinking life had finally cut her some slack by letting her shrink down so she could move around, it turns out that they can make evil clones of her that can control the blobs. Oh, and said blobs can <i>control her body if they get inside her!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>So yeah, I'd file this under 'worst roadtrip I've ever taken.'</i></b> Claire snidely thought as she fought desperately to maintain as much control of her limbs, which were poised to unlock the door and let her copycat out, an outcome which would most certainly spell her doom. However, she knew it was a losing battle, she could feel her muscles burning from exertion, beads of sweat forming and running in thin rivulets down her face as she grit her teeth and stood her ground against the influence of the blobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Claaaaaaire~</i>\"  she heard the mimic sing from the other side of the door, \"<i>please open the door, it's getting a bit chilly in here, wouldn't want me to freeze to death? <b>Would you?</b></i>\" The other Claire's went from fake sweetness to a firm command as she finished her sentence, and the second she did, Claire felt her hands surge forward and grasp the lock as control was wrested from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Claire yelped, caught off guard by the sudden movement, her quick reflexes and reaction time being the only thing that saved her as she put everything she had into making sure she didn't undo the lock to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Claire, cut the crap!</i>\" She heard a bark from the other side as her twin raised her voice, a hint of anger now laced in, \"<i>your pitiful resistance was amusing at first but now it's growing tiresome! Open. This. <b>Door!</b></i> Once again Claire felt an external force trying to make her body act against her will, however, this time Claire was ready, as she steeled herself and pushed back against the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...about -huff huff- no?\" Claire panted, pouring sweat as she continued defending against the internal onslaught, \"there's...no way...in hell I'm letting you out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>CLAIRE REDFIELD!</b></i>\" She heard a roar emit from the other side, a furious set of loud pounds on the doorway following the furious cry from her doppelganger. \"<i><b>YOU OPEN THE D-DOOR T-THIS I-INSTANT OR I'LL-</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, freeze to death?\" Claire finished with a knowing grin, though her twin couldn't see it. \"You sounded a bit cold at the end there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>YOU DARE MOCK ME?!?</b></i>\" 'Claire' shrieked, slamming her fists against the door even harder as chunks of her fists turned into blobs and splintered off, showing that her body temperature was dropping, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled, she could hear desperation building in the fake's voice, and with every assault she laid onto the door, the less she force she poured into controlling Claire, who was able to finally start drawing her hands away from the lock. <i>So that means with one solid push...</i> Claire thought, bracing herself.The moment she felt a drop in the stalemate, she clenched her jaw tight and pulled herself back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a triumphant yell she flopped onto her back, her body jiggling as the layers of fat felt the force from her collision with the floor. Huffing and puffing after emerging victorious in the battle of wills, Claire grinned wearily up at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And That's...hoo...why you...don't mess...with a Redfield...\" Claire chuckled, pushing herself upright with her elbows back into a sitting position. Looking down at herself, she gave her arms and legs a few experimental flexes and and stretches to make sure she wasn't under any other blob based influences. Confirming that she was back in control of her body, she shakily rose to her feet and unlocked the door, peeking inside the freezer to find that the fake Claire had frozen solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...uh...that was quicker than I expected.\" Claire said, scratching the back of her head in surprise before the chill of the freezer met the skin of her bare belly, causing her to shiver. \"Brrrrr- just how cold is this thing?\" Looking at the temperature gauge on the inside wall, she noticed it measured 0 degrees Celsius. <i>Way colder than normal, but it worked out.</i> She shrugged and retrieved the crowbar she had previously dropped in the chaos. Grabbing the tool off the ground, she turned to the frozen Claire in the doorway and wound up a swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resounding crack, the icy countenance shattered into pieces as the metal tool made contact with Claire's foe. Immediately she noticed the pieces of her doppelganger shift back into a shapeless mass inside their prison of ice with no guiding intelligence to keep them together. Her victory now assured, Claire wiped her forehead with her arm to mop up her sweat, and closed the door to the freezer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally...it's over...\" Claire sighed to herself in relief. Taking a moment to survey the area, it seemed that the coast was clear. Sitting back down, she took a moment to catch her breath and review herself situation while taking a look at the map she had procured. \"Alright...So I'm over here at this convenience store...\" she pointed at her current location, \"so it seems like the Police Station is a bit further up ahead. Hopefully I don't run into any more me's on the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And also..I could do without the extra weight those blobs gave me,</i> she thought, shooting a grimace down as she silently wished she was able to get the blobs out of her. Just as the thought crossed her mind however, she felt a strange churning in her gut, and she placed a hand on her ballooned belly as it seemed to squirm underneath her touch. \"What the -mmph!\" She muttered before slamming her mouth shut as her stomach rumbled and she felt a familiar gooey substance shoot back up her throat. \"Agh! What the hell? Mmph!\" She blanched as she spit up the two smaller blobs from earlier, the masses now laying on the floor with the occasional quiver. \"Okay...okay I guess that worked out...\" she breathed, feeling a bit nauseous after practically vomiting out the two blobs. Fearfully, Claire tensed as she took a tentative step towards the blobs, waiting for the moment they would leap or dart towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...I'm just gonna go over...here...\" Claire awkwardly stuttered, before slowly walking past the two. Turning her head as she passed, she noticed that the blobs didn't seem to acknowledge her presence, and if she didn't see them occasionally twitch, she'd have thought they were dead. <i>Huh...I guess leaving them there is alright?</i> Claire decided, before the blobs suddenly darted a few inches to the right, making her squeak in surprise. \"Um...well then I guess they wanted to move right-\" the blobs darted right once again as she said the word 'right,' making her pause as she noticed the slight trend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let's test this...left?</i> She thought hesitantly, and sure enough, the moment she thought the word 'left,' the blobs started slowly moving to the left. \"No way...\" she breathed, \"can I actually...control them?\" Figuring a few more tests were in order, she mentally ordered the blobs to move left, right, towards her, and away from her, and sure enough, every time she issued a command either out loud or with her thoughts, the blobs followed the order without delay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...weird...I guess that must've happened when I beat that other me before after breaking free of her control? ,,,Doesn't matter I guess.\" Claire shook her head in dismissal, \"is there anything else I can- woah!\" Claire stumbled back, startled as her vision changed from looking at the blobs to seeing herself towering over her a few feet away. Fearfully lifting a hand to her face, she was surprised to see that through the weird point of view she saw the view of herself raise that same hand. Willing one of the blobs to head towards her, she jumped as she saw herself take up more of her vision as her view rocked slightly, as if scooting closer. \"I guess I can see through you guys too then? Neat!\" Claire chirped, seeing herself smile through the blob's vision. \"Can I get back to normal- ah there we go!\" She nodded as her vision turned back to her point of view. \"This should come in handy if the other versions of me can't control you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter figuring out her handy new ability to herd the blobs, she looked back towards the freezer and opened the door. <i>I wonder...</i> she thought pensively, before ordering the blob remnants that were once her doppelganger to vibrate in order to melt the ice they were trapped in. Surprisingly, the command was carried out as the ice melted off the blob remnants and the parts reformed into one bigger pile of goop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say it's best not to reveal this ability until I need it,\" Claire spoke thoughtfully to her entourage, \"don't want those fakes to get wind of this new advantage until absolutely necessary...so in that case...\" Claire took a breath before commanding all three blobs to head back towards her. Almost eagerly the blobs crawled towards her and made their way up towards her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Easy eas- mmph!\" Claire was cut off as the blobs entered her mouth, pushing her back down as she shuddered in discomfort from the feeling of each blob sliding down her throat, expanding her belly and piling on the pound as she passed her previous weight of 250 pounds and ended somewhere around 280 pounds due to the extra passenger. \"Oh...\" she groaned, rubbing her bigger belly in slight annoyance feeling the blobs within her squirm at her touch. \"I was gonna say not everyone at once...\" With a sigh, she got to her feet and headed out of the store, her destination clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Something's not right here...</i> Claire thought to herself as she slowly made her way through the back alleys of the city. Taking a glance around, everything seemed normal enough, at least for a deserted alleyway. Nothing except a few pieces of discarded paper, bottles, and other litter sparsely populating the ground. However, in the distance she could hear the faint wails of what sounded like a chorus of car alarms all going off at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell?\" The flabby female grunted as she moved herself a bit faster, trying to ignore the sensation of her fatter frame erupting into a cascade of jiggles, and the light squirming of the cargo stored of her rounded gut. \"Could've sworn I heard something-\" Claire froze as she heard a loud crash from the end of the corridor, subconsciously drawing the crowbar she'd acquired earlier just in case she needed to defend herself from any potential assailant. Taking a deep breath to calm herself, she silently made her way to the end of the alleyway and was about to take a peek, when she heard another sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"Ghuuuuhg...\"</i></b> Claire felt her breath hitch for half a second as she heard a groan from around the corner that sound vaguely human-like. However, the sound that was let out gave the impression as though whatever had made it was either very exhausted, or in a mind numbing amount of pain, as though the source was almost half dead. Claire cautiously poked her head out from the corner, and nearly vomited at the sight that greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had made the sound it seems, was humanoid enough, as the entity, or rather a group of <i>entities</i> bore the shapes and statures of average men and women. That was where the similarities ended however, as the gnarled gray hue of their cracked and mottled skin, and the blank white eyes, devoid of life, told the Redfield sister that if these things had once been human, they certainly weren't anymore. Added to that fact was that the group of things seemed to be readily engrossed in consuming <i>someone's corpse.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god...</i> Claire blanched, feeling bile rise up in her throat as the horrid stench of death and decay met her nostrils, <i>I have to get out of here, but this seems to be the only way to the police station...and I don't really feel backtracking would be the best option.</i> Suddenly, a familiar slithering sound caught her attention as the passengers in her stomach began to squirm more intensely. \"Oh not again...\" Claire gulped as she wildly looked around for the blobs she knew were in hiding somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a stroke of luck however, she seemed to not be the main target of the blobs for once as the insidious piles of goop leapt  down from the rooftops and landed in front of the creatures, giving pause to their feast and meeting the newcomers with a few moans as they began to shamble towards their new targets. What surprised Claire however, was that immediately the blobs moved and knocked down each of the monsters with inhuman efficiency, engulfing their bodies as they set to work. Claire's jaw dropped as she saw the bodies of the once-human abominations melting and dissolving into the masses of goo, which began to grow steadily larger as they added more mass to their forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had completed this process however, the woman watched as all of the blobs moved slower, and eventually went motionless while turning a sickly green hue. Claire wondered what could possibly have happened to the blobs, as they made no sign of wanting to go anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting a few minutes to see what they did, Claire shrugged and crept behind them, making sure to not kick any of the stray cans or other potential noise sources as she approached an abandoned bus that had crashed through a fence separating her from the next part of the street. Upon reaching the closed doors of the bus, she looked back once more to make sure none of the blobs had made an effort to follow her, sighing in relief once she'd confirmed them to be in the exact same spots as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Alrighty, now to pry this bad boy open!</i> The younger Redfield thought as she took her crowbar in hand and plunged it through the gap between the doors. With a few heavy tugs, they swung open, Claire proudly flexing an arm and giving it a prideful pat. <i>Heh, even if I am a complete butterball now, I still pack a punch when I need to!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the momentary celebration, she resumed her quest and boarded the bus. Unfortunately nothing seemed to be of use except for a few scattered bills laying around and some strewn suitcases and bags. She pocketed a bit of money and took a suitcase since she needed a change of clothes anyways, though she doubted that the money would be usable with the city in the ruined state it seemed to be in. The suitcase, she found upon opening up, was a bit more of an immediate help, as she found a black t-shirt and a pair of gray sweatpants that were practically in mint condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...at least now I won't be walking around practically naked anymore...\" Claire snorted as she slipped the t-shirt on easily enough under her tattered red jacket. The sweatpants gave her a bit more trouble, but after popping a few seems the stretchy material managed to fit her thick thighs and bigger butt quite well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to make sure everything was on straight, Claire decided her belly would just have to hang out like it was, huffing in annoyance as she exited the bus through the doors at the rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I thought only pregnant women had to deal with their gut hanging out like this...\" Claire groaned, the slimy occupants of said tummy squirming outwards as if to make a point, \"oh don't give me that! I'm not you guys' mom.\" She rolled her eyes as she realized the absurdity of her situation, \"besides, I don't think the doctors would believe me being preggers with a couple of slime babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of the slow walk she was doing, and a number of pokes to her belly in a futile attempt to quite her allies, she had finally reached her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Raccoon City Police Department...\" She whispered to herself, \"I hope there's someone here who knows what the hell is going on...\" The building looked like it had seen better days, with most of the brickwork looking worn and weathered by time, however, the sturdy set of wooden double doors conveyed that at least some, if not all, of the place had been well kept. At least, until recent events had transpired. Grunting as she shoved a door open, Claire jumped as the door slammed shut behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no reason to go back outside, she took a look around and saw that she had entered into what looked to be the Main Hall of the station, a few doors on either side of her. What seemed to be a visitor's desk was set up in the middle of the hall, with a peculiar looking statue that carried the image of a Unicorn a small distance behind that. With nothing and no one else in the room with her, Claire found it best to check the visitor's desk out first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she had been happy to find that a phone lay on the desk, but her joy was quickly silenced as she found that the phone was unable to make any calls out, only met with static at each attempt. The other two items, she found, weren't much better, as she acquired a box of rounds that looked perfect for a handgun, if she had one, and a set of ink ribbons that were presumably used for the typewriter that lay on the other half of the desk in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no harm in taking a break, Claire chuckled and figured she might as well use the typewriter to note down her experiences in the city so far. <i>Not like anyone will read it, but hey, it's been a hell of a day...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter typing out her story thus far, Claire stood up and pocketed the box of handgun cartridges. She figured it would be best to keep them around in case she actually <i>did</i> manage to find a proper home for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around to view each of the doors to the station she narrowed down her choice of available options to one door, as the other two seemed to be locked by a security mechanism that needed the swipe or scan of a keycard. Sighing, Claire made her way through the door of the section labeled \"West Office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she made it inside, she looked around, frowning at the haphazard state of the room as many books, documents, cups, and other articles were strewn about the tables and floor the room possessed.

A sudden sound caught her attention as she tensed up, looking around and finding that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another one of those monsters, but in an officer's uniform!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slowly limped and lumbered it's way toward the chubbier Claire, arms stretched towards her with a dead look in it's eyes as it moaned, \"<b>Guuuuuuuhhhgg...</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReadily arming herself with a nearby wooden chair, Claire prepared to strike down the dead-looking monstrosity before her. However, the blobs that reside with her taut stomach had other plans, as her belly burgled profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not now...\" Claire muttered, just as she involuntarily regurgitated the four basketball-sized blobs from her systems. From there, the four blobs surprisingly lunged at the undead creature, smothering it in their mucus-coated gelatinous forms, devouring it in a corrosive manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, the only things that remained of what Claire could only presume was once human were nothing but tattered dissolved remains of a police uniform. Claire noticed that the four blobs that \"rescued\" her from the monster looked noticeably bigger in size and mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Is it just me, or are those blobs...bigger?</i>\" Claire thought to herself, but despite the rescue, the four blobs then promptly returned to their \"mother's\" womb, but not before Claire pleaded, \"No, please wait-! *GLUP!!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like so, the blobs began to forcefully insert themselves back down into Claire's gullet and stomach, causing her already plump stomach to bloat out even more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this sudden surge of increased weight took a hit on her center of gravity, as she stumbled back onto a nearby wooden bench, clenching her now larger stomach in major discomfort. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!! You could've at least give me a minute before you--\" Claire exclaimed, only to stop mid-sentence when she suddenly began to feel something...\"peculiarly hefty\" regarding her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>...Is...I-Is it just me, or am I getting fatter?</i>\" Claire thought, as she noticed that her already plump physique looked to be increasing in girth and bulk...but is it, though?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately for Claire, her current assumption proved absolutely correct, as she began to witness her boobs press tighter against her shirt, while she felt a wave of fat encompass her legs and butt, making the already tight feeling sweatpants that covered her butt feel almost suffocating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Craaaaap...\" she moaned in discomfort, standing up as best as she could. \"I-<b>URP</b> better get to a mirror quick...\" she declared sickly, letting out a belch that signaled a bout of indigestion. Justifiable, considering the blobs' 'meal' was pretty much rotting meat. Huffing as she slowly waddled, \"<i>great, can't even walk normally now,</i>\" she sighed as she spotted a full body mirror on the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, she didn't grew as much as she thought she did. As opposed to the fifty pound minimum that each previous weight gain had added she seemed to have only gained fifteen or so pounds. So while it was still a noticeable gain, with her bust, rear, and face all developing another half inch or so of fat, it wasn't something that would render her immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can still move around, so that's something at least...\" Claire grimaced, turning around to inspect the rest of her frame. \"You four cannot jump the gun like that again though! Anymore stunts like that and we might really be stuck if I pack on too many pounds!\" Her belly churned and gurgled in what she <i>hoped</i> was an affirmative, before she got fed up and decided to inspect what was left of her adversary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering herself onto her knees, Claire peered over her belly and rifled through the slime-ridden garments, which luckily no longer posed any threat to her well being as she felt no sting or stab that would signal the dissolving of her skin. Reaching into the pockets of the shirt and pants, she managed to recover a relatively intact letter, and a Blue Keycard from the back pocket of the work pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should come in handy for those doors outside if I'm right...now let's see about this letter...\" Unfurling the wrinkled piece of parchment, she quickly read through the contents. She discovered that the monster had once been a part of the Raccoon City Police Department named Marvin Branagh, who had been helping people in the city evacuate after the start of some massive outbreak that was caused by some unknown source that rendered the corpses of the dead able to move around and turn other people into one of them. From the later half of the letter, Branagh believed himself to be beyond help, and had been knocked unconscious before waking up to one of his rookie officers who went by the name of \"Leon S. Kennedy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, the officer, believing himself to be fatally wounded, sent the other away to escape without him, before Branagh began to mutate. The final words were illegible, devolving from a jumble of words to random scrawls of ink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must've found him not too long after he turned...\" Claire surmised, frowning as she was hit with a wave of sorrow at the man's untimely end, \"but these things, are they zombies or something? They seem to fit the bill at least...\" She shook her head, heaving herself up to the ground and leaning back against the table as she pondered what to do next. \"Well...if this 'Leon' guy is still around, maybe I have chance of running into him and teaming up...after all, between these zombies and blob creatures, I'll need all the help I can get.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that was her best bet, Claire dusted herself off and made her way back into the Main Hall. Upon exiting the West Office, she heard a click, and looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell?\" She muttered, before jiggling the door handle, realizing that it no longer gave way, but remained firmly in place, \"guess I'm not going back in there anytime soon...\" Shaking her head, she walked back over to the visitor's desk, noticing a place to swipe the keycard she'd obtained. After doing so, she heard the sound of an affirmative 'beep' from both sides of her, and the clicks of two tumblers unlocking soon after. \"Guess that did it!\" Claire cheered, pumping her fist victoriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to try the right side of the floor after trying one on the left already, she wandered inside the section labeled \"Reception Desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, as soon as she entered, she heard the familiar moan of what she now knew to be zombies, the smell giving them away only slightly after the sound. Sighing as she pulled her crowbar out for action, and her survival knife from her shoulder holster in her off hand, she turned the corner and saw two zombies. As luck would have it though, the two seemed to be unaware of her presence as they simply stared blankly at the wall in front of them, engrossed in whatever the undead might think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This should be simple enough!</i> Claire smirked, preparing to creep up and dispose of the two as silently as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Graaaaagh!</b>\" A moan directly in her ear made her shriek as she spun around, nearly falling over from her own momentum as she realized that she'd failed to spot a third zombie hiding in the other corner from the side she'd entered. Catching her off guard, the zombie pinned her to the ground on her back, eagerly opening its maw in an attempt to chomp down on her flab ridden flesh. Unfortunately for this zombie, Claire Redfield was far from a helpless damsel in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET. The HELL. Off ME!\" Claire cried out, punctuating each cry with a gloved punch or a kick to the zombie's body. With one final well placed shove from both feet, she threw her assailant away from her, quickly sitting up and recovering her crowbar and knife after having dropped them in the previous ambush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Gruuuuughhh! Graaaarrrg!</b>\" A pair of moans from behind her made her pale as she swiveled her head around only to confirm her fear that the other two zombies had been alerted to her intrusion, coming to help their undead comrade in arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Urrrrgh...this isn't good...</i> Claire thought nervously, <i>as slow as these guys are they have me on both sides, and if I get bit by them...</i> the woman gulped. She had no desire to join the city wide body count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if picking the perfect opportunity to remind her of their use, the blobs within her squirmed heavily as her belly rocked back and forth, nearly knocking her off balance. <i>Much as I'd hate to, I might have to use them again...but how much would I gain?</i> Claire grit her teeth. Either she took them on alone and risked getting herself injured or worse, or she used her commanding nature of the blobs and payed the price in literal pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second or two, Claire sighed and shifted her body, deciding to...</span></div></div>",

That's...weird It's as if those blobs are depositing their extra mass into me.

Maybe I- woah!\" Claire yelped as her legs wobbled beneath her, the burn from holding her fattened form up finally reminding her of its existence as she fell backwards. Luckily for her, the impact from her less than lithe frame was hardly felt as the newly added supply of fat distributed to her butt provided a more than ample cushion to land on. With a grunt, she sat back and grimaced as she felt most of her body quiver violently,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...nevermind, guess I just had a quick second wind there. Hoof...\" Claire sighed as she wiped away the thin sheen of sweat that had developed on her brow. Looking down at herself, she realized that only after two rooms, she was totally winded without even breaking out into a run. Claire knew this lack of stamina would do her no favors in the near future, as there were doubtlessly a vast supply of zombies still left to fight through in the rest of the police station, and if she had to resort to using her newfound slime-based troops in every single encounter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God...I need to find a firearm or something soon...or I won't be able to walk myself out of here...\" Claire placed a hand on her protruding gut that provided most of the mass to her body at this point, feeling her backup move within, almost as if responding to her touch. She spent a few minutes like this, idly poking her stomach and sitting back in order to catch her breath before moving on. Finally, after she felt most of her strength return to her legs, Claire heaved herself onto her feet with a groan, pondering where to go next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, since the door doesn't seem to be locked...</i> Claire placed a hand on her chin thoughtfully, <i>guess continuing this way couldn't hurt.</i> With a shrug, Claire tentatively made her way through the door at the back of the Reception Office and carefully cracked the door open. What met her eyes was a narrow, darkened, dilapidated hallway that had most certainly seen better days some years ago. Stray sheets of paper were strewn across the floor, desks haphazardly lying in a stack probably meant to serve as some sort of makeshift barricade, and worst of all, the scent of iron and streaks of blood lining a good portion of the tiling. Claire gulped as she surveyed the area as best she could, taking in the signs of an obvious struggle that had occurred quite recently, if the bright color of the blood was anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not the most encouraging sight...but I guess I'll have to come through here at some point anyway...</i> Claire steeled herself with a light smack to the face. Holding her knife in one hand at the ready, she gave the door a push, grabbing the knob and halting its momentum just before it hit the wall on the side of the hall. With the maximum amount of stealth a person of her size could muster, Claire slowly made her way towards the corner of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Dlop</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of liquid hitting the ground stopped her in her tracks. <i>Is there a leak in the pipes or something? I didn't notice any-</i> Looking up, Claire covered her mouth, nearly screaming as she discovered the source of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat lay perched on the ceiling was an abomination of the most grotesque manner, that Claire found a hard time stomaching the mere sight of the creature. Unlike the zombies, which had looked no different from their human counterparts except for mottled skin and rotting flesh, this monster defied the form of humanity itself. The thing seemed to possess no skin at all, the vague similarities of a human body on display, musculature and sinew exposed to the elements. Its head, somehow being overtaken by its own <i>brain,</i> was roughly around the same size as a person's, however, the lack of eyes and nose, in combination with a mouth that sported elongated teeth perfect for ripping meat, left no room for doubt that this thing was anything but human. Added to that, it sported a set of wickedly sharp claws that glinted in the moonlight, serving to highlight the lethal capabilities each heinous talon possessed. The only \"odd\" thing that Claire could truly find about the creature was its abnormally long tongue that flicked idly back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ohmygodohmygodohmygod...</i> Claire panicked, fighting the urge to sprint from the room right then and there, partly because she knew such a feat was nearly impossible at her current weight, and partly because for some reason, despite being directly in front of her on the ceiling, the thing hadn't made any sort of move to attack her. <i>It's blind...</i> Claire realized, a smile of relief adorning her face, <i>with the way its brain grew it must have lost is ability to see! Lucky!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Guuuraghlll...</b>\" The garbled gurgle of a zombie made her snap her focus towards the next part of the room past the ceiling crawler. <i>Oh great...</i> Claire thought, <i>more company...</i> to the Redfield sister's chagrin, it seemed that a pair of zombies had noticed her and were currently shambling their way towards her, the slow gait of an undead human sounding out as their feet scraped the ground beneath them. As soon as this occurred however, Claire saw the creature above her snap its neck in the direction of the approaching assailants. At an inhuman speed, Claire watched the creature's tongue lash out at one of the zombies, puncturing the forehead with calculated precision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire watched the zombie fall over, truly dead, from the creature's lightning quick assault. <i>Okaaay...guess it definitely isn't deaf though...good thing I didn't move or else I'd end up like that zombie. Now all I have to do is wait-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>Grrrrrglllorp</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Claire squeaked, her heart racing as she realized that her stomach had picked the <i>worst</i> time in her life to remind her that she hadn't eaten for quite some time. Unfortunately for her, this sound was easily picked up by the creature as it turned to address its rotund intruder. Once more, its tongue shot at, aiming to bore a hole into Claire's cranium and end her life. Unlike the zombie however, Claire knew she had one option left to take. Opening her mouth in tandem with the creature's, she felt one of her blob-like bodyguard's surge forth and move to block the blow, encompassing the end of the monster's tongue as the rest of its brethren emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys take care of that thing!\" Claire ordered, \"I'll deal with the small fry!\" With their objective clear, the group of blobs raced to engage the most pressing threat as a unit, swiftly tackling the Licker and unseating it from its resting place on the ceiling of the hall. With a nod of approval, Claire, now freed of a bit of weight now that her troops were out and about, jogged over to the zombie, who began the fight with a clumsy swipe of its hand, obviously trying to grab a hold of Claire so that it could take a chunk or two out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme a break!\" Claire scoffed, easily weaving her way out of the blow, \"I coulda dodged even if i was <i>twice</i> as heavy!\" Even though the zombie possessed no sense of pride, or even a semblance of recognition of what a taunt was, Claire liked to think that the growl and the aggressive lunge that followed was a sign her words had angered her opponent. With a cocky smirk, Claire waited for her chance, the zombie nearly falling on top of her, until finally she kicked a foot out, tripping the zombie, and in a surprisingly swift move, spun around and embedded her knife in the back of the zombie's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...better luck next time buddy!\" Claire laughed triumphantly, placing a hand on her hip, until she realized she was showing to nobody except a dead zombie, an unholy abomination, and four or so slimes that obeyed her every command. Seeing this, she blushed and scratched the back of her head in embarrassment as she found that her vanguard had long since finished off their adversary, and looked...abnormally large for it, even larger than when they'd consumed the group of three from before, coming up to Claire's waist in height instead of ankle height as normal. And speaking of zombies, Claire noticed that while she'd surveyed the aftermath of the fight, the smallest blob of the group had already broken down the zombie she'd killed and grown accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing as she knew what was coming, Claire rolled her eyes and gestured with her hand, \"I'd better be able to walk after this...\" she growled in annoyance, but nonetheless opened her mouth in resignation as the blobs made their way towards her, not deterred in the slightest by the exasperation their matriarch showed. One by one the slimy supporters entered Claire's maw, and bit by bit Claire grew, wincing as she felt her clothes, which had been a little baggy before, fill out more and more until she thought she might burst out of them. Her shirt was nearly skintight, wrapping around her even larger bust as though it were more or less a makeshift bra rather than a T-shirt, the garment having ridden up, leaving her entire belly exposed to the world. Her sweatpants weren't faring much better, looking like they were going to split any second, and by some miracle holding on. Added to that, Claire could feel another chin in development as her face was adorned with even more pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her initial disgust however, Claire felt a strange...satisfaction from the growth. <i>Huh...that wasn't so bad...it actually felt...kinda good. Wonder if I could get any bigger? I'm only around 350 pounds so-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" She yelled, shaking her head as she started breathing heavily, \"if I get any bigger I won't be able to move! I can barely walk like this as is! Even if that did feel...fine.\" Claire shuddered...she couldn't possibly be becoming addicted to this weight gain could she, or was this a side effect of ingesting the blobs time and time again? As she came across the next hall and saw two more zombies...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Claire entered the next hallway, she quickly noticed that the state of disrepair in the police station was not merely limited to the main hall, which made sense considering how quickly the rest of the city had gone downhill upon her arrival. However, despite the only source of illumination being the moonlight leaking in from the windows spread across the hall, Claire could easily see two zombies vacantly loitering further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the two from before, these were far enough away and engrossed in their own enigmatic actions to notice the tubby Redfield sibling. <i>Perfect, I should be able to take them down silently if I don't make any noise.</i> Claire thought, stealthily tiptoeing, or in reality, lumbering slowly over to get closer to the pair of undead. Just as she readied her knife, a feeling began to well up within her. It was a tiny thing at first, no more than an inkling of a thought of how hungry she was. However, the feeling began to intensify, building up more and more until she felt a predatory grin form on her face as she leered at her targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine...\" she whispered, licking her lips in anticipation as she quickly opened her maw. Before she could even contemplate her actions, the blobs within her burst out of her mouth, each one flying out of the orifice and hitting the ground in uniform fashion with a resounding <b>*SPLAT*</b>. This of course, finally caught the attention of the two unfortunate rotting bystanders, who slowly turned to face the source of the sudden noise. Unfortunately for them, by the time they had registered that there was something else in the room to address, the blobs had already overwhelmed their prey, slamming the two poor creatures onto their backs while they flailed their arms in a futile attempt to escape their assailants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was going on, Claire eagerly stared with pleased, almost ecstatic look that would signal to anyone else that something might be amiss with her mental disposition. Breathing heavily, she watched as her brood took down and absorbed their prey with practiced ease. After no more than two minutes the blobs returned to their leader, who awaited them with an open mouth and a prideful grin adorning her face. With no further actions required, the blobs quickly made their way back inside Claire, who gulped them back down with a delighted groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh <i>hell</i> yes!\" She said, nearly <i>moaning</i> in pleasure as she felt her body begin to expand from the two fresh kills the blobs had brought her. Her belly extended a few centimeters more, quietly filling out another roll on her sides as the blobs squirmed within after distributing their acquired calories back to their ravenous caretaker. Her breasts pushed the confines of her shirt even further, an audible pop being heard as seams began to split, however the shirt held on despite the internal abuse of the garment. Claire's rear did not shy away from accepting its fair share of fat as it also sought to burst out of its coverings, a few rips on the thighs of her sweatpants as the skin of these veritable tree trunks was slightly exposed to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the growth came to a close, Claire blinked, finally regaining her train of thought as her breathing began to slow, and her heart stopped racing a million miles a minute long enough for her to realize what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the hell?\" She breathed, eyes taking in her now heavier form, which was about 10 or 15 pounds heavier than before if she had to guess. Not nearly as huge a jump as her previous growth, but still... \"D-Did I summon them without thinking? It's like something...took over when I wasn't paying attention...\" This revelation worried Claire, as she was already wary about her severely hampered mobility as it was, but if she continued to keep summoning the blobs at this rate to solve every little problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better keep moving...\" She decided with a shake of her head, \"I'll just have to try and keep myself from using them for now.\" Continuing on, Claire let out a frustrated sigh as she found that her already lumbering gait was just a tad slower than before, not doing anything to assuage her fears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking inside the first door she came across a room that seemed like it had been used quite recently, as a cluster of desks that looked hastily grouped together were surrounding a chalkboard at the other side of the room across from the door. Documents were scattered around the floor, as though a tornado had previously made its way through the room and thrown everything to the ground before she had arrived, while a crude sketch of what Claire assumed was the station's layout was drawn on the chalkboard itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through most of the documents, Claire found that there wasn't much information to be had in a good number of them, either pertaining to daily affairs or a record of meetings long since passed. There were even a few laden with numerous doodles talking about another city named \"RedGrave\" or something, and a few supernatural incidents that had occurred there. Claire thought this one odd at first, but then re-evaluated her current situation and the events that led to it, and figured that sometimes, reality proved to be stranger than fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last document she came across however, was much more recent than the others, and held within its pages a few things that piqued Claire's interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe document was a report on how the Police Department planned to tackle the zombie outbreak after the initial wave of zombies had begun to spread throughout the city. What baffled Claire, was the way they handled the distribution of armaments and ammunition throughout the police force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Chief just decided to throw weapons and ammo in separate random places?\" She scoffed, not believing what she was reading, \"that's a pretty tactically inept decision in my book. If I didn't know any better, I'd say he <i>wanted</i> this place to go under...\" Luckily, upon reading further she discovered that a good chunk of weaponry remained in the underground weapon storage facility, but unfortunately the keycard to open said facility was currently missing as of the report's creation. \"Fantastic,\" Claire muttered, rubbing her temple in annoyance, \"I guess that's another thing to keep a lookout for, that and the fuse to get the power back on...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most interesting thing she found in the report, was that three victims had already fallen to the same foul beast she'd encountered only minutes before. For lack of a better name, the recorder had taken to calling this creature a \"Licker\" in reference to its abnormally long and razor sharp tongue. Unfortunately, besides the name, no other information on how to handle them had been recorded at that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll have to figure something out before I come face to face with another one of those...\" Claire muttered, before wincing, \"unless I want to get even closer to becoming a beached whale that is.\" Sighing, Claire closed the document, figuring that at least she found a goal to work towards if nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading out of the room, Claire went back down the hallway she previously scoured, and headed further in towards the side she hadn't yet explored. Upon entering the next room, she took a look around and discovered she was at a crossroads. To her left was a staircase that led to the second floor of the station, and based on the map she glanced over on the chalkboard earlier, the office where her brother worked at was only a few rooms away. On the other hand, there were still two rooms she had yet to investigate, and she knew that the two could have tools that could prove to be valuable in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I came here to find Chris...\" Claire tapped her chin(s) in thought while furrowing her brow as she considered her options, \"but charging on ahead without taking it slow got me into this entire mess in the first place.\" She took a glance back at the stairs, and then stared down at herself. <i>Also I <b>really</b> am not looking forward to hauling myself up that flight of stairs.</i> Once she came to a decision, she looked up, and headed over to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Contemplating on her next move, Claire looked back at the staircase, then looked toward where the remaining two rooms were located. She needed to know that her brother at least got out of the city before things took a nosedive. From there, cupped the lower hem of her blubbery stomach in mixed feelings of frustration and mild annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* ...I guess I got no choice to head upstairs if I want to know what happened to Chris.\" She said to herself, where she began what would be an arduous climb up what was measly a flight of stair. Or at least, back when she didn't weigh 350 pounds. First, she clamped onto the staircase railing with a left meaty hand for support in case her girth and \"passengers\" had other ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Here goes nothing. God, I'm gonna hate this.\" She frustratingly remarked, where Claire began to slowly lumber her wide self up each step, feeling a bit more winded with every 2 to 3 steps, as a thin stream of sweat cascaded down her cherubic face. Alas, as she was halfway there, Claire soon felt her slimy bodyguards squirming about, as if they were irritated or whining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brow furrowed in mild annoyance, briefly slapping her spare tire of a belly in response to the gurgling, frustratingly muttering, \"Will you stop that?! I know you guys probably hate stairs, but I'm still the one in charge here. Got it?\" Surprisingly, as if they read her mind, the slimes stopped gurgling inside her, as if to convey an affirmative answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmph. Finally, something we can apparently agree on apparently.\" Claire retorted, only for her subconscious to  overlay her thoughts for a brief moment as they said, <i>\"I just hope I haven't upset them or anything.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*growl* Stop that, Claire!\" She exclaimed to herself, lightly smacking the side of her head to refocus herself. Eventually, after what felt like several hours, Claire finally reached the top of the stairs, much to the chagrin of her established girth, panting and huffing in a exerted manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*huff* *huff* *huff* Okay... I am not...*huff* *huff*...Going up stairs like this again, *huff* that's *huff* *huff* ...for sure.\" Claire panted, feeling the fatigue of weighing over 300 pounds. Suffice to say, it certainly put things in perspective for the female Redfield, whilst she took a momentary respite to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head to the left and saw a doorway that will probably lead her to where her brother and his friends work at. Hopefully. Meanwhile, in front of her, she noticed a bronze Lion statue before her, propping it's right forepaw upon an equally bronze kite shield, which appeared to contain something inside it, with three symbols upon a pedestal the statue stood upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, looking to her right, there was another door, only it had what appeared to be a crystalline spade symbol adorned upon the door. How strange. Weighing her options while she caught her breath, Claire eventually decided to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That statue looks a bit odd...\" Claire muttered, taking a closer look at the stony visage of the king of the jungle. \"What are these symbols for?\" She scratched her cheek in confusion after catching sight of a few parts of the statue's base that looked like dials. The pictures themselves were of different objects or animals that seemed to have no real relevance to each other as far as Claire could tell. One was a branch, another a picture of the head of the statue's subject itself, and a bird as the final symbol. \"I wonder what these could...oh!\" Claire blinked as she ran her hand over the image of the lion trying to press it, only to find that it rotated instead of depressing inwards as she thought it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...so this seems like a match the symbols game...\" Claire observed, finding that all three of the sections rotated between the aforementioned set of pictures. As far as Claire could tell, once she actually found the right combination she'd simply let it sit and then wait for...<i>something</i> to happen. \"Only thing is I don't know the combination that works...\" Claire sighed, knowing that she'd probably have to go somewhere else to figure out what pictures would provide the right combo. However, as she went to step away to look elsewhere, the burn in her leg muscles reminded her of the arduous journey they'd weathered to make it to the statue in the first place. \"Yep, screw that!\" Claire growled, turning right back around to face the statue, \"I'm <i>still</i> winded from those stairs, so no way in hell am I running around this godforsaken place when I'm as fat as baby hippo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNostrils flaring in frustration, Claire set about solving the puzzle the only way she knew how. Trial, error, and a whole lot of patience on her part. First up, she figured she'd go with eagle, eagle, eagle. \"Nope, nothing...\" Claire huffed, before planting an elbow tiredly on the statue and resting her head in her hand. Eagle, branch eagle? No dice. Eagle, eagle, branch? Nadda. \"I'm gonna be here for a bit I guess.\" Claire muttered, looking around the room before spotting a chair that would hopefully hold her rather hefty body. \"Just gonna go ahead and use this to get a little more comfy...\" After pulling the chair over and wincing as the chair protested with a rather loud set of creaks, Claire smiled in relief that it hadn't crumpled underneath her before getting back to the task at hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Many tries later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my Gooooood!\" Claire groaned, slamming a hand down in frustration for the umpteenth time as nothing happened with the combination she'd tried. \"Who even built something like this! Whose mind was twisted enough?\" She laughed, placing a hand over her eyes as she continued to rant, \"oh look at me, I'm an architect who set a <i>statue of a lion</i> up with some stupid locker combination like lion, branch, eagle and expected people to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*DING! Skkrrrrrrrrt*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire paused after hearing the chipper tone and what sounded like stone scraping against itself before looking up from her annoyed rambling. Sure enough, after uncovering her eyes her vision registered that against all odds she'd finally \"solved\" the puzzle completely by accident. Claire's face was blank at first, before a grin slowly began to form, \"hah! and Chris said my 'brute smarts' would never get me anywhere!\" Heaving herself up back to a standing position, she reached inside to pull out a rather heavy hunk of bronze with the face of yet another lion, looking as ferocious as it did in the statue. \"Well, go figure I guess,\" Claire shrugged, wondering what she could possibly use this thing for. \"Maybe I could stuff it in a zombie's mouth whenever they try to bite me? Nah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire huffed to herself. The nerve of this statue's commissioner! Making a girl climb a flight of stairs only to solve some dumb puzzle and not even put anything <i>good</i> in the statue as a reward for solving it? \"Ah forget this!\" Claire raised the hunk of metal in anger and went to hurl it at the wall before remembering something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Earlier...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Back when Claire had first entered the Raccoon City Police Station, and been 100 pounds lighter, she'd come across something in the main hall that gave her pause. It was another statue of what Claire presumed was some significant historical figure. What caught her eye about it was the three indentations near the bottom of the statue's foundation. \"Almost like something would fit in there...\" Claire guessed. At that moment in time however, Claire had no tools or information of any sort that might be of use to her, and so she continued on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Presently...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...just maybe...\" Claire hesitated, bringing the Bronze Lion disc back down to her face to look at it once more. It seemed to be the right shape and size of the holes in the entrance's statue to her. \"Only one way to find out I guess...\" She declared, looking behind the Lion statue to see a railing, and more importantly, the distant image of the main statue and the entrance hall she'd arrived through. Unfortunately, the only way down to get there was a rather large set of... \"stairs...\" Claire blanched, her daycare's worth of blobs squirming lightly at her words. \"Yeah that's a haaaaard pass on that!\" She told her belly, patting it reassuringly, \"buuuuuuuut I have an idea!\" She smiled, opening her mouth, and swiftly closing it after one of the blobs had exited her maw as planned, though it seemed to tilt its mass around in confusion after spotting no enemies in the immediate area. Turning back to its glorified babysitter, it began to slow climb back up Claire's leg, before halting as the woman in question held a hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on there little guy,\" Claire chuckled, \"I need you to take this over to that statue and put it into one of the holes at the bottom of it.\" she held out the medallion to the blob, before pointing to its intended destination. The blob turned to where her finger pointed, and then back to her before quivering lightly as if nodding to show that it understood her request. The blob then took the Lion Medallion into its mass before rushing off as quick as it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire watched with bated breath as it trekked down the stairs and to the Main Hall's centerpiece. Once there she squinted her eyes in concentration as she focused in on her courier deposit the metal ring into one of the indentations. After it did so, Claire waited for a few seconds, before hearing a faint *click* and the sound of stone moving. Looking down at the statue, she saw that it had sank just slightly, and one of the marble and limestone rings had unfurled itself from the platform the statue's figure was resting on. \"Huh. I guess that worked!\" Claire nodded to herself. Now she at least had a goal to work towards after finding information on Chris' whereabouts. \"Finding the two other medallions is gonna be hell if they aren't in two more of those statues though...ah well no use sweating it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on back!</i> She thought, hoping that her mental link with the blob wouldn't peter out at this range. Luckily, it seemed that her message had been received as she watched her charge slowly make its way back to her. Once it arrived, it paused at her feet to her surprise, as normally it would have eagerly leapt up to get back to its brethren contained within her stomach. \"What's wrong? Not feeling it?\" Getting down on her knees, she held a hand out to the blob and gestured it forward, \"come on, I'll let you back out later I promise!\" Despite her coaxing, the blob still seemed hesitant to return, however, it did move closer to her hand and almost seemed to lean into it- \"ohhhh I see.\" Claire rolled her eyes as she chuckled, running a hand over the blob and patting it a few times, feeling the viscous liquid it was composed of wet her hand a bit. This grossed her out slightly, but by this point she was housing an entire team of six inside her so she maintained her composure as she showered her ally with light praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a good job little guy, keep up the good work!\" She smiled warmly at it. With that, the blob finally seemed satisfied as it made its way into her waiting mouth and slid back into its home. \"Alrighty...next up...\" Claire grunted, getting back to her feet, \"figure out where Chris is. Now if I remember that drawing on the board, the S.T.A.R.S office was... that way!\" She snapped her fingers and looked back down the hallway to her left as she recalled the layout of the second floor the drawing had conveyed. Beginning her journey once more...Claire smiled to herself, <i>maybe having these little rascals around isn't so bad...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter continuing on Claire came back to the choice she'd had before. Either check out the door with what looked like the symbol of a crystal spade adorning it, or the much more normal door that seemed to be the right direction to the S.T.A.R.S office?</span></div></div>",

I mean...if <i>I</i> can do it like this...\" She directed a pointed stare at her rotund body. Fortunately, the light deprecation did provide some much needed reassurance for Claire as she started to calm down a bit, letting her think a bit more clearly. \"Alright, now if I remember that drawing, the office I'm looking for should be...this door.\" She stopped in front of a door that bore a logo composed of three bright yellow stars encased in a blue ring with white trim. However, just in case one couldn't grasp what the logo itself meant, the ring extended itself to include the word \"S.T.A.R.S\" above the namesakes images that were also encircled between \"Raccoon Police DEP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheering silently at the possibility of reaching her goal, Claire opened the door to see an office that was in slight disarray. However, compared to the state of the rest of the Police Station, the state the room was in was by far the cleanest Claire had yet to lay eyes on. Multiple desks were connected throughout the room, and each had their own desktop computer which was surrounded by multiple important looking documents and files. However, as Claire looked to her left and right throughout the room, she frowned as she realized the person she came for was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Chris...where could you be...\" she whispered sadly, shaking her head as she once again had no clue on where her beloved sibling might be. \"Maybe his desk might have something?\" Claire wondered, before lumbering over to the desk with her brother's nameplate adorning it. Sifting through the documents, she finally came upon one letter that was addressed to the other members of S.T.A.R.S.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my bestest S.T.A.R.S. buds,\" Claire fought back a giggle, but failed to snifle a small snort that escaped her nose. Shaking her head, Claire read the body of the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>How are you all doing in that drab, old station? Hanging in there against old Irons? Me? I just got back from a date with a hot chick. Bet you can guess what we got up to under her extra-large umbrella. Europe is amazing. One month is in no way enough to even scratch the surface. Maybe I'll extend my vacation for another six months. Barry, don't you even think of coming to join me. Wouldn't want to make all the cute girls cry, yeah? So you just leave the babes to me. Jill, if Claire tries to contact you, please let her know I'm OK.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, Chris Redfield, my brother? And a 'hot chick?'\" Claire snickered as she finished reading the document with as much of a straight face as she could, \"yeah, now I know something is up...at least I know wherever he is, he's fine.\" Claire sighed, relieved as she pocketed the letter for safekeeping in her currently skintight sweatpants. \"I guess it couldn't hurt to search the rest of the place though...\" With a newfound sense of vigor at knowing her brother was safe, Claire investigated the rest of the room, and discovered that the armory at the back of the room had been left open for some reason. \"Huh...odd that they would leave it open just like that...\" However, not one to look a gift horse in the mouth she quickly made her way over to it and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her delight, she walked in and immediately found the very thing she'd been hoping to find since her arrival. \"Guns!\" She chirped in excitement as she saw a handgun on a nearby table and what looked to be a submachine gun inside one of the open lockers along with some ammo for each next to their respective firearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handgun itself seemed to be modeled after a revolver based on the rotating middle of the gun, but was of a much lighter caliber unlike its well know .44 caliber cousin. Claire remembered that Chris had showed her this model before, the \"SLS 60\" if she remembered right. He'd even ended up buying one for her and teaching her how to handle it for self defense purposes, but unfortunately she'd left hers back home before she'd left for Raccoon City. \"Well that's at least something I know how to use alright, now for the other one.\" Wrapping the holster for the handgun around her thigh, no way it was getting around her waist at this point, and inserting the pistol into its intended home, Claire reached for her next prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis one she didn't know too much about, but she'd remembered Chris using one at the firing range for a session, the \"MQ-11\" or something along those lines. Whatever the case, it seemed to be relatively easy to use and at any rate, Claire would likely need something heavier hitting than the handgun she'd acquired as well. As for the ammo, Claire luckily found two hip pouches to carry them in, and placed the submachine gun in the largest carrying compartment of the pouches. \"Alright, armed and ready for action!\" Claire cheered, raising a fist in triumph. \"Oh hang on, what's this?\" She stopped, noticing a card on the table she'd grabbed the pistol off of. \"Downstairs Locker Keycard...guess I should...oh <i>no...</i>\" Claire wailed as she realized what she had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Fine...\" She sighed, resigning herself to her fate as she headed back out into the hallway to begin her slow descent. This time, Claire opted to place both of her sausage fingered digits firmly on both sides of the staircase to steady herself, letting her belly be subjected to the laws of physics. Descending the first step, she winced as she felt her stomach lurch and then wobble vigorously as she placed both feet on the next step down. The blobs inside her squirmed at the disturbance as Claire sighed, choosing to ignore the seemingly angry reaction from her brood. \"I. Hate. These. Stairs,\" she growled, punctuating each jiggle, and every step with a choice word or two, her breasts nearly smacking her in the face each time her feet landed. \"Why. Don't. They. Have. An. Elevator!\" Finally, after nearly losing her balance from her quivering, massive behind throwing off her center of gravity, she made it back down to the first floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Okay!</b></i>\" She huffed, blowing a few rogue strands of hair away from her eyes, \"now that I'm back here, the weapons locker!\" Luckily for her, and more importantly, her legs, the weapons locker room was right across from the staircase. The locker room itself seemed like a renovated gym locker room, but with locks being controlled by a keypad at the front of the room. Unfortunately, it seemed as though most of the lockers had already been opened and the items within taken out. However, in the distance, Claire spotted a back portion of the room sealed off by a gate with a keycard reader next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the first steps towards the rear of the room, Claire quickly found a problem in reaching her destination. \"Stupid...lockers!\" She grunted, trying to squeeze through the room as she felt her arms collide with the wall and the front of the lockers to her left. \"Why make this room so narrow?\" She groaned, before turning to the side so her stomach faced the wall. \"Bear with me you guys, this'll get a little bumpy...\" she warned before scooting towards the back of the room. Just as she thought, her protruding belly scraped along the wall the whole way through, and the more she continued, the more active the blobs got, as if protesting the conditions they were being subjected to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like forever, Claire swiped the keycard in the reader and flung herself into the backroom she'd been questing for. \"Ohhh...this better have been oh hello~\" She whistled, awestruck at the device in front of her. The label next to it said \"GM-79\" but from what Claire could tell it was a launcher of some sort. Picking it up and studying the weapon intently, Claire knew somehow that she'd be wanting to keep this baby around for <i>quite</i> a while. \"Oh what's this? Another document?\" She said, plucking a note that had been placed behind the new addition to her arsenal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>To all members of the staff, we have been authorized the use of the GM-79 Grenade Launcher in order to stave whatever the hell these things are. I'm not sure what to call them but they're just formless ooze that chases us down relentlessly. I've seen its approach and for some reason it attacks men and women in <b>drastically</b> different ways. With males it simply tackles them to the ground and disintegrates them like some sort of very lethal pool of acid. With the female officer I observed however it tried to make her ingest it. Anyways, curious behavior aside, it seems flame rounds and acid rounds don't do anything to them, but luckily our boys in the lab have been experimenting with some new cryogenic ammo, and that seems to keep them at bay. Ple-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like something got him before he could finish.\" Claire shuddered, but looked at the canisters next to her, colored a light blue. \"Cryo rounds huh?\" She wondered, before picking one up and studying the label, which read 'caution: experimental rounds, handle with extreme care as exposure to extremely cold temperatures can risk many injuries.' \"Well I've got five here, might as well take em with me.\" Placing the rounds in her pouches, she sighed and began the close quarters trip back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never again.\" Claire vowed, before deciding where to go next. She went...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"*sigh* God I hate this part.\" Claire said to herself, reluctantly heaving her rotund self up the flight of stairs, much to her exasperated girth's livid objections. But whilst she slowly ascended back up onto the second floor, her thoughts returned on what that earlier not said regarding the oozing slimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the Grenade Launcher she grasped onto, as she thoughts proclaimed, <i>\"Okay... So apparently, those slimes are weak to these \"Cryo Rounds\" that note mentioned. *sigh* I must admit, I'm becoming a bit fond with those little blobs.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, she stopped at the final step, inspecting the Grenade Launcher in her hand, flicking open the barrel with a contemplative look on her round face and multiple chins, seeing that the weapon was already loaded with a single Flame Round. From there, she pulled out one of the experimental Cryo Rounds in an inquisitive manner, inspecting it before putting it back in the left hip pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"...If what that officer said is true about those blobs being weak to these things, I'd better not use them while my new \"friends\" are squirming about.\" </i> Claire thought once more, where she then instinctively flicked the Grenade Launcher closed out of preparation, where she then ascended up the last step, which was easier said than done compared to the entire staircase in her current physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*huff* *huff* Okay then. Let's *huff* see what's behind that door, then.\" Claire thought aloud, waddling toward the Spade Door after catching her breath. Of course, due to her now bulkier appearance, Claire easily felt her burgeoning hips scrape a smidgen against one of the passing columns on the walkway leading to the strange door, mumbling to herself as she muttered, \"*sigh* I just hope that I don't get too big for my britches. Otherwise, getting through these stupidly narrow halls are going to be an effing pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she reached the weird door, where upon closer inspection, where it indeed had the symbol of a Spade adorned on the door's center. At first, Claire simply began to turn the doorknob, only to be flat-out denied with an audible rustling clicking noise. She tried a few times for confirmation, which only seemed to infuriate her a bit, which resulted in her using her newfound mass to ram into the door, yet it wouldn't budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!!! What the hell is with this place?!\" She yelled, giving the door an instinctive yet frustrated punt kick in response, showing her anger some from all this supposed bullshit that has been occurring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, there was no way past the door without...SOMETHING to open it. But then, Claire noticed a keyhole in the center of the doorknob, which made her exhale an annoyed sigh in response as she said, \"*sigh* Okay, so I have to find a stupid key that matches this asshole of a door. *growling sigh* I swear, if this Chief Irons guy is responsible for so much as a wild goose chase in here, I might just think about sick you guys on him after my go at him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, she referred to the small group of blobs residing in her stomach, placing a hand over the outermost curve of her spare tire of a belly. \"*sigh* Might as well get started on searching for that damned key, then.\" She muttered, which meant more exploring to do, much to the mild aching of her now thicker legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she'll probably find more ammunition for her newly acquired weapons lying about somewhere. After all, it was only a matter of searching. However, since she was here, she might've missed this Spade Key while she was exploring the Police Station in some of the previous rooms. Or maybe it was in the previously unexplored rooms back at the main lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end though, Claire decided to...</span></div></div>",

If she was right, she remembered that there had been another room just down the hall from the office where her brother worked out of. Deciding that it was a much preferable alternative than to follow the dreaded flight of stairs up even further, she set forth down the long hallway once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing the door leading to the S.T.A.R.S office Claire continued further down the hallway and found a pair of doors. One led to the left, and from the sound of it, some type of machinery seemed to be in working condition, as she heard a low hum and a small clank or bang every now and again from within the room. The other door was at the very end of the hallway, though Claire had no idea what could be behind that one. Luckily, none of the doors carried the hated Spade symbol that taunted her so frustratingly from before, and so Claire figured she might as well go ahead and start with the closest one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the SLS-60 handgun from her side, and sandwiching the Grenade Launcher in between a hip pouch and her hip, Claire took a deep breath and cracked the door. Seeing nothing hostile in the sliver of sight she was allowed, she slowly pushed the door open, bringing the gun up and scanning the room with it just in case. Once a couple of seconds had passed without anything jumping out at her, Claire let out the breath she'd been holding in suspense and put the gun back into its holster to actually study the room she'd wandered into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room size immediately caught her off guard, as it was much smaller than any of the other rooms she'd been in thus far. A lone washer and dryer combo sat in the corner of the room, the load of laundry still being cleaned as the machine kept dutifully performing its given task, despite having been abandoned for some time. In the space next to Claire sat two racks that were loaded up with towels, shirts, pants, basically all common laundry load items that one would bring to a room such as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not many places a key could hide,\" Claire hummed, picking up a shirt and rifling through the chest pocket, but only brought out a bit of lint for her troubles. Frowning, she tossed the shirt away and picked up the next garment with a sigh, \"this is gonna be a pain, but I guess I'll have to search every one of these so I don't miss it...\" With that, the young woman set to work searching each and every shirt and pair of pants on the racks of fabric. At first, she hand searched every pocket, or at least attempted to, since her ever increasing weight had made sure that her hands and fingers had fattened up to the point that she had trouble squeezing them into the pockets as dexterously as she once was able to. After nearly splitting the fifth pocket of her searched, she'd thrown the offending shirt away and resorted to turning each clothing item upside down and vigorously shaking them. She tried to ignore the way the flab on her arms did its best impression of gelatin as she shook each piece of clothing, but just when she learned to tune that out, her mind grew self conscious about the light bounce of her breasts, or the way her mountainous tummy barely scraped against the cool metal of the racks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Claire eventually gave up her search and left the room to clear her head before she kicked the rack over in anger. \"Guess I'll check the other room then, hopefully there I'll have more room to do...<i>anything at all</i>.\" She left the laundry room and then headed back down the hall, opening the next door in just as careful a manner as she'd done previously. Passing into the next room, she let out a sigh of relief, thankful that the room was large enough to actually allow her to walk around. However, the sigh quickly caught in her throat at the sight of a statue that gave her an unwelcome reminder of one she'd recently encountered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah no thanks mister unicorn,\" Claire stated flatly, giving the statue of the horned equine in front of her a heated glare as she knew what she'd have to do to make it yield its cargo. \"You can keep whatever chocolate coin you have in that stupid puzzle of yours.\" At the words 'chocolate coin' however, her passengers immediately started squirming around, as if to convey they rather liked the idea of a giant candy based replica of the medallion they'd found before. At this, Claire poked a finger into her belly in rebuttal, narrowing her eyes at the active group. \"Hey! I was joking about the coin! I'm already big enough as it is! I don't need a bad diet doing you guys' job for me too.\" As if they knew they were being scolded, the blobs settled down as Claire smiled in triumph, a sense that could only be described as motherly smugness that came with disciplining ones own offspring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now that the peanut gallery is quiet again, I can skip the stone horse and- oh <i>come</i> on!\" Claire yelled, smacking a hand in her face as she realized the only other thing in the room was the door to her left, which, big surprise, also held the insignia of the Spade that was, as of right now, an insurmountable obstacle. \"Just once I'd like to catch a break here,\" she growled, shaking her head as she turned back to the statue of the Unicorn. \"Well...guess since I'm already here...\" she sighed going up to the statue and looking at its base. Sure enough, the same three-dialed mechanism was there to greet her furrowed brow, though this time the pictures display were of two fish, a scorpion, and a vase or a jug spilling water. Figuring that the same principals applied from the last statue, Claire began her brute force method of figuring out the puzzle once more. This time however, knowing what she was in for, she was much more patient, though that didn't stop her from growing mildly annoyed at the sheer absurdity that someone would commission a statue like this in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, finally!\" Claire groaned, relieved that the combination of Fish, Scorpion, and Water Jug had been the one to undo the lock and open the hidden compartment. \"I swear once I'm out of here I'm going to look up who built this place and give them a piece of my mind!\" She stored her vow of frustration in the back of her mind for later, and then proceeded to reach in and pull out exactly the item she'd been expecting to find, which was a bronze disc with the face of the unicorn on it to match its container. \"That's about right, now where...aha!\" Claire smiled as she caught sight of the area past the railing behind the statue. Much like the Lion's display, the area past where her spot was currently overlooking was the very hall she'd come into the police station through, though this was much closer to the entrance than the lion's statue had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright little one, you're back on!\" Claire called to her stomach, opening her mouth and feeling a singular blob surge forth. She couldn't really tell the globs of slime apart, so she had no idea if this was the same one that had carried the previous medallion. Just to be safe, she explained what she needed done to the blob and directed it to carry it to the statue. With a short hop of acceptance, the blob took the Unicorn medal into its grasp and slid down the overhang into the main hall. Once it left her field of vision Claire had no way of knowing where it was, until she remembered that she could see through the blobs if they were separate from her if she focused as she'd found out from her test run back in the convenience store. Closing her eyes, she quickly found her point of view shift much lower to the ground and saw that the blob had already made it to the statue and inserted the medallion into the second slot of the mechanism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, upon insertion the second ring surrounding the giant marble woman's platform receded, and the statue sank a few inches for a second time. However, Claire could only faintly hear this happening despite having a front row seat through the eyes of her courier. <i>Interesting, so I can see through them, but hearing is through my ears only...</i> she committed that little discovery to memory before directing the blob to return to her. Cutting the visual link between them, Claire waited around until the blob made its way back up the side of the railing before letting it jump into her waiting arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job you!\" Claire praised, giving the blob a firm pat of approval before lifting it to her mouth, \"time to get back to it though!\" With the blob now back inside its home, Claire turned and headed back out through the door she'd come in through, pondering on what she'd seen. \"So that room has two doors that are marked with the same Spade design. I guess from here I can either go to the next floor on this side, or try the other side of the station...\" She finished her thought with a pensive look. Either way she'd be making a bit of a trek, either horizontally or vertically, and there was no guarantee that she wouldn't end up gaining even more weight on the way just because she had guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Claire ended up deciding that she'd check upstairs since that was closer to her, and despite her growing hatred of them, she figured at this point that she needed the exercise in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, upon arriving back at the stairs, she discovered a trio of zombies clumsily making their way down from upstairs, falling or stumbling every other step or so. Seeing the less than graceful display, Claire rolled her eyes in amusement as she unholstered her pistol and prepared to fire at the zombies. However, as she aimed at the first zombie, that familiar feeling of hunger, to consume the zombies and grow bigger returned. She fought the urge, knowing there was no real need to use the blobs, but eventually... </span></div></div>",

Thankfully, it was only a minor drawback, as Claire compensated by firing a few well-placed headshots upon the first zombie, causing it to collapse onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Grrruuuggh*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite taking down a single zombie, it took up almost all five bullets in the revolver cylinder to truly defeat. So in response, Claire began to reload as quickly as her chubby fingers would allow. But by the time she fully reloaded her firearm, the second zombie clumsily lunged at her for a bite. But due to her increased body mass, Claire pushed the zombie off of her, thus knocking the walking corpse into it's compatriot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire continued this process until the remaining zombies were downed...hopefully. \"*sigh* Well, that wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.\" Claire retorted to herself, continuing her way through the derelict Police Station. But then, as she took a few waddling steps forward, she soon felt the blobs squirming once more, as well as the subtly gnawing pangs of hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there, looking at the staircase first, then back towards the downed zombies splayed out on the floor. But like a mother bird with her baby chicks, the blobs demanded to feed. Obviously knowing that was undoubtedly going to regret this, Claire, tapped her belly to converse with her blobs and begrudgingly commented, \"*frustrated sigh* ...Alright, fine! You can eat. But you're only eating one corpse, nothing more! Got it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the blobs heaved their gelatinous forms in confirmation, prompting Claire to fully open her mouth to allow a few of the blobs to fully emerge and slither their way over toward the nearest zombie, dissolving it and adding to their overall mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"*sigh* Now I know how Mom felt when she was raising me and Chris.\"</i> Claire thought to herself, obviously now experiencing what motherhood was like. Or at least, in an unorthodox manner of speaking. However, before her mind could even wander off, Claire soon noticed that her slimy brood were finished with their meal, as she felt one of the blobs cutely nudge up against the side of her thick leg, as if asking to be back inside their mother's embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was certainly surprised at how obedient they were, as she noticed the other two corpses were left untouched, where she then patted the blob a few times with a reassuring demeanor, speaking to them as she maternally quipped, \"Good blobs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Claire reluctantly opened her mouth wide once more to allow the blobs passage into her stomach, which they eagerly proceeded to do, slithering up Claire's body and back into her opened maw. Suffice to say, Claire was soon going to regret this decision, as she felt the blobs deposit their excess mass into her own physique, which resulted in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*ZZRRRIPP!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RRRIIIIIPPP!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZZZKKKRRIIIIIPPP!!!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Claire soon felt her already strained sweatpants give way to her newly accumulated bulk, as she assessed the damage, which revealed a now noticeably large tear at the seat of her pants, thus exposing her now voluminous behind. Claire noticed it very easily, as she felt a light breeze touch her now partially exposed buttocks, causing her to both blush and furrow her brow in a mix of mild annoyance and frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* ...Goddammit.\" She audibly said to herself, now internally regretting her earlier decision, as she then noticed that the shirt she wore now rode up a few more inches, becoming more akin to a bra, as her bra had now given up the ghost, the snaps breaking on cue with her sweatpants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Now I have to find some bigger clothes if I get any fatter than this.\" Claire said to herself, as she now contemplated on her next move. On one hand, she could head back to the Laundry Room and hopefully find some larger clothes before continuing her search. But on the other hand, she had to find that damned key that could open those Spade doors. Thinking it over, Claire decided to...</span></div></div>",

Shaking her head at this turn of events Claire pressed onward, ignoring the ever increasing breeze she could feel as her sweatpants tore further and further with each part of her ascent. By the time she made it up her sweatpants had fluttered off, leaving her bottom half clad in only a pair of panties that were tight, but much less taxed than their predecessor. Unfortunately, despite their dogged determination, they did little to cover any notable part of Claire's exposed rear, the young woman turning a crimson hue at her current state of dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Great...that's what I get for rushing ahead...\" she stuttered, trying to ignore the bounce her bubble-butt made with every union that met between her feet and the ground underneath it. \"Now...seems the only way ahead is through that room...\" Claire gazed upon the room to her right, which had no door for an entrance on this side at least. Walking into it, Claire could see that it was modest compared to the S.T.A.R.S office, whose many papers and desks strewn about gave an air of hustle and bustle even with no officers to populate it. This office by comparison, gave off a much more relaxed air as it contained only one desk, a table with several chairs placed around it, and a board game that made Claire guess that this was a place that one could take their mind off of their work, if only for a moment. Added to that, a small set of bookshelves lay flush against the wall opposite her and bordered a window that gave an excellent nighttime view of the city, or rather, it would have if parts of the city weren't visibly aflame at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...seems pretty homey compared to everywhere else here,\" Claire noted, noticing that a lot of the books on the shelves dealt with similar topics. \"History of Raccoon City, Raccoon City Museum Renovation, Famous Figures of All Events Raccoon...man, somebody was a bit of a history buff it seems...\" She scratched her head at this, never really preferring history as her favorite subject, as she preferred to live in the moment. <i>Come to think of it maybe that's why Chris says I'm a bit headstrong as times...</i> Grinning sheepishly, she paused for a moment as she remembered the many times her older brother ended up bailing her out of the mischief she usually seemed to get herself into. The more she thought about it however, the more she looked at herself and realized she had no Chris to get her out of this situation she was stuck in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not sure what Chris would think if he saw me now, but I don't know if he would call me his 'little' sister now.\" She chuckled, before deciding she'd spent long enough reminiscing and got back to looking for the Spade Key. \"Now if I were a key where would I hide?\" She hummed to herself, nothing on the table, or on the desk, so those were out. She scooted the chairs out of the way just in case the key had fallen underneath the seats, but still her search proved fruitless. After nearly getting ready to flip the table over to check underneath that, a gleam in the corner of her eye caught her attention, and she swiveled her head towards the window-sill at the brief flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! Thought you could hide eh?\" She crowed, picking the key up from the window and inspecting it. Much to her delight, Claire confirmed that the key she'd picked up was indeed the elusive guardian of the Spade doors that had vexed her so. With a short, joyful laugh, Claire spun around and merrily skipped, or rather slightly raised herself on her tiptoes, back to the stairs, only breaking her celebration to make her way back down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, instead of going straight for the first Spade door that met her sight as she arrived back down to the second floor, Claire realized that now might be a good time for her to grab that change of clothes from before that she'd desperately been needing. Even if nobody alive might come across her, it certainly did no good to give the zombies a big fleshy target to home in on if she could help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting back into the laundry room with a much happier feel to her step, Claire found herself happily singing a short tune as she sought to remedy her pants-less conundrum. At first, all Claire could come across were work jeans or pants that were either way too tight, or just felt uncomfortable after doing the button up, the denim scratching the underside of her muffin top and threatening to start chafing even after the brief period she had it on. Finally, after going through ten or fifteen pairs of pants in the laundry stack, she found a black pair of dress slacks that seemed to be flexible enough, and didn't cut into her flabby gut flesh at any level of discomfort. Next up on the docket of replacement clothing was her shirt, which was still holding on quite well much to her surprise, but the more she could cover up her belly, the less self conscious she'd feel about it. After seeing that most of the white button up dress shirts wouldn't fit her, she came across a white shirt and grey sweater vest combo that seemed...rather large compared to the rest of the clothing she'd sorted through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't care much for the outfit, but since it looks like the only thing that'll fit me better...\" Claire sighed and wrenched her tattered black t-shirt off, shivering as her fat-filled bust lay exposed except for the small portions that were covered by her red jacket, which seemed to be in way better condition than everything else considering the circumstances. After donning the white shirt and sweater vest, she found that she was correct in her initial assessment, as she saw that the shirt had no trouble reaching around her bust, <i>what are they even at this point? F-cups? G-cups?</i> Claire wondered, eyeing her pair of twins that were quite possibly the only part of her growth she was at least somewhat happy with, even if they did get in the way a bit. With at least the top half of her stomach covered now, though her belly button was still out and about for the world to observe, Claire donned her red jacket once again and sized up her appearance in the mirror next to the sink and washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...minus the jacket I look like...a really stuffy librarian...\" She huffed, frowning as she realized the triple chin that had begun rounding out her face even further, \"a really stuffy obese librarian...\" Blushing hotly as she started to feel put off by her portly portrait, she exited the room and went down the hall back to where she found the Unicorn statue. Upon arriving at the familiar stone exhibit of the mythical equine, she raised a hand as if to greet it before turning to her real goal, the Spade door. However, as she reached for the door handle, a rumbling in her gut made her freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't the blobs squirming,\" she noted, as they were being eerily still, as if sensing danger beyond the door. This, she knew, was a rumbling in her gut that felt familiar, only having happened a couple times before. \"Let's see, the last time this happened was out in the street when...oh no...\" her eyes widened in horror as she realized what the ominous churning in her gut meant, \"one of those clones pretending to be me is past here...\" Knowing that she now faced a much more credible threat than any zombie or Licker, Claire pulled her hand away from the door and considered how to approach the situation. To start, she opened her mouth and summoned all of the available blobs she had stored within her. Confused as to what was going on, the six of them floundered about briefly before Claire snapped her fingers and garnered their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, listen up you guys,\" Claire hissed, the blobs staying stock still as they received their orders, \"one of my...body doubles is behind that door, made of the same stuff as you all. Now I don't know if she'll be able to take control of you guys or not so I'd rather play things safe for now. You guys go back and hide in the laundry room. If I need you, I'll let you all know from up here,\" she tapped her head to remind them of her mental link, \"otherwise, stay hidden until then. Okay?\" Whether the blobs understood every single word said to them was up for debate, however, they did seem to catch the gist of her explanation as they reluctantly filed out of the room and back down to their designated hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that her charges were gone, and hopefully safe and sound, Claire shook the jitters out of herself, able to hop in place now that she was about forty or so pounds lighter. \"Here goes nothing,\" she told herself as she took the recently acquired Spade key and inserted it into the lock. A quick turn and a quiet click signaled that the door was ready to be opened. Taking a deep breath, Claire chose to bring out her Grenade Launcher in case a fight broke out, and load it with a cryo round to prepare for the battle that was sure to break out...  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon entering the next room, Claire saw that the Spade door had been hiding a massive library whose square footing rivaled that of the Main Hall's. Bookshelves towered above her with a countless collection of doubtlessly old tomes and records that one could spend their life pouring over. However, that's not what Claire was focusing on as an unamused scowl crossed her face. What had caught Claire's attention, was the figure sitting casually above her on one of the bookshelves, kicking her legs like a school-child without a care in the world. Of course, the malevolent smirk that adorned the figure's face showed that they were anything <i>but</i> innocent or well-meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well well well...I was wondering when you would show up sweetie!</i>\" The person giggled teasingly in a perfect replica of Claire's own voice. \"<i>You sure took your time in getting here...oh but I suppose you have seemed to pack on a few pounds since our last meeting...</i>\" The doppelganger gestured to her stomach, \"<i>a bit here, a bit there,</i>\" she pointed to her own slim visage for reference, before shrugging and waving a hand over the rest of her body \"<i>quite a bit everywhere really, you oughta lay off the junk food Claire. It's not doing any favors for your figure.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bite me!\" Claire growled, her anger rising at both the nonchalance she was being treated with and the obvious jabs at her growing waistline. \"You're the ones that started this mess in the first place! In fact, you wouldn't even be up there if it weren't for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And your contribution is duly noted, and oh so appreciated~</i>\" the clone snarked with a patronizing snicker. \"<i>Unfortunately, I have no desire to compensate you for your efforts with any monetary gains, but perhaps I can let you ah, 'gain' an opportunity of a different nature.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh ladieeees~</i>\" The copycat cut Claire off with a snap of her fingers and a melodious chime of her voice. Immediately, Claire heard a set of groans and the familiar shuffle of feet coming from behind the furthest bookshelves from her position. Claire narrowed her eyes as she mentally braced herself for what new horrors would await her behind the barrier of paperback and wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat moment of preparation was not nearly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat emerged from behind the bookshelves were a pair of female zombies that were so bloated, so huge, so disgustingly weighed down by the layers of fat that had accumulated on them that it was a blatant disregard of the laws of nature as to how they were even capable of movement. Claire thought before that she'd been the fattest thing in this police station, but <i>these</i> things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They look double my size, or even more...</i> Claire gulped, finding herself speechless at the sheer mass of each quivering, slime hoarding undead, <i>they have to weigh at least seven to eight hundred pounds, if not half a ton...</i> Realizing that she was so caught up in the sheer off-putting appearance of the two, that she'd forgotten about the real threat, she tore her eyes away from the pair of gurgling giants and saw that her other self had leapt down from the bookshelf and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, what do ya think?</i>\" She held her hands out in display, as if she were a twisted ringmaster in the most contemptible circus imaginable. \"<i>These lovely pair are twin sisters, and were in a pretty nice neighborhood before the walking grave fillers took over.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the <i>hell</i> did you do to them?\" Claire shouted, hefting her Grenade Launcher so that the sight was aiming squarely at her so called twin. \"How on Earth are they even still <i>moving</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Funny story actually...</i>\" The clone giggled, flashing a deceptively sweet grin that gave way to obvious malicious intent, \"<i>you might've come across a couple of our kind that took down those poor excuses for rotten meat and turned a beautiful hue of green?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the word I'd use.\" Claire snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well you see,</i>\" 'Claire' rolled her eyes, ignoring the deadpan response of her progenitor, \"<i>once we saw this happen, we realized that the virus responsible for this plague of flesh eaters could be...incubated, and replicated instead of eradicated like our kind would normally do. A side effect of this replication process is that the individual turns a shade of green</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This explains why I didn't turn into a zombie despite eating at least six or seven of them...</i> Claire realized, smiling at the thought of her brood of slimes unknowingly protecting her before she directed a heated glare back at her mirror image. \"That doesn't explain these two though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Don't worry that's up next,</i>\" the clone winked, before walking up to one of the flab-ridden fiends and wrapping an arm around its neck affectionately, \"<i>it turns out that since we replicate the virus, we also carry a much higher concentration of it, and so turning someone from human, to not so human? A mere hour or so, instead of a day.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You monsters...\" Claire growled, feeling another surge of anger course through her as she slowly pieced together where the story was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh seems you figured me out,</i>\" the clone laughed, slamming her hand down in the air as if she were ringing a bell, \"<i>ding ding! That's right! Once we found these lovely ladies trying so desperately to escape, we simply fed them our...point of view and a little more, and by the next hour or so they came to see things our way! Helps that once they had no mind of their own that we could get rid of those hindrances like bones and muscles and fill their bodies with more of us to provide them freedom of movement even at a size such as this.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Woah...so no bones or muscles left in there huh?</i> Claire blinked in surprise, <i>them being filled only with slimes explains why they aren't snapping their own legs in half with their weight.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You're pretty quick to catch on to my little story Claire,</i>\" the clone flashed a smile before unhooking her arm from the zombie and stepping forth, <i>that's why I've decided to give you an extra special opportunity, one you can't possibly refu-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Bang*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bullet streaked across the room and struck the dastardly doppelganger in the head mid-speech, having been fired from Claire's handgun in a spur of the moment decision to try and catch the slimmer and trimmer version of herself off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I think of whatever possible offer you could throw my way!\" Claire spat, though her look of anger faltered as her clone snapped her neck back forward to stare at her with a chillingly neutral expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh Claire...you must have misunderstood me...</i>\" the clone chuckled as she casually plucked the bullet out of her head and flicked it away as if it were no more than a mosquito bothering her. \"<i>You can't possibly refuse this offer, buuuuut if you insist upon putting up some paltry resistance then I'll humor you...</i>\" She took another step towards Claire, <i>after all, it's the least I can do before I let you join these cute little butterballs as another one of our slime breeding factory, or I guess in your case it would be rejoin?</i> The clone shook her head in deliberation, before directing a grin at Claire, \"<i>of course, this time, we won't be letting you have the luxury of being alive and with the freedom of thought to get in our way again.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So she wants to fatten me up into one of those things then?</i> Claire huffed to herself as she put on a confident smirk. <i>I guess we'll see just how well these cryo round work then, it'll be worth it if I can wipe the smug grin off of her annoying face! Or...my face? Whatever!</i> Regardless of the semantics of whose face was really annoying her, Claire knew she had to win this fight, or else become a non-thinking, slime creating ball of undead tonnage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fight commenced...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first, Claire could only see that it was seemingly ineffective, as she silently cursed, <i>\"Dammit! It's not working!\"</i> However, that tone soon changed when she noticed something peculiar happening to her two decaying assailants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bloated female zombies appeared to be cracking apart, literally, as their lower bodies shattered like glass in a matter of seconds, causing them to collapse onto the floor with an audibly loud <b>*CRUNCH!!*</b> in response to their coldly dismembered lower halves. Claire couldn't help but display a cheery, satisfied, and relieved dimpled grin upon her chubby cheeks, as she mentally exclaimed, <i>\"Hell yeah!! Now that's what I'm talking about!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yet, despite the effectiveness of the cryogenic grenade rounds against the elephantine zombie twins, the gas cloud slowly began to dissipate, which gave Claire the incentive to fire off another round against the now downed zombies to continue the barrage. Of course, just like before, the cloud of liquid nitrogen began to take a fatal toll on the fattened zombie duo, effectively freezing them in place, whilst one defiantly attempted to reach out toward the rotund brunette, only to be rendered completely frozen by the liquid nitrogen encapsulating it's slime-filled corpse frozen solid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph! Not so tough now, are you?\" Claire smugly scoffed, where she triumphantly bashed the first frozen zombie with the buttstock of the Grenade Launcher, then proceeded to do the same with the other one as well, causing the now frozen zombies to shatter like a porcelain vase being dropped onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite such a surprising victory, 'Claire', still standing before her progenitor whilst observing the brief battle in front of her, as she bore an inquisitive look and posture before the chubbier Claire, as the slimy duplicate put a hand under her chin, all while bearing a curiously cheeky smirk upon it's face. But as Claire shot a heated glare at her thinner doppelganger, 'Claire' spoke up and inquisitively quipped, <i>\"Hmmm.... Intriguing. Very intriguing, indeed. I can see you have found the means to combat Us, my dear.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! Yeah, that's right, you copycat bitch. I've found your Achilles Heel, and I'm not afraid to twist the knife.\" Claire smugly replied, loading another cryo grenade into the Grenade Launcher,  then aiming the weapon at her slime-coated doppelganger. And yet, she couldn't help but feel like something was...off, regarding her clone's current disposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"*giggle* Maybe so, darling. However, since we are feeling rather generous, we shall let you be...at least for now, anyway.\" </i> 'Claire' elaborated, with outstretched arms, as if tempting the real Claire to open fire upon her and waste precious ammunition. However, Claire was no fool after her first encounter, as the clone smugly exited from the room to leave her progenitor for the time being.</span></div></div>",

Here's hoping I'm a bit more prepared next time.\"</i> Claire thought to herself, exhaling an almost husky sigh of relief, despite being unable to truly finish off one of her wretched clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly looked to her left, then to her right, just to make sure the room was clear before proceeding to the locked door. <i>\"So far, so good.\"</i> She noted, where she soon waddled over to the locked door, equipped with the Spade Key. From there, she posthumously inserted the key into the keyhole, and turned it to hear a cathartic  <b>*click-click*</b> in the process, as what appeared to be a satisfied grin appeared on her cherubic face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Better call them in in to let them know it's safe out here.\"</i> Claire thought, but just as she slowly turned around to return to the pack of pet-sized green blobs, she soon felt a wet sensation on her right leg, prompting her to look down, seeing the aforementioned slimes already before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, it certainly surprised her a little, briefly forgetting that these creatures, despite their translucent gelatinous forms, had a decent amount of intelligence. \"Wow. That was fast.\" She said aloud, to which the small group of blobs jiggled somewhat as if to convey a semblance of emotion due to their extreme lack of facial features. However, Claire couldn't help but feel like she was gradually becoming attached to these gelatinous creatures, remembering what her sexually sadistic clone said earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, despite her now established heft and girth, Claire slowly knelt down, petting the blob closest to her akin to petting a pet dog, a small smile appearing whilst she acknowledged, \"...I guess I should be thanking you little guys for keeping me safe this whole time, huh? Even after eating several zombies sometime ago.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blobs briefly wobbled in a vertical motion, like a pet Golden Retriever being rewarded with a tasty biscuit, as if being thankful for their mistress's kind yet blunt words. \"Now...What do you say we find a way outta here, hmm? Come on.\" Claire retorted, where she calmly opened her mouth wide enough for the pack of green slimes to promptly enter their <i>\"Mother's\"</i> body, to which they responded with glee, forming a single file line into her open maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost a minute later, the last slime had finally descended down her throat and into her stomach alongside it's siblings. From there, with a little bit of difficulty on her part, Claire stood back up, her stomach returning to it's taut pregnant-like shape from carrying her gelatinous brood. Fortunately, she had gotten accustomed to such a predicament, as she calmly proceeded to open the Spade Door, leading her rotund self out of the Library and onto the left balcony on the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, as she slowly waddled over to the other balcony, she thought, <i>\"...Here's hoping that wherever that last Medallion is at, it doesn't involve going up another flight of stairs.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== 7 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stairs. *huff* *huff* It just... *huff* had to be stupid stairs...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Claire could mutter at the moment, as she finally ascended up another flight of stairs towards where the final Medallion was theoretically located. Unfortunately for her, it was on the third floor, behind the upper level of the Library. Earlier, she found both a pair of batteries, and what appeared to be a Detonation Timer for explosives. Claire made her way across the oaken walkway, hoping that the polished wooden flooring and structure doesn't buckle under her corpulent form and substantial weight, as the only sounds accompanying her were the indiscreet sounds of creaking and groaning wooden planks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon making it to the other side, she promptly used the Spade Key one last time to open the door before her,  forcibly making her way through, despite the narrow door frame scraping along the sides of her bulkier hips. <i>\"*sigh* I just hope I don't get stuck in the doorway way sooner than I'd like to.\"</i> She mentally prayed, aiming her SLS 60 revolver in front of her should there be any more zombies or whoknowswhat lurking within the RPD Police Station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, only her and her slimy brood were the only living organisms in the room, just as Claire soon noticed a fresh corpse dangling upside down from a floor in the ceiling. \"Gross.\" She noted, as she slowly lumbered into the room, revolver still out should the need arose. The room itself was more akin to a decrepit attic, with garbage and various unmentionables strewn about, blocking off one small section of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-Ha! There you are!\" Claire exclaimed, seeing the Maiden Statue before her, clear as day. Sadly, she soon noted that the sculpture was blocked off by a set of crude metal bars. \"Dammit!\" She yelled, kicking one of the bars with a stomping foot out of frustration. But then, something caught her eye, as she lumbered over to the right, as she saw what appeared to be a few blocks of C4 were placed on what appeared to be some sort of makeshift barricade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting two and two together, she soon realized that the Detonator was actually meant for blowing up the barricade, as a cathartic smirk appeared on her plump face, now knowing what had to be done here.</span></div></div>",

Come on girl you can do it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire growled at the display, her copy holding the gun above her just out of arm's reach, and so she simply glared at her captor in defiance. \"<i>Oh you're no fun...</i>\" The clone pouted as she realized Claire was hardly in the mood to humor her teasing antics. \"<i>Well girls if she's not willing to play, what say we make our guest of honor into the main event?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the mottled female mammoths drew  closer, until they were about a foot away from Claire, however, instead of making a move to bite her as Claire expected, they simply waited, staring vacantly into space as if they didn't even remember she was directly in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Alright, now how should we do this?</i>\" Claire heard her clone hum to herself, tapping a finger to her chin in thought as she pondered on how to proceed. Eventually, after a minute or two of deliberating, 'Claire' simply shrugged and gestured to one of the zombies, \"<i>you go first I suppose, give our dear friend Claire here a little taste of what her life will become...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that supposed to mean?\" Claire laughed, acting as though she was resigning herself to whatever they had planned for her, but was desperately searching for something, <i>anything</i> nearby she could use to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Weeeeell since it can't hurt~ I suppose I can tell you!</i>\" The copycat Claire snickered as she rested her head in her hands, eyeing Claire hungrily, \"<i>you see, normally I'd be inclined to feed you a singular little zombie virus slime of mine, but leaving you with a whole hour of potential mischief in your hands is something I'd rather not risk.</i>\" The clone slightly shifted its position as the zombie to Claire's left got down on its knees, \"<i>therefore, I'd rather speed up the process by letting you borrow a fair amount of weight from each of these fine ladies to get things started. Consider it a VIP gift if you will!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God no! I have to get out of here!</i> Claire thought, beads of sweat forming, and tears starting to burn her eyes as she felt the breath of the zombie hit her face as it brought its own rotting visage closer and closer to hers. In one last act of desperation Claire tried to turn her face in the opposite direction, only to feel a hand force her to meet the deadened eyes of the undead twin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clone grinned as she held Claire's face aloft with an iron grip, \"<i>Oh don't be so down, now you've at least been granted the chance to serve something...'bigger' than yourself if you catch my drift!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO - <b>mmph</b>!\" Claire was swiftly cut off as the zombie's own rancid mouth connected with her own, blocking any last words that might have been said. At first, Claire nearly vomited as all she could taste was the stench of graveyard breath in her mouth, but a splitsecond later that taste was washed away as a steady flow of slime began forcing its way down Claire's esophagus. Like tap water, the ooze made its way into Claire's stomach, slowly inflating it like a balloon as she was packed more and more with virus ridden slime against her will. Unlike her previous growths, most of the weight from this expansion went to her belly itself, though her breasts and butt slowly filled out alongside the taut drum that her abdomen was becoming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God I'm going to explode! I can't...</i>\" Claire moaned softly as she placed her hands on her expanding gut, feeling her limbs separate further and further apart as the vast expanse of pale flesh grew larger and larger. Slight stretch marks began to appear on the sides of her belly due to the speed at which her skin was forced to stretch, which was fitting giving the use her doppelganger had her lined up for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like hours of drinking down mouthfuls of slime, the zombie pulled away at the snap of her twin's fingers. As one would expect, the previously mammoth sized zombie was much less rotund than her sister zombie after the transfer of her slime-based essence, leaving her about two hundred pounds lighter, and Claire that much heavier. This landed the poor Redfield girl at about even with said zombie, though in much more pain as her belly cried out, skin throbbing after being pushed to its limits in such a short amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please...no more...\" Claire moaned, a shaky hand tracing circles on the side of her gravid tummy before it fell tiredly to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sorry Claire,</i>\" her clone trying, and failing, to sound even somewhat apologetic, \"<i>but when I said you'd be our main event...</i>\" trailing off, the slime contortionist signaled the other zombie to approach Claire much like its foul kin did before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Claire pleaded softly hoping that her copy had some sense of humanity left within her. Unfortunately, the amused, joy-filled grin let her know that she was long past the bargaining stage. Tears ran freely down Claire's face as her head fell back, defeated as she let the second zombie plant its disgusting maw on her own living oral entrance. Claire's vision began to go hazy as her second meal was started to be forced down her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButtons began popping, and seams began splitting as Claire was fattened up more and more like the prize hog she was as her thighs freed themselves from the dress slacks she'd acquired earlier, and as she looked down, her eyes were met with a cleavage most women had to pay good money to acquire as her breasts surged forward after emerging from the confines of her shirt and sweater vest. Her belly was beyond massive at this point, practically making up half her body as it rose above her like a pale mountain, though in some trick of the light, her skin looked like it was a very faint shade of grey...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Chris...help...</i> she thought in the throes of futility, though as she breached the 700 pound mark a confused look came over her face. <i>Chris? Who is...Chris? Don't...remember...</i> Suddenly, it was harder and harder to form complete thoughts, her mind all muddled up from whatever was being done to her. <i>Chris...brother...good?</i> She thought weakly as her mind fell further and further apart. <i>Chris...family...hungry...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Itchy...tasty...</i> Were here last thoughts as her eyes closed, not even noticing that her skin had already begun to decay, a dark grey hue to signify she was human no longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's enough...</i>\" The clone held a hand up as the zombie rose to its feet, looking to be around the same 500 pound girth that its sister was currently at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf one were to call them huge however, then what was once Claire Redfield certainly put them to shame. What was once a lithe young body had become a being loaded up with 850 pounds of slime and fat. Her clothes lay in tatters around her, the only thing setting her appearance apart from the numerous other zombies being the sleeves of her signature red jacket, the only survivors of her twisted growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Alrighty Claire, naptime is over!</i>\" Her clone, or rather, the only Claire left standing, called, clapping her hands. With a slime-ridden gurgle, the zombie that had once been her progenitor opened her eyes and sat up. \"<i>There's a good girl! Now come on! Up and at em' we've got work to do!</i>\" The clone chirped gleefully as she stepped back from Claire's gargantuan gravidity, Signaling the trio of zombies to follow her, 'Claire' smirked as she glanced over her original's new plight. \"<i>you know Claire? I thought that these two were my best work, but you?</i>\" she smiled wryly, \"<i><b>you</b> are definitely my magnum opus...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the clone began walking slowly out of the room, humming happily as her undead entourage slowly followed behind her. Two of them a pair of poor souls condemned to their fates, and the third a girl who had come to the city hoping to find her brother, but instead found something much worse...a life cursed with undeath for the sole purpose of incubating the very creatures responsible for her fate. Truly, this was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><div align=\"center\">Game Over...</div></b></span></div></div>",

Stop!\" Her shouts proved fruitless in spurring herself however, as her fingers at last undid the lock, and she fell back on her butt with a groan. Huffing and puffing at the exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her horror, her clone opened the door, red eyes filled with glee as it made its way out of the freezer and back into the store lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well well Claire sweetie, I must say, I'm impressed!</i> It giggled, before giving Claire an intense gaze, \"<i>Though I don't appreciate almost being frozen solid like that, but I can respect some quick thinking like yours.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clone drew even closer Claire tried desperately to get up, and nearly got herself to her feet, despite her exhaustion and added weight from the two blobs she had ingested minutes before. However, as soon as she had started to rise the clone shot a portion of itself into her mouth and forced her back down, Claire unable to scream as she felt herself being fed more of the blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly rounded out into an even bigger curve and became heavy enough to the point that it forced her down to her knees, rendering her immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Honestly I thought about killing you here and now,</i> the other Claire mused, \"<i>but after our little bout I figured you've displayed enough ingenuity to be of use, so instead I'm going to do something different!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff- what-urgh-what are you going to do?\" Claire groaned, too lethargic to muster up any resistance towards her doppelganger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well let's just say that instead of resisting us like you do currently,</i> the clone grinned, before forming two more tendrils and placing them in Claire's ears, \"<i>I'm going to make sure you support our little cause!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you- AGH!\" Claire screamed in pain, her vision blurring as she felt her doppelganger toy with her mind, rewiring thoughts and erasing memories and her goals before replacing them with new ones. Claire tried to stop the process  somehow, jerking her head wildly to see if it would maybe, just maybe break the doppelganger's link, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after a few minutes, the doppelganger withdrew the tentacles from Claire's mind, letting Claire's head drop as the girl panted heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>There you see? All over now!</i>\" The doppelganger chided, apatting Claire's head as it began to walk past her. \"<i>Just a few memory rewrites and augmentations of your will and now you will be on our side!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, who had fallen unconscious, didn't respond. The clone, seeing this, simply smirked and morphed back into blob form before shuffling out of the store, back to its original mission of finding others to invade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Claire finally woke up, groaning as she felt her head pounding as if a migrain had struck her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...what happened?\" She whimpered, looking blearily around as she began to regain her bearings. \"Last thing I remember was...was...\" Claire paused, confused as to why she couldn't remember what she had been doing before she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a lightbulb went off as she remembered that she had been headed for the police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! I was heading for the police station! Maybe some other people will be there... and if there are...\" She grinned, the thought of encountering others exciting her for reasons unknown to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no sense in sitting around here!\" Claire declared eagerly standing up with no trouble at all despite her previously being immobile, though she didn't notice that fact as she walked out of the convinience store and headed towards the police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, instead of feeling her belly surged forth like it did the last time, Claire felt a surge of mass all over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you- AHHH!\" Claire screamed as suddenly an immense pain erupted all over her body, making her spasm and writhe uncontrollably as the blob began to break down and digest her body from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she felt her bones go, then her nerves, which thankfully meant she couldn't feel the pain anymore, then her muscles. Finally, as she felt the blob begin to break down her internal organs her last thought was strangely of how she should've sided with the blobs, until finally, Claire stopped moving completely, letting out one final breath before laying motionless on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, after a minute, her body twitched, then again, and a third time, until finally the body of Claire opened its eyes to reveal the same ominous red irises that the copies had sported, before the body stood itself up with little to no effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so much for remaining skinny and sexy...\" 'Claire' muttered to herself. \"Though I guess the others will be glad to hear that I got the original's body...or maybe now I could be called the original...\" 'Claire' giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking outside, 'Claire' took a deep breath and looked around, seeing one of the other doppelgangers, she waved it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Claire Redfield!

As a look of sheer terror came across the young girl's face, her cheeks swelled, chins multiplied, and lips thickened. Her skinsuit tore even more as her belly sagged out and her breasts swelled with fat, tearing at her vest. Her thighs and legs became quite thick as well, swelling to nearly the size of large tree trunks, her ass alone growing immensely as her shorts and skinsuit ripped and rolled back, exposing the edges of her doughy buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was all finally over, Claire had gained 300 pounds for her foolishness.

Ada immediately tried desperately to spit it out, but his hand covered her mouth of a few seconds, long enough for whatever it was to dissolve into nothing. The ganado then left as silently as he had entered, leaving Ada alone and terrified of whatever would happen next. She was surely infected with something, but what?</span></div></div>",

Finally, it stopped<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... this... it?\" she panted, her gut was as big as her and she was struggling to stand. Her then made sloshing and gurgling sounds and saw that it was getting smaller but saw that her body was getting soft and flabby. She was getting fat, her arms and legs getting big and flabby, her butt jiggling and swelling, her breasts swaying and swelling which made the dress strain more, her face's cheeks getting big as a baseball and having a double chin that seemed to multiply the more bigger she got, and her belly getting soft and folded on itself with love handles on her side. She was getting so heavy that she fell on her butt, sweaty and tired, unable to stand. Her dress was tearing at the seams and it was only a matter of time before it ripped apart, leaving the remains of a once-fitting red dress on the morbidly obese lady. Finally, the weight gain stopped after a long time and went to see her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noticed is her breasts, big as a beach ball and sagging on her belly, which was humongous, it was so big, it folded on itself with many love handles on the side, it spread around the floor which touched some of her meaty thighs, the thighs lead to her butt whose size rivaled her belly by a little amount, she tried to move her arms but could only move a little due to it's fat, and her face looked like it was sinking to her body, with a vast amount of chins. \"I'm... huge...\" she panted, this whole situation taking her energy away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u00a1Sos cerdo! \u00a1Te voy a hacer picadillo!\" the ganado said and began to call for the others carry her, she struggled to get away but all she could was wiggle, she tried to stand up but released a quite loud fart, making her blush, the ganados picked her up with some difficulty and began to bring her to what seems to be castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need... to get... out... but... how?\" She was in a bad situation, she couldn't do anything with this body and they were bringing her to the castle where she would probably die.

Lately, she\u2019d seemed a bit more annoyed than usual, but now she looked just a few steps shy of exploding with her jaw clenched, her brow furrowed, and her eyes practically searing holes into everyone in the room. Despite being a slender unimposing woman, her scowl froze the blood running in their veins and stilled their hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive seconds passed before Excella punctuated her sentence with \u201cNOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Ms. Gionne,\u201d A single scientist \u2013 brave enough to speak, but extremely cautious about choosing his words \u2013 addressed. \u201cWe\u2019re\u2026actually in the middle of Plagas research right now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Excella interrupted. \u201cYou are all relieved for the rest of the day. Go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcella groaned audibly. \u201cYou\u2019ll still get paid for the rest of the day.\u201d She said. \u201cNow leave!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am, we\u2019re on the verge of a major breakthrough right now.\u201d The scientist continued; sounding a bit agitated. \u201cIf we stop now, we may never-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t shut up and leave right now, your leave will be permanent.\u201d Excella shouted over the scientist. She shot glares across the room. \u201cThat goes for all of you! Why aren\u2019t any of you moving? If you want to look at the Plagas so bad, maybe I should release it here so you can all get a better view.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Excella lifted her left arm to reveal a large metal suitcase griped tightly in her hand, everybody practically fell over in their seats in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color drained out of the scientist\u2019s face. \u201cAre you crazy? D\u2026do you have any idea what that-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">\u201cGO!\u201d</font></b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab emptied almost instantly. Every last scientist dropped pencils, chairs, and research binders as they all rushed for the door; making sure to step gingerly pass Excella so as to not disturb her, or the dormant, yet deadly, Plagas dangling in her hand. As soon the last scientist turned the corner at the end of the hall, Excella made her way into the lab, sat at the main computer, and pulled up a folder simply labeled: <i>UROBOROS</i>. She navigated through the folder until she found a file containing the genetic data of the few subjects deemed compatible with the Uroborus virus. Excella stared at the file for a long time; not actually reading it, but just to delay what would come next. She didn\u2019t want to know, but she had to be sure. Just to put her suspicions to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the genetic analyzer next to the computer booted up, Excella pulled a single hair out of her chignon bun, and fed it into the machine. She then sat down to longest five minutes of her life as the computer compared her DNA with the test subject\u2019s. Her heart pounded against her chest, and her breathing got heavier as she watched the computer\u2019s green progress bar inch closer and closer to the end of the window anxiously. When the computer finished its evaluation and revealed his finding to her, Excella\u2019s heart stopped battering against her ribcage, and her face took on a frightening shade of crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cINCOMPATIBLE?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcella nearly drove her fist through the computer\u2019s monitor in her rage. Instead, she thundered: \u201cScan it again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother five minutes passed, and then another, then another, but the results were the same each time: Excella\u2019s DNA was incompatible with Uroborous. It was hard for Excella to accept the computer\u2019s judgement, but wasn\u2019t as if she hadn\u2019t suspected the truth before. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t even be here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Excella wasn\u2019t about to let genetics get in the way of her destiny. She closed the window showing her test results, and opened the suitcase she\u2019d brought with her. Instead of a vial of dormant Plagas, the suitcase contained vials of PG67A/W: a serum her beloved Albert Wesker used to control the virus inside his body that presented him with amazing powers. She\u2019d studied it extensively to replicate and manufacture an ample supply for her lover, so she figured she could modify it to allow her to control Uroborous, and not let it overwhelm her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day, Excella remained in the lab \u2013 dressed in a hazmat suit one of the scientist left behind - hard at work designing her new virus. It had been a while since she\u2019d actually done any genetic engineering work herself, but the more she worked, the more she recalled. Of course, Excella could have called her research team to come back and make the virus for her in a matter of hours, but she didn\u2019t want anyone learning of her discordance with Uroborus; especially Wesker. She knew of course that Wesker would love her whether she was worthy of Uroburous or not, but she preferred to be a Queen he could take pride in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came time to administer a bonding agent for the two viruses, something occurred to Excella. Perhaps she could use another virus to help control, maybe even enhance the effects Uroborus. The lab had a sample of every known variation of the Progenitor virus available to her. There was - of course - a very large possibility that something could go wrong, and she could possibly mutate into some horrible creature. However, she was positive that, with the antibodies Wesker had developed from that woman he captured, she could neutralize any ill effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which virus would she use?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The lights had stopped working once the building went into lock down. The ground was littered with corpses and blood. On the floor, Annette could see a zombie chewing at someone's intestines. It reacted to the sound of the door opening, but when it looked at Annette, it was like she was invisible as it just ignored her and returned to their meal.<br>\r\nAnnette shuffled around the deserted room, after eating whatever food she could find.

While she hadn't eaten that much, obviously the F-Virus had affected her metabolism and how calories infected her body.<br>\r\nHer new belly made her look five months pregnant. As Annette looked at it, she was reminded of when she was pregnant with Sherry. Her breasts had gone from C cup to a D cup. Her legs and arms, while not looking as bad still had some fat on them. Her waist was digging into the sides of Annette's jeans. As for her ass, it now jiggled with each and every movement that she made.<br>\r\nStanding up, Annette decided to test her strength.

Once a cruise liner full of passengers, now all that remains of both the passengers and the crew were either dead...or mutated into grotesque monstrosities, courtesy of the V-Abyss virus. And unfortunately for FBC member Rachael Foley, things were about to get much worse for her. Within the bowels of the Queen Zenobia, Rachael lied there on the metallic floor, lifeless as a corpse and as bloated as a stuffed pig, with her belly filled to the brim with liquid infested with the V-Abyss virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that would soon be the least of her worries, as her body began to transform and alter into that of an Ooze, all while still retaining some physical aspects that identified her as Rachael Foley. Once she had fully transformed, Rachael quickly regained consciousness, exhaling hefty coughs in the process. \"What...happened?\" She asked herself, noticing that her voice sounded...different, as if it was echoing as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as she was about to stand up onto her feet, Rachael instantly noticed her mutated right hand and arm, shocking her greatly, where she then looked down at the rest of her body, only to see both the tattered remains of her black and yellow diver suit...and the mutated limbs that were once her human legs. \"Mirror...Need to find...Mirror.\" She gasped, her capacity of sentient fully sentenced speech becoming limited, making her fears more profound, as she was able to stand upright, where she shambled across the small interior that was the Research Room, attempting to find anything to use as a makeshift mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for her, she was able to use a dead computer monitor as a makeshift mirror. However, Rachael surely wasn't going to like what she was about to see, and what had become of her, as the monitor screen revealed something quite horrendous: She was infected with the V-Abyss virus, She had become an Ooze! \"No...NO...NOOO!!!\" Rachael shrieked, reacting in a mix of great fear and rage, causing her to lash out with such distress, smashing the old computer into many pieces with her inhuman strength, as well as slicing at anything on the metallic table with her elongated clawed right hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her current state of mind, Rachael felt like her worst fears had come true. After all, she had nightmares of experiencing what had transpired in Terragrigia, worried that she could become one of those horrific monsters she was running from on the Queen Zenobia before what she thought was her \"death\". Unfortunately for the Federal Bioterrorism Commission member, she was now experiencing a fate much worse than death.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although, just as Rachael thought her current predicament couldn't get any worse than it already has, she then suddenly heard the all-too familiar sound of a semi-automatic handgun cocking back to load another bullet into the barrel. Of course, in the back of her mind, this clearly meant that someone that's still human was right next to her! \"...Ray...mond?\" She asked, her normal voice now meshed with this inhuman moaning, thinking that it was her FBC partner, Raymond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was far from the truth for Rachael. \"Don't! Move.\" The assailant shouted, identifying herself as a woman, just as she then aimed the handgun toward Rachael's head, thinking that Rachael was going to attack her. Instead, upon turning her head to look at her assailant, Rachael didn't know that it was none other than BSAA member Jill Valentine, who clearly had made her way past some of the Ooze creatures lurking around the Queen Zenobia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Jill thought that Rachael was a threat, just as the same as the Ooze. So, in reaction to seeing a gun aimed at her face, Rachael became frightened, tripping on her mutated feet and instinctively crawled away from Jill while she wailed, \"...Pleeease...Don't...KILL MEEE!!\" Upon seeing the way that the Ooze in front of her was reacting, Jill couldn't help but become both shocked and surprised from this encounter, becoming aware that the single Ooze in front of her still retained some human sentience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after regaining her composure, Jill became hesitant about shooting this specific Ooze, especially since she wasn't sure if it truly did retain sentience from it's previous life, or if it was simply using it's cowardice as a way to let her guard down so it could injure her, kill her, or worse. However, something in her gut told Jill to simply talk to what was essentially once human, see if it could understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in an attempt to communicate with the creature before her, Jill slowly lowered her handgun away from Rachael and said, \"...It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you.\" From there, Jill cautiously sheathed her pistol back into the holster, so the Ooze would be aware that she wasn't a threat to her, where Jill then spoke toward Rachael and said, \"See? Not going to harm you. Name's Jill Valentine, I'm a member of the BSAA. Now... Care to tell me your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Rach...Rachaeeeel...Foleyyyyy...F...B...C...\" Rachael replied, revealing her identity to Jill Valentine, as well as confirming which faction she was a part of. Of course, Jill then realized that the Ooze in front of her was indeed Raymond's missing partner, where she then knelt down on one knee to speak toward Rachael and said, \"Rachael Foley, huh? Then, that means you must be Raymond's partner who went missing in the bilge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ray...Raymond...Wheeere...where is... heeeee? Is...Is he...alriiiight?\" Rachael asked, wondering if her red-haired partner was alive and well in the hellhole that was the Queen Zenobia. So, as a way to reassure her, Jill calmly spoke toward Rachael and answered, \"Don't worry, he's very much alive and in one piece. He gave me this Iron Anchor Key so I can unlock certain doors. You know, he was...very worried about you, Rachael. And...I'm so sorry for what's happened to you. You couldn't see it, but...I was on the other side and I...I watched you die at the hands of those...things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Rachael could see that look of sadness and sympathy on Jill's face, despite the disheartening revelation. However, just as she was about to respond to Jill's words of sympathy, Rachael witnessed a singular Ooze monster slither out of the airduct in the Research Room. But then, as the Ooze creature slowly stood upright, Rachael was experiencing this inhuman...hunger, as if her mutated body was demanding her to eat and consume the Ooze creature that slowly shambled it's way toward both her and the unsuspecting Jill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in an attempt to warn Jill of the approaching danger, Rachael spoke up and said, \"...Mooove...\" \"Excuse me?\" Jill asked, confused as to why Rachael was saying that, unaware of the approaching Ooze monstrosity. In turn, the gluttonous hunger increased within Rachael, causing her to spring up onto her feet, as she knocked Jill off to the side while she shouted, \"MOVE!!\" From there, Jill quickly recovered, swiftly pulling out her holstered handgun in self-defense, only to witness what she assumed to be Rachael saving her ass from an Ooze monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what seemed the most disturbing about what Jill was witnessing, was the fact that Rachael seemed to be...eating the Ooze monster in her grasp, using her leech-like appendage to consume chunks of the Ooze's moist damp flesh. But it wasn't just the process itself that Jill took notice of, she also noticed that Rachael appeared to be getting somewhat fatter from consuming the Ooze monster, stretching the tattered remains of the diver suit, as Rachael's physique went from thin to downright chubby, complete with plump Double D-Cup breasts, a soft round belly, plump butt, and a pair of chubby legs and slightly plump arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Rachael stopped \"feeding\" on the Ooze monster itself, dropping it on the metallic floor, where the Ooze corpse began to dissolve into a decent-sized puddle of red slime. Once that was all said and done, Rachael soon noticed her newfound softness and girth, gently poking her pudgy belly with her mutated right hand a few times, each poke making her more concerned and distressed. From there, she then looked back at Jill, who lowered her handgun away from Rachael once more, as the BSAA agent began to hear these sobbing noises from Rachael where she whimpered, \"...Jill...Pleeeease...*whimper*...HELP MEEE!!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking into account of what exactly has transpired, Jill felt extremely conflicted on whether to help Rachael or simply outright desert her to her own fate. On one hand, Rachael was no longer human, but a grotesque husk of her former self. But on the other hand however, Jill could clearly see that Rachael still retained her humanity, showing that she was quite frightened and scared out of her mind, pleading greatly for help in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, left with no other choice, Jill had to come down to a decision, letting out a deep sigh and said, \"...I just hope I don't regret this.\" \"...Pleeease...Don't...Leave meee.\" Rachael pleaded, begging for Jill to help her in such a dire predicament and not abandon her. Fortunately for Rachael, that was what Jill intended to do, as she gently laid her left hand on Rachael's right shoulder and replied, \"...Don't worry, Rachael. I'm not going to abandon you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words from Jill filled Rachael's mutated heart with some sense of hope, where she slowly wrapped her arms around Jill in a thankful embrace, while avoiding to hurt or crush the BSAA agent with her inhuman strength, as she then spoke up and whimpered, \"...Thank...you...Jill...*whimper* *whimper*\" \"You're welcome, Rachael. Look, I know this might not sound like a good time to say this, but...Is there a chance you have a key to the elevator that leads to the Main Engine Room? It's important.\" Jill asked, trying to be as polite as possible toward the plump Rachael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for them, that problem was remedied in the form of said key sticking out from between the tattered remains of Rachael's diver suit and her slightly flabby belly. Of course, Rachael noticed this, as Jill began to grab the key by the handle, which also meant feeling some of Rachael's belly flab. To Jill's surprise, Rachael's belly was soft and warm to the touch, despite being all moist and damp from the effects of the V-Abyss virus. And yet, for some strange reason, Jill felt somewhat...aroused, from simply feeling Rachael's plump belly and body fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, she managed to resist those unexpected temptations, as she was able to get the elevator key out from the tight space between the tattered diver suit and Rachael's body fat. From there, Jill stored the elevator key in one of the pouches on her belt, where she then decided to call her partner, Parker, via her communication earpiece attached to her right ear, as she then pressed her right index finger to the earpiece to speak into it and said, \"Parker, can you hear me? I got the key.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's some good news at least. So, have you found Rachael yet?\" Parker asked, who was currently waiting at the elevator that led down into the Main Engine Room. However,what concerned Jill was how exactly Parker was going to react if she told him the truth regarding Rachael's...current condition. So, she decided to take it slowly for her partner and answered, \"It's...complicated, Parker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Jill, what's going on? Did you find Rachael?\" Parker asked once more, becoming both confused and skeptical over what was going on at Jill's end of the line. So, in response to her partner's confusion, Jill eventually decided to disclose what happened to Rachael, where she then spoke toward Parker and explained, \"...I found Rachael, Parker. She's alive, but...she's already been infected with the V-Abyss virus. And yet, she's still able to retain her humanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you know that she isn't faking it?\" Parker said, in some sense of disbelief, thinking that anyone infected with the V-Abyss virus was transformed into a mindless husk. So, to counter her partner's skepticism, Jill then spoke once more and replied, \"First off, Parker: I'm standing right next to her. And second: I talked to her. She was able to tell me her full name, as well as the name of the organization she's a part of. And besides, when one of those creatures was sneaking up behind me, Rachael moved me out of the way and...well, I think she ate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...let me get this straight: Rachael \"ate\" one of these monsters?\" Parker remarked, obviously not buying what Jill said about Rachael consuming one of the Ooze. However, Jill snapped back at her partner and answered, \"Alright, alright, I get it! You might not believe me, Parker. *sigh* Fine, I'll meet you at the elevator. Just do me a favor: Rachael's coming with us, and whatever you do... Don't. Shoot. Her. Got it?\" \"*sigh*...Copy that, Jill. Just get your asses over here before I decide to come to my senses.\" Parker replied, being in sarcastic disbelief that he was about to be within breathing distance of a B.O.W.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after ending the conversation with Parker, Jill turned around to confront Rachael, who was currently examining herself in her mutated form, still becoming accustomed to her newfound physique. However, she soon noticed Jill approaching her, as the BSAA agent then spoke to her and said, \"...Rachael, I've got some good news and some bad news. The good news is that you can come with us. Now, as for the bad news, Parker...he, um... doesn't exactly want to be near you, since he thinks you might, um... hurt him. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Don't...want to... hurrrt...hiiiim.\" Rachael answered, wanting to let Jill know that she didn't want to harm Parker in anyway, especially since  she and Jill were the ones who wanted to prove that she wasn't a monster. Of course, despite Rachael's hindered capacity of intelligible speech due to her unwilling transformation, Jill understood what Rachael was telling her, where Jill then held Rachael's still-human left hand in reassurance and understand as she replied, \"...I know you want to prove him wrong, Rachael. It's just that we need to play things a bit safe. After all, we're not sure if there are any side effects from you devouring those...those things. I mean, it might just make you more hostile toward humans if you keep eating anymore of those creatures. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me...Don't...want to...hurrrt you...Jill. But...sooo...huuungrry...\" Rachael said, becoming somewhat frightened at such an outcome, not wanting to harm the only human that didn't see her as a monster. \"I know, Rachael. But you've got to fight the need to feed. Come on, we need to rendezvous with Parker at the elevator.\" Jill answered, as she then carefully guided Rachael out of the bloodied Research Room, and into the metal hallway interior of the Queen Zenobia, slowly but progressively making their way to Parker's current location.</span></div></div>",

However, seeing that it was going to take them a bit of a while to reach Parker at the pace they're currently going, Jill decided to have a conversation with Rachael to pass the time, as well as see if there was something that she and Parker might've missed, where she calmly spoke toward Rachael and asked, \"...Rachael, I know this might sound rude considering, but...Was there anything you might have found that could help us figure out why Veltro are using luxury ships like the Queen Zenobia? It might help us solve this crisis we're in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she truly wanted to help Jill in answering such a question, Rachael had just recently found out that she was having some difficulty remembering recent events before her \"death\" and transformation into an Ooze, causing Rachael to experience this nauseating and somewhat painful headache, as she pressed her mutated right hand against the side of her head, feeling like she was experiencing an awful migraine. \"...Can't...Re...Remember. Braiiiin...Hurrrts...\" She answered, as her migraine slowly but noticeably dissipated, still lingering somewhere in the back of Rachael's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, despite not getting any closer to understanding what exactly was going on in this hellhole, Jill understood Rachael's predicament. After all, when Jill had witnessed Rachael's demise at the claws of the Ooze, there was this splatter of blood smeared over the Research Room window, which indicated that the transformed FBC agent might have suffered some form of physical brain damage prior to her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...it's okay, Rachael. You don't have to answer my question if it hurts so much to remember.\" Jill replied, trying to let Rachael ease off on thinking too hard about what happened to her before dying and turning into an Ooze. Unfortunately for the female duo, just as they were about to continue their conversation, they saw approximately 7 Ooze creatures crawling out from a few of the airducts nearby! And judging from their varied appearances, there appeared to be 3 standard Oozes, 2 Oozes with massive claws called Pincers, and 2 Oozes with a bizarre looking arm that shot out sharp projectiles known as Tricornes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! We got company!\" Jill shouted, quickly raising her handgun up and aimed at a Tricorne, just as it raised it's grotesque appendage and aimed it toward Jill and Rachael, intent on attacking them. From there, Jill began to open fire on the Tricorne, firing off a few rounds into the monster, killing it with relative ease. However, while Jill was confronting the remaining Tricorne, Rachael began to fend off the two Pincers, using her inhuman strength from the V-Abyss virus, along with using her elongated clawed right hand as a weapon to inflict damage upon the creatures, intent on protecting Jill as she confronted the Pincers and growled, \"...Leave...Jill...ALOOONE!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, out of instinct and despite Jill warning her not to do this, Rachael used her leech-like tongue to impale the Pincer in her grasp, and began suck on it's bodily fluids, thus draining the creature of some of it's strength. However, this also made Rachael gain an extra 50 to 60 pounds of blubber, as she then delivered a fatal claw swipe against the Pincer, ;killing it in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after several minutes of fighting and shooting through the remaining Ooze, Jill and Rachael were able to survive the ambush unscathed...Well, mostly unscathed. However, it wasn't Jill that was injured, but rather, it was Rachael, since she had consumed the bodily fluids of some of the Ooze creatures that attacked them, gaining an overall weight of 140 pounds of blubber, thus putting Rachael at around almost 300 pounds in weight, as her newly acquired body fat began to distribute it's mass throughout her mutated physique, increasing her overall bulk and girth from chubby to downright fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Jill couldn't help but notice Rachael's increased girth, which brought up those unexpected temptations from earlier once more, causing the BSAA agent to display a pair of blushing cheeks on her face, subconsciously thinking about how attractive Rachael was with all of that fat. However, due to their current situation, Jill had to forcefully snap herself back to reality, and yet...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately, despite her best efforts to restrain herself from fondling with Rachael's fat mutated physique, Jill Valentine couldn't hold back anymore, as she slowly approached Rachael and began to press her hands into Rachael's plump round belly, feeling how soft, warm, and plush her abdomen had become. In all honesty, she wasn't sure if Rachael was unwittingly secreting a unique pheromone that was causing her to behave like this, or if there was some sort of erotic desire suppressed within her psyche, which has now made itself known to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Rachael was very much aware of what exactly Jill was specifically doing, as the transformed FBC agent felt Jill's hands continuing to fondle with her plump love handles, fat round belly, bloated waistline, hips, and buttcheeks. \"*aroused moan*...Jill...Stooop...Pleease...\" Rachael said, becoming sexually aroused from Jill's current behavior and handiwork upon her bloated frame, as her mind was conflicted between letting Jill continue fondling her fattened form, and simply snapping the BSAA agent out of her sexually-induced stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Rachael had chosen the latter option, where she then used her still-human left hand to slap Jill in the face as she exclaimed, \"JILL STOP!!\" Fortunately for Rachael, her method was successful, as Jill managed to regain control over herself, looking back at Rachael with a confused but embarrassed expression on her face and asked, \"Um, Rachael? What...What was I doing?\" \"...You played...With meeee...\" Rachael answered, becoming embarrassed herself somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, both Rachael and Jill had experienced something that was both erotic and awkward at the same time, especially since this obviously involved Rachael's newly acquired girth from devouring the bodily fluids of the Ooze from their recent encounters on the Queen Zenobia. \"I... Played with you?\" Jill asked, becoming a little more confused regarding what just happened a moment ago. In response, Rachael nodded in confirmation and bluntly explained, \"...You...You played...With...My bellyyyy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, upon hearing from Rachael of what exactly she had done, Jill couldn't help but blush even more in embarrassment, as her cheeks took on a deep crimson hue. However, she couldn't help but feel this sense of exhilarated excitement and arousal from merely touching Rachael's flab, as she thought, \"Is this what it feels like to be in love with a girl? Let alone a fat girl?\" Although, hearing about lesbianism wasn't old news to Jill. After all, one of the BSAA's agents and former FBC agent , Jessica, happened to be a lesbian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after a moment or two of awkward silence between the two individuals, Rachael spoke up first, as she slowly looked toward a blushing Jill and asked, \"...You...Like me...Fat?\" Upon hearing what exactly Rachael had just said, Jill snapped out of her own thoughts, still blushing some. From there, Jill eventually spoke toward the plump Rachael and replied, \"...Well, um... maybe, Rachael. I...I don't know. It...I-It feels all new to me. But, uh... Anyway, we should really get back to our rendezvous with Parker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, despite the erotic yet awkward \"intimate\" moment between her and Jill Valentine, Rachael Foley (or rather, Rachael Ooze, given her physical condition) nodded in agreement with the BSAA agent, thus resuming their trek through the bowels of the Queen Zenobia, with Rachael doing her best to keep up with Jill. And yet, for some peculiar reason, Rachael could've sworn that Jill's belly was looking a little...bloated, underneath her skintight diver suit. At first, Rachael thought that her eyes were simply playing tricks on her, but she couldn't help but have a bad feeling about this, as they cautiously made their way through the luxury ship's interior.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although they were eventually able to progress their way out of the bilge and into the passenger-focused areas of the Queen Zenobia, Jill and Rachael cautiously trekked through some of the numerous decrepit and abandoned rooms and hallways of the Passenger Quarters, as Rachael continued to closely follow behind Jill Valentine, despite having this shambling stature in her walking pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite what had just recently happened back in the bilge section of the ship, neither Jill or Rachael couldn't seem to get said event out of their individual minds. In Jill's mind, she began to slowly develop this erotic fascination with Rachael's fat bulging frame, as the transformed FBC agent's mutated body kept lightly jiggling with each shambling step she took, due to her newly acquired blubber. While Rachael on the other hand, she couldn't seem to keep her eyes off of Jill, noticing that the BSAA agent's butt appeared to be slightly more plump than before underneath such a skintight diver suit, which subtly jiggled with each step Jill took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from that, Rachael also was aware that Jill kept sneaking in these quick periodic glances at her, as if she was taking a peek at Rachael's somewhat bulky frame. \"...Jill...Why...Are you...Looking...At meee?\" Rachael asked, wanting to know why Jill was sneaking in glances at her in a shy and timid manner. However, Jill tried her best to ignore Rachael's question, displaying a crimson blush of embarrassment on such an erotic subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, it was only a matter of time before Rachael figured out the reason why Jill was looking at her in such a manner, as Rachael soon realized the answer, prompting her to slowly rub her plump round belly with her left hand to gain Jill's attention and said, \"...You...Like me...Like this...Don't you...Jill?\" Although she tried her best to avoid the subject, Jill was having more and more difficulty in doing so, as Rachael continued to stroke her flabby belly and said, \"...You...Like me...As a... Fatty...Don't you? ...Me...Can see it...In your...Eyeeees...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, despite her best efforts to resist such erotic temptations, Jill couldn't hold it in any further, where she quickly turned around to confront Rachael and exclaimed, \"Alright Alright, I admit it! I, um... I like fat girls, Rachael.\" Upon hearing such a confession, Rachael then spoke toward Jill once more and asked, \"...But why...Keep it...Secret...From meee?\" But then, just before Jill was about to answer such a question from Rachael, they both suddenly heard this eerie male voice approaching them as it said, \"...Mayday...Maaayday...This is... The Queen Zenobia...Emergency Distress...Call...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Jill muttered under her own breath, instantly recognizing who it was that they just heard seconds ago: It was the grotesque abomination that was once the Queen Zenobia's Communications Officer, horrendously mutated by the V-Abyss virus, just like the rest of the passengers and crew members on this now derelict luxury ship. \"Not...Good?\" Rachael asked, wondering if the creature approaching them was bad news to her and Jill, which made the BSAA agent look back at Rachael and replied, \"...Not good, Rachael. Not good at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as they continued to hear the wet thunderous footsteps of the mutated Comms Officer slowly approaching them, Rachael knew that she needed to get a gun. And fast. \"...Jill...Give me...Gun...\" Rachael said, wanting Jill to give her the handgun, since she noticed that Jill had an MP-5 Submachine Gun slung behind her back. However, just as the bloated and rotund Ooze creature lumbered it's way around the corner, Jill momentarily looked back at Rachael and replied, \"I don't think this is a good time to talk about giving you a weapon, Rachael.\" \"...Jill...Do you...Trust meee?\" Rachael asked, which made Jill quickly respond as she answered, \"...Yes, Rachael. Of course I trust you, but this isn't solving our current situation right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Then...Give me...Gun. Me...Can heeelp...\" Rachael replied, letting Jill know that she can trust her with a firearm, despite being transformed into an Ooze by the V-Abyss virus. Although she was somewhat skeptical regarding the topic of giving a mutated Rachael Foley a handgun to use, but given the current situation and circumstance they inadvertently found themselves in, Jill eventually decided to...</span></div></div>",

This isn't a transformation/vore/giantess story, it's about the poundage.<br>\r\n-Don't kill off the main characters ( ;p Unless it's in dream sequences, such as popping, being trapped by zombies, etc.)<br>\r\n-Male weight gain is allowed if the circumstances of the story allow it ( i.e. fattening virus leaks out, a weight gain related monster attacks female character and companions) Just don't make it the focus.<br>\r\n-NO underage weight gain. I don't want eight year old kids running around, porking out. Ashley is OK though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that about covers the don'ts, now how about the fun stuff:<br>\r\n-Weight Gain (OF COURSE this is allowed! :D)<br>\r\n-Sex and sexual situations (It's rated GC for a reason ;) Stuff can go pretty far)<br>\r\n-Slobbiness (Just don't make it the focus of the story)<br>\r\n-Immobility is allowed, just remember that you or somebody else will have to write their way out.
