Mechanical hands, a computer, a built in hd screen, games, a duel disk, and much much more!

Lua smiled, turning over to the chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the birthday meal.\" Lua stated, as the chef whirred over to him, placing down a giant cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Lua, eat up!\" The chef smiled, Lua looked at the cake, a little uneasy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...uh...\" Lua gulps, \"I'm...really full, still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nonsense dear~\" The chef grabs a cake slice and shoves it into Lua's mouth.

However, Lua didn't anticipate his belly growing as much as it did. His belly grew, the shirt he wore rose up, as Lua took off his jacket, the room warmed up in his mind. Lua kept eating, the pizza had been secretly spiked with spices, certain weight gain spices. Lua's belly hungrily growled once he finished, panting heavily, letting out a burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I get so...hungry?\" Lua noticed, however, ignoring his belly as he walks over to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licks his lips, grabbing brownies, cakes, ice cream, and stuffing himself even more.

Most people were playing card games in their dreams or were still working in the security. However, a small green haired girl at the age of eleven was already on her feet and ready to do something. The girl was called Luna, a petite girl who did her hair in two high pigtails and was also pretty smart. Her twin brother, Leo, still slept in his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the bathroom to look at the only intact mirror in the entire house. The last one was smashed by Leo, who threw his shoe at it after he lost a duel against his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the mirror and examined her entire body. She wore a red long-sleeved shirt under a short sleeved light pink jacket and a pair of white shorts that are held together by a red belt. She also wore high socks and a pair of pink sneakers. It was clear that she is dressed like a typical girl with all the red and pink colors. She also was very proud of her slim and slender body, because most of the girls in her class were slightly heavier and not all that attractive. She however managed that even grown-ups fell in love with her. But before she finished looking at the mirror, she gave herself a small slap on her butt for no apparent reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Luna never thought what strange, exiting, weird or creepy things she would experience during that one single day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I am ready. What shall I do today? My brother is still asleep and I have the strange urge to do something for once,\u201d she said to herself while running in circles.

A foot walk was only twenty minutes long and would not be all that complicated. She only needed to go straight forward and after a green card shop; she must only go to the right to see the gigantic mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pathway to the card shop was not exiting enough to stop her from her track. Only a few people crossed the street and the only shop she saw was an expensive grocery store she rarely visited. There was a park on the right with some beautiful flowers, but Luna chose that she would pay them a visit after she discovered the rich amount of shops inside the shopping precinct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifteen minutes, she saw the green card shop that sells various products like Duel Disks, Cards or even Toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I will visit the store at first. Perhaps I can find a nice card for Leo\u2019s Deck. Maybe they have some cards that would complement with my Deck?\u201d assumed Luna as she looked with big eyes at the card shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to take a closer look at the shop window, but before she could move on, an old and kind man appeared from the left out of the shadows and began to talk with the green haired girl in a strange accent: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello my little angel! How are you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I guess,\u201d answered Luna quickly.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know. I was always able to sense a person\u2019s heart by talking to them. And you seem to be a very kind person. Do you have some time to chat with an old grandpa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe now had the choice to go to the card shop or hear the stories of the old man. Her parents taught her to respect old people, but it was also suspicious that a stranger would talk to her. Why would he do that? Is he an enemy or simply a kind person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She blushed red. \u201cMost kids today are unfriendly and have no respect towards old people. One of my childhood friends got beaten up by some teenagers last week and now he is in the hospital. Kids these days are so unfriendly! Back in my time, the police and our parents kicked the crap out of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man told her his entire childhood and how childish the current society is. After twenty minutes of nonstop blabbering, the old man stopped talking and looked directly at her yellow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have wonderful eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d she began blushing even stronger.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are also very polite. You know, I and my wife are working on a new shop and we have the cheapest prices out here. Do you want to come and pay a visit?\u201d asked the man.<br>\r\n\u201cSure! I originally wanted to go to the shopping mall, but I have plenty of time.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks darling,\u201d he said and pointed at an empty and abandoned site street that seemed to be dark due to all the skyscrapers around it. \u201cGo to the dark side way and go to another side way that is behind a van. Find a red door and you are there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you even open a shop in such a dark place that is easy to miss?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was quite cheap to earn a license. I was going to place some signs here for advertising, but I did not have enough time for this.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be indeed a good idea. Well, see you later!\u201d answered Luna before she shook hands with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the talk, the brave girl entered the dark side street. In fact, it was so dark that after Luna walked a few meters into the darkness, the people outside would not even see her anymore. <br>\r\n The smell of the garbage bins was also disgusting. In the side way, she needed to enter another side way that was well hidden well behind another garbage container and a van. This side way was even darker than the last one and none of the sky scrapers that surrounded the street had any windows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would anybody even open a shop right there? Nobody would even dare to enter a smelly and dark side way, especially if it\u2019s hidden by a van,\u201d she thought and doubted the entire story of the old men. And yet she still felt a great urge for adventure and continued walking further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw a red door. She reached the door, opened it and found\u2026</span></div></div>",

She was scarred. She never was that scarred in her entire life! Perhaps it was a trap? Whatever it is, she had a bad feeling in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped back from the room to go outside, but the path was blocked by something. Luna then rotated and saw the old man from outside and two unknown men. The old man had an evil grin on his face and the two men around him do not even care about her. She tried to duck and run between their legs, but one of the men grabbed her by her hand while the other one then tightly hold her legs together. She also tried to scream for help, but the old man quickly taped her mouth with duct tape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are so naive! Haven\u2019t you parents told you that you should not listen to strangers? You may be kind and smart, but you are way too gullible for this world!\u201d said the old man to Luna, whom trembled in fear and tried to escape from them. But it was a waste. She was way too fragile to escape from the hands of two muscular men. The old man only moved his finger gently around her clothed belly, trying to locate her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought what would happen to her now. Would they rape or even kill her? Or kidnap her and use her as a guinea pig for horrible experiments? Whatever it is, she wished that Yusei or somebody else would appear and rescue her.<br>\r\nLuna still trembled in fear and tried to escape from the grip of the two men, but it was a futile attempt. The old man then took a bottle of chloroform and a tissue, damped the tissue with chloroform and held it on Luna\u2019s nose. At first she still tried to resist, but from second to second, she became weaker and after a short time, she felt into a coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any voice, the three men then began to store Luna inside the van and drove away from New Domino City without being conspicuous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later, the effect of the chloroform went away and Luna began to close the eyes.

Luna then exited the bathroom and walked downstairs to the living room. From the stairs, she turned to the left and was walking until she arrived at the already opened door in the end of the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents were quite rich and could easily afford such a big apartment, but they were always working oversea and were never at home. However, both Luna and Leo quickly got used to this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black PC was standing on a matching black desk. But Luna already took notice that the PC was turned on: \u201cHuh, why is this PC already turned on? Has Leo forgotten to turn it off after he played that one game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she did not really care about it right now. She sat on the chair and immediately checked her e-mails. There were three or four advertisements about the newest cards. However, the only thing that got her attention was a mail with the title \u2018Want to transform?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna then clicked the link out of curiosity. She was actually prepared to read another spam with some questionable pictures, but then she began to read the text:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Luna. From all the girls in this world, you were chosen to participate in an experiment. As the title suggests, you have now the chance to turn into an object until midnight. If you always wanted to experience the helplessness and the thrill to become an immobilized object, click the link under that paragraph.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was quite shocked. On the one side, she always wanted to experience something different, because the normal life was quite boring lately and to transform into an object would be a nice change. Maybe the weird, forced and painful feeling during the transformation would be a unique experience. On the other hand, the whole story seemed to sound like a big fat lie. It also was quite fishy that a stranger knew her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart seemed to beat faster than regular and she then began to think: \"I never received such a suspicious mail. How in the hell did they have my name and why was I chosen as a guinea pig? And who knows how dangerous this transformation really is? Perhaps this entire mail was a fake? I am sorry, but that is sounding too dangerous. But on the other hand, transforming into an object for a limited time would also be pretty interesting for once.

I am still a little bit worried on how this works, but it's better than nothing!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe page had a black background and the entire text was in white. She started to read the text and was surprised that the first paragraph described her entire biography of her life and the struggle she had before she clicked on that link.

She instantly lost all her doubts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second paragraph described that if she would move to the next page, the time would halt until she has fully transformed into an object of her choice.

However, she always could turn off the PC to let the time flow again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna then advanced to the next page and instantly looked at the window. The Internet page was right! The entire city stood still. The clouds, the cars and the people on the streets were standing still.
