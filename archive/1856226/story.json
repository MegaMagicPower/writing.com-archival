He saw the look of despair on <br>\r\n<br>\r\nher face as she fell asleep and he let out a heavy sigh. \u201cWinnie\u201d he muttered to himself. \u201cI-I'm so sorry <br>\r\n<br>\r\nabout...\u201d He paused for a moment to gain his composure. \u201cAbout everything\u201d He finished, grabbing his <br>\r\n<br>\r\ntote bag and hopping down from the tree. He heard thunder and looked up. Sure enough, it had begun <br>\r\n<br>\r\npouring rain. 'Hm' Al thought looking up into the darkened night sky. \u201cEven the sky itself weeps <br>\r\n<br>\r\nalongside me\u201d he said as tears rolled down his face. He began walking away from the school, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nremembering the note he left on Phanty's bed for her to find. 'They'll figure it out before too much <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlonger' Al thought. 'Phanty, I'm sorry to do this to you and on Valentines Day no less' Al thought as he <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncontinued making his trek, the rain pouring down onto his face and hair. 'Hopefully you will find it in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyour heart to forgive me.....someday'. \u201cI'm lost....and....and so confused\u201d he said. \u201cAnd....(Alucard has a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nflashback to the day he killed Michael Myers) This power\u201d he said, clenching his fist. 'It's so dark and <br>\r\n<br>\r\ncold inside' he thought as he continued to trudge along the muddy dirt path. 'Is this what I truly am <br>\r\n<br>\r\ninside? Is this what I am destined to become' he thought, picturing the image of himself in that raging <br>\r\n<br>\r\nmonstrous form? 'In any case, I know one thing for sure, I need guidance' he thought gazing up into the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrainy, dreary, cloud filled sky. \u201cI don't know where you are, or how to find you\u201d said Al out loud to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhimself as he continued walking. \u201cBut I know you are the only one who truly understands me and my <br>\r\n<br>\r\npower. So ready or not, here I come......Master.....\u201d He said as he faded away into the darkness of the <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrain drenched night.</span></div></div>",
