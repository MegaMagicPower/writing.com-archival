You saught the help of the necromancer Veson to bring her back, and you were happy. But, Cosmo became more and more violent and soon had driven herself to the point of trying to kill you. She fell to her seccond death in Brinstar and, due to her unnatural reserection, turned directly into a Hallow; you fear she may still follow you and try to kill Mellissa out of blind hunger jealousy. Captain quit the team 5 years later to start a new life on earth. Mewtwo despised leading (due to his low self esteem) and left the job to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a heated argument with Mellissa, you slam the phone down. Mewtwo, sensing your anger, floats over.
