You are studying for your final exam, which will be a six hour theory paper followed by a four hour physical exam. Ten out of every thousand students pass the exam to become Space Rangers\u2026the rest become space genitors\u2026at the moment you are not too positive about your prospects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning your thoughts to the three terra-bytes of work that you still have to go through, you hear star fleet Admiral Maximus Potentius talking to one of his subordinates outside your door. \u201cIf we don\u2019t recover the Star Nexus, it will be our end. We need a hero for this, but we cannot find our number one Space Ranger, Sam Sloane.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMissing in action sir\u201d, the subordinate asks. \u201cNo. A month ago, for his bachelors his buddies dumped his intoxicated body into a crate and mailed him to the outer rim\u2026we\u2019ve not been able to find him since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard a rumour the Star Nexus was stolen by the Gobz-Natz and is being held in the dark marshes of Doomsdunder\u201d, his subordinate says. Quickly checking your books you see that Doomsdunder is a dark and dangerous planet. The Gobz-Natz is an evil breed of alien, with a particular disliking of humans\u2026except when it comes to human flesh which they will gladly prepare in any variety of ways as per their \u201cUniversal Cookbook for Humans and all other Inferior Creatures\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can hear anything else, a passer-by scares them away. Your mind races at the speed of light. If you recover the Star Nexus (whatever that is), they will instantly make you a Space Ranger. You figure that your odds are much better of becoming a Space Ranger by braving the Gobz-Natz, than by passing the exam. You realize you could sneak into the launch-deck and highjack a transporter, but where will you go?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s all I ever wanted to be!\u201d Your eyes mist up and your voice cracks a little as you reminisce.  \u201cWhen I was a young boy growing up on the algae farms of Ag326 I used to watch \u2018Tales of Galactic Patrol\u2019 on the Tri-Dee.  My friends and I would pretend to be patrolmen on the Acturas border, and set up empty Bio-Nutri-Aid crates as road blocks and checkpoints.  Then we\u2019d pretend that the pre-programed waste-carrier Bots were Agrean blockade runners as they smashed trough them without stopping, and we\u2019d shoot at them with our photon pistols, well, bent sticks we would pretend were photon pistols, cause we couldn\u2019t afford the officially merchandised \u2018Galactic Patrol\u2019 action sets that the rich kids who lived in the pumping sector would deck themselves out with\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, all right!

It was a bit like a feeling of being swallowed like a glass of water.  For a short while you\u2019re not sure if you started out half full or half empty, only that you are definitely flat. And tepid.  The feeling soon passes, and you settle down to the mind numbing boredom of hyper-travel.<br>\r\n  A couple of times during the 20 minute journey you attempt to query the computer, only to have the navigation screen flash the words \u2018Can\u2019t talk right now, busy navigating\u2019 at you.

Another corner looks like it has been used as a toilet by countless other captives, since departed.

Perhaps an escape plan will occure to you as you munch down \u2018Cadet Brand Nutri-O-Bar\u2019, the one nutrition bar guaranteed to lessen your hunger (quite true, as the thought of eating a second was often enough to make you decide you\u2019re really not that hungry). <br>\r\n  You start to wipe your hands on the sides of your dirt covered uniform and find they are covered with a yellowish foul smelling powder. Great, it looks like the Gobz-Natz trooper dragged you through a pile of sulfur on your way here. You shake as much of the yellow dust as you can out of your clothes, then open the Sur-Viv-All pack to see what\u2019s for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  One of the wonders of the Sur-Viv-All kit was the Metabolic Universatility Compound Kit.  MUCK was a series of sprays that you applied to anything you thought might be edible, and chemical agents in the spray(s) would combine with any and all toxins, or other biological incompatible compounds, and render them harmless. Once the process was complete, a chromatic indicator let you know you could now consume that item.  In other words, if the meat was green, it was safe to eat. <br>\r\n  One of the side effects of eating such treated food was that the human bowels often reacted by producing an excessive amount of intestinal gas.  This, combined with the cramped conditions onboard ship escape pods during emergency evacuation, often lead to statements like  \u201cJees dud! If you have to do that, do it outside!\u201d  Since atmosphere suits were often not included in these invitations, offenders rarely got a third chance to apologize.<br>\r\n  Thus was the decision made to include charcoal biscuits to absorb and neutralize any possible flatulence causing gasses. The manufacture claimed that the biscuits were not only effective, but tasty and nutritious as well.  On an Odd side note, the executive in charge of advertising  for \u2018Dad\u2019s Own Willow Charcoal Brand\u2019 was recently indicted for failure to declare income from sales of over 350 of his grandmother\u2019s \u2018gently enjoyed\u2019 atmospheric runabouts (used only to visit her worship planetoid on Sundays, and all with only slightly more than 10,000 kilo-parsecs on the clock) <br>\r\n  The danger of deathly flatulence was why, as you rummage amongst  the colourfully decorated (one couldn\u2019t possibly use the phrase \u2018tastefully decorated\u2019 without risking the wrath of the Goddess Morissette, patron Saint of irony) packages of Sust-In-All E-Ration (Trademark applied for) you see a jumbo sized box of \u2018Dad\u2019s Own\u2019 Biscuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare for a minute at the label, as something important wriggles beneath the surface of your memory, something learned, under hypnosis, in a chemistry class long, long ago and far, far away.  Something about Urinic acid, and charcoal, and sulfur.  What was it???\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly, a mental image forms of people, and hot dogs, and a pot of bubbling tomatoes.  Why do you keep thinking of sulfuric smelling tomatoes?<br>\r\n  Wait a minute.  Sulfur! Charcoal. That recipe for your great uncle Jack\u2019s authentic Australian style Taiwanese Tex-Mex Chili !!.<br>\r\n  Earth was a long time ago, but traditionalists still observed the old traditional holidays: Xmas, Earth Hog Day, Spring Break, Easter, Hollow Weed, Thanks for Shopping, and the mystical 4th of July.  Chili, for some obscure reason, had come to be associated with the 4th; a holiday honoring the Great Prophet Rushmore (a 4 headed giant said to have lead the faithful to a bountiful land overflowing with milk and honey, where he gave them dominion over the birds of the air, the beasts of the land, the fish of the waters, and stewardship over the less fortunate and backwards peoples, back in the days when all those things still existed.)  <br>\r\n  Every year Uncle Jack would dig out the dog eared, badly stained and almost unreadable recipe book that was his family heirloom.  The book wasn\u2019t the original, which had disintegrated to dust long in the distant past.  Instead, successive generations had faithfully copied and translated the pages as the old ones tore, faded, caught fire, dissolved, or were otherwise damaged.  Who the author Anna Christ was, and why her cook book came to be associated with that particular holiday, was a mystery.    You had always meant to ask Uncle Jack about that, but had never gotten around to it. And then had come that fateful day when, after eating the entire pot himself because, as he had put it, the other relatives at the picnic were un-educated heathens that lacked the sophistication to appreciated the fine art of traditional cooking, he had struck a lit match to a Nic-O-Stick, inhaled, and vanished in a very loud cloud of smoke. (The resultant crater is fondly called \u2018Jack\u2019s Lake\u2019 and is quite a popular fishing spot).<br>\r\n  You sigh, and shake your head.
