He had forgotten to turn the alarm off as he wouldn't need to use it again for a good few weeks as it was the summer and all the time mark spent in those weeks he was determined to relax and chill out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark reaches across and turns off the alarm, throwing his head back down onto the soft pillow and sleeping until noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mark wakes up he thinks 'Man, I needed that!' and then whilst still being in his boxers he decides to go and find his room mate. To his surprise his room mate was just leaving his bedroom too in his boxers, after only just waking up himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name is Luke and despite now having the same physique as Mark he was chubby when Mark first met him last year. This physique was due to the two of them hitting the gym together as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So ready for the gym?' asks Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not really, ready for the IHOP?' you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You read my mind!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the guys head out for breakfast or is it lunch . . .</span></div></div>",

Mark and Luke being fit young men had no trouble carrying all the food and drink back to their dorm, but have worked up quite an appetite, so seeing as it's  summer they decide to chill out and have a munch then do a bit of sunbathing before going to sleep in the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wake up at 6 and are again feeling a bit hungry so they decide to grab one of the pizzas which they had bought, and have a few beers too.

I can't wait to see how you manage alcohol!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke simply laughs and goes for a shower.

His round face and fat neck led down to a broad chest and even broader gut that filled the golf shirt of his uniform nearly to the breaking point.  Mark mentally figured that the guy had to weigh at least 300 pounds.  Strangely, seeing another guy his own age so big just made him feel hungier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mark is doing his mental calculations on the counter guy, Luke speaks up.  \"I'm having a combo number two and two extra doubles,\" he says in a positive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do ya want to supersize that?\" asked the server.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Luke replied.  \"And maybe I'll get a sundae later too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" replies the fat guy, smacking his lips.  \"And you?\" he asks Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same for me,\" replies Mark.  \"Must be hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry is good!\" replies the server, who turns to get the drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I thought I had eaten enough at breakfast to last me the whole day,\" Luke commented, \"but now I'm hungry again. I guess I had it in the back of my mind all year that I shouldn't eat 'til I'm full to keep my body and stop from going back to chubby! But now that we don't have to worry about that for a while, I feel like I can eat loads and not feel bad after and have to hit the gym!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" replied Mark, as the server puts the drinks on their trays.  \"It's gonna be great to just eat for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe server brings the burgers for them, then asks, \"Say, you two hungry?  We got a couple of chicken burgers sitting here that somebody in the drive through cancelled out on, and I have to either give 'em away or throw them out.  I'd eat them myself but I'm waiting for my new uniform to come in, this one's gotten a little tight.  You two sound like two hungry boys who could put them away easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" reply Mark and Luke together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys ample over to a table and fall to their fast-food feasts greedily. Soon, the burgers and fries are safely esconced in their still-flat-for-now midriffs, and the two young studs amble back to the counter for a sundae.  Bored, with an empty restaurant, the counter guy gives them each a large sundae, when they'd only ordered a regular.  Soon, temporarily sated, they head off to finish their day's tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout five o'clock Luke lets himself into the apartment, to find Mark setting out food on the counter and table.  Luke, feeling peckish, grabs a big bag of Doritos and takes a handful, opening a tub of dip and dipping the whole lot at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy,\" says Mark, \"We have all summer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever, just getting something to start on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK dude, but wait for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark brings over two massive tubs of ice-cream and two big spoons.  The boys dig in and consume all of that snack in 20 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice appetizer!\" says Luke, putting down the empty tub and grabbing the last Doritos.  \"But I need something more beefy!  Did you get any pizza, Mark?  Put a few of those in the oven, and pass me a couple of submarines in the meantime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark passes Luke the subs, and says, \"Hey, I got frozen lasagna too, it's in the oven, should be done about now.  Want it before the pies?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" replies Luke, his mouth begins watering at the thought. The two guzzle a two-liter each while wolfing down the big pan of lasagna.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...PING...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oven time went off...the pizzas were cooked and despite their feed already, the smell was making both boys' mouths water! Mark pulls the pizzas out and the two share the four pizzas, having some of each kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both of them had finished, Mark a few minutes after Luke, Luke went over to the counter and opened up a package of snack cakes tossed them to Mark.  Taking another package for himself, he pulled more pop out of the fridge, cola for Mark and root beer for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I bet you can't burp louder than me!\" said one, after a particularly large swig of pop....and so the talking went on in true 'lad' fashion! Eventually they agreed that Luke had the loudest burp. <br>\r\n\"But that's 'cause you're a fatty!\" says Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you call me?\" replies Luke, feeling full and belligerent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Fatty!\" shoots back Mark.  \"Let's face it - you have a great body now, but you still think you can outeat me and you used to be fat - you'll have a harder time keeping slim than me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,of course, you can eat and eat and not gain!  I though we were going to relax and not worry about 'weight' for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in fact,\" says Mark, feeling a bit silly from all the food, \"I was looking forward to watching you put on a few pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" retorted Luke. \"Well that's easy.  Hey, I'd like to see you put on a few too - cover that perfect body with a little manly meat. You think I'm a fatty?  Well, hell yeah, I guess I am, under all this crap.  Here, we'll bet. I bet that I can gain more weight that you in one month!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\" replies Mark, a light in his eyes. \"There's cheesecake in the fridge - just watch me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, one of those for me too!\" says Luke, clambering to his feet.  He nearly snatches the box out of Mark's hands in his eagerness to get started on the bet...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The day after the first binge, they woke up feeling tired and terrible, but like any guy in a bet, committed to continue. Over the course of a week, they did settle into a pattern. The guy at their burger joint now knew them by name, and they noticed that he always seemed to have some cancelled order that doubled the size of what they paid for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fridge, which they had entirely cleaned out over the course of three days, was restocked with everything microwaveable and unhealthy. They bought loads of snack foods but couldn't seem to keep them in stock, since every time even the largest bags would be opened, they wouldn't last 20 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke, by past history, did settle in faster to the lifestyle. The third day, he was putting away much more food than he had before. leaving Mark behind. After only a week, not an enormous amount was showing, but you could see it through his clothes. Luke had bought tightly fitted clothes to show off his chiseled body when he had gotten fit; now they were serving to show off every pound he put on. His t-shirt no longer came over the top of his jeans, and the tiniest bit of midriff showed. A treasure trail led up into the hint of a starter belly, that became more than a hint when he was stuffed. His pants were tighter, and mostly in the butt. You could see from up close it was becoming a struggle to put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was never one to be left behind. He always ordered as much as Luke at the burger joint, and tried to catch up with him everywhere else. Luke may have led the way after three days, but Mark's shear determination was leading him to catch up. Just to help, Mark stopped by the nutrition store early on in the week and picked up a protein weight gain formula. He had two shakes every night right before sleep, to make sure that he wouldn't fall behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Mark ended up being ahead. The protein shakes right before bed went straight to his body, and he was in the same position as Mark. His shirts showed a hint of midriff, his pants tighter than before, and his arms looked slightly less defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys were still determined to win.</span></div></div>",

Instead, Mark decided that he'd simply continue to appease his every craving and throw himself headfirst into a sedentary lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark took to this new way of life very well.  It was easier than he could have imagined to just lounge around in front of the television with a big bag of chips and a can of beer for company.  He stopped making trips to the gym and really only left during mealtimes.  Even though he wasn't doing too much, he had to admit that he was definitely having a blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luke was studying for an upcoming test and Mark was pretending to type up a paper while really chatting on Facebook.  The assignment wasn't due until the end of the week anyway, and there was no point in trying to write when his heart wasn't in it anyway, he reasoned.  <br>\r\nClosing his textbook, Luke let out a sigh and glanced at the clock.  \"I think I'm gonna go to the weight room before dinner.  Wanna come?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno man, I'm kind of tired,\" Mark replied, giving up on the prospect of homework and reaching for the remote.  \"I'll hit the caf with you when you're done though.\"<br>\r\nMark had always used to be the one to drag Luke off to work out, and Luke had noticed that that trend had changed recently.  After a day full of classes and a few hours of homework, he found that he liked doing something to take his mind off of school.  Plus, he was able to persuade himself to take extra helpings at dinner if he could say he had worked out earlier.  The gym was the perfect choice.  <br>\r\n\"What could you possibly be tired from?  You didn't even go to class today.\"</span></div></div>",

He liked feeling powerful, but he was a naturally big, strong guy and he didn't have to worry about working out so much.  He couldn't remember the last time he'd gone so long without a sore or cramped muscle.  Mark was thoroughly converted after living the lazy lifestyle for just a week!<br>\r\n\"I dunno man,\" Mark finally responded to Luke's question.  \"I just didn't sleep too good last night I guess.\"<br>\r\nLuke snorted disbelievingly.  Mark had still been snoring away after he had gotten back from his morning classes, and they ended at 11:30.  He hadn't forgotten that Mark had slept through his alarm and missed his first two classes that morning, but it wasn't worth bringing up.  His friend had made up his mind and nothing was going to get through his thick skull now.<br>\r\n\"Alright, have it your way you lazy ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer he lived his new lifestyle, the more Mark grew to love it.  It was great to come back from class and just sit around without having to worry about doing anything.  He gave his homework just enough attention to keep from failing his classes, and now that he wasn't spending hours in the gym every day he had quite a bit of time to just relax.  On some days, the only things that could motivate him to leave the couch were a hungry belly or the urgent need for a bathroom.  <br>\r\nLuke watched this transition with no small amount of surprise.  He could never have imagined Mark as such a lazy slacker, but there it was.  He had to admit that Mark seemed more laidback and happy than ever though.  As surprising as it was to him, Luke decided not to bug him about it if it made him happy.  </span></div></div>",

Mark had never been shy about touching, but Luke rubbing his belly was new, and rather pleasant, territory.  Luke, however, didn't seem as comfortable with it, and his hard left Mark's middle rather quickly.

Mark guessed that he was about fifteen pounds heavier than the last time he'd worn them and they were showing the change.  Instead of all going to his belly, the weight had distributed itself evenly across his body.  His gut was definitely protruding a bit further, but his whole abdomen had grown both thicker and softer.  The elastic band had to contend with his newly fleshy flanks as well as his fuller belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no way to talk to me when I'm doin' you a favor,\" he laughed, putting an arm around Luke's shoulders.  His shirt shifted upwards as he did so, revealing nice hint of hairy bulk pushing over the shorts just enough to turn the waistband down.  Mark felt the draft on his exposed skin, but he was alway proud of his body and so didn't fuss with the fabric.  \"Besides,\" he continued as he unwrapped a large Snickers bar he'd gotten from his pocket, \"I'm not lifting so, I'm really making this trip for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You act like I'm asking you to do something hard.  I think you can manage to haul your fat ass across the street to the campus gym.\"  Luke couldn't deny that he's been watching the way his friend's beefier buttocks shifted beneath the tight, shiny fabric.  He slapped Mark playfully on the rump and gave a little squeeze.  \"You're probably just gonna sit yourself right back down when we get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark didn't think anything of it as he felt Luke's hand lingering on his rear end, but then it was snatched back.  They were quiet for the rest of the walk.  Both of them took a predictable path.  Luke made his way to the weights and Mark ambled over to the vending machines.  After a few moments, Mark planted himself on the bench next to Luke with a can of soda and a fresh candy bar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was more comfortable with Mark there, but that did nothing for the intensity of his workout.  A few regulars recognized Mark and asked where he'd been.  It didn't take long for them to notice his new heft.  They ribbed him a bit, but he took it very well.  He even lifted up his shirt to allow a few curious acquaintances to give his gut a rub.  With all the conversation, Luke quickly lost interest in his exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending about an hour in the gym, Luke was ready to call it a day.  Despite having done very little in the way of actual strenuous exercise, he continued with the routine he was comfortable with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Back when they had both come to the gym together, Luke would go through the same amount of reps with weights that were at least fifteen pounds heavier.  He didn't even go through his normal cardio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Mark wasn't the kind of guy to turn down a hearty meal anymore.  He knew that Luke was used to going for a large meal after spending time in the gym.  He was probably just following his normal schedule.  Mark shrugged his shoulders and followed his friend out, throwing the wrapper from his candy bar into the trash as he passed. \"Lead the way then.  I ain't one to turn down a good meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, he was glad that Luke was ready to indulge a bit after slacking off during his workout.

It had started taking more than one trip to collect all the food he could eat.  The caf looked like it was currently holding about half of the school's male population.  None of the tables were empty, but he did spot a few friends to sit with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had met most of the guys in the various recreational sports groups that he'd been a part of at the beginning of the school year.  They'd competed in a couple intramural tournaments together, but several of them had decided to take a page out of Mark's book since then.  Instead of dealing with serious and overly-competitive opponents, they pulled out of the intramural program and now mainly got together to play casual games together.  Mark hadn't played in a while, but they still hung out regularly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a seat between the two guys he knew best, Mike and Sam.  Before his gain, Mark could only be immediately recognized from Mike by his dark hair.  Both of them had been very popular amongst the girls because of their good looks and confident personalities.  Mike had short, sandy brown hair and blue-gray eyes.  His cheeks and strong chin were always covered with stubble which he occasionally allowed to thicken and form a beard or goatee.  He was taller than Mark, standing at 6'3\", and had a pretty muscular frame.  Though his waist had never been narrow, it had begun to look a tiny bit thicker lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was the same height as Mark, but his stocky build made him look a bit shorter.  His hair and eyes were dark brown, and he was always sporting some style of facial hair.  His good looks got him a bit of attention from the female population, but he wasn't quite as outgoing as his friends when it came to new people.  He had a strong, sturdy frame, but there was also a noticeable layer of extra flesh lending his frame a hint of softness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man,\" Mike said, swatting Mark's ass as he passed.  \"We were just talkin' about you.

He picked Mike and Sam up at ten, starving.  He'd thought of just skipping dinner completely to make the most of his meal, but his grumbling stomach persuaded him into taking a lite dinner.  True, that lite dinner basically equaled a pretty large one from his previous life, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark hadn't been expecting much in the way of atmosphere when he'd heard big servings of food, but the place turned out to be pretty nice.  A bar ran along one wall and booths lined two other walls.  Several small tables sat in the center, and a pretty long one sat near the back wall.  They decided on the corner booth with a view of a majority of the televisions on the wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna love this place,\" Sam told him.  \"Half pound burgers for a buck.  And if you don't want that, there's pizza for half off.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, why not both!\"  Despite his earlier meal, Mark was practically drooling.  \"How's any man supposed to choose between pizza and burgers?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He played a little on weekends with some buds but dropped the workouts.  He focused on his studies, deciding that his last year at college was going to get him a good start on a well paying career. But why not see what some more weight felt like while he was at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his decision, he was reluctant to have his friends recognize that he was ganing weight intentionally.  He was careful to take only a bit more food than normal.  Since he was never the biggest eater in his circle of friends, noone noticed - or said anything.  Where he went all out was in the evening while studying.  Since he had a single room, it was easy for him to stock up on snacks.  He would sneak it into the dorm in the bags he used for his laundry so his friends wouldn't see him loaded with grocery bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his four hours of study every night, Mark would have a bag of potato chips with dip, a bag or two of cookies washed down with half and half and sometimes he would top of the evening with a jar of peanut butter.  Mark's grades got better and better with this new study plan and his softening body started to outgrow his wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Thanksgiving holiday approached, Mark was struggling to get into his 38 inch jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, I have let this go too far,\" Mark was thinking as he wondered how to explaing his growth to his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"38 is plenty big enough for now.  I will just cut back until these 38's fit easy.  It won't be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the week, Mark cut back a bit at meals and stopped his study time gorging.  It wasn't as easy as he thought because now he really needed that extra food at night and he couldn't concentrate on his studying.<br>\r\nMark decided that he would just force himself to adjust to the old regime.  It would help him to go home and break those habits too.  He was sure that he would be back on track by the time he returned from the Thanksgiving break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking up from the morning paper to see Mark entering the kitchen, his dad said, \"I told you you'd need to make a whole pie for each of us dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark glanced down at his body in a momentary bout of self consciousness.  All of the clothes which he had brought from school were being washed, leaving him to make due with what was left in his dresser.  Anything without an elastic waistband was instantly out of the question, and even the old pair of PJ pants were feeling rather tight around his rear.  The t shirt he'd found kept riding up over his belly, and he had to yank it down every few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I did put on some weight at school,\" he said sheepishly.  The shirt had begun displaying the bottom of his gut again, so he once again pulled it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad gave his stomach a solid thump.  \"Happens to every guy, don't worry about it.  You're lucky: those pounds suit you better than they do some guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother didn't say anything, but when he dropped into a seat at the table she placed a loaded plate in front of him.

The imminent arrival of several family members brought Mark's clothing crisis into clear focus.  By now his school clothes had grown too restrictive for the amount of food that was being prepared.  Instead of having to worry about a tight waistband all through dinner, he decided to go out and buy something a bit roomier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was surprised to find that he could still fit comfortably into 38 jeans of a different brand.  He wasn't gone long, but some family members had already arrived.  He'd hardly gotten out of his car before one of his aunts had him in a tight hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, you've grown since last time I saw you,\" she said happily.  Last time she'd seen him had been about a month before he'd left for school, and Mark knew that he hadn't gotten any taller since then.  He grinned as she continued to chatter as they entered the house.  Men were mostly restricted to the living room while the women cooked the meal, but his aunt Jane dragged him with her to visit with them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark made polite conversation for a little over half an hour, receiving an occasional sample to taste in return.  Still, after a while the kitchen began filling with more and more food and he ended up being shooed off to join the men of the family.  Thankfully, his uncles and cousins fussed much less than the women in the kitchen.  He shook hands with several of the men as he took a seat between his dad and his uncle John.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookin' good there Mark.  College sure seems to agree with you.\"  Uncle John nudged his side with an elbow, grinning.  \"Good to see they still no how to treat you kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure do.  Treating us to an all you can eat cafeteria and a bunch of fast food places on the side.  Just what a guy needs.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Because there were so many family members, Mark's mother had to improvise.  There were several dining tables filling the living room and she used the dining room to stage all the food.  It was an unbelievable spread.  Two huge turkeys,  a ham, a roast and then all the sides.  It was a family tradition to overeat.  All the men would brag about their ability to eat.  Mark had planned to eat light but he ended up sitting with his Uncle Rob and soon was caught up in a friendly challenge.  Before he knew it, his cousins were placing bets on who could eat the most and then started bringing the food.  Uncle Rob's appetite was a legend in the family and nobody had challenged him for years.  He would sit and eat for hours.  Mark had always envied Rob but never in his wildest dreams did he think he would ever try to keep up with him.  Today he was matching Rob plate by plate.<br>\r\n\"Watch yourself, kid,\"  Rob told Mark.  \"I'm just getting started.\"<br>\r\nMark was stuffed.  He waved away a new plate and panted from stuffing himself while Rob continued to eat.<br>\r\nMark was recovering when Rob finally signaled that he was full.  He rose from his chair and offered his hand to his uncle.<br>\r\n\"Good job, Unc. but watch out next year.  I'm going to give you a real competition.\"<br>\r\n\"You are a scrapper kid, but let me tell you.  I didn't get to be this good over night.  This performance today is the result of 20 years of hard training.\"<br>\r\nMark didn't listen.  He had himself a goal.  Next year, it would be Rob crying uncle.<br>\r\nAll the eating was making Mark drowsy and in a few minutes he drifted away from the family activities and up to his room.  Soon he was snoring.<br>\r\nGradually, the downstairs activity started to calm.  The table was cleaned; dishes washed; leftovers packed up; relatives left.  Finally Mark's parents went to bed.  It was midnight.<br>\r\nMark woke up.  What time is it?<br>\r\nHe rolled over and pulled the covers over his head trying to go back to sleep.  He rolled over. He tossed.  Finally he sat up.  He just wasn't sleepy.<br>\r\nHe pulled on his new jeans but they just weren't going to fasten.  Mark grinned remembering trying to out eat Uncle Rob.  He dropped the jeans.<br>\r\n\"Heck,\" he thought. \"Its the middle of the night.  Nobody is going to care that I'm in my boxers. \"<br>\r\nMark pulled down his t-shirt trying to cover his belly.  It rode right back up again.  Mark slapped it and heard a rumble in response.<br>\r\nHow could he be hungry after all he ate earlier?  Still it was the middle of the night.  Everyone was asleep and he was wide awake.  What should he do?<br>\r\nMark decided to</span></div></div>",

Right now, he didn't have a doubt that big Uncle Rob would check out the leftovers.  Mark wasn't sure how much capacity he had but he was ready to find out.<br>\r\nThe refrigerator was stuffed with leftovers.  There were pies and cakes on the kitchen counters and even the spare fridge in the garage was packed with food.  Mark couldn't believe that there was so much.  But it was all cold.

He cut slices of the succulent meat rimmed with soft fat.He piled a plate with the meat and then the sweet potatoes caught his eye.  Stuffing methodically, he finished half of the roast and the entire dish of potatoes.  <br>\r\n\"Pretty good,\" he thought.  \"Even cold.\"<br>\r\nHe wasn't hungry any more but, on the other hand, he wasn't full either.  How much more could he eat?  He grabbed a giant drumstick and a bowl of dressing.  He took some slices of ham and started on the scalloped potatoes.  Now Mark was feeling the pressure in his gut which was definitely bigger than when he started.  When the potatoes were gone, he decided to change into desert mode.  There were still whole pies along with half and quarters.  Mark grazed through the deserts- a wedge of apple pie, half of a pumpkin, a healthy slap of pecan, all loaded with whipped cream. He was panting from the effort and his belly was bigger than he ever believed it could be.  He was stuffed but it was such a pleasure to feel that full..  Steve cleaned up the kitchen and loaded the platters into the dishwasher so his mother wouldn't notice.  Then he waddled up to his bedroom.  It was nearly 4:30.  He had been eating for four hours.  He'd be as big as Uncle Rob in no time it he could eat like this all the time. He lay down on the bed and was soon fast asleep,<br>\r\n\"Mark.\"  Mark heard his mothers voice and checked the clock by his bed.  10:00.</span></div></div>",

What's the special occasion?\"<br>\r\n\"I know, but I've been cooking so much lately in order to prepare for Thanksgiving, and I've really started to like it.\"  She placed the plate on his bedside table and turned to leave.<br>\r\nMark thanked her as she left the room and grabbed the plate eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark didn't think about what his mom had said very much at the time, but it was hard not to notice the dramatic increase in food around the house.  With nothing else to do, Mark pulled on a pair of old sweats and headed down to the living room for a day in front of the television.  There wasn't a whole lot of excitement on the horizon, but he was happy for a chance to relax and enjoy being home.  Between struggling in all his classes and maintaining a social life at school, having time to sit around and do nothing was a welcome change.  <br>\r\nA less expected change came a while later in the form of his mother carrying a plate of brownies.  She handed him the plate and sat down next to him.  \"Mind sampling these for me?  I've never baked without a mix before and I figured you'd be a perfect taste tester.\"<br>\r\nHe wondered if his mom was making a comment about his new weight as he took a bite of one of the brownies.  He had made a pretty big pig of himself during Thanksgiving dinner after all.  There wasn't a whole lot he could do about it either way, he decided.  He was fatter than ever before, and definitely bigger than the last time they'd seen him.  There was no way they couldn't notice the change, but he was still worried about them freaking out.  Not worried enough to keep him from grabbing another brownie though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny concern about his mom freaking out over his weight gain was put to rest by the end of the rest of the day.  A couple hours after agreeing to being his mom's taste tester, his Mom called him into the kitchen for lunch.  Instead of the sandwich he was expecting, he was treated to a big bowl of spaghetti with homemade sauce and meatballs.  The ice cream he had for dessert wasn't homemade, but he somehow managed to eat the whole pint.<br>\r\nDinner was equally extravagant, and he and his dad both managed to put away three full servings before calling it quits, as well as sharing a plate cookies in front of the television later that evening.  After a day so full of food, Mark was sure that he wouldn't repeat last night's midnight stuffing, but it was just past twelve when the thought of a snack crossed his mind.</span></div></div>",

Having so much food sitting in his stomach was making him drowsy.  Clad only in his underwear, he gave his changing body a good once over in the mirror.  Not too long ago he would have seen a fit, handsome young man staring back at him.  Now, though he was still good looking, Mark had gotten used to seeing soft flab where his flat stomach used to be.  It stuck out in front of him, curving down smoothly and overlapping the top of his boxers slightly.  He thumped his hairy gut and climbed into bed wondering how big he'd be if his mom kept cooking like she had that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for him to fall asleep due to his food induced lethargy, but he was awake again after what felt like mere minutes.  His bedside clock told him that it was going on 1:00 AM.   After tossing and turning fruitlessly, Mark gave up on sleep and headed downstairs quietly.  He had meant to watch some TV until he got tired again, but a dim light in the kitchen caught his attention.  <br>\r\n\"Hey dad.  What are you doing up?\"  Mark's dad was outlined by the glow of the open fridge.  Apparently, Mark wasn't the only one having a hard time sleeping.  His dad was crouched in front of the fridge as he searched for leftovers to munch on.  He turned around at Mark's voice.<br>\r\n\"Look who's talking,\" his dad said as he turned away from the open fridge.

Come on big guy, you can do better than that!\"<br>\r\nHis dad looked over at him and grinned, presenting a tin of apple pie out to him alluringly.  It seemed like he was trying to get Mark going: to encourage him to really start eating.  He didn't really get what the man was up to, but whatever it was was working.  He'd come downstairs already hungry, but now he was looking for more than just a snack.  He was ready for a man sized meal.  \"Alright, alright.  But you made me hungry so now you gotta share.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, any meal's better when you got good company.\"<br>\r\nHe set the pie down on the counter and handed Mark a bowl of mashed potatoes, motioning towards the microwave.  It was slow going, the bowls were so big that only one would fit in the microwave at a time, but before too long everything was lukewarm.<br>\r\n''Bout time,\" his dad said, rubbing his bare belly in circles.  It gave a little rumble as he took in the spread.  \"I'm starving, how about you?\"<br>\r\nMark picked up a couple of bowls and brought them to the table, his own gut grumbling as he took in the sights and smells.  \"You said it yourself.  I'm a man after your own heart.  Or maybe your stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversation pretty much stopped once the two men started on their meal.  Looking up from the bowl of stuffing he was helping himself from, Mark couldn't help but be impressed by his dad.  He thought he'd become a pretty big eater over the last couple months, but the old man was in the zone and Mark was barely keeping up.  He didn't know why, but he wanted to hold his own and his belly was already feeling pretty stuffed.  It didn't look like his dad was having the same problem, even if his already large belly was looking rounder and fuller than ever.<br>\r\n\"Urrrp.  You lookin' for the turkey,\" he asked once he noticed Mark staring at him.  The man quirked his eyebrow and offered the big plate of turkey cuts he'd been hunched over.  For some reason, despite his already stuffed stomach, he reached over and forked a big hunk of meat.  \"Atta boy,\" he said, reaching over and patting Mark's taut gut.<br>\r\nIt was his turn to try to stifle a burp.  \"I think I'm filled up here.\"<br>\r\n\"Come on son,\" his dad said, continuing to rub the side of Mark's belly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Normally it didn't stick out nearly as much as it did right now.  Even after their actual Thanksgiving dinner it hadn't been protruding quite this much.  He dropped his hands to his belly and started to rub, trying to relieve the pressure a bit.  <br>\r\nLooking up from the pie he was eyeing, his dad watched as Mark massaged his gut.  The boy had really put it away tonight.  Nowhere near as much as he had, sure, but it was still impressive.  Still, he was pretty sure that Mark could manage to find a little bit more room.  Besides, he was pretty sure that even he wouldn't be able to finish off that pie on his own after everything else he'd already stuffed down.<br>\r\n\"There's gotta be room for a little more in here,\" he said, patting Mark's bare belly a few times.  \"And apple's your favorite.\"<br>\r\nHe gave a little burp and said, \"If you insist.  I need some milk first though.\"<br>\r\nGrunting a bit with the effort, Mark hefted himself up and went for the fridge, hiking his boxers up in the process.  After all he'd eaten even his underwear's forgiving waistband was starting to feel pretty tight.  The stuffed feeling in his gut told him that he had no business shoving any more food down his throat tonight, but, for some reason, he couldn't pass that pie up.  As uncomfortable as this fullness was, a part of him wanted to push himself just a little bit more.  He wanted to see just what he could do.  <br>\r\n\"Alright, cut me a wedge,\" he said, placing a glass in front of his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApple pie really was Mark's favorite, and after a taste he couldn't help but go back for more.  He was stuffed as it was and every forkful made his gut feel like it was about to burst, but somehow he managed to keep going.  After a while it actually started feeling good in a way.  The stretching in his gut was painful, but it he was also getting a kick out of pushing his limits.  Pushing the limits of his stomach was really satisfying.<br>\r\nBefore he knew it the pie was practically gone.  All that was left was a small wedge in the tin and a bunch of crumbs scattered on the ledge of his stuffed gut.  Feeling proud of himself for managing to cram down nearly half a pie on top of his already huge midnight snack, Mark sat back and let out a groan.  <br>\r\nLooking up from his own forkful of pie, his dad said, \"Look at that.  And you almost didn't have dessert.\"<br>\r\n\"Good thing you talked me into it.  That last piece is yours, but next time I'm not leaving you any.\"<br>\r\nHis dad crammed the last bit of pie into his mouth and down into his already overloaded belly.  Giving his bulging gut a couple strokes, he said, \"I'll hold you to that next time bud.\"</span></div></div>",

He tries to put on pants and a shirt but it rides up is gut and can t get his pants to button then he hears his mom, \"mark breakfast!\" Mark puts on some sweat pants without bothering for a shirt and walks but actually waddles down. He walks into a feast. 15 minutes later he along with his even bigger and hardier dad laid backed stuffed with his dad saying, 'uh that's the-burb! Stuff',. Mark later struggled getting up then put on a a wife beater which gives his belly a small peak. Mark goes into the bathroom and goes on the scale. He remembers at the start of summer he was 170 and when he got home was 220  and he had to look over his gut to see the needle on 230 pounds! Marks was like whatever.

Brad patting his gut says, ' well I don't know Will a girl want a whale like me?\".

The more he looked at it, the more it occurred to him that it wasn't as huge as he had made it out to be while panicking.  By now his gut stuck out far enough to protrude farther than his pecs.  His V-shaped torso was being covered by the flesh that was gathering at his sides; his waist was slowly approaching the width of his upper torso, thanks to this new lovehandles.  Still, Mark's base was big and muscular enough that a good deal of the extra weight was pretty well disguised.

It had never occurred to Mark that his new lifestyle could have other effects on him and, while the walk across campus wasn't difficult, he did notice that he was breathing more heavily afterwards.  <br>\r\nThose changes were nothing to what he experienced when he was eating.  Mark had always enjoyed the tastes of the junkfood that he'd stuffed himself with, but he had never paid much attention to the stuffing itself.  The sensation of his normally soft belly bloating and growing more firm as he glutted himself was completely new to Mark.  It reminded him of the pumped feeling his arms and chest had always gotten after a tough workout, but it didn't leave him sore and tired the next day.  Even rubbing his hands over his taut, full belly, something he had done unconsciously to relieve the pressure, was a completely different experience that often left a different part of his anatomy engorged and looking for attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was sitting in front of the TV, playing with the soft, hairy bellyfat as he waited for Luke to get back from class.  His stomach was rumbling loudly and he wasn't going to wait much longer before going to dinner.  It hadn't taken much thought for Mark to decide that there was no reason to diet.  Why should outgrowing a pair of pants make him give up his awesome new lifestyle.  He was happy, and all it took was a little bit of laziness and a lot of good food.

Not only did he remain oblivious to the fact that his beginner gut was anything but gone, even after he'd accomplished his goal of losing five pounds, but he also began slipping into the habit of grabbing a handful of candies or a snack cake throughout the day.

He had expected the food that he'd bought to last for at least a month, but it had scarcely taken two weeks for Luke to eat it all (with a little help from Mark).  His friend's appetite was only supposed to increase, but it would be next to impossible for Mark to keep up with only the money that his parents gave him.  He would need some sort of income. </span></div></div>",

As much as it went against his personal inclination to put off working as much as possible, he would have to get a job if he wanted to keep this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing aside the newly emptied Twinkie box, he searched the floor until he found a suitably clean t shirt.

He went past the one at the entrance to his building, figuring that the Student Center would have the best selection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe board has a bunch of info for jobs relating to academics, but Mark isn't exactly a model student.

It certainly wasn't his ideal way to spend his evening, but the guy seemed cool enough.  Besides, he might as well enjoy being paid without having to do anything for as long as he could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but rest assured, I sure am excited to get paid,\" he replied.  Normally he'd do his best to be a bit more subtle on his first day, but hours of burger flipping and the smell of grease had made it a bit difficult to keep his manners in mind.  Still, from what Mark had seen so far, Sam the manager seemed like a very laid back boss.  It was a big relief for Mark, who had never been one to walk on eggshells.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, maybe not so glamorous.  There are perks though.  You can eat anything you want during your shift, and when it comes to closing time we either throw the extras out or give 'em a good home.\"  He grinned and thumped his belly a few times.  \"I hate seeing these food-like products go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can see that, he thought as he looked his new boss over.  Mark certainly wasn't new to the idea of glory days, and the man had that certain look of someone who had peaked early, probably the big man on campus during high school.  He held himself like an ex-athlete, baseball unless Mark missed his guess, and was probably right at home on the Most Popular page of the yearbook.  He looks might have matured a bit over that time, but the scruffy look wasn't so bad on him.  He probably wasn't the star of the school reunion, but it certainly didn't seem to hurt his confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of closing time,\" he continued, \"I'm sure you've had just about enough fun for one day.\"</span></div></div>",

Unlike most of his coworkers who spent their shifts with their eyes on the clock, he didn't really mind being there.  It wasn't like he got some great satisfaction out of flipping burgers, but it was better than actually having to work for a paycheck.  There weren't many ways to make a name for yourself while working fast food, but his manager Sam took note of how well he was doing.  And for his own part, Mark always managed to keep himself occupied while he was at work.  With little else to hold his attention, he quickly fell into the habit of reaching for a handful of fries or one of the older burgers when he began to feel bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had watched many employees fall victim to unconscious snacking in his time working with fast food.  It, along with a general lack of ambition, was one of the main reasons that he hadn't moved on to a more lucrative job.  He liked watching as the guys around him starting filling up their uniforms.  True, he wasn't immune to the process himself, but his own thickening waistline was a small price to pay for his favorite passtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the weeks went by, Sam's newest employee proved to be an excellent example.  Mark had shown up on his very first day with his uniform already displaying his body nicely.  That had only been about three weeks ago, and Sam was already wondering when he would come by looking for the next size up.  There had been the hint of a beginner belly developing over Mark's formerly lean stomach, and his well-muscled upper body wasn't as defined as the other gym bodies on campus.  Now that hint of a belly had grown into a bona fide gut sticking out over his snug waistband and his chest looked a bit thicker beneath the fabric of his shirt.  Mark had noticed that his work clothes had grown a bit tight, but he had a long history of shrinking clothes in the wash so he never gave it any thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how're you feeling after your first few weeks here bud,\" Sam asked as they went through their usual half-assed cleaning after closing one night.  He had noticed after the first week that Mark no longer waited for an invitation before helping himself to a late night meal.  As he reached for his next double cheeseburger, his shirt untucked itself and rode up his belly a bit.  The older guy took in the sight of Mark's beefy belly for a few minutes before he absentmindedly brushed his shirt back down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam dragged his eyes away from the sliver of hairy flesh that was still peeking out from beneath the shirt's hem.  \"I'm getting paid and I get free food to boot.  Who could complain?  Dunno what's wrong with this damn uniform though.\"</span></div></div>",

Both of the guys had a small pile of discarded wrappers sitting in front of them, and it didn't look like either of them were done yet.  Mark didn't know if this was a normal thing around here, but he'd ended all of his shifts so far by pigging out with his hefty boss.  At first he had worried about getting fat, but all of his work outfits were still fitting him even after several weeks.  True, his everyday clothes had grown rather tight in that time, but he figured that it was probably from some laundry accident or something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been happy to take it on faith that he was as slim as ever for a while now, but the thought nagged at the back of his mind as he looked down at the small mountain of empty wrappers that sat on the table in front of him.  Not even his metabolism could be good enough to let him put away four or five burgers four times a week on top of his normal meals without gaining any weight at all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam had bitten into yet another burger before seeing his friend looking down at the burger he'd just unwrapped with a bit of a frown on his handsome face.  What had started out as pleasure from watching Mark start to plump up had turned into a downright crush over the weeks.  He still loved to watch Mark eat and to secretly admire his growing body, but Sam had also begun to really like just hanging out with him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up man,\" he asked.  He had never seen something stop Mark's eating so suddenly.  \"You ain't full already are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even close,\" Mark scoffed in spite of his concerns.  It was true too.  Last time he'd hit a groove like this he'd packed his gut full with ten burgers.  Not wanting to be underestimated, he took a big bite out of the burger he'd been staring at.  With his mouth full he mumbled, \"Not to sound like a chick or somethin', but d'you think I'm gettin' fat?\"</span></div></div>",

You're a total stud,\" Sam said as he got up and collected their garbage.  Mark's gut was already pretty full from what he had put away during his shift, and it was resting comfortably in his lap as he sat there.  It was about time to slip his buddy a shirt in the next size up.  This shirt rode up as he leaned forward to demolish the final burger, revealing the slightest hint of a thick, tan lovehandle.  On second thought, maybe he should hold off a bit on that bigger shirt.  The view was only getting better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a roaring belch, Mark finished off the last of the leftovers and leaned back in his seat.

He'd gotten the guy used to spending his shift grazing on whatever scraps he got his hands on as well as stuffing down several of the greasy, fattening, unhealthy burgers as they were closing down, but he didn't seem to put two and two together.  Sam had found that all he had to do to keep Mark complacent was stroke his ego.  The big guy was used to being confident and it didn't take much to keep him that way.<br>\r\n\"Man, we've never had so many repeat customers.  I swear people come back just to get another look at you.\"<br>\r\nMark would always smirk and puff out his chest when Sam paid him a compliment.  He'd liked his boss from the get-go, but who knew that he would be such a nice guy.  Mark knew he was a looker, but all the attention was flattering.  After spending so much time around other alpha males, he was more used to other guys being jealous or aggressive towards him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're workin' too hard buddy,\" Sam said, slapping him on the back and offering him a burger with his free hand.  \"You oughta keep your strength up.\"<br>\r\nHe accepted the burger without thinking.  He didn't really know why Sam had thought he was working hard.  The truth was that the late shift was usually a bore and Mark liked to just slack his way through it.  Still, it was nice to be appreciated, he thought as he took a big bite out of the greasy burger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the job going so well, Mark hadn't really gotten around to putting his plan into action.  Sure he always managed to bring a sack of burgers back with the intention of tempting Luke with them, but it never seemed to work out that way.  He usually gave in to their intoxicating smell as he made his way home and ended up eating one or two before he even got back.  Sometimes he'd even wake up from a deep sleep starving and craving one of the delicious calorie bombs.  <br>\r\nAside from that, he always seemed to come back from work completely beat.  Even when he had the time, Mark usually felt way too lethargic to drag himself to the gym for his normal workout.  Most of the time he didn't have the energy to do much more than sit and watch tv or play video games.  He'd even started having trouble waking up for class.  He didn't think much of it, assuming that he was worn out from work or coming down the a cold of something.</span></div></div>",

His belly was skin tight full, and he groaned in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door to his dorm, with his belly button exposed and Luke noticed. He knew his buddy was gaining weight and considered telling him about his growing gut, but he was a little jealous of his looks. Yes Mark was the more attractive of the two, and he hoped girls would find him more attractive than his fat friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Luke! I got you some burgers from the grill.\" Mark said. He pulled out a burger and handed him it. \"Thanks! Luke said and grabbed it from Mark's hands and began munching. Mark silently thought to himself, 'this is easier than I thought!' Luke hadn't lost the weight he gained, and he appeared oblivious to it. Although Mark gained double what Luke did, both were oblivious to their growing bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke finished his burger and got another from the bag. Although still full, Mark reached in to eat just one more.... or he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the bag was empty, with Luke and Mark eating 6 burgers together, Mark started scheming to fatten Luke. He had gotten a ton of money from his job, and could feed Luke leftovers along with food he would buy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark went to work the next, and again ate like no tomorrow. Mark got extras for Luke and again he couldnt help eating a few in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few weeks, ____ gained more weight than _____</span></div></div>",

The house became his heaven, even if it meant a little something on his waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy! Like what I did? I figured we've been holding back on eating and we should treat ourselves!\" Mark said. Luke pulled out a tub of ice cream from the freezer and got a spoon. The two ate away until Mark realized he had to go to work. He went to put on his uniform and he couldn't put it on. It was way too small. He tried to push the shirt over his pudgy chest but it wouldn't budge. Along with that the pant legs couldn't get passed his thick thighs.

Luke was so happy. But he knew he had to lie. <br>\r\n\"180.\" Luke said. \"You gained a few pounds but nothing to worry about, I couldn't even notice it.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh okay.\" Mark said. He stepped off the scale. \"You next.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke stepped on the scale and his belly wasn't as big as Mark's so he could read the number. \"200 pounds.\" Luke said to himself. He gained 30 pounds.<br>\r\n\"Wow man, I think you're too far in.\" Mark said, patting Luke's belly. \"It will take you at least a year to lose 30 pounds!\" Mark lied.

Luke and Mark walked, or Mark was beginning to waddle, out of the bathroom and Luke was cautious of his words. He wanted to go to the gym and begin to lose his 30 pounds gain, but didn't want Mark to join. He had to sneak off to the gym without Mark knowing.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go see if I can get a job, since you have one I probably should too!\" Luke lied. Mark didn't seem that interested, as he was already cutting a piece of cake for himself to eat. \"Yeah sure!\" Mark said waving him off, and Luke went to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 Weeks passed and Luke still remained determined to lose his weight. He hit the gym everday, went for night runs, and fixed his diet. However, Mark was still determined to fatten his friend up. Mark saw that Luke was beginning to lose weight, so Mark bought even more treats for Luke to snack on. Everywhere around the dorm room there was a snack in reach. While Mark upped his game, so did Luke. Luke resisted his temptations and would only snack on occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that didn't stop the food from being eaten. With even more food around, and one less mouth to fill it with, Mark had begun gaining even more weight. He ate double as much as he used to and his body surely showed it. He gained 15 pounds in just 3 weeks. Mark never seemed not to be eating. Whether he was at work, hiding burgers from Sam for his own belly, or sitting on the couch eating a full gallon of ice cream, Mark was getting big, and was still oblivious to his weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Sam was not. He saw his employee get bigger and bigger everyday. One day, while eating (of course) on the job, Mark's button flew off his uniform. Mark went to pick up the dropped button, and another flew off. Sam watched Mark's gigantic belly jiggle as he walked, and he never realized how big Mark was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Sam???\" Mark asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes sorry. What was that?\" Sam replied.<br>\r\n\"I need a new uniform, I don't know what keeps happening to mine.\" Mark answered.<br>\r\n\"Yea no problem!\" Sam said.

He got up at 1 pm, and only had underwear on. He noticed his underwear was extremely tight, so much so it was uncomfortable. His enormous hairy belly muffin topped his small underwear, and as he began to get up he heard a large tear. His underwear was split from the back, and Marks huge ass was bare. He brushed it off, believing the laundry had shrunken his clothes. He took off the torn underwear and threw them away, and decided to go out the day camo. He tried to put on some gray sweatpants, but they couldn't expand enough to fit his tree trunk thighs. He had to jump in order to get them on, causing the whole room to shake. he had trouble putting on a T-shirt, and had to keep pulling it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark went to go get his breakfast, but he had trouble leaving the door. His broad, fat, shoulders hit each end of the doorway, and had to squeeze through. Mark's loud and heavy footsteps showed to Luke that Mark was awake.

He realized he had broken the chair he was sitting on. \"Geez\" he thought to himself. \"I guess I gained more than I thought.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark got right back up to finish his behemoth's worth of a breakfast, and waddled into the bathroom. His fat, broad shoulders brushed by the door frame with a tight squeeze. Mark attempted to shift his body in the small bathroom, knocking down some things on the counter with the swaying of his belly. \"Shit\" he muttered to himself. Pulling out the scale, he knew he wouldn't be able to read it. He clicked the save feature, stepped on and off the scale. \"Shit\" he muttered to himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n272. Just over 100 lbs. Mark was so confused, sure he was eating a lot, a lot more actually, than normal, but how could he just notice this now? Mark again brushed by the tight doorframe to the kitchen and subconsciously started stuffing some donuts in his mouth. Three donuts in he came back to his senses - \"This is why I'm gaining so much weight! I need to lose this now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo more putting it off, he thought. He was going to the gym, and going now. He pulled out some of his old work out clothes and they looked dwarfed next to him. He tried to get his shirt on, but it did not get over his new moobs, let alone his gut. The shorts could not get past his thighs. No use. He needed an entirely new wardrobe. The only thing that came close to fitting him was his most recent uniform, and even that was tight on him. Even though he wasn't working, he pulled over his uniform and made his way to the mall for new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mall, Mark kept a close eye on the foodcourt. Although he tried to keep focus on getting in and out of the athletic wear store, the aromas of friend food and greasy pizza kept him in a daze. He brushed it aside, and quickly (as quickly as you can when you're pushing 300 lbs) made his way into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark didn't even know what size he was at this point. The tag on his uniform said Large, but no way that could be correct. He decided to start with XXL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointedly, he wasn't even close. The shirt came just below his big moobs and sat right on his belly, but not even close to covering his whole body. He skipped right to 4XL. Much better, it covered his whole gut, but still felt slightly tight. He contemplated going up one more size for comfort, and ultimately decided 5XL was fine. He bought a few of those. Next was pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreviously he had been a size 33, but Mark skipped right to 40 this time, and surprisingly wasn't too far off. Again, he rounded up to 42 for ultimate comfort, and made his way to checkout. His clothes looked gigantic, he barely could believe they fit him. His blubberous body was huge, with big moobs, big gut, and a huge butt to accompany it all. It would take a while to shed all the weight off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark made his way through checkout and was out the door, when the aromas of the food court again tempted Mark. Mark checked the time and it already was pretty late considering he woke up at 1pm. Why not have one last binge session for ages before going cold turkey. Mark waddled over to the foodcourt with determination that this would be his last large meal.</span></div></div>",

In fact, to Luke it seemed as if the extra flesh was, if anything, making his friend better looking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in Mark's appearance in its  entirety, Luke decided that he, at least, approved of the changes.  His body still retained its strong, muscular frame, but it was augmented by the new fat Mark had put on.

You got a pair of jeans I can borrow?\"  Mark came out of the bedroom, attempting to force his pants to fasten around his thickening waist.  Luke looked up from the TV, watching as he once again tried and failed to yank the fabric together.  He had recently started to enjoy watching his roommate deal with the side effects of his increasing girth without actually acknowledging that he'd been getting bigger.  For some reason, ever since he finally noticed Mark's new heft a couple weeks ago the hadn't been able to get it out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing his held breath loudly, Mark stopped sucking in his belly and dropped onto the couch.  For someone who refused to acknowledge it, he certainly liked rubbing his hairy gut a lot.  Luke watched his hand as it lazily circled the mound of fat that had taken up residence on the formerly flat stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I let myself get so fat,\" he whined.  Luke did his best to hold back a grin as Mark followed that statement by shoving a handful of chips from the bag he was offered into his mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was surprised to hear him call himself fat so bluntly, but he was also reasonably sure that he wouldn't do anything about it, if he even remembered the evening at all.  They were heading to a party pretty soon and Mark wasn't the poster boy for sobriety.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up, motioning for Mark to do the same.  When he did, Luke kneeled down in front of him and grabbed hold of the waist of his jeans.  Mark raised a questioning eyebrow as he looked down at him, but otherwise did nothing.  Gently. he pulled the jeans down until they rode lower on Mark's hips instead of over his belly.  Giving the flab above the button a little pinch, Luke told him to suck in.  Mark's gut did recede a little bit, but it wasn't gone.  He still managed to get the jeans buttoned though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Problem solved.

This was the part of the college experience that he was most familiar and comfortable with; the pounding music and the crowds of people made him feel more at home than a quiet library and a stack of boring textbooks ever could.  He and Luke grabbed some beers and surveyed their surroundings.  Mark gulped down his beer quickly before shouting, \"So what'cha feel like doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I wanna play some beer pong.  We could dominate,\" Luke shouted back.  He wasn't the best player, but he always managed to stay pretty consistent for a long time after Mark and most of the other serious contenders got too drunk to be any good.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you go ahead,\" he said as he made his way back to the keg.  A party ain't no fun if your cup's empty, he thought as he filled his cup again and headed towards a cluster of girls standing at the edge of the dancefloor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was having a great time so far.  He'd danced with what had to have been a dozen sexy girls and exchanged numbers with most of them.  He couldn't remember the name of a single one of them, but he wasn't worried.  He filled up his cup for what had to be the seventh or eighth time, he couldn't remember exactly, and chugged it down.  Wiping the sweat from his brow with his forearm, he decided to go find Luke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't made his way into the kitchen yet that evening, so Mark was surprised to see a few neglected boxes of pizza sitting on the counter.  His stomach gave off a sudden roar, so Mark grabbed a slice and hastily shoved it into his mouth before turning towards the beer pong table.  He was about to head that way when he realized that he had just eaten the best piece of pizza ever prepared.  Forgetting all about Luke, he grabbed another slice and took a big bite.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe counter had a great view of the beer pong table, and he saw that Luke had partnered up with one of his buddies from the baseball team and was sweeping the table.  Mark stood back and watched until the duo finally lost a game, unconsciously putting away slice after slice of pizza.  Looking down at the newly empty pizza box, mark stifled a belch and reached around his gut to unbutton his jeans before heading off to get another beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luke was still relatively sober and he was starting to think longingly of his bed, but he knew for a fact that Mark would be too drunk to make it home on his own.  <br>\r\nPeople were starting to head out by now, but the music was still going strong and there were quite a few partygoers still enjoying themselves throughout the house.  He was a little bit jealous of how much they were enjoying themselves.  Luke usually at least had an okay time at parties like these, but he never really knew what to do with himself when he was there and he usually found himself getting tired of them much more quickly than everyone else.  He'd gotten used to them ever since Mark had started dragging him along, but he had never grown to be as comfortable there.  Mark usually came back from a party with some good half-memories and a handful of new numbers.  Luke usually just came out feeling exhausted.  <br>\r\nIt took a few minutes, but eventually Luke found his buddy.  Unsurprisingly, Mark looked like he was having a good time, drunkenly swaying to the music with a girl grinding up against him.  Just his type, Luke thought as he took in the sight, skinny, drunk and with a nice rack.  Somehow, he didn't feel bad about butting in.  \"Dude Mark, the party's wrapping up.  Wanna head out?\"<br>\r\n\"Luke!  Whassup man?\" he shouted, clapping Luke on the shoulder.  Not waiting for an answer he wrapped an arm around the girl's waist and turned her around.  \"It's my bro Luke!  This is Katie.\"<br>\r\n\"Kristi!\" she corrected him with a drunken giggle, shoving against his chest playfully.<br>\r\n\"Right, sure.\"  He raised his cup to his lips only to find it empty.  \"Hey, I'm dry here!  Lesgo hit that keg,\" he said, wrapping an arm around Luke's shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Keg's tapped big guy,\" he replied, draping his own arm over Mark's broad shoulders.  Mark was leaning on him pretty heavily.  \"Let's head out bro.  Nice meeting you Katie.\"<br>\r\n\"It's Kristi,\" she insisted with a smile.  Turning to Mark, she pressed herself up against his chest and kissed him enthusiastically.  Finally coming up for air, she said, \"Call me Mark!\"<br>\r\n\"Totally.  Sure thing,\" he promised as Luke led him out of the house.  He started laughing once they made it outside.  \"I don't even have her number man!  Never gave me it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you walk big guy,\" Luke asked about a block later.  Mark had been leaning heavily on him since they left and the dude was heavy.  \"How much did you drink?\"<br>\r\nNot to much.  I can walk, I got this,\" he insisted.  It took a moment but he finally found his footing well enough to sway along beside Luke, only stumbling every couple of feet.  \"Dude, I'm drunk man,\" he said, cracking up and almost taking a spill before Luke grabbed him and draped his arm around his shoulder again.  <br>\r\n\"Gotcha dude.\"  Luke had gotten pretty good at handling his bud when he'd been drinking.  Mark hardly ever left a party sober.  <br>\r\n\"Dude, Wendys!\" Mark shouted, pointing unnecessarily at the Wendy's they'd passed on the way to the party.  \"Lets go in.  I'm starving!\"</span></div></div>",

He could not remember how he had gotten to his couch, but sure enough he was there.  Not to mention he was surrounded by quite a few fast food wrappers and his shirt and pants were off, boxers still in tact though. But all he knew was that he had an aching pain in his belly and that he had to eat something right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groggily got up and went to the kitchen and grabbed a pop tart, opened it and began eating it.  While eating, he continued to look through the pantry as he knew two measly pop tarts would not be enough.  Just then Mark remembered the 12 pack box of hot pockets in the freezer he had just bought a few days ago.  The ham and cheese and bread sounded perfect.  He opened the freezer to get one and noticed there was only one left.  While he felt lucky, he also couldn't believe how fast they had gone in less than 3 days.  He chalked it off to the idea that Luke had been eating them all.  Luke in fact had only eaten one.  He popped it in the microwave and began munching his second pop tart has he rubbed his slightly bloated, but rather soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then noticed a note on the fridge he must have overlooked in his hung overstate.  It was from Luke and said:  'Hey Mark, you were GONE last night. We helped you get home safely, but not after that awesome feast at Taco Cabana!  I couldn't finish all my tacos and had an early morning, so you're welcome to my leftovers.  Later man, Luke.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark opened the fridge to find four good sized beef tacos.  Having finished the second pop tart, he did not hesitate in opening up and devouring the tacos.  And extremely fast at that, not taking time to inhale.  He was half way done eating his fourth taco when the microwave dinged.  He had completely forgotten about his hot pocket!  Not really being close to being full, still hung over, and not wanting to let a good hot pocket go to waste, he finished the taco, the the hot pocket cool down as he walked it back over to the couch where he had awoken and sat down as he let it cool.  However he could not wait long enough, for he still burned his mouth.  This did not deter him however, and he continued to eat it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing it, he passed back out.  He didn't wake up again until:</span></div></div>",

They both head over and share the 4 pizzas, having some of each kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know whether it was the beer or something else but Mark was feeling so hungry and he ate his food like he couldn't eat it quick enough.

Just relax. You won\u2019t lose your abs from one meal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMark smirked and glanced under the table. Luke stomach seemed to have expanded slightly from all the food. His t-shirt was straining slightly as his bloated gut pushed outwards, flopping over the waistband of his very tight swim trunks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLooks like you have.\u201d Mark sneered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLuke glanced down at his stomach and shrugged. \u201cMaybe, but the food\u2019s worth it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMark sighed and decided to...</span></div></div>",

His arm was wrapped around him and resting on his potruding belly. He was at first embarassed, but then he realized that it felt good. He began to rub Mark's soft and flabby stomach. His sixpack was nearly undetectable. He felt the warm, fleshy glutton and grabbed his small developing love handle. Realizing that he was completely horny, he detracted quickly. He sat up and looked around the room. Tom and Ash were passed out. They had grown prominent, round bellies. He then looked down at his stomach. His sixpack was invisible.

Since the beginning of the summer, the four boys had feasted each breakfast, hit up three or for diners and fast food joints a day, and partied each night until they passed out. Their habbits were supported by their families generous gifts from graduating high school. Luke would still continue to cook big meals and would strongly encourage others to eat (Though, it was not difficult to persuade the group to eat). There was no longer any denial of weight gain. They all had big round flabby guts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark woke up around noon on Monday to the typical smell of Luke's cooking. He scratched his stomach and looked around the room with a faint idea of what happened last night. He saw that he was in the living room. Tom and Ash were still unconscious on the floor, shirtless. Their bellies hung out like ballons. Tom had dark Italian skin and dark, thick hair covering his entire body. What was once a muscular body with a little chunky belly had not become a chunky body with a little visible in his arms. Ash once had a fairly slender physique. He had short, spiky, black hair. He was the shortest of the four. He was also less muscular. He now was a rounded and plump guy with a bulging gut. Marc was a well-built, tall boy with a buzzed hair cut that was growing back in a little. He now was the fattest of them all giving him a huge appearance. His apetite never quit. Mark stood up and followed his nise straight to the kitchen where he found Luke, once again, cooking a feast fir for twenty kings. Luke was the thinnest of the all. His primary focus was to provide food and keep the others fat and happy. Luke had long blond hair and pale skin. He was now very chubby and all his close hung very tight to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Mark,\" Luke said cheerily to the groggy, hingover whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" Mark replied as he grabbed a plate and started piling it high with food, \"I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke grinned, \"Well eat up big boy. There's plenty here, and I made the bacon extra thick today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark had already dived in to devouring his food, not paying much attention to Luke. Tom and Ash soon joined in breakfast. They finnished off the food in no time at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark layed back and let out a roaring burb and scratched his bloated stomach, \"Well boys, This is the life. no worries, no stress, nothing but partying and eating. I guy could get use to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how much we're weighing these days?\" Ash asked grabbing a fold of fat from his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?\" retorted Tom, \"We're living the good life. We're fat, we're happy. This is great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" Mark said and Luke followed by putting more bacon on everyone's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's today's plan?\" Tom said with his mouth full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the beach,\" Mark suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good,\" everyone agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey go to the beach and..</span></div></div>",

Each one looked like they were wearing a speedo because the shorts clung so tight. Mark's swim trunks had ripped down the pack.<br>\r\n\"Ok, so I guess we should make it a priority to get new clothes,\" Mark proposed looking at his exposed butt in the mirror. The boys' clothes had been getting more and more dificult to wear. They had been mostly waering sweat suits, but even those had become too small to stretch over the girth of their midsections. <br>\r\nLuke had packed four big picnic baskets full of sandwiches, chips, sodas, pies, ribs, and many other good foods. They hopped in the car and headed to the beach. They had to sto by the store to get Mark a new pair of swim trunks. They unloaded their stuff and set up a spot on the sand. Their were many other kid fresh out of highschool partying at the beach. It had not occurred to them just how fat they had actually gotten until they got to the beach and saw the fit and slender teens at play. They all looked down at there newly aquired bulk and then looked at each other. A grin grew on each of one's face. They then stripped their shirts off, showing off their massive bellies. Laughing and joking like they always do when they're together, they each started eating the four baskets of food.<br>\r\n\"Dude!!\" a shout that came out of nowhere, directed to the four, \"Mark? Luke? Tom, Ash? Is it really you guys.\"<br>\r\nThe guy stood there holding a frizbee in a happy astonishment. He stood with a slim body with visible washboard abs. He had bleach blond hair and a dark tan. He spoke with a nearly comical surfer-dude accent.<br>\r\n\"Eric?\" Mark said recognizing his strong and emphasized surferness, \"How the hell have you been?\"<br>\r\n\"Just got back from Hawaii bra. The surfing was radical,\" Eric mentioned expecting the same enthusiasm from Mark who did not surf, as Eric knew very well. Eric was in the graduating class of the four boys. He would normally work out with Luke and Mark.<br>\r\n\"Very nice man,\" Mark said.<br>\r\n\"So what have you guys been up to?\" Eric said peering down at their unmistakable flab, \"I see you haven't been to the gym in a while.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeh,\" Luke said patting his gut with a nearly proud smile, \"We decided to take the summer off before college.\"<br>\r\nSomehat taken back by the nonchalant behavior the boys had about such a change in weight, Eric just laughed at the massive change the boys had had, \"Well I guess thats one way to go dudes.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you want to join us for lunch?\" Luke invited Eric.<br>\r\nEric gazed at the food. He was actually quite hungry and could go for a bute, \"Sure Bra! Pass me some of those ribs.\"<br>\r\nThe boys talk and catch up with Eric's life since graduation. Soon the picnic baskets were emptied of their contents. <br>\r\n\"You dudes certainly know how to pack a meal,\" Eric said patting his bloated stomach, \"That was riteous! No wonder you guys have packed on the punds.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, you wanna chill with us this summer?\" Luke asked  with a certain desire to fatten up the surfer, \"You can party with us.\"<br>\r\nEric took some timeto consider the proposition, \"Sounds cool and all bra, but I can't lose this body. I need it to surf dude. Surfing is my life bra.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok dude,\" Mark said, \"but if you ever feel like partying call is up man.\"<br>\r\n\"Ofcourse bra,\" Eric said, \"Well I'll catch you dudes later.\"<br>\r\nHe ran off.</span></div></div>",

Food,\" Mark said with a blunt dictation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke Laughed and started cooking dinner. The main thing they had stocked up on was Mexican food. In no time the table was filled with burritos, tacos, enchiladas, chips, dips, and other beefy and cheesy concoctions that Luke had form with a Mexican twist. Mark was salivating at the sight of the feast. It was the same amount normally prepared for the four boys. Except, now there were now only two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in,\" Luke grinned at the massive beast drooling over the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark quickly started to eat the many burritos and tacos. Luke ate some but prefered to just watch Mark make a pig out of himself. Luke would load up plates for Mark as he would near finish the plate he was on. Luke would bring him beer after beer. Mark was extremely content to just eat and eat without much thought of anything else. Mark had eventually eaten everything in sight and had collepsed to the ground. Luke quickly went over and started to rub the porker's beach ball belly that was stiffed to the brink of explosion. Mark let out a big belch followed by a bean-induced fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better,\" Mark said standing up with a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke laughed and brought him another beer. The two sat down on the couch and talked, consuming beer after beer. The guys had pretty much given up on wearing clothes in the apartment and normally just sat around in their boxers. The two were highly intoxicated. Their drunken conversation was interupted by loud farts and belches that would cause them to crack up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'm still freaking hungry,\" Mark said stroking his massive gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that there are some donuts in the pantry,\" Luke said staggering to the pantry. He grabbed a  pack of cream-filled donuts that were covered in a sugary glaze and chocolate frosting. Luke kneeled beside Mark and started to feed him donuts. mark just went along with it. Luke would rub Mark's massive belly and grabbed a big handful of soft fat from Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're sexy,\" Luke said stupidly with a big smile, \"You're so fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're drunk,\" Mark said grinning at Luke as another donut was stuffed into his face,\"You trying to fatten me up or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Luke said as he started to paly with Mark's love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke,\" Mark said and was interupted by a swelling belch, \"...feed me a sandwich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke beamed with dleight and went to make Mark a sandwich.</span></div></div>",

However, Ash and Tom had noticed some changes in Luke and Mark after Monday night. Luke now ate less and less and Mark ate more and more. During breakfasts, Tom and Ash had noticed Luke piling more food on to Mark's plate, giving looks of affection towards the rounded hog. Strange behavior between the two showed distinctly when they were drunk. Luke would feed Mark clumsily and would all but force-feed him into a coma. Tom and Ash did not think of it too much. Luke himself didn't fully understand why he did this. All he knew was that the sight of Mark made him really horny. Luke was slightly embarrassed by this because, though he was never the ladies man, he always thought he was straight and never had been attracted to a man, until Mark. Mark didn't think of it too much either. He just ate blissfully and loved every minute of it.<br>\r\nSaturday afternoon came and the four guys went to Burger King. Tom ordered three double whoppers, Ash ordered 8 double cheeseburgers, Luke ordered a triple whopper, and Mark ordered 3 quad stackers, a double whopper, and 3 double cheeseburgers. The pimply-faced cashier looked at the massive man with shock and awe. Mark by this point looked like mountain. His belly had grown to nearly round out his body, he had grown 3 other chins and had almost lost his neck. His face looked even bigger with a full beard grown. Mark did not look like a 19 year old any more. Mark loved it when people would gawk at his size.<br>\r\n\"Ok boys,\" Tom said with his usual commanding voice and sparkle in his eye when he had something new for us to do, \"Tonight we're going out. The hottest club in town is having an all-you-can-eat buffet.\"<br>\r\nMark swallowed his second burger and looked up with manic salivation at the mere mention of all-you-can-eat.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm..\" Ash said with a thoughtful expression and then spread a grin across his face, \"Think they'll have enough food?\"<br>\r\nAsh slap Mark's belly and patted it. Mark let out a grunt of pain.</span></div></div>",

There was a slight pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see we're not the only ones who decided to enjoy the summer,\" Luke said eying Eric's newly formed flab with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dude,\" Eric replied with a guilty grin, \"Thought I'd take your advice and chillax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric went over to order his food and came back with platter barely rivaling Mark's massive meal. The other four guys stared with admiration and big grins appeared on their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dude, If you really want to let it all hang loose, come with us to the club tonight,\" Tom invited, patting Eric's belly, \"They're having an all you can eat buffet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more dude,\" Eric said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure between the five of us, that buffet will have a difficult time keeping up with us,\" Mark said smiling with a big mustard stain on his mouth and shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys arrived at the club. People were dancing wildly. The club was filled with thin young, drunk girls and fat, drunk guys. Tom and Ash started to sling back drinks and flirt with the girls on the dance floor. Mark, Luke, and Eric headed straight to the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark piled plateful after plateful. Eric saw this and followed suit. An unspoken competition formed between the two. The two ate plate after plate. Fifth course, eighth course, twelfth course. Luke stared with amazement at the ability of Eric to be any competition for Mark. Ash and Mark stopped flirting and went over to watch the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My money's on the Big Guy,\" Luke said with a cheer for Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. The underdog seems to be able to pack it away nicely,\" Ash said with admiration towards Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral plates later, Eric fell with a belch of defeat and fell to his knees with sixteen plates of food in his stomach. Mark continued to devour his food and gave way with an even bigger belch of triumph. Luke cheered and patted Mark's bloated belly. He grabbed a beer and poured it down Mark's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go big fella,\" Luke said still rubbing Mark's stomach and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys continued on through the night gorging themselves even further and drinking up a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mark,\" Luke said with a drunken and goofy laugh, \"Wanna dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark let out a belch and rubbed his gut, \"Are you kidding? I'm so stuffed..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Mark,\" Luke said with laughing longing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok fine,\" Mark said walking out on to the dance floor while downing another beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two danced among the other people. Mark was awkwardly and drunkenly shaking. His flabby belly was jiggling like jello. Luke stared at him with such longing. He was so turned on by his dancing. Luke then started to get closer to Mark. He danced grinding up the round giant. He put his arms around Mark. Mark went along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys left the club. Tom got several numbers and Ash made out with a chick in the broom closet. Eric woke later from his food coma. The other guys, particularly Mark, was used to these comas and laughingly helped Eric to consciousness. </span></div></div>",

There was a lot of running and conditioning drills.  The coach was impressed with Mark work ethnic but can also tell that Mark has been eating over the summer and slowed down.  After the practice the coach spoke to him.  He explained to Mark that he may be too slow because of his weight gain but if he gained more weight and worked out a little bit he can assign him as a line backer instead of cutting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the locker room afterward, many of the players noticed Mark's new belly and tan.  Matt Kemp, the defenses captain gave Mark's stomach a good pat and asked, \"What are you weighing now, buddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I am not sure.  I just thought to chillax during the summer and now it may get me kicked off the team\" Mark exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I am sure some weight can help you from falling so easily?\" questioned Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach said if I don't gain enough muscle and weight to become a linebacker I can't stay.  How am I going to do that if we're conditioning like crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt encouraged, \"We can't lose you.  We'll help you with this.  Get dressed you have to work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt, Mark and some other guys went to the weight room.  For a good hour and a half they pumped it up.  When finished Mark was exhausted and just wanted to go sleep in his dorm but Matt told him they needed to feed him.  Before this they were going to measure Mark's weight.  Mark metion to everyone at the begging of summer he weighed 155 and not with his little paunch he weighs 178.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow are they going to go about the feedathon?</span></div></div>",

As they left the gym, Matt finally managed to wear him down and get him to agree to heading to the cafeteria.  Matt sat with him as the other guys headed off to collect the food for him.  \"You gotta eat or that whole workout's gonna be wasted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey returned with several trays loaded with food for Mark to eat.  They'd decided against things such as salads in favor of everything from pizza and burgers to pastries and sweets.  The more substantial things would fill him up and the desserts would provide a nice break from the heavier foods.  The guys placed plate after plate in front of him while Matt sat next to him, encouraging him to keep going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his own through nearly four plates of food before beginning to slow down.  Mark liked to eat, but there was a point that he didn't want to cross.  His gut was stuffed and aching almost more than his sore muscles.  He started on the fifth tray, but was certain that he'd pop before finishing even half of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Matt reached over and placed his big hand on Mark's bloated stomach.

Once again, Matt and his buddies from the team forced his already aching muscles through a strenuous routine that left him certain that he would never be able to lift his arms again.  After stiffly getting dressed, which was one of the most difficult things he could remember doing lately, he found himself being escorted up to the cafeteria.  The guys pushed him into a seat where he sat dazed while they filled up a tray for him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle fatigue in his arms made it a bit difficult to control his fork, but Mark found that he was at least becoming more skillful at this part of his bulking program.  This time, he managed to put away four overflowing plates away without any real trouble before his sore arms got the better of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you're doing great today but you gotta push yourself.  I know you can put away more.\"  Matt signaled for one of the other guys to go back and load up another couple plates for Mark to stuff down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I can lift a fork anymore, even if I did want more food,\" Mark mumbled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning their surroundings quickly, Matt grinned slyly.  \"We're pretty much the only ones around now.  I ain't gonna let you leave this table until you pack in at least one more plate, so you can either do it yourself or let me do it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew from experience that Matt's threat of detainment was completely serious, but Mark wasn't sure how he felt about the idea of being fed by another guy, especially in such a public place.  Still, he wanted nothing more than to get back to his bed and sleep through his next two classes, and the only way he was going to be able to do that was by continuing to stuff his face.  There didn't seem to be any better option and the caf was empty anyway.  Plus, Mark didn't even have the energy to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" he said as his next plate arrived in front of him.  Mark leaned way back in his chair and put his big hands on his already bloated belly.  With a final shrug, he opened his mouth and allowed Matt to feed him his next heaping helping.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even with all the muscle soreness and painfully large meals, Mark manged to stick to the program for several weeks.  The first game of the season would take place at the end of the week, and it was about time for him to show coach the fruits of his labor.  He had practically become a permanent feature at both the caf and the weight room over the last month and he was pretty confident that Coach would be pleased with the results.  Between working his butt off in the weight room everyday and stuffing himself so full of food that he thought he was going to pop, Mark was certain he was well on his way to completing the transition from defensive back to star linebacker.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark arrived at the gym early for his check in with Coach in order to get his own good look at what a month of hard work had gotten him.  After grabbing a locker, he stripped down to his gym shorts and ambled over to a mirror.  His muscles had regained some of the bulk that seemed to have disappeared during the lazy days of summer, but they had yet to reach the level of definition that he had at his peak.  His chest and arms were thicker and more firm than they had been at the beginning of the month, and his shoulders were looking a bit wider than they had even in his most athletic days.  A few halfhearted flexes convinced him that he was carrying more muscle than he'd ever had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow his chest Mark's belly curved out in front of him, hiding the waistband of his shorts from him.  He put a hand on his firm, hairy gut and rubbed it over the round expanse.  It was obvious that he had gained at least as much fat as he had muscle, but instead of being flabby, his gut was round and firm, but with a hint of softness where his hand caressed it.  His shorts were forced lower around his hips by its weight, but instead of rolling over the waist it simply stuck out above it.  Obviously he hadn't really gotten fatter; he was just carrying a bit more bulk than before.  Feeling confident, he pulled on a sleeveless t shirt, failing to notice how tightly it clung to his rounded middle, and made his way out into the gym where Coach was waiting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you managed to pack on some weight there bud.  Hopefully most of it's muscle.  Get on the scale,\" he said, clapping a hand on Mark's shoulder.  The scale creaked as he stepped onto the platform, and Coach began pushing the balances.  After a few short moments he let out a quiet whistle.  Hiding a smirk, Mark looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A month ago you were weighin' in at around 185 pounds, but now you're tippin' the scale at 210.  Kid, you put on 25 pounds in less than a month,\" Coach said in surprise.  Mark hadn't thought he could have put on more than maybe 15 pounds, if that.  \"Well, that extra mass ain't gonna do any good if you can't move it.  Lets see how you handle ten minutes on a treadmill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't occurred to Mark or Matt and the rest of the team to have him do any cardio, but he was feeling pretty good with how this check in was going so far.  He hadn't so much as jogged at all in the last month or so, but how bad could it be after all the working out he'd been doing.  He watched Coach turn the machine on to it's middle setting and began to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured that the test had to be at least half over by the time he began to have some trouble.  Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Mark looked at the machine's readout and almost lost his rhythm right there.  According to the treadmill, he had only been running for a little over two minutes.  Coach was watching him closely, not letting any of his thoughts show on his face.  Mark took in a big gasp of breath and tried to find his stride.  By the time five minutes finally rolled around, Mark was panting for breath as he did his best to keep running.  Finally, Coach told him to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confidence he'd been feeling at the beginning of the meeting had all but disappeared.  As he stood on the treadmill with his chest heaving and sweat running off his brow, Mark began to feel a little bit worried.  There was no way he'd have been able to make it the ten whole minutes at that pace.  He lifted the hem of his shirt to wipe his forehead, exposing his big, hairy, glistening belly for a moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was finally about to catch his breath when Coach began to speak.</span></div></div>",

Besides, hadn't he already proven that he didn't have any discipline once today? No use trying to lie to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trudged into the caf and made a beeline for the greasy burgers he'd grown particularly fond of, returning the greetings he got along the way halfheartedly.

He always made sure to compliment them when they'd made something he really enjoyed, and in return many of them had begun to provide him with special treats.  Now he never had to worry about them running out of desserts before he'd filled up on them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark loaded his tray with three double cheeseburgers without even thinking about it.  He was used to eating big at the insistence of his former teammates, and it didn't occur to him to reconsider those habits.  Automatically, he made his way to the next line to complete his first course with a few slices of pizza.  After finding a seat close enough to the food lines, Mark began on his first burger.  He demolished it and the other two burgers in four or five bites each, cheeks bulging as he chewed contentedly.  Too focused on eating to continue to beat himself up, he let out a burp before gulping down half a glass of milk and starting on his pizza.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to easily put away four more similarly loaded trays before beginning to feel pretty full.  Putting a big hand on his full, round belly, he began to consider his next move.  He could go now that he wasn't hungry anymore, but he hadn't reached his limit yet.  Mark knew that he could still pack away a decent amount of food before he maxed out.  Letting loose another loud belch, Mark scratched his full belly and decided to...</span></div></div>",

By now he'd had his fill of burgers and pizza for the time being.  Luckily, he caught sight of a big new pan of mac &amp; cheese being brought out by one of the cooks.  He grabbed a new plate and made a beeline to the noodles, already feeling better than he had all day.  Nothing like some good ol' comfort food, he thought as he filled his plate to overflowing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out that Mark needed a lot of comforting.  Despite reaching what he had thought was his limit after two plates full of mac &amp; cheese, he found himself struggling up from his seat and slowly getting back in line time and again.  All together, it took four overloaded plates to fill up every inch of space in Mark's gut, leaving him sprawled out in his chair without any thought in his head aside from the fullness of his belly and the dazed, sleepy feeling that had turned the simple acts of massaging his gut and keeping his eyes open into hard work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow he managed to keep from falling asleep right there, but he remained in his seat for about twenty minutes; until it felt like he could move without popping open.  His uncomfortably full gut grumbled audibly as he slowly made his way back to his room, steadying the bloated bulge with one hand the whole time.  Falling onto his bed with a grateful groan, Mark pressed his fingers into his stuffed belly and worked up a few big burps before the discomfort finally left him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was falling asleep, Mark thought about the day's events.  He still felt like crap when he thought about being cut from the team, but it was hard for him to be too upset about anything with the full, satisfied feeling that his bloated belly was giving him right now.  He'd eaten more than he ever had before, even with help from his teammates.  Mark finally gave into the drowsiness he'd been feeling since finishing his meal, impressed with what he'd accomplished at the lunch table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe accidentally slept through his afternoon classes, but for some reason Mark couldn't bring himself to care.  Scratching his stomach with one hand and rubbing a bleary eye with the other, he realized that his stomach was no longer stuffed and bloated.  The clock said that it was about 6:30 in the evening.  He had taken a good five hour nap and it was passed dinner time.  It wasn't actual hunger, but Mark always had dinner at six and he couldn't think of any reason to change that now.  Picking up his phone, Mark decides to...</span></div></div>",

Opening up his phone, he began to go down the list to his friend's number.  Ever since he'd started taking most of his meals with his bulking buddies, it had become rare for the two roommates to share a meal together.  He wasn't about to tell Luke that's he'd been cut from the team yet, but it would be nice to spend a meal with his best bud.  As he made his way to Luke's number, Mark paused momentarily on the number to his favorite pizza place.  For some reason the thought of having a big, greasy sausage and mushroom  pizza all to himself was sounding really great to him right now.  Without really thinking about it, he dialed and placed his order for a couple of large pepperoni pizzas.  He didn't remember until after he'd hung up that Luke wouldn't eat mushrooms.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him and the hunger that had very quickly overtaken him, the pizza place had an ideal location about four blocks away from campus.  Mark had barely had time to pull some sweats on before his phone went off to tell him that the order was there.  It wasn't strange to see Mark going about his business without a shirt, but the last time he'd done it his belly had been slim and muscular.  Not even thinking about the round, firm gut riding over his waistband or the new love handles growing at his sides and making the waist of his sweats tighter than he remembered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting the person holding his pizza boxes, he was suddenly once again painfully aware of his new physique.  The girl with his food was the kind that would look right at home next to the hunk he had been at the start of the summer.  Already regretting not taking the time to pull on a t shirt, Mark did his best to suck in his new gut.  Looking down, it was clear that his efforts had no effect, so he took a steadying breath and walked towards her doing his best to imitate his usual confident swagger. </span></div></div>",

He had begun hitting the weights himself, though his schedule really only allowed him to get there in the late afternoon.  Mark was usually gone with his football buddies by that time, so they hadn't really seen much of each other over the last month.  Still, he had seen how Mark's big chest and shoulders were filling out his workout gear more than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday he expected his roommate to be out dining with his football buds like usual, so he was a bit surprised to see him spread across the futon with an empty pizza box on his lap.  Actually, that sight would be a little bit surprising in general considering Mark's spontaneously renewed interest in hitting the weights.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like Mark was a bit too interested in the television to notice his roommate's return.  As he got closer, Luke was surprised to see that, in addition to the empty box sitting on Mark's lap, there was another pizza box with about a quarter of the pie missing from it.  The box on his lap was covering his midsection, but Luke could tell that there was no flat stomach beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you dude,\" Luke asked his oblivious roommate.  \"Havin' a private party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCocking an eyebrow, Mark looked over his shoulder at his roommate.  He was sucking on his finger to remove the sauce. He shoved the empty box to the floor and got to his feet.  It was the first time in a while that Luke had gotten a look at his friend without a shirt on, and he wasn't expecting what he saw.  Mark had never had a six pack, but even if his stomach had never been defined, it had always been mostly flat.  Obviously, Mark's shoulders, chest and arms weren't the only things that had gotten bigger as a result of his bulking program.  There was no way the big round belly bulging over his friend's sweats could be nothing but bloating, even if he had stuffed down almost one and a half pizzas on his own.</span></div></div>",

He still thought of himself in much the same way, but now it seemed as though the roles had been reversed.  Mark knew what his roommate was talking about but he quirked and eyebrow and did his best to look confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno what you mean,\" he said, flexing his bigger arms and chest halfheartedly.  \"Check it out, I'm bigger than ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luke only laughed harder.  Even with his thick pecs and beefy arms, Mark's bulging belly stole the show as it stretched over his sweats.  Instead of being soft and sagging over his waistband like Luke's belly used to, his gut swelled out like a round, firm ball attached just below his hairy, muscled chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think anyone's gonna argue with you there, big boy,\" he said, slapping Mark's belly.  He expected it to jiggle or quiver, at least a little, but instead it just gave a thump kind of like a watermelon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever dude, I got the mass and now I just gotta get cut.\"  Mark tried to suck in his gut, but it stuck out as much as ever.

They were bigger than he expected, bigger than the Dunkin' Donuts variety and dripping with glaze or icing.  He'd promised himself that he would stick to one or two pastries, but just looking at all the options was making his mouth water.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, can I help you or are you just browsing?\"  Tearing his eyes away from the delicious display, he looked at the speaker and let out a silent sigh.

Even if he wasn't feeling exactly like his old studly self, Mark still knew how to talk to the hot chicks without much preparation.

Why don't  you tell me what's good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'd just have to tell you that everything's good.  I made these after all.  Is that what I'm gonna get you,\" she asked with a playful grin.  Not waiting for his answer, she grabbed a big paper bag and started filling it with one of each type of donut.  She smiled, taking a closer look at Mark while she filled the bag.  He was a hot guy.  Big arms, strong chest, handsome face with a sexy coating of stubble and a nice firm mound of hairy belly fat peeking out from beneath the hem of his too-short shirt.  \"A big strong guy like you can take care of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grin didn't waver at her words, but she caught a glimpse of one of his hands trying to pull down his shirt and hide his gut.

Mark didn't mind this at all since it meant that he'd be able to get to the food sooner.  His stomach had begun to complain as he was leaving the room, and by now it was growling audibly.  The guy working the grill gave him a bit of a sneer when he scooped up three of the burgers that he had prepared in anticipation of the imminent lunchtime rush.

There were still ten minutes until Luke's class even got out and Mark was hungry NOW. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Luke finally got there, he had put away all three of the burgers and was plowing through a plate of spaghetti and meatballs.  Luke sat across from him with two burgers and a salad.  Mark felt like a total pig when he looked at his formerly fatter friend's comparatively small and healthy meal, but it didn't stop him from continuing to stuff himself.  Luke talked about this and that while Mark offered a nod or the occasional grunt, paying more attention to his meal than the conversation.  Finally, Luke couldn't help himself anymore and said, \"Dude, you're really puttin' it away today!  Talk about carbo-loading.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally pausing in his eating, Mark looked up at his friend, feeling embarrassed and a little pathetic.  He had just lost his place on the football team for being too fat and slow yesterday and here he was eating a meal big enough for a family of four.  No wonder coach didn't want you any more!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn't really feel like talking about how much of a loser he was, but he couldn't stop himself.  Before he could help it, he was spilling his guts about everything that had happened between him and the coach yesterday morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he said he couldn't use me how I am right now and left,\" Mark concluded, eyes dropping to his half empty plate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?\" Luke asked incredulously.  He fully expected his friend to start messing with him, but Mark was surprised by how anxious he was feeling.  He already felt bad enough about the whole situation without Luke kicking him when he's down.  \"I don't know what that guy was talking about.  Look at you!  Look at those arms and that chest!  You're bigger than ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bigger than ever,\" Mark echoed as he slapped his big belly.  \"And fatter and slower and more out of shape too.  Coach was right to let me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, come on.  How many pro players do you think have slim, 30 inch waists?  It's not a problem....\"</span></div></div>",

This is my third plate and I'm not even full!\"  It was true too.  Even if he wasn't really hungry anymore, he still couldn't help thinking about going back for another serving.  He had grown accustomed to eating until he was stuffed to the brim.  Mark appreciated his friend's effort to comfort him, as unexpected as it was, but he knew he wouldn't be able to drop any weight if his new appetite kept up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got me to lose weight not too long ago.  I'll help you out this time.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what got me here in the first place.  If it weren't for Matt and the rest of the team, I'd only have like 10 pounds to lose instead of however much I have now, he thought.  Besides, Luke had always been his fat friend.  He would still be fat if it weren't for Mark.  There was no way he'd be able to help Mark shape up.</span></div></div>",

Not feeling up for much, Mark made his way back to his room and stared at the television for a while, doing his best not to think about his current situation.  In the back of his mind he knew that sitting around doing nothing wouldn't do anything except maybe make him even fatter, but what else could he do?  He'd never make it through a workout in the gym without being seen by one of his athlete buddies, and he'd only end up looking like an out of shape loser if he went for a run around campus.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Mark spent most of his free time that week either in front of the TV or at the caf.  Unable to find the will to face his health nut friends or the will to do much of anything productive, he barely managed to make it to classes.  Even when he did, he spent a majority of the time staring off into space.  </span></div></div>",

You party too hard last night?\"<br>\r\n\"Somethin' like that,\" Mark shrugged his broad shoulders and looked away.  He usually didn't lie to Luke, but it was better than admitting how much of a pig he'd been last night.  If he noticed Mark's evasiveness, Luke didn't say anything about it.  <br>\r\n\"So who was there?\"<br>\r\n\"What\"<br>\r\n\"Who was there with you last night,\" he asked again innocently.  \"It's not like you ate those pizzas by yourself, but it couldn't have been too many people.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah.  No way I could do that,\" Mark lied.  \"Just me and a few bros from the team, y'know?\"<br>\r\n\"Must've had something to celebrate huh,\" Luke exclaimed happily.  Grinning, he clapped Mark on the back in congratulation.  \"How's it feel to be back on the team?\"<br>\r\nFor a minute, Mark thought about lying again.  So far, no one else knew that he'd been kicked to the curb and he could try to pretend that nothing had changed.  Still, Luke would probably notice that something was up when Mark didn't show up to games or practice.  <br>\r\n\"Well, I couldn't tell ya,\" he finally said.  Luke just stared at him in confusion, so he continued.  \"Coach didn't want me back.\"<br>\r\nThe look of embarrassment on Luke's face was enough to make him crack a smile.  \"Wha- but...\" he stammered before collecting himself.  \"Damn, sorry dude!  I thought it was a sure thing.  What happened?\"<br>\r\nThere was a limit to Mark's honesty.  \"I dunno man.  Does it really matter?\"<br>\r\nLuke was quiet for a minute.  He knew Mark was more upset about all this than he was letting on.  Mark had been a football player since they'd started high school, and he'd loved every minute of it.  He'd always been a total jock.  Perhaps even worse, he wasn't used to things not going his way.  Things usually went his way, and this was a hell of a way to break that trend.  Of course, he also knew Mark well enough to know how embarrassed he must be over being dropped.  What good would it do to pester him about it?<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it'll be fine,\" he said encouragingly.  \"Just look at the bright side man.  When's the last time you were able to just kick back and enjoy yourself for a change?\"<br>\r\n\"What d'you mean?\"<br>\r\nHe draped his arm over Mark's shoulders and led him towards the cafeteria.  \"I mean when you could just chill out and be lazy.  You've been going to the gym for hours five days a week since high school!  Take a break and enjoy yourself for a while man!  Cut back on the gym time for a while and be a normal person for once.  You've got tons of time to get in shape later if you want.\"<br>\r\nThe thought had crossed Mark's mind before, but he'd never really entertained it.  He'd loved taking a break from his old diet restrictions over the last month (which was why he was in this situation now), but even then he always knew he'd be hitting the weights again the next day.  Maybe it would be nice to kick back for a while.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
