Working at The Ontario Regency was a fantastic job don't get him wrong but Danny had other obligations as well . Danny excepted that his high school and even College life was over but he still wanted to work out and coach at the local high school . He coached year round any sport they needed a coach and so Danny was average size but his knees were starting to hurt more and more , after working 8 hour days then coaching you can understand why he would be tired at the end of his day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past 3 years Danny's boss Ray or Raymond as he likes to be called has been secretly trying to down size Danny's department and layoff Danny . Raymond hired the last 5 women at the front desk and all of them were very attractive and he slowly found ways to get rid of the male coworkers . The sad part is he made Danny write them up and then through a process fire them . It was so bad that recently the Hotel was criticized with its hiring practices and Raymond had to hire someone brand new to come on board to please not only Danny and the staff but the community at large . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What the hell ? I can't even sleep now ?\" Danny said rolling over to check his phone . A text message from Raymond was in the notice box . \" Hey Manager of the desk up front , I have great news I just hired a brand new agent and I think you will like her \" is the Text From Raymond. Wait her ? Is all Danny could think of . What was Raymond thinking hiring another girl ? After the last one went to the press and basically accused Raymond of sexual harassment , why would he risk his job and the hotels reputation by doing this ? Oh yeah I have to train her and if she doesn't work out for one reason or another he has grounds to lay me off . Is the only thing Danny could think of as he got out of bed and began to press his pants and shirt. With the business dress could of slakes , Button down dress shirt and ties for the guys Danny had to wake up early every morning to make sure he was neat and presentable . \"She will be shadowing you today and learning everything from you , Don't screw up\" -From Raymond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Danny got dressed he went on a jog , just around the block and when he got back home he quickly showered and shaved. His life was very routine  , he did the same thing every day . As he drove into work he noticed a Red mustang parked in the employee parking lot . Most wouldn't notice this and think of it as being out of the ordinary but Danny did , it was part of his job and what made him good at his job. This must be Leslie's car , nice he thought . I beat she is a cute little blonde with a big rack and dumber then shit . I wonder how long it will take Raymond today to get her to check her out and hit on her ? He thought as he went into the hotel , through the employee entrance . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny walked the halls to the front desk area he was bracing himself when .........</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Danny came around one of the columns at the front desk he saw a young Hispanic girl at the front <br>\r\ndesk . Mel was normally there already and Robert the Night Auditor was no where to be found . Leslie was just standing there her hair pulled back into a pony tail , her button down shirt was freshly ironed and tucked into her work slacks . \"Wow who is this ?\" is all Danny could think of when he saw her , she wasn't anything like what he thought she would look like . There was a line in the dress code of if you have belt loops wear a belt and so far Danny was the only member on staff that followed it . But Leslie had a leather belt on and looked up and smiled at Danny . <br>\r\n\" Good morning , you must be Danny right ?\" Leslie said .<br>\r\n\" Good morning , that's a nice greeting , always grin and greet with in 8 feet \" Danny said as he came around the front desk and put his bag down . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Have you ever worked in a hotel before ?\" Danny asked as he logged in and checked the Hotels Point of sale computer . <br>\r\n\" Actually I haven't but I have worked in a bank before , a car dealer ship and a coffee shop . Along with retail sales\" Leslie said as she stood at attention to the side of Danny and clasped her hands behind her back . Danny didn't get a good look at her chest before , but he did now . She had at least a C cup size breasts and she wasn't skinny but she wasn't heavy either . She could almost pass as native american . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat must be why Raymond hired her , she fits a certain demographic and is actually very smart . She was on her feet about allot of the operations of the hotel . As the Morning progressed Danny Continued to show Leslie how to work at the desk , answer the phone and count the Money . As the house keepers came in Danny realized Leslie even knew how to speak Spanish to them . A skill Danny didn't know but really he should of known by now . \" Wow you speak really well \" Danny Complemented Leslie as soon as one of the house keepers left . \" Thanks they all think you speak Spanish and I have a feeling you don't speak a word of it do you ? \" Liz said in a very playful way . \" Not one word hahahahaha But don't tell them \" As Danny continued to show Liz the ropes of the job . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny had to leave work at 3 p.m. to go and coach Tennis on Tuesdays , he would return later on for the evening break coverage and late shift if need be. \" It was fun working with you today \" Danny said as he left Leslie with Mel to continue there shift . </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Normally Danny doesn't think about work or his co-workers once he leaves the job . But today of all days he couldn't stop thinking about Leslie , what was it about her ? It wasn't her looks , or her job abilities . It was something else , little did Danny know he was in the middle of a serving set when WACK!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Coach you alright ?\" One of the Tennis Players said as a ball hit Danny in the chest , it wasn't bad but he was not in the right mind set for the moment . \" Yeah I'm good .....just going to sit this one out ......I have a lot on my mind \" . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny sat down for the first time ever during one of his practice's he had his gym bag next to him on the bench and his personal belongings in side . Out of sign out of mind he thought , But he couldn't resist calling the hotel to see how things were going . As Danny reached into his bag and pulled out his phone he noticed it was flashing green and red . Green was for Text messages , Red for missed calls . This was not good he opened it and saw more then ten text messages from Mel at the hotel , and all of them where call me back ASAP or HELP massive help needed Call me back . As Danny listened to the first missed call and message . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey Danny its Mel from the Hotel , so far Leslie is ok she seems really odd . Anyways why did you let her check in 5 rooms with no method of payment ? Call me \"<br>\r\nNext message <br>\r\n\" Hey Danny its me again , I really need you to call me back guest are complaining on the second floor near 208 where Leslie checked in that guest with no method of payment . Can you please call me when your done with practice ?\"<br>\r\nNext Message<br>\r\n\" Danny where the f*&amp;K are you ? This is insane get her quick\"<br>\r\nMel sounded crazy in that last message , Danny looked up and told his guys to come in . \" Hey guys I have an emergency at work I have to go deal with Practice is over now but you guys can continue to play if you want \" . The team was understanding as Danny began running to his car . He kept listening to all the messages and knew he had to get back . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny Called the hotel once he was in the parking lot . \" Good Afternoon , thank you for calling the Ontario Regency this is Leslie how can I help you \" Leslie answered as calm as a cucumber . \" Hey Leslie , its me Danny . how is everything there ?\" Danny asked surprised she was so calm , maybe Mel was over exaggerating ? But Mel is normally very level headed , what ever was going on was cause for concern . \" Hey not much .....its pretty chill \" Leslie said as Danny began to drive down the road . \" O.K. nothing out of the ordinary ? Nothing on the second floor ?\" surprised at how Leslie was so calm . \" oh yeah that ,well I checked in a guy who didn't have a credit card or any cash on him \" . Ok hold the phone Danny was pissed how could someone so smart do something so dumb . \" Leslie I know your new but I told you we need ID and CREDIT CARD for all guests!!!!\" Danny was so upset , he thought to himself this is why Raymond hired her right her right now his career was going to be over . \" I am on my way tell Mel I am on my way please\" . \" O.K. I will tell her .\" Leslie said still calm and composed .  </span></div></div>",

Danny thought as he pulled around to the back employee parking lot . Raymond's car was there , 'Great I beat he is waiting with my termination paper work ready' Danny thought as he parked next to Raymond's Lexus . Danny thought on the way out he could accidentally have his keys in hand and they might just scratch the hell out of his car maybe .But Danny tied his tie as he walked quickly into the hotel , all the house keepers where in the break room and none of them seemed upset or stressed out . Danny looked out the windows on the lobby level as he walked to the front desk , no one was out at the pool . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny Rounded the column of the front desk , there was Leslie and Raymond laughing . Great they Laugh as they prepare to terminate me . \" There he is the man of the hour \" Raymond said excited , of course he is excited this whole thing was a set up . Danny thought as he smiled and made his way to the other terminal . \" Leslie has just been telling me how well you trained her and how amazing the whole staff is . \" Raymond said as he walked over to Danny , Danny stopped smiling \" Ah yeah that's our hotel for you haha \" Danny said in a sarcastic way , Raymond didn't pick up on it . He leaned in and said \"  your doing great this one will put us back on top with the public view keep it up . \" Raymond said as he went into the back area into his office , Leslie came over to Danny . \" Is everything ok ? \" Leslie asked , Danny not wanting to show how frustrated he was looked at the in house guests . There was someone checked into Room 208 and there was a credit card . There was nothing written in the log book and nothing coming over the walkie talkies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ummmm what happened with the Guest and the credit card ? \" Danny Asked Leslie , who was standing just to the side of him . \" Oh ....ummmm yeah that its all handled now . \" Leslie said looking at the screen as if she hadn't seen it before in her life . \" The big cluster of stuff Mel called and Text me about ? Where is Mel anyways ?\" Danny asked looking around . \" Oh she had to leave early she wrote a note down in your office .\" Leslie said , it was the oddest thing ever . Mel would work even if she had her leg chopped off . Danny excused himself and went back to his office , on his desk was a note from Mel saying \" Sorry Danny I had to leave early , Don't worry everything is taken care of now . Thanks Mel. \" </span></div></div>",

Danny smiled at Leslie and continued to his terminal , Did I just imagine the whole thing ? Danny Checked his phone he had all the text messages and all the messages , he checked 208 and the credit card on file was authorized by Mel . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day went on Leslie was getting back into Danny's good graces and Danny felt like he should apologize for his actions earlier . As Raymond locked his office door and started heading to the front desk . \" Shhhh I will tell you everything once he leaves .\" Leslie said in a very discreet manor , and quickly stood next to you as if she was shadowing you the whole day . \" Good night everyone\" Raymond said as he left he gave Danny a nod , and headed out . \" O.K. what was that all about ? \" Danny Asked looking Leslie square in her big brown eyes . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You don't understand right when you left this guy came in and was threatening me and saying he would kill me if he didn't get a key to room 208 \" as she continued Danny could see how scared she was . \" Why didn't you call the cops or me for that matter ? What about our security guard Samantha?\" . Danny was starting to get the picture and he was ready to call Raymond and let him know . \" I Called Samantha and she went up there , she said it looked like one of Raymond's friends. I got a call shortly after Mel came in .....it was from room 208 Sarah said don't tell anyone but she was now a hostage and that Raymond was behind this .\" Leslie almost cried , as she collapsed to the ground her hands over her face . Danny knelled down to comfort her , and as he began to say \" I am so Sorr-\" \" Mel went to get help but I don't know where she went and Every time I call the police it clicks and hangs up \" Leslie said grabbing Danny's arm. Danny could feel Leslie feeling up his arm , she was distracted by his arm . \" Alright have you called the room ?\" Danny asked thinking of a safe course of action, Leslie said she tried but it clicks to a message . Danny realizes he is the only one who can go up there and assess the situation . </span></div></div>",

Also He thought what he would say once he got to the room , which wasn't going to be anything normal . He tried calling the police from his cell phone , It would ring once then transfer to Raymond's voice mail . \" How is he doing this ? \" Danny said out loud as he was putting his phone in his pocket . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny got off on the second floor and made his way to Room 208 , his heart was pounding . He was glad he had more deodorant on today then normal , since he was going to train Leslie and he wanted to set a good example . As he stood outside Room 208 , he listened in to see if he could hear anything . Nothing ? Not a sound . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny Knocked on the door , \" Front Desk\" . Danny Said identifying himself , and waiting a few seconds . He knocked again \" Front Desk\", he said again . No Answer , he knew there wasn't anyone else who had come or gone from the room since Leslie checked in the guest he checked the key lock with his key reader . As bad as he thought it would be he knew he would have to enter the hotel room and find out what was going on . \" Front desk coming in \" He said as he slipped his master key in the slot and opened the door . Right away he could smell something odd in the air , it wasn't smoke or anything like that it actually smelled really nice .Like strawberry star bursts , the curtains were pulled shut and it was hard to see in the room . As Danny Looked at the king size bed he began to feel dizzy , just as he was about to say something to what looked like a person on the bed . Danny Collapsed Face first on the ground he was out cold ......</span></div></div>",

As he slowly began to focus in on what he was looking at he felt a comfortable pillow supporting his head . He could feel a nice soft mattress supporting his body . As Danny continues to wake up his arms feel like they weigh a thousand pounds , same with his legs . <br>\r\n'What the hell is going on ? I can't move my body , why does my chest feel so heavy' Danny thought to himself still trying to move . Only able to move his eyes around Danny tried to move his head and couldn't. Danny normally wore glass and realized he wasn't wearing them and he could see fine . As the room began to focus he could hear voices to his left coming from the rest room . At first they were very muzzled , and as his hearing slowly returned he could her a woman's voice \" Shhhhh , ( Whispering tone) I think he's awake shhhh\" . Not able to recognize the voice , Danny tried to speak \" ......Argh*.....\" Danny couldn't speak he could barly open his move which felt very strange to him as well , he had the taste of coconut and some odd metal taste . Trying again to raise his head he was unable to , he was able to raise it just a little bit off the bed . Enough for the woman who he had heard to come out from the restroom area . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey don't try to move so quickly .....your not ready yet .\" Danny could understand the voice and it sounded familiar to him , but it also sounded like he had water in his ears. As the woman came closer he felt helpless and she sat on the bed near his legs , He still couldn't even look down to see her . The woman lifted Danny's left leg up and pulled his pant leg down over the top of his shoe , the feeling in his leg was as if his leg was asleep . \" You couldn't at least tighty ( Muffled Word ) up first ?\" The woman asked the person in the other rooms . \" ( Muffled response ) \" The other person sounded familiar as well but it was such an odd experience that Danny couldn't tell if it was a man or woman . <br>\r\n\" ( In a lower tone) This will take some getting used to \" The woman who was creeping slowly up to Danny's head said .

Danny Let out a sigh of pleasure , as she continued to squeeze them for a second time . \" There we go now your feeling it .\" the woman said as she continued down Danny's new body . She placed both hands on Danny's stomach and continued outward , this time her grip was much firmer . the tingling in Danny's body was slowly going away but he still couldn't move . Danny could feel that the woman just got to Danny's waste was trailed inward on Liz's Belt . When She got to Liz's belt Buckle she lifted it up and slide one hand in , Danny knew she was going to go low and as that area of the body had no feeling what so ever he could only imagine was he was going to feel next ......</span></div></div>",

Just enough to get them nice and wet , then she slide Danny's fingers into his new pussy . She slowly started to slide them in and out and then pick up the pace . Danny felt the sensation across his entire body , from his head down his spine it was bliss . \" Ohhh mmmmm....\" Danny let out feeling his first Orgasm as a woman .Just as he was cumming , \" Oh yes Leslie take it all in \" The woman said . Danny heard the name and felt an odd sensation in his head , as if he just ate ice cream and had a brain freeze .<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\" That's right Leslie enjoy yourself some more \" the voice came from the bathroom area  , Danny could recognize it as a man's voice . \" I just want to rip her clothes off already Hehehehahaha\" the woman said as she continued to make Danny's new body cum. She pulled Danny's hand out and stuck his fingers in her mouth , she pulled them out clean . As she released Danny's hand in the air it quickly fell back to the bed . \" She still needs to get used to her body ?\" The woman asked the man as he came out of the bathroom , area and was toweling off his head . \" Don't be so hasty babe , it takes sometime for everything to settle \" The man said walking over to the right side of Danny . He sat down at the foot of the bed on that side , as the woman crept up into view . Danny recognized her immediately ,  \" Yo...abbbHggg*\" Danny was trying to express himself but what came out was gibberish again . \" Shhh your still getting used to your new body , Leslie don't go trying to rush it otherwise you will never get it right\" Said the woman who was now cradling Danny's face as she went in for a kiss . The woman closed her eyes , for some odd reason so did Danny as the woman slipped her tongue in Danny's mouth . She began to massage Danny's tongue with her own for a few moments . She pulled out and said \" Wow shes a great kisser , I am going to have to get used to that \" the woman said . Danny could only lick his now feminine lips , and realize he just made out with Samantha the security guard who was missing . Samantha had short blonde hair blue eyes , well built and had a security uniform on . It was a well known fact that Samantha was a lesbian , and that she was normally viewed very mescalin . but she didn't come off that way right now .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny licked his lips and was felling his new body a little bit more , when he felt the man suddenly grab hold of his hands and wank him up right . Danny's head wasn't able to sit up right and the Samantha helped her look up as Danny felt the huge drop in his stomach as he saw who the man was . Danny gasped in horror as the man smiled sinisterly back at him , and said \" that's right Leslie I am Danny now \" . \" Ahhhhh.....how \" is all Danny was able to say as Samantha Slowly started to work her way to the side of Danny and help her sit up . \" Good your starting to get the hang of it now Leslie \" The new Danny said to the old Danny in Leslie's body to which Danny thought 'why do they keep emphasizing calling me that name ? '<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's right arm stocked the back of Danny as The new Danny grabbed on to Leslie's legs and straightened them out . \" Its like your our little puppet right now \" he said still smiling and totally enjoying every moment of this experience. \" You said I could have some time with her before you began?\" Samantha said to the new Danny , who was just about ready to work his way up Leslie's legs . \" Are you really going to hold me to that ? Look at her its to good to be true .\" He said excited that Danny was now trapped in Leslie's body . \" Remember if you want Leslie to remain this way we have to do this right!\" Samantha said laying Danny back down in his new body , for which he was starting to get the feeling back in his legs and could almost wiggle his new toes . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Fine you get to play with her for one hour , when I get back she is all mine \" . The new Danny said as he started to to leave the room . Danny realized that his former body wasn't wearing his uniform , in fact he was wearing something Danny would never wear .  The new Danny left the hotel room wearing tight black jeans , and a tight black tank top tucked into his jeans and a black leather belt . Also looking at his former body leave the room Danny could swear his former body looked buffer . 'Oh crap did I just check myself out ?' Danny thought as Samantha lifted her up again . Relax this next part will put your mind at easy , and you will feel much better once we are done . \" H.......ow.....How....d....id.....How...Did...y...ou......How did you do this to me....\" Danny said now hearing his voice as Leslie . Samantha hugged Leslie Close , Danny didn't have any ability to resist . \" It will help you understand once we begin the next part of the ritual \" Samantha said as she placed Leslie back down on the bed and had her fold her fingers together .

The strange wisp swirled about eerily, dancing through the air like a plastic bag in the wind. Without warning, the wisp suddenly darted at Danny, expanding as it reached her. The incorporeal essence wrapped itself around her waist and legs, trying to envelop her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny felt a sensation of bliss all over her new body, it felt so good .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny's face suddenly blushed as the mist crept across her thighs and crotch. Her expression almost seemed as if it felt slightly pleasurable, that is until the essence slithered through the toothed interlocks of her pants zipper. Danny's expression quickly became that of being violated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha began to lower the Cloth onto Danny's face as the mist began to course through every opening in Danny's Bolus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was nothing more then a wisp,Danny could feel every crease and indention in his pants as if something really had been touching his new legs. The more alarming aspect of the situation was everywhere the mist went, it left a strange green glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n To both Samantha and Danny's surprise  the unnatural glow on her  suddenly disappeared from around Danny as unexpectedly as it came, fading away from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha Lowered the Cloth Right in front of Danny's face , when there was a knock on the Door to the Room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**KNOCK KNOCK**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"House keeping\" , From just outside the door to the room one of the housekeepers was already using her key card and entering . Samantha was alarm and caught off guard , \" He.....Hey this room is occupied \" Samantha said pulling away and slipping the cloth in her pocket . 'Oh crap she wasn't supposed to come around her' Is what Samantha was thinking as she raced over to the door to stop the house keeper from coming in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? I am doing a room .....inspection?\"  Samantha headed off the house keeper , thinking about what she could do to keep her from coming in . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe room seems fine\u2026 wait, what do you mean, whats going on here?\" Her tone quickly changed from that of nervousness to terrified , as she could see over Samantha's shoulder and see Danny in Leslie's body laying on the bed . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I mean, well... you should...you should come and see\" Samantha said grabbing the house keeper by her arms , she was a younger housekeeper , wearing black pants and a tan pull over polo shirt . She had a short pixie cut , and was very terrified . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook I  just clean rooms! Please don't do this.\u201d She pleaded with Samantha who quickly grabbed the cloth and cupped it in her hand , as she placed it on the housekeepers face . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Danny a slight glare. As she closed her eyes over taken by the cloth on her face , Danny's eyes opened wide he knew he couldn't let that happen to him as Samantha gentle laid the housekeeper down on the ground . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear if you just jinxed me\u2026\u201d Samantha said to the housekeeper as she was out cold , the door was still slightly open Danny Knew he had to do something . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry! We really need to get somebody who knows about this stuff and have them check you out.But for now you will remember everything about your life up until you came to work today\u201d Samantha said to the housekeeper still out of it . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha took a few steps away from her as the house keeper started to shake and look like she was convulsing. She then laid at peace , Samantha grabbed her by the shoulders and dragged started to drag her into the bathroom . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny Knew this was the make or break time , as he started to try to roll his now female body left to right . He shimmered his right shoulder up then his left , he could feel his body still not moving all that well . He continued to roll side to side . ' No Matter which side I get to I have to get out of here quickly' he thought as he continued to shake side to side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust keep sleeping peacefully t, I\u2019ll check you out later on .\u201dSamantha was saying to the house keeper as Danny could hear her in the bathroom , Samantha just dragged her onto the tile . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 Ok.\u201dDanny sighed, hoping to god he had enough momentum to roll off the bed as he rolled hard to his left Danny was then flung onto the floor between the two beds . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of his peripheral vision he could see that Samantha wasn't near by , and could still hear her in the bathroom. ' Alright .....made it to the floor now I have to ......move my arms.' Danny thought to himself face down in Leslie's Body . He was able to slide his left arm up his side , and as he was about to push himself up . 'HOLY CRAP!!!! 'Danny just felt his new chest with his arm as he was trying to get up . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling alone was enough to freak out most people , but Danny knew it would be worse if Samantha came back and he was at her mercy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha finished placing the house keeper in the tube , She closed the door and locked it from the inside . 'I hope she doesn't wake up any time soon ' Samantha re tucking in her shirt and checking over all her security items on her belt . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs She came around the corner she noticed .........</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samantha had just finished checking her hand cuffs in the back of her belt holster , when she looked up hoping to see Danny in Leslie's body still on the bed . But she wasn't there Samantha had just seconds before ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHACK!!!!!!*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny had been standing right on the other side of the wall and had the lamp in hand , still not fully able to move the body he was in . But it was enough to connect the lamp to Samantha's head .Samantha was sent to the ground and Danny almost right next to her . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny was able to pull himself back up and sat there for a moment with his back against the wall . He looked down at the two mounds now on his chest . \" Wow my center of gravity is much higher now ....\" , as he caught his breath he gave his breast a nice firm squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rush of pleasure was quick and instant sending the rush down his spine to his now lower half. ' I would like to keep this up but I have to get out of this body before Samantha wakes up '. This thought, followed by a thoroughly discontented sigh was the only reaction he could manage as his entire lower half jerked forward abruptly. The movement being neither steady nor graceful; rather seemed as if someone grabbed the sides of his waste and pulled him up . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sudden momentum shift almost sent Danny head first back down to the ground but he was able to step forward with his leg to catch himself . In that brief moment when confusion and uncertainty began to settle in, Danny Started to try to walk in his new body . He stepped forward with his right leg now and once again almost sent himself down to the ground again . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny lurched forward toward the dresser in front of him, he put his hands out to brace himself as he came into contact with the dense wood. His hands were also now very different in feeling and in function , he was really going to have to be careful . His normal big grasp of a mite he called a hand was gone , instead he had to get used to the feminine but still strong hands that Leslie spent a good deal of time grooming . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny pushed himself off the counter , he slowly started to turn towards the door . This time however, the center of the unwanted movement was settled slightly lower resulting in more of a pelvic thrust of sorts. He was still getting used to walking and realized his new body wasn't full awake yet , as the feeling that his legs were asleep crept back into his mind . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny Stayed close to the walls as he made his way out into the hall of the hotel , No one was around . As he began to leave the room it was like the green mist had him again , or someone tripped him . Danny was able to catch the door frame as Leslie's body was still not fully functional for him . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling now in a clumsy manner, he skidded slightly on his high heeled boots as he came to a sudden stop, ending up just in front of the elevator door . Unsure were to go Danny sighed as he finally made it to the elevator , he held his hands out and to his sides just in case he had to keep his balance again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously peering downward, Danny couldn't think of anywhere to go right away other than he had to get off this floor before Samantha woke up . Danny Pressed the button to call the elevator to the ground floor , he could hear it coming and it settled . The door Opened ......Luck would have it no one was in the elevator as Danny began his awkward stumble into the elevator . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door opened to the ground floor Danny Took a deep breath and closed his eyes , this has to be the worst nightmare ever . He thought as he began to walk out of the elevator once again he felt as if he could walk normally in his new body , until he took those first two steps . Still getting used to his chest pulling him forward and his rear end pulling him back , Danny made his way to the lobby area . Looking around , looking for his former body and anyone else . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was surprisingly slow , there was no one in the lobby . As Danny made his way to the employee's only door , he opened the door and closed it right behind him . Amidst his thoughts, as he just closed the door . His attention was promptly re-focused upon the most unpleasant sensation. his thong unexpectedly, actually began to move and slither  up the crack of her butt. The front creased around his crotch as it gripped tighter, allowing the side straps to climb another half centimeter up his waist and sink in, creating small bulges of voluptuous skin between them and the pants. Danny realized someone was right behind him pulling at his Thong......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Danny Places both his index fingers in Leslie's belt loops and pulls up her pants , the tight material is reluctant to be pulled up on Leslie's butt . Danny Re-tucked in her shirt as Raymond sat down at his desk and entered his password . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" This will just take a moment , if you would like I have sparkling Voss water over there . Please help yourself\" Raymond polity said gesturing to his counter top . Danny had been in this office before , and knew that Raymond paid for most of the amenities out of his own pocket . Why Not ? \" Don't mind if I do , I have always wanted to try it\" Danny said as he walked over to the counter top and pored a glass for himself . Danny held up the glass bottle to see if Raymond wanted any , he shock his head no . As Danny walked over to the leather couch in the middle of the office , he took a sip of water and sat down . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" So why am I looking for Danny ?\" Raymond asked as Danny could hear the camera system fast forwarding through hours of tape . Still not sure how to phrase it Danny took a big sip , and held it in his mouth . He gulped it down and began to say \" Well......ummmm\" \"WAIT!! ....Here he is .\" Raymond said as he quickly entered the command keys to slow down the video play back . With his left hand he turned the monitor so Danny could see , sure enough he could see his former body walking down the hall way of the second floor . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What the hell is he doing up there ? \" Raymond asked , looking back at the monitor  . Danny and Raymond couldn't believe what they saw next Samantha came out of Room 208 and had with her the lamp . But more importantly she and Danny's former body locked lips as he made sure she wasn't injured . \" Wow ...you see the lesbian thing only goes so far ..... This is good , I have him kissing a co-worker , out of uniform , on clock , and abusing his power.\" Raymond said with a sinister grin . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n' Oh Crap Raymond is going to be able to terminate ...me once I get my body back ' Danny thought . \"Wa-wait ....you don't un-understand , th-thats .....th-thats ...not......\" Danny could finish his sentence , his arms were getting heavy . Leslie's grip in his right hand released the glass and all Danny could do was watch as it hit the floor and splashed on the ground . Danny's eye lids were also getting heavy , along with his head . Danny Laid back in Raymond's couch . The erge to go to sleep was so over whelming . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny Could Barely stay awake , but he noticed that Raymond did glance over to see her dozing off , but made sure he made a copy of the camera footage . As Raymond powered down the camera , Danny could see he turned off the camera in his office . \" Wh.....Wh-why......D......\" Danny couldn't finish his thought , let alone his sentence . Raymond Stood up and pulled something from his shirt pocket , Everything was getting blurry for Danny . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Raymond walked over to a almost passed out Danny in Leslie's body , he stopped and bent down to pick up the glass Danny dropped . He placed it on the counter and then came back and sat next to Danny who was still fighting to stay awake . Danny looked over at Raymond , but he could barely keep his head up . \" Ra-Raym-\" <br>\r\n\" Shhhh You don't need to speak , all you have to do is relax\" Raymond said as he put his finger over Danny's mouth . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny Blinked , and when he opened his eyes slowly it was so hard not to keep his eye lids closed . But he had to open them because he could feel Raymond's hands now on the top button of his blouse . Raymond started to unbutton Danny's blouse , and work his way down . \"N-No.....\" Danny tried saying as Raymond gently laid his head back , as Danny looked up at the ceiling he closed his eyes . Feeling a slight pressure on his lips and a wet soft <br>\r\ntongue slither its way in and swirl her tongue as well . Raymond was having his way with Leslie's body while Danny was along for the ride. </span></div></div>",

With there lips locked and Raymond gently cursing Leslie's face with both hands , he started to give her little kisses down Leslie's left side of her face . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Raymond's right hand he brushed her hair back , weather he noticed it or not during the interview . He definitely saw it now as he saw the tattoo right behind Leslie's left ear . \" Raymond started to lick Leslie's ear and as he did this he started to bring his right leg over her body to mount her . He licked her neck , slowly up and down . As he worked his mouth back up to hers , Raymond took a moment to get a good look at her . \" Its to bad you won't remember any of this , you are actually very pretty in your own way\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaymond continued to monologue Leslie as she laid there helpless , Raymond continued to unbutton Leslie's blouse the first couple of buttons opened up her blouse enough for Raymond to see the tops of her breasts . He unbuttoned the next one which was right below her breasts , he opened up her blouse and slide in his hands . Feeling them up he then unclasped her bra in the front , and just let her bra hang there for a moment . Raymond flung his hands back up to Leslie's face and began to passionately kiss her again, working his hands back down to her chest and pulling her bra open . \" They're real , ......oh yeah\" Raymond said as he once again worked his way down Leslie's chest kissing little pecks until he reached her breasts . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie let out a sigh , as Raymond cupped her left breast and felt it up  . Even though Danny might be unconscious Leslie's body had natural Pleasure sensors . Leslie's body also gave out a pelvic thrust , while Raymond wasn't giving her all his weight he looked down . As he looked up Slowly at Leslie's face \" Oh your so ready for this . \" He said as he quickly started to undo his belt and pants , he wasted little time unbuttoning his shirt . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaymond Grabbed Leslie's Body and laid her down long ways on the couch , he was overly excited and started to rush things . He quickly unbuttoned the rest of Leslie's blouse , \" Mmm...\" Leslie's body let out , it was enough for Raymond to want her even more . He pulled open her blouse ,and took a moment to pause . He lowered his head and placed his hands on the sides of Leslie's stomach . He went in and began to lick the indention of her belly button . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued down her sides , the fact that Leslie's body did have slight love handles didn't stop Raymond if anything he gave them a lite squeeze as well . As he walked his fingers down the leather of Leslie's belt , Leslie's head began to go side to side as if she was dreaming . \" I know I want this too \" Raymond said in response to Leslie's bobbing . He unclasped her belt and unfastened her pants , As he unzipped Leslie's pants Raymond Sat up and began to slide them down Leslie's legs . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" By the time you wake up ............\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n . </span></div></div>",

He Blinked his eyes and could hear a knock at the door . As his eyes started to adjust , he realized he was in Raymond's office . Sitting up right on Raymond's leather couch ,' Ah my head feels like a million pounds ' Danny thought . Danny was rocking his head up and down when he rocked his head down as his sight began to adjust , he noticed something . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!!!! What the hell?\" Danny Shouted , as the felling of a massive hang over , over came him . Danny lifted his arms up and felt his chest , and realized he was in a woman's body . \" What the hell ? How did this happen ?\" Danny Said feeling the breast right in front of him . Danny made his way to his feet , and continued to look down . Bracing with one arm on Raymond's desk and he felt his head , which to his shock wasn't his head at all . He felt Leslie's hair pulled back into a pony tail as he continued to slide his hand back and realize what other surprises his new body held . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny looked around the office , he was alone and saw that he was most likely passed out on the couch because of the pillows all thrown about . Danny started to make his way to the door leading out of Raymond's office when he had a sudden erge . ' Holy Crap I have to pee ' , Danny thought , as he walked over to Raymond's executive bathroom . Hearing a clinging sound , Danny looked down as he head over to the bathroom .  He could see he was wearing a hotel uniform , the shirt was un-tucked . The belt he was wearing was un buckled , and dangling . ' What the hell happened to me ?' Danny thought as he made his way into the bathroom . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later Danny came out and tucked in his shirt and fastened his belt . \" I don't want to get used to peeing sitting down . I have to get out of here and find out what happened to me \" . Danny said as he almost tripped on his leather boots he was wearing .

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Danny opened the door he was not only surprised he was caught off guard by who was standing there . Samantha the security guard , when Danny last saw her she was doing her security patrol on the second floor . Samantha was wearing her tactical black pants with military style boots . She normally had on a gun belt with all the bells and whistles attached but for some reason she didn't have it on over her wide leather belt . She didn't have on her long sleve shirt under her black polo either she just had her black polo on . Tucked in a proper , she was also wearing her finger-less gloves . Samantha was in her mid 20's and going to school to become a police officer as well . She normally wore a black base ball cap but she didn't have that on either , just her short hair cut parted down the middle . She was white with blue eyes , and most knew she was a lesbian . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Hey quickly we have to get you out of here \" Samantha said as she grabbed Danny's hand and pulled her away from Raymond's office . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Do you mind telling me why ?Or what the F&amp;*# is going ?\" Danny said as he tried to stop his new feminine body from being dragged about . Leslie's body wasn't strong enough to resist Samantha , and for that matter slow her down . <br>\r\n\" Shhhhh....He will be back soon \" Samantha said as stopped and turned to Danny , as they rounded the front Desk Mel was working the front desk . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Whispering ) \" Stay here I will make sure its clear. \" Samantha told Danny , Danny really didn't understand what was going on so he shock his head . Pressing his back against the wall , feeling his center of gravity had shifted again . Danny looked down . 'Normally this would be a kinky fun time, but what the hell is going on . I can't remember anything or why I am in a woman's body' Danny had so many thoughts from panic to wondering who's body he was in he could over hear Samantha talking to Mel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Everything quiet ?\" Samantha asked placing her thumbs in the front portion of her belt , and acting casual . She did a little patrol walk around the lobby area and looked around. <br>\r\n\" Yeah ......mostly\" Mel responded with , as if it was a typical day <br>\r\n\" Anything out of the ordinary ?\" <br>\r\n\" Well not since Raymond walked by whistling and saying something about today was the best day of the week or something\" <br>\r\nRaymond whistling , that is not normal . Danny thought , what the hell could make that guy so happy ? <br>\r\n\" Well alright give us a call if you need anything \" Samantha said walking back over to Danny , who looked puzzled and confused beyond belief . <br>\r\n( Whispering again) \" Hurry we have to move while she is checking the printer below . \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two woman raced to the elevator , Danny almost tripped over her curvy new body again . 'How the hell do they walk in these boots ?' Danny thought to himself as he was basically along for the ride . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking there was off the elevator on the second floor , Danny followed Samantha to Room 208 . Why is this so familur ? Danny thought to himself as he thought of a De-ja-vue moment with Room 208 , he felt a sharp pain in his head on the right side of his brain . \" Ahhhhh!!!! \" He stopped suddenly and held his head with his right hand . The pain was so extreme he closed his eyes . He had a sudden flash of laying on a bed and seeing ....Himself wank on his female body and being very excited about it . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Come on we need to get you back inside .\" Samantha said as she helped Him to her feet . \" My head is pounding , what .....is happening to me ?\" Danny said out loud still holding his head and getting fragments of memories from before Raymond's office . As they both entered the room , Danny could see there were shopping bags in the closet with clothes that still had tags on them . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Your going to need to sit down for this , ....There you go\" Both Women sat at the ends of the bed . Samantha was holding Danny close , and hugging her . Danny didn't have a lot of options in the matter , his head was throbbing with pain and Samantha was cuddling with Leslie's body . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" It was supposed to be so quick and easy no one was supposed to find out. \" Samantha said as she continued to rock Danny in her arms. \" Before I attempt the ritual again , you have to understand why your going to willingly do it.\" Samantha said something that jogged even more memories and mad Danny's head just go ballistic with agony . \" Ahhhhhhhh!!!! Wh-What are you saying ?\" Danny said as Samantha laid him down on the bed , Danny craddled his head with both hands now . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Ancient language chant\" After Samantha was done , Danny's head didn't hurt as much he was able to sit up again . He ran his fingers through his now medium length hair . <br>\r\n\" I deleted the security tape ......Before I did it , I watched\" Samantha said still sitting next to Danny and holding Danny's hands . \" I know this is allot to take in , but the reason your excepting the fact that your in a woman's body is there was a ritual before you were in Raymond's office. \" Samantha placed her right hand on Danny's face. As she spoke softly the next part . \" He roofied you \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny Suddenly had a flood of thoughts rush through his head, so many things just hit home for him . <br>\r\n\"AHHHHHH HOLY SH&amp;*!!!!!!!\" Danny shouted almost jumping up with shock , Samantha pulled her down and held her in a seated position. \" HE RAPPED ME!!!!\" Danny Shouted again as Samantha held on to her hands and kept her from jumping about. \" Shhh keep it down you have to calm down\" Samantha said trying to council Danny, who was still panicking and having the idea of Raymond on top of him set in . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 20 minutes of pure freak out , Samantha Chanted another Chant . The chat made it so Danny could not move or speak in Leslie's body . As he laid there on the bed looking up at the ceiling , he couldn't think of anything other then what had just happened . \" I know its to much to take in but I kept a copy of the video and destroyed the audio , there isn't a jury in the world that wouldn't convict him .\" Samantha tried to calm Danny down who actually had tears coming out of his eyes. \" I know that this is more then you can handle but you have to understand , I want you to want your new body.\" Danny's eyes opened wide as his eye brows lowered on the ends and raised in the middle . 'WHAT?! Danny thought what in the world would make me want to be a woman?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She reached over Leslie's body with her right hand and gripped her left shoulder and gave her a firm but nice embrace. The man who's mind was now inhabiting Leslie's body wished he could scream out , or at the very least fight back in anyway he could . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Samantha laid her head on the pillow next to Danny's and just looked at Leslie's body he was now wearing , she took her right arm off Danny's should and gripped around his ribs. Pulling herself on to Leslie's body in a mount position , she could see in Leslie's eyes how much Danny wanted to say or do something right at that moment . \" Don't get all fussy , your going to enjoy this . I want you to enjoy this .( Samantha gentle guided her hands from the middle out wards on Leslie's face , much to the displeasure of Danny) Only a woman could truely know how to please another woman\" . She said leaning in , she closed her eyes and slowly started to kiss Leslie's lips . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny couldn't resist , the taste of Samantha's strawberry lip gloss was comforting . But not enough to embrace this moment fully . Samantha Started to massage Leslie's neck just under her hairline with her left hand . Grabbing a  small hand full of hair with her right hand she gave it a tug . Much to Danny's surprise it sent a wave down his spine . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the warm up , I want you to want this \" Samantha whispered into Danny's ear as she sat up on Leslie's body , she slowly slithered down  enough to grab Danny's hands and gently place them above Danny's head on the head board . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha released Danny's arms knowing he was still helpless to move Leslie's body , she closed her eyes and began to chant again waving her hands in front of Danny's face her fingers back and forth . Danny looked around hoping for any way of escape , also if this was hypnosis he wasn't going to do it willingly . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's Chants got louder , Her eyes rolled back into her head . Danny watched closely awe stuck at this site . Could this be what switched his body with Leslie's ? he was totally distracted by what Samantha was doing to even rationalize it . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Samantha's eye lids flung open her eyes glowed green as if they were pure energy at the same time her mouth opened and was engulfed in the same glowing green energy . With in a split second of seeing this Danny eyes opened wide , as a bolt of energy emerged from Samantha's mouth and forced its was into Leslie's .

The force of energy from Samantha was so strong that it felt like some stuck two fingers in my mouth and the once inside jammed the rest of there hand in and made a fist . <br>\r\nThe energy filled my mouth and went down my throat , it felt like I just ate a tube of ice cream and was going to be bloated . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds the feeling spread all the way down and it felt like I had to go pee so bad , I felt the urge to hold it in . But the feeling was so intense that it felt good for a split second then I could feel myself just letting go , and let it all flow through me. ' Ah' now that felt amazing , the feeling that was originating in my lower extremities was spreading down my legs . Swirling thought I could feel it enter my rear end , and once again I felt myself wanting to hold it in . I tried with all my effort to close my eyes and bite down to squeeze it in . The pulsating energy was to strong and in the split second I had the idea of holding it in , it forced its way out . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n' Ahhhh I have never been able to just let it all go like this before....'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought, followed by a thoroughly discontented sigh was the only reaction I could manage as my entire lower half jerked up abruptly. Samantha straddled my legs and was ridding me like a bronco , I could feel my eye lids getting so heavy . Almost as if I haven't slept in days , or weeks even . Its not a far stretch but , wow I feel so sleepy . I closed my eyes . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that brief moment when everything just didn't seem to matter, I was reminded of the first time I had sex with a girl . I remembered it as if it was happening right now , her name was Kristin . She was amazing , she came into my room and before long she was explaining to me how to unhook her bra from the back . I was reminded of the feeling of her chest for the first time , it sent a  jolt down my spine thinking about it . I remember following her into bed and just being mesmerized by her heart shaped but in her jeans , and how she was wearing those and only those jeans. She and I made out for a while before I laid down and she was on top . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slow rhythmic thrust motion between the two of use made me cling to her like we were one , as if that feeling should never end . How I went numb that first time and craved the numbing feeling every-time . I felt that feeling again as it spread through out my body , This sudden Surge I felt while my body was being penetrated by this energy foisted upon me the same feeling of bliss . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d assume that\u2019s why the nostalgic thought sprung to mind in the first place. As the energy dissipated through me , I started to lay back down on the bed . It took me a moment but I had a stiff neck for sure , when i went to rotate my neck around I was able to move it free with out restriction . I stretched my arms out above my head as I stretched my neck as well . I did a yawn and moved my jaw about . I rotated my wrists and my ankles at the same time , feeling the stiffness slowly leave me . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened my eyes , and I opened them wide . I took a deep breathe , and let the air into my nose and out through my mouth . I smelt the faint smell of Citrus Fruit in the air , Most likely from the air freshener in the room . But it was lovely to smell it and breathe deeply again , as I started to lift myself up Samantha took my hands in hers and assisted me . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled my hands into her lips and kissed them softly . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" How do you feel ? \" Samantha asked looking at me with those bright blue eyes of hers , her face was so soft and smooth I found myself over whelmed with the urge to taste her . I slipped my left had free and guided myself to her face , slipping my hand in on the side of her face I closed my eyes and kissed her . Feeling mouth open slightly , Samantha kissed me back . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I guess your feeling better aren't you ?\" she said as she pulled away and rested her forehead on mine . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both sat back , and looked each other in the eye  . \" Hey.....\" is all I could say She was just to irresistible to me , and the exquisite feeling I got from looking at her resonated through out my whole body . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Are you feeling ...O.K...?\" With her eye brows raised slightly in concern , I couldn't resist her but I had to answer her . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I feel....O.K... all over \" I said with a slight laugh , Samantha slide off my lap and stood on the floor next to me . She didn't let go of my hands for a moment , as I slide my legs to the side of the bed and sat on the edge . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Lets get some particulars out of the way , ( she was nodding her head at me) what is your name ?\" She asks me a simple question such as my name , and I get lost in her eyes again . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Its what ever you want it to be \" I reply with only a gleeful smile to try to hide my lust for her . As I smiled and looked at Samantha I kept thinking how I wanted to remove her uniform and only leave her Shiny belt . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha Smiles \" That's kinky but what is your name ?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I do Like the name Leslie , which ever one you want is fine by me.\" Danny said as she felt her stomach and worked her way up to her chest and then stretched her arms out . \" So what do you want to do with me ?\" She asked Samantha as she wrapped her hands around Samantha's neck , and jumped into her arms knocking her back and onto the other bed in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny didn't wait for her answer as she started to make out with Samantha , Samantha closed her eyes and embraced her passionate everything that was happening . Danny pulled herself off , \" Now then what shall we do with this body I am wearing ?\" Danny Stood in between Samantha's legs who was still laying there in a blissful state , taking a brief look around Danny spotted the half mirror over by the entrance to the hotel room . She pulled on her belt loops to pull up her pants , and started to walk over to the mirror . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Not bad , not bad at all .....could be worse \" Danny stated as she began to look over Leslie's body in the mirror . She began to pose a few different poses as Samantha made her way over and behind her . Danny placed her right hand on her hip and her left hand up and behind her head . Doing a half turn to the left and giving a smile to the mirror , Samantha crossed her arms . \" Well we could always put you in the body of a cat if you like posing so much \" Samantha said mocking Danny . \" You can do that ?\" Danny asked surprised by the idea of being a cat ,which really didn't seem to bad to her . \" I -I think so ....the spell isn't constricted to the body .....want to try it ?\" Samantha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Not really , just thought it was a fun idea \" Danny quick spouted back , Samantha reached out for Danny's hands . As Danny extended her arms out and the pair genitally held hands Samantha guided them back to the bed . Placing Danny seated on the end of the bed Samantha was re-leaved to see the new mind set was much easier to deal with then the male trapped in a female's body . But what extent does this blissful mind set go to ? Samantha thought she would test it first , if she could keep Danny this way it would be perfect . \" So Danny , what do you have planned for this afternoon ?\" Samantha asked Danny paused for a moment recalling what she had to do . <br>\r\n\" What ever you want to do is fine why ? \" Danny said with a smile . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No practice or stuff to do at your house ?\" Asking in an almost alarming way , Samantha had a feeling this blissful state was clouding everything in Danny's head . <br>\r\n\"Nope just doing what every it is you want to do \" Danny said laying back on the bed while still looking deep into Samantha's eyes . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" NO ...This ...Th-this can't go on ..... \" Samantha said standing up , which cause Danny to sit up alarmed . \" What did I do wrong ?\" Danny asked . \" Your not supposed to be a ...a Sl-slave to me you are supposed to be comfortable with the fact that your a woman now and retain some of you memories ....No all This yes master blah blah blah . \" Samantha was pissed about the spell she cast and started to tear up as she turned away . <br>\r\n\" Hey .... Hey relax I am here for you , whats wrong ?\" Danny sprung to her feet and wrapped her arms around Samantha . \" You don't get it .....DO you think I wanted this .....thi-this ....Body ?\" Samantha said with tears coming down , as she placed her hands over her face . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was surprised , deep deep down in the bliss filled mind of Liz's body . Danny's mind was still full intact and trying to force its way back to the surface . In the moment Danny saw Samantha crying which is something a tough Security guard would never do . Danny's mind was at peace and still logical . \" Wa-wait .....give me a second\" Danny said shacking her head and remembering the events of the day . \" What do you mean ....this body\" Danny asked pointing at Samantha . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't my body .....This is Samantha's body . \" Samantha said still crying and sobbing . \" Aren't you Samantha?\" Danny asked seeing this for what it was , the woman in front of him who he had know for almost a year was acting very different , she was kind , she was genital , she came to Raymond's office to Save Danny . All of which seemed now like it was out of character for Samantha . <br>\r\n\"No ......I am Leslie..... Your in my body ...or rather my former body. \" She said drying up her tears . Danny looked down and then back at Samantha . \" Does this mean that .....Samantha is in my body then ?\" Danny asked as he was still figuring it all out . \" Yes , she tricked me . This wasn't my idea she tricked me .\" Samantha said falling to her knees crying hysterically Danny went to her side . Samantha pushed her away \"NO stay back please ....just stay back.\" <br>\r\n\" I ....I have no clue what to say ....or do ....but ....we are both in the same .....position . \" Danny started to say , \" NO You still can get out of this .....I am trapped now and being freakin tortured every second I breath. \" She said looking at Danny . \" Your in my body but you have your mind still . I don't ....she cast the memory spell on me.\" Danny realized the cloth Samantha or rather Leslie in Samantha's body was about to place on her face was a spell of sorts . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know who you are then ? \" Danny pieced it together , and realized she was looking at what they were going to do to him . \" Because the spell makes you remember your bodies memories , and still retain your former memories . Its torture !!!!! .......It hurts like a migraine ...she kept me this way so I could cast the spell on you and her . I am her slave .\" Samantha said standing up and dusting off her knees , as she turned Danny noticed she wasn't armed with a ammo just a gun in the holster with no clip . \" Why did you bring me back here ? \" Danny asked not wanting to know for sure but her had to find out . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Because while , I am in this body Samantha's memories are mine now and she did have a crush on me .So naturally I feel the same way towards you or rather your body . I MEAN my body , AHHHHHH this is so hard .\" Samantha said as Danny stood there in the middle of the room ........</span></div></div>",

Odd you bring it up but .....Samantha made you get a job here ?\" Danny could start to understand this better . \" More or less Raymond is a real ass , all I did was answer a few questions and I got hired .But Samantha knew ....she knew it .......I don't hate her but ...\" Samantha or rather Leslie paused . Danny could understand she was in love with her . \" Is there a way you can change me back ?\" Danny thought out loud . \" The only way I can make this right is if I am me again . \" \" I know\" Leslie said , \" But its complicated \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to go on Leslie paused with her left hand in the air , almost as if someone said freeze . Danny could hear the key lock opening , before he could react Samantha in his former body came bursting into the room . <br>\r\nHe saw the two standing there and with out a word of warning rushed at Danny putting both his hands on her shoulders and forcing her to the bed . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Rhythmic Chanting)\" Samantha said while looking deep into Danny's eyes , Danny's arms were stretched out . Next was her legs . She could feel a force as if someone  was holding her down . Samantha smiled with a sinister grin , as she stuck her fingers into Danny's blouse between the buttons . With a quick fling her ripped her shirt open exposing her bare belly , and bra . Danny felt helpless as his former body began to have his way with her . <br>\r\nSamantha leaned in and kissed Danny's belly button , giving it a lick as he continued on . \" Oh look at you go you horny dog hahahaha\" Samantha said mocking Danny . <br>\r\n\" I love Leslie's style as well , just wait we have more of this in store for you in a moment \" Samantha was saying this as she felt Danny's belt . He began to unbuckle Danny's belt , unclasped her pants and unzipped her pants . <br>\r\n\" I want you to pull your pants down please \" He said , with out a moment of hesitation Danny's arms moved as if she was a puppet on the strings . She put her hands on her hips and started to slide her pants down , inserting her thumbs in the pants and guiding her hands to her bottom she then slide her pants off of her but . <br>\r\nShe slide them down to mid thigh , and Samantha pulled them down to her ankles . Just below the tops of her boots . Danny was wearing a nice pair of underwear the had little bows on the sides that could be untied , and Samantha did just that . As she untied Danny's underwear , She looked Danny in the face . \" What a beautiful Smile you have . \" Taking a brief moment , to pause and look at Danny. Samantha then reached out with her left arm and grabbed onto Danny's face forcing her mouth open . Samantha had the wadded up panties in the other hand and stuck them in her mouth . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Enjoy this \" was the last thing Danny heard before he was in the blissful mindset again . Danny remembers blinking , when he opened his eyes . Samantha was putting his clothes back on , Danny blinked again a and looked around . Leslie was still standing there but now looking at Danny lay there , she still couldn't move . <br>\r\n\" She is back \" Leslie said almost like she was in a trance . <br>\r\n\" Oh good this will be even better then we thought , Fashion Show \" Samantha said . Danny noticed he was wearing the blouse again with only the top few buttons buttoned . Her panties were still in her mouth , she could even spit them out . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Help her up please , \" Samantha said as she went around the corner to get what sounded like paper bags . Leslie helped Danny up to her feet , she also removed the panties from Danny's mouth . As she did this she smiled at Danny , and slipped her hands under her blouse for a quick feel . As she did this she whispered to Danny .....<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
