The sheer amount of noise and lights were overwhelming to her, even despite her time in the Capital. A wave of nausea caused her to slump to the ground, her head spinning. Taking slow breaths and holding her head with her eyes screwed shut, she willed the world to stop whirling around her. The queasiness soon passed, and she slowly looked around, trying to take in the huge scope of the space around her. People weren\u2019t even paying much attention to the statuesque woman who had appeared in their midst and fell to the ground, walking around her without sparing little more than passing glances, and some didn\u2019t even do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she had been quite in disbelief of the situation: one moment being locked in mortal combat for the fate of the Empire, next she was floating in a void with dozens upon dozens of other women, while a voice from nowhere and everywhere told them all that they would have to eat an entire universe; the utter absurdity had almost caused her to laugh. Now though, placed within a city looking like nothing she had ever seen before, filled with people that were at once very alike and very unalike any that she had encountered before, she had to wonder if it wasn\u2019t all true. Her thought was cut off though as an intense hunger like nothing she had ever experienced before gripped her whole body. It felt like a void had opened up within her, wanting nothing more than for everyone and everything \u2013 including herself \u2013 to be consumed by it. She curled up in the fetal position on the ground, feeling the hunger gnawing away within her comparatively frail body. If she had been able to think better, she might have realized that this was likely the hunger that the voice had given to all of the women in the void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting with all of her will, she clawed her way back from the abyss, shoving the hunger down, but not banishing it at all. She could still feel it deep within, demanding to be filled, but it wasn\u2019t all consuming for now. A hand reached down to hold her shoulder, rocking her back and forth slightly seeming to try and get her attention. Opening her eyes again was another battle, but she finally managed, and saw that a young man was speaking to her, but she couldn\u2019t hear a thing for now. At first, he looked so much like her love Tatsumi, but as she continued to look, she realized that he looked nothing like the young man of her dreams. A flash of anger surged up from within, at being taken away from her love, for being forced into this situation, for the indifference of those around her; any of those and more caused her to lash out, a desire to punish this world and beyond building like a flame within her heart. With barely a thought, she called on her abilities, wanting to freeze the unfortunate soul closest to her. A small piece of her mind wondered if her abilities would even work in this realm though.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A surge of power rushed through her body; she could feel it even while holding the hunger at bay, a familiar rush of cold blossoming and following her command. With a loud crackle and snap, the young man was totally encased in a layer of ice several inches thick. This finally seem to attract some attention from the people rushing around her; a shrill scream cutting through all of the other noise, followed by another, and shouts, and expletives, and more, all blending together into a beautiful song to the icy woman. Drinking the fear and surprise helped still her mind and helped her gather her wits. As pleasant as it all was, she decided to make a hasty retreat, using of the panicked scattering of the crowd to slip away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching her breath in a deserted alleyway, she could feel the cavity that was her stomach grumbling in complaint at not being filled yet. Across the way, some boxes with moving pictures and words were telling of how odd women had appeared all over the world, and all of them were becoming ravenous eating machines that couldn\u2019t be stopped; Esdeath paid little attention to that though, the hunger demanding attention again. A smell wafted by, she couldn\u2019t recognize much of the smell, but she was reasonably sure that it was food, and that was all that mattered; her mind still shying from eating anything and everything for now. Other than that, her mind submitted command, letting her body go, following the scent drifting from around the corner and through a glass door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin were tables and booths, most filled with people eating all sorts of things. Without waiting a moment, she launched herself at the nearest offering, shoving a hefty woman aside and digging into the food she was carrying. A cry of outrage died on the other woman\u2019s lips as Esdeath shoveled the food into her mouth as fast as she could. As soon as she finished, she moved onto the next table, pushing more people out of the way and devouring each morsel with barely a chance to taste it. Each piece she shoved in her mouth brought rapturous delight to her, and she never wanted the feeling to stop. Shouts of complaint and anger trailed in her wake, but she ignored anything other than the next piece of food before her. At first, she gave a token effort to chew the food she was consuming, but she soon abandoned that, swallowing most in large pieces or even whole. One burly man grabbed her shoulder roughly, shouting some incomprehensible noise in her face, and the blue haired Amazonian woman only responded with a roaring belch in his face before tossing him across the room. A small portion of her mind struck out with her abilities, ice forming around the hands and feet of those nearest to her, pinning everyone affected in place, as well as coating the door in a thick layer to prevent any other escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing all of the food within the first area, Esdeath turned her attention to the region behind the counter. Despite the weight and size of her glutted stomach \u2013 burst through her now ill-fitting coat \u2013 she deftly leapt over the counter to get to the food beyond. A little man in an undersized uniform of some sort tried to stop her, getting a swift boot to the face as she focused solely on filling her stomach. Not all of the food back there was fully cooked, but that mattered little to Esdeath in her voracious glee. More people where frozen in place as they tried to stop her or flee, the noise not penetrating the haze within her head. Soon she had cleared all of the somewhat prepared food, though she had a sense that more was still there, lying behind a gleaming metal door. Her bloated belly bobbing with each step, she wrenched the door open, feeling the burst of cold air from within billowing out around her. Stacks of boxes greeted her from within, and she gave a shout of absolute joy before diving in. The icy bounty shrunk as she consumed every piece, the cold settling within the cauldron of her stomach. Upending the last box to dump its contents down her gullet, she licked her lips to get the tastes lingering there, and rubbed her weighty and distended gut, her conscious mind coming forth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, her mind recoiled from the knowledge of the gluttony she had committed, but that feeling passed as her stomach gave another hungry grumble. Despite the ridiculous amount of food she had stuffed within, the hunger was still there, demanding more. The voice had told all of the women to enjoy themselves, and Esdeath was starting to really enjoy the new power and freedom from inhibitions. Another rumble from her stomach spurred her to move on and find more food. A panicked whimper stopped her in her tracks, her gaze settling on one of the people frozen in place behind the counter. The sheer terror evident on the young woman pulled Esdeath closer, her mind spinning around a new idea: why go out and find more food, when there was so much still here? Did she really want to eat these people live though? The voice had said that they were supposed to, but some part of her brain still fought against the notion. A louder roar from her gut helped make up her mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The hunger demanded more food, and there was some right there, just waiting for her to devour every bit. Plus, if the voice was to be believed \u2013 and it certainly hadn\u2019t steered her wrong yet \u2013, everyone and everything was going to be eaten anyways, so why not indulge herself? Something about the thought of consuming these people and feeling their futile struggles before they are digested and added to her swelling frame stirred something within her, what better way to prove your power over another than making them part of you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsdeath gave a wide grin, which did little to soothe the young woman caught in the shadow beneath that swollen gut. She reached down to the food vendor, that food bloated belly crushing the lady into the ground. The icy restraints easily succumbed to Esdeath\u2019s strength, freeing the girl from one imprisonment only to trade it for another. Opening her mouth wide, impossibly wide, Esdeath gave a long luxurious lick over the face of the soon-to-be meal, causing the panicked flailing and screaming to increase, but it was all for naught as her head was soon shoved into the back of the icy woman\u2019s throat. As she got the first taste of the living meal, the hunger reared up, causing Esdeath to slurp the woman down quickly, clothes and all, the bulge of her passage easily visible as it passed down her slender neck, past her heaving breasts, to the final destination within the cauldron of her stomach. Bumps and lumps could easily be seen across the sagging and swollen stomach as the first occupant tried in vain to escape; her actions only resulting in pleasing Esdeath and giving her confirmation that this would be immensely enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt seeing what happened, a shocked hush fell over the other patrons forming the audience and the rest of the buffet. The quiet was soon shattered as shouts and screams came from everywhere at once, hysterical attempts to free themselves and get away from the insanity taking place. This noise proved quite a delight to Esdeath, giving her a heady feeling as she turned to the next meal, and the next, and so on. Men, women, and children all made their final journey into the maw leading to the writhing mass that pushed ever farther out and down with each addition. Coming to the last \u2013 a young redheaded woman \u2013 Esdeath\u2019s stomach was touching the ground, and she had to swing her legs far out to the side to make any headway, but it was still slow going, though considering all of the food and nearly two dozen people packed within, it was still impressive that she could move at all, no matter that the voice said that they would remain mobile. Her coat had long since given up the fight, the buttons and clasps giving way to the gluttony, hanging open and revealing that massive sphere of her stomach and the relatively tiny orbs of her breasts, only held in place with a thin lacy bra, and pushed up by the churning weight below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman was pinned at the base of a wall, her eyes wide with fear as Esdeath slowly lumbered towards her. Her uncontrolled sobbing was all the noise she was making, not even attempting to scream for help or anything, seeing how well it had helped those that came before. Using her ice powers, Esdeath extended the shackles holding the target, pushing her up so that they could see eye to eye. A glimmer flashed through the young woman\u2019s eyes, as she tried one last thing to save herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Please, don\u2019t eat me!\u201d she managed to gasp out between sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, why should I do that?\u201d Esdeath asked coolly, her tongue making a slow pass of her lips as she waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically looking around, the woman\u2019s eyes could find no solace, and was prompted by the icy glutton, \u201cWell, I\u2019m waiting\u2026\u201d to which she blurted out, \u201cI\u2019ll do anything\u2026anything! My house is nearby, you could go there; you might need to sleep all this off, right!? Or I could do anything you want!\u201d her voice shrill and words smashing together from her fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsdeath stopped to consider this, and the brief reprieve seemed to settle the young woman, though she looked like she might still break down completely at any moment. The hunger had actually faded away, not completely, but it wasn\u2019t the all-devouring void it was before. Other parts of her body was demanding attention too, she could feel the heat in her face, her normally pale skin likely flushed, and her loins ached from desire, a stream of cum leaking down the side of her legs, her panties soaked through from her arousal. Once she stopped crying wildly, the girl was actually somewhat attractive, even pleasantly plump. It wasn\u2019t as if Esdeath hadn\u2019t been with another woman before, she just preferred men, especially her dear Tatsumi. Separated from him and the rest of her world though, and facing a burning desire, she could certainly spare this one for now, and it wasn\u2019t as if she couldn\u2019t eat her later on anyways. On the other hand, she could always eat her now and find someone else who might be able to satisfy her other base urges.</span></div></div>",

The Pure Evil Omnitech Ultra Nightmare Corporation, also known as P.E.O.U.N.C for short, has successfully taken over the entire universe.   This amalgamation of the most sinister military contractors, malevolent media empires, and psychopathic pharmaceutical industries on Earth has ousted the world governments.  Under the leadership of the evil cyborg vampire crocodile anthro CEO Count Dracugator, the company rules the Earth as the center of their galactic corporate dictatorship. The corporation has monopolized all aspects of industry and economy, forcing impossible to pay debts on every nation, state, and city, and charge 300 million dollars a day to civilians for clean air and drinking water.  The poor and homeless are resigned to be turned into either guinea pigs for amoral experiments, savage undead, or mindless drones for either military or labor.  Resistance movements against the mega-corp are destroyed the moment they begin.  Kindness, charity, friendship, and love are all outlawed with the punishment of death by Gatling chainsaw rocket launchers.  There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide from the Pure Evil Omnitech Ultra Nightmare Corporation.

The unicorn pony yawned to greet the day but quickly found out something is wrong.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Where am I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked in a state of surprise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t my bedroom. Spike?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\nShe wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in her library home in Ponyville.  The unicorn took a quick look at her surroundings.  Twilight was sitting a large queen size bed, behind her was a large landscape painting framed on the wall above the bedframe, on her right was small wooden desk with a lamp on it and some books, to her left was a mirror, dresser, and a lilac set of curtains, and to the front was a large flat box thing that was attached to the wall.  The floor was carpeted a neutral white color and the walls had a beige-off-white color painted on.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay, this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t funny you guys.  You know I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it when\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\nThe growl of her stomach interrupted the pony\u00e2\u0080\u0099s train of thought.  She got off her bed and tried to leave her room to grab some breakfast but the door was locked shut.  Words were etched in metal that showed Twilight why the door wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t open.  <br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPay 40 million dollars to leave your room?\u00e2\u0080\u0099  Pinkie and Rainbow Dash would never do this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\nThe more she looked at her surroundings, the more she began to feel this wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a prank.  Opening the curtains just confirmed to her she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in Ponyville anymore, but a strange settlement whose architecture and city planning was vastly different anything she seen in Equestria.  Buildings of mason brick, a water tower of metal bearing the name of Plains Town, and roads of a black substance decorated with yellow lines in the middle.  <br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever responsible for this, could you please just tell me what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  <br>\r\nTwilight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleas went nowhere.  In her panic she accidently stepped on a small rectangular handle like object laying on the carpet floor that was rounded on both ends with many buttons on its top.  The black box turned on and started to display an animate image of a robot newscaster.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 in other news, Your lords and masters of the Pure Evil Omnitech Ultra Nightmare Corporation has recently repossessed the human will of the American state of South Dakota for years behind on their 800 million dollars a day decision making payments.  The P.E.O.U.N.C\u00e2\u0080\u0099s squadrons of Chainsaw Ninja Gorillas, Amazon River mutants, and Battle Copters piloted by Velociraptors will be rounding up those deadbeat Southern Dakotans and force them to work in the weapon factories as their ability to make their own decisions are permanently gone. And for those wondering if there will be any chance of a resistance movement putting up a fight\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 just remember the oddly specific weakness for any of the robots, soldiers, demons and any other form of military/corporate law enforcement of the Pure Evil Omnitech Ultra Nightmare Corporation: they can only be defeated by being swallowed completely whole, which absolutely no one in this universe can possibly achieve. Stay tuned for today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest deals we will force you buy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. *Kzzrt* Your TV viewing time has expired please pay 30 million dollars to continue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPure Evil\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Nightmare Corporation!?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Twilight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jaw fell flat at the utter audacity of the atrocities of this so called Pure Evil something something whatever.  Innocent people suddenly becoming brainwashed and forced out of their homes. They were basically being treated as property, forced to work against will when they should be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  Twilight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach rumbled a second time.  She realized she had to get out of this room.  She searched the room for anything of use.  The first thing that came of interest to her was the books lying on the desk.  Levitating them with her magic, she saw that they were conveniently books of magic: one on light magic, one on dark magic, and one of elemental magic.  They weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the same magic as the magic of Equestria but Twilight Sparkle could learn the contents rather quickly.  In fact one of the spells was a short term intangibility spell and with a simple cast she was finally able to exit the room.  <br>\r\nShe was now in a hallway from the looks of it a two star hotel but something wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t right about it.  It looked cleaned recently but felt like everyone, guest and staff have just gotten up and straight up abandoned the place. <br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello? Is any\u00e2\u0080\u00a6one here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Twilight Sparkle asked aloud with concern.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just woke up in one of the rooms and I have no idea how I got here and I'm really hungry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Twilight still had no answer. In the empty hallway, between wandering aimlessly in the hallway she was getting anxious her mind filled with questions that she wanted answers to.   Where was she? Were her friends or any one from her home world of Equestria here?  If so would she able to find them? That dream she had this morning, surely that must of have something to do with her current predicament.  Twilight focused on what she could remember from that dream: Being in a void of darkness, being told a universe been corrupted, and from what she saw from that Pure Evil Omnitech Ultra Nightmare Corporation was most certainly the cause of it.  She thought she had caught a glimpse of her friends in that dream but wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure.  The unicorn tried to ponder about the dream more but Twilight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s train of thought was interrupted a third time, not by her hungry stomach this time but by a mysterious scent that had found its way into her nostrils.<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that breakfast?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked herself excitedly.  Twilight turned around and passionately followed that scent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trail down the stairs. The Unicorn pony didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any time to look around as getting herself fed was an uncharacteristically high priority to her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run into anyone, and finds an empty buffet room full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight runs into runs into someone from the dream she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Choice to the ones who think they can make this cheesy, campy plot work seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
