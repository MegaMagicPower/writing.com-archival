There were few out that evening, and no attention came to the lost little girl who was all by her self.  Her wings hurt from flying too fast, and now she didn't know where she was, or how to get back home.  Why did she run away.  She was only upset at the scolding she received earlier in the day.  Her mother had found out that Elith had skipped magic school, and when Elith said she'd fallen asleep, her Mother had hit her for the first time.  Elith had lied ... and her mother new it, she knew that Elith had been down at the swamp with a boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Elith felt bad for running away, she meant to apologize to her mother, but was too stunned to realize she had stormed from the house, and now sat crying far away from her home.</span></div></div>",

She quickly stood up and looked around if she could see a source of light in the streets of Magnous. Suddenly, she became aware of a soft rhythmic noise, which she quickly identified as sneaking footsteps. She quickly looked around, now in panic. The footsteps gradually became louder. Elith just decided she would run in the opposite direction of the noise as fast as she could when her eyes finally caught sight of a small light in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the footsteps stopped. Elith clearly heard heavy breathing behind her. For a split second she stood frozen in terror, and then she shrieked and ran in the direction of the light as fast as she could. There was no sound of pursuit. Slowing her pace as she reached the light, she found it was a lantern. It light up a sign that said \"Magnous Tavern: Open 24 Hours a Day, Seven Days a Week!\" Elith looked back to see the silhouette of a very tall man looking at her about ten yards away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She carefully moved closer to the tall shape, who still didn't move an inch. \"S-sir?\" She asked, this time mustering up the courage to poke the silent type. \"... It's a statue!\" Elith realized. She chuckled, and then broke out in laughter. \"Founder of Magnous\", she could just barely read at the statue's foot. She stood there for a while when a sound made her fall silent again- footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to the tavern.

So much for being open 24/7.  \"Please!\"  Her screams echo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elith opens her mouth to attempt to scream out again, a gloved hand covers her lips firmly!</span></div></div>",

They are persistent in finding her.  \"Why me?\" Elith wonders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She thinks of ways of escaping, but her choices are limited.  If she tries to run, the noise will lead the monster to her.  Her wings are to tired and would not be able to lift her.  The fatigue becomes more and more of a problem as the night closes in all around.  \"I should have stayed home.  And, I should have listened to the instructors.  Maybe, I would know of a magic spell to get me out of here.\"  Elith's mind torments her with what should have or could have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear continues to be the same.  Someone is after Elith.  They have purposely followed her.  Magnous has never been a safe town.  There are always things trying to capture fairies.  Of all the creatures, fairies get targeted the most.  They are small and fragile.  Elith knows that her wings would be a grand prize for a hunter!  She has heard many horror stories about young Forrest Fairies being kidnapped by hunters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crunching of the leaves don't ease the patter of Elith's now fragile heart. She knows that something is trying to find her.

Dressed in nothing from the waist up, the extraordinarily handsome, bearded and athletically built human had beautiful sapphire eyes and long, frost-white hair that draped down to his shoulders. It was hard to tell how old he was, but he was certainly no younger than thirty. He held a long staff in one hand, which seemed to be made of wood and had unusual writings carved into it all over.

His name is MAGNUS. We live in a small keep in the forest just outside this city's walls. His knowledge of magic is amazing -- he managed to raise a tiger and a wolf into a semi-human state so they could now think, talk and walk upright like you and me, though they're still not fully human.

With trepidation, she unfurled her wings and flew to within a few feet of him. Trepidation because she knew better than to fly in close proximity to structures, trees, or even people. Her diaphanous wings were so delicate, so fragile that the slightest bump or contact might shred them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching up to Rufus, she huffed, \u201cAren\u2019t we going east?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to your keep, to see if Magnus can help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagnus and Lupus, the human wolf I mentioned, have been gone for several days searching for spikenard.

Elith was already exhausted when she encountered him and by now could barely keep up. \u201cLet\u2019s take a break,\u201d he suggested. He didn\u2019t have to ask Elith twice; she collapsed on the grass, after, of course, tucking her wings flat against her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t tarry long,\u201d said Rufus. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Father wants, but he would not send for me unless it was urgent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He\u2019ll not be delayed on my account</i>. Feigning vigor she didn\u2019t feel, Elith jumped to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m rested. Let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Sure you\u2019re ready?\u201d asked Rufus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d lied Elith. \u201cDon\u2019t you know fairies recover from exhaustion faster than humans? Why, we hardly need sleep at all.\u201d If anything, the opposite was true. Fairies, especially female fairies, can fly only if they force themselves to remain thin nearly to the point of being emaciated. Save for the sinewy muscles in her back and shoulders that powered her wings, Elith carried virtually no muscle or fat on her frame, and thus lacked the endurance of even average humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then.\u201d Rufus gave her a nod of satisfaction and started off at the same pace. Elith stayed by his side, trying to ignore the ache in her legs and side. They were nearing the city gates now, and the forest beyond, so flying was out of the question. They had gone half a millarium or so into the forest when she heard the roar of the mighty Riparian River. The same river ran near her village. <i>Girl, if you had the brains of a rock, you woulda followed the river home</i>. Too late now; she couldn\u2019t possibly manage a flight of any length as tired as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRufus noticed she lagged behind and called, \u201cAlmost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey came to a clearing at the edge of the forest overlooking the river. A trim little cottage sat nestled against a slight rise. Several people stood outside the cottage, some with torches. A voice yelled, \u201cHere comes Rufus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople turned toward the man and the fairy, but nobody seemed to notice Elith. \u201cRufus,\u201d said a man, \u201cIt\u2019s Lorene. She\u2019s dead. Murdered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRufus\u2019 face grew dark. He stared at the man for several seconds, almost as if he expected him to say he was kidding. With a growl deep in his throat, Rufus strode into the cottage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A friend of Rufus was killed! He won\u2019t have any time for me now. I can\u2019t intrude on his grief. Maybe I better find a place to sleep till morning then fly home</i>. She took a deep breath. <i>But then I won\u2019t see Rufus anymore</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"> A millarium is approximately nine-tenths of a mile, or about a kilometer-and-a-half</font>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The other men just stood nearby silently. Elith watched from several paces away, and she realized: <i>big men cry, too.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she to do, now? She couldn't expect him to pay her much attention anymore. Then it occured to her: maybe she could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging into her pocket, she took out a sachet of fairy dust. There was too little of it in this single sachet for it to be of use to her -- she needed at least two sachets to conjure up a meal and four to cast a spell that would bring her home -- so she thought she might as well try it on Rufus' dead friend to see if it could be of any help. Who knows, maybe it might exert a different effect on humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElith went up real close to Rufus and the body, ignoring the other men as they muttered among themselves upon seeing her. \"Rufus, maybe I can help,\" said Elith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" gasped Rufus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually not sure,\" explained Elith, \"but let's put it this way, you've nothing to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElith opened the sachet and emptied its contents over the body. Countless constellations of colorful twinkles spread all over it. The twinkling display lasted a while, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body began to move. The chest and belly went up and down as breathing resumed. At length the eyes fluttered, then opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh... What happened?\" muttered the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lorene! <b>You're alive!</b>\" cried Rufus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then two figures approached. One was a tall, thin old man with a long white beard, dressed in robes with runes embroidered on them; the other was a half-wolf, half-man creature. \"Could someone tell me what's going on?\" asked the old man.</span></div></div>",

She brought Lorene back to life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, you fool!\u201d hissed the man. To the wolf-creature, he said, \u201cGo outside and disperse the crowd. Tell them Rufus and I want to grieve in solitude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who would believe that lycanthropic face could express surprise or dismay</i>? The wolf-creature managed it. \u201cBut ...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do as I say,\u201d ordered the man. He took a step toward the now-resuscitated  girl on the bed, shielding her from view of the rubberneckers peering in from outside. \u201cAnd close that door on your way out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had left, the man turned to Elith. \u201cI'm Magnus. And you've really made a hash of things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElith looked at Rufus. He looked back at her, his face reflecting the same confusion she felt. \u201cSir,\u201d said the fairy, \u201cI don't understand. I've brought this lady back to life.\u201d Why would anyone be mad at her for reviving \u2026 \u201c A terrible thought flooded her brain. \u201cYou!\u201d She pointed at Magnus, at the same time backing away from him. \u201cYou're the one. You killed Lorene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorene was trying to sit up. She gave up and propped herself on an elbow. \u201cNo, no, he didn't.\u201d Rufus sat on the bed and helped her to a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I didn't kill her,\u201d snapped Magnus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather,\u201d said Rufus, \u201cLorene is my cousin and your Goddaughter. Aren't you overjoyed to see her alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I'm deliriously happy to see the color in her cheeks.\u201d In a softer voice, he said to Lorene, \u201cYou'll have a pounding headache, my dear, but it'll go away in an hour or so.\u201d He turned to Elith and his voice grew hard again. \u201cMy joy doesn't alter the fact that we have a <i>major</i> problem and -\u201d He leveled an accusing finger at Elith \u201c- It's <i>your</i> doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Elith had no idea why this mage had turned his wrath on her. She'd performed a miracle. Hadn't she??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnus lowered his finger and sighed. \u201cYou didn't know. Doesn't matter now. It's done and we have to deal with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Deal with what</i>? She looked at Rufus and saw understanding begin to gleam in his face. <i>Wish I understood</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnus pointed to a chair and Elith obediently sat. The wizard pulled another chair close to her. \u201cDo you think you're the first one to use fairy dust to revive a human? We \u2013 I mean, we senior wizards and the elite of the Fairy Parliament \u2013 Have known for hundreds of years the dust could return a recently deceased human to life. We've all taken a vow to keep that knowledge secret. The world must never learn what your pixie dust can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElith's head was swimming in a hundred different directions. \u201cI \u2026 But why???\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe I understand,\u201d said Rufus from the bed, where he still sat next to Lorene. \u201cIf humans knew what fairy dust could do, they'd never leave the fairies alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d agreed Magnus. \u201cPeople would stop at nothing to get their hands on the stuff. They would rob, kill, torture, enslave, and do even worse to fairies. And after they obtained the precious powder, they'd try to take it from each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElith swallowed the lump rising in her throat. Magnus is right. The ingredients and process that went into fairy dust were a closely guarded secret. Fairy Parliament leaders doled it out, but there was never enough to fill the need. <i>No fairy would ever have a moment's peace or safety if word got out</i>. War would erupt between humans and fairies. A war the humans would surely win. If nothing else, their violent, selfish natures gave them a tremendous advantage over idyllic, peaceful fairies. <i>And then the humans will wage war against each other</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the wolf-creature entered the hut. \u201cAll the mourners have gone home,\u201d he told Magnus.\u201d He seemed to notice Elith for the first time. \u201cWell, hell-o-o-o, Sweetie. I'm Lupus.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, he was a wolf all right. His eyes roved up and down her slender body. She could <i>feel</i> him peel off her green, figure-hugging dress in his mind. She turned away uncomfortably. <i>Has to be tight and short. Who could fly with yards of material billowing around her</i>?? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStow it, Lupus,\u201d ordered Magnus sharply. \u201cWe've got more important things to discuss than your animal urges.\u201d Lupus gave Elith one last leer, then tore his eyes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnus moved his chair near the bed and took Lorene's hand. \u201cMy dear, I am so sorry, but you cannot stay here. No one must ever know of your resurrection. We'll hold a funeral and bury a dummy in your place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorene sat up. She looked around the room, at the solemn faces of Magnus, Rufus, Lupus, and Elith. <i>Did she scowl at me? Maybe she'd rather be dead</i>! \u201cWhat am I to do?\u201d asked Lorene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must go away,\u201d said Magnus. \u201cNow. Tonight.\u201d He turned his attention to Rufus. \u201cTake her to the farthermost  civilized place you can find. Far enough that no one from Magnous will ever run into her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRufus nodded; he clearly did not consider balking or even questioning his Father. He did appear a bit uncertain about something though. He addressed his next words to Elith. \u201cThis may be a long, arduous journey. I'll have to keep Lorene out of sight and deal with whatever danger presents itself. I could use some help. Will you go with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElith stood transfixed in shock. <i>Go with him</i>? She had to get home, to her family, to school, to her life. <i>But it</i> is <i>my fault he has to undertake this trek</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, I don't think it would be a good idea for her to follow you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" interrupted Lupus, \"must Rufus and Lorene go? And so quickly? There are several very large underground caves deep beneath us here in this forest, which are totally unknown to the people of Magnous and the entrance to which is well-hidden in a small grove about half a day's walk from here.

Rufus and Lorene could hide in these caves for at least a few days or weeks while we consider other possible solutions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElith studied the werewolf quietly. <i>Incredible how intelligent a lycan can be,</i> she thought. <i>And discounting the monstrous features, this creature could actually be as good-looking as Rufus.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course!\" exclaimed the old wizard. \"How could I have forgotten that!

They came in \u2013 I didn't hear them because of the river - and started going through my things. I yelled, `Hey!' and ran toward them. Burris had one of my brass candlesticks in his hand and swung without thinking.\u201d She rubbed the side of her face, at the temple and below the ear. \u201cThat's all I remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I bet he swung without thinking,\u201d said Lupus, his voice a bit closer to normal. \u201cHe's never thought in his whole life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFather, we have to <i>do</i> something,\u201d said Rufus earnestly. \u201cBraxton and Burris have been bad news since they could walk. The next person they kill will <i>stay</i> dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElith watched this exchange in silence. <i>None of this is getting me home</i>. Rufus stood up and started pacing the floor, his fists clenching and unclenching, which had the effect of emphasizing the muscles in his arms. <i>Maybe staying here wouldn't be so bad</i>. But her parents \u2026 <i>They'll be frantic. I have to get a message to them, whether Magnus likes it or not</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe <i>will</i> do something,\u201d Magnus assured Rufus and Lupus. \u201cBut our priority is getting Lorene out of sight.\u201d He looked at Elith. With a sigh, he said, \u201cAnd, I suppose, getting you home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir, can you simply send a message to my village?\u201d asked Elith. \u201cI can fly home once I get a few hours sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRufus came to an abrupt halt in his pacing. \u201cHey, I thought you said you don't need sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh ...\u201d Elith felt her face flush red. \u201cI \u2026 We \u2026 Don't need <i>much</i> sleep.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnus narrowed his eyes; he obviously knew better. Thankfully, he didn't pursue the matter, saying only, \u201cA detailed message requires a lot of energy. Any wizard, or even a sensitive layman, in the area will know we communicated with the Fairy Parliament, and might wonder why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nothing for it, then. I'll have to let them take me home</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever,\u201d continued Magnus, \u201csending <i>emotions</i> uses only a niggardly* pinch of magic. We can tell the Fairy Parliament, `All is well,' and hope they realize we're talking about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, please.\u201d Elith felt herself smile for the first time since she realized she was lost. <i>Daddy's probably got every fairy in the village searching</i>. \u201cThey'll know it's me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee to it, Rufus,\u201d Magnus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRufus told Elith to stand next to him. \u201cSometimes the magic seems to reach out and copy the essence of anyone nearby. If that happens, it'll confirm you're safe.\u201d He held his hands in front of his face and whispered something too low for Elith to hear. He raised, lowered, and extended his hands in a complex pattern. Elith felt \u2026 She felt something she didn't have words to describe. <i>Warm?? Not exactly. Mellow?? Sort of, but pumped up at the same time</i>.** The feeling fled, but Elith fancied she could sense an afterglow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRufus smiled somewhat sheepishly. \u201cSenior Wizards, like Magnus, can communicate magically without all the gestures and theatrics.\u201d <i>Is he apologizing to me</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorene, apparently fully recovered, began packing clothes. \u201cSlow down, my dear,\u201d ordered Magnus. \u201cRemember, everyone thinks you died tonight. Take one change of clothes and whatever money you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy jewelry?\u201d she asked. \u201cBraxton and Burris didn't find it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnus frowned but before he could say anything, Lupus spoke up, \u201cIf any any one notices her valuables are gone, they'll assume the murderer took them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point,\u201d agreed Magnus. \u201cShe may need to sell anything of value, if she is to start a new life somewhere else.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLorene finished packing, looking very sad. <i>She's leaving her life behind</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo now, quickly,\u201d said Magnus to Lupus, Rufus, and Lorene. \u201cInvisibility spell or not, it's best to get Lorene hidden before daybreak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElith succeeded, barely, in holding back the tears welling in her eyes. She took Rufus' hand. \u201cThank you! If not for you, I'd still be sitting by the side of the road feeling sorry for myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's we who should be thanking you,\u201d said Rufus. \u201cYou've returned our dear friend to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye,\u201d agreed Lupus. He almost allowed his eyes to crawl over Elith's body again, but seemed to catch himself and looked only at her face. \u201cIf you ever need anything \u2013 Anything at all \u2013 We'll be there for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they left, Magnus yawned and slumped into a chair. \u201cYou may as well spend the night here.\u201d <i>What if the Flaxem Brothers come back</i>? As if reading her mind, the wizard went on, \u201cDon't worry; I'm staying too.\u201d Sarcastically, he added, \u201cUnlike fairies, old wizards need a full night's sleep.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I refuse to let political correctness inhibit me from using an appropriately descriptive word</font>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n** <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Perhaps Elith was searching for the word rapture</font>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

SWOOOOSH, wings feathered against her tiny shoulder and Elith was knocked over, landing hard, almost face first, thus causing her ripped wind to tear a little more than it was.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  \"AHHHH!\" She screeched, and the owl echoed something that sounded like a laugh, as he swooped for her again.  Elith, arms frantically moving, hands and fingers trying desperately to grab at anything stable, but no, too late.  The Owl hit hard against her tiny form again, again, and again.  Elith's lungs were heaving almost breathless, her mind stopped thinking, and she couldn't scream.  She realized that the giant owl was playing with her, taunting her, and was doing a good job of keeping her from going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears blotted her face; she could hear the owl leaping from tree to tree around her hiss-laughing in a teasing manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have never come here dear\" The owl said from the shadows!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElith managed to move her head which hurt much.  She tried to see the owl, but had no success.  The owl could see her.  Owls are known to see better in the dark then day, and that was his advantage.  As Elith was trying to get up for an escape, the owl would not let her.  He flew out of the corner of Elith's eye.  Sharp claws dug through the garment of her shirt and dug in her back.  Elith felt herself being pulled from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooooooo!\" Elith screamed.  She wasn't going to let this beast take her so easy. A hidden dagger at her belt was now in her hand and she swiped it upwards stabbing the wing of the owl.  The minute knife was no use braking upon impact, but it was enough to make him let go with a hiss of pain. To Elith, was more agony then she realized, because she fell at least 6 feet. Lucky for her she landed upon soft wet ground.  The owl was mad, angered at the pain he felt, and before Elith had any other chance at defense, attacked again with blinding speed.  Elith only had time to close her eyes.  Even though time was going by like it does all the time, to her, was now slow, for her life was about to end.  She could see the owl in her mind coming toward her.  Anytime now it would all be over, and so she feel to her knees to wait the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crack of bushes, and an unknown growl from behind Elith was made.  The growl was so load and intimidating that Elith from fear, sprawled to the ground without opining here eyes.  She was too afraid to.  'Did the owl miss her?  What was that mean sound?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hisssssssssssssssss!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeeeeerrrraahhhh!\"  Bushes were being torn apart.  The owl and the interrupter of Elith's death continued to wreck the air and the habitat around.  The yelps and growls from both intruders where terrifying to Elith, and she refused to look.  Then only silence lit the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" A menacing voice brawled from above Elith's tiny form, huddled knees to chest. \"You are ok now young one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElith opened her eyes, and the beast was revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" the beast repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"umskiiw\" was all she could muster as she shied away scared of the massive beast that had the body of a human and a head of something she never had seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what are you?\"  She managed to ask, tears still running down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am\u201d he paused\u201d I am a Reasoner.  I am half human, half tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElith tried to get up but pain bolted though her body and she passed out.

The mage was an old man named Magnus who studied alchemy and aspired to raise the soul-substance of all living things into a state of perfection, and Tigra was one of his very first successful experiments, albeit a partial success, because he was able to permanently raise the tiger's being into a semi-human state by feeding him waters of golden magic. (Another of Magnus' successful experiments, also a Reasoner, was a friendly werewolf named Fenric, who was originally just a wolf.) Tigra looked upon Magnus as his own father (and Fenric as a brother), and Magnus in turn treated them as his sons, teaching them the ways of humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently Tigra arrived at a keep in the forest and knocked at the door. It opened and another beast-man greeted the Reasoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tigra!\" said the other beast-man. \"What took you so long today?\" Then he noticed the fairy in his arms. \"And who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later, Fenric,\" answered Tigra. \"I think she needs healing, Is father back yet?\" </span></div></div>",

Long ago, people used to worship me, but they have forgotten me and this is the only patch of my land that remains. It won\u2019t be long until this little spot is gone. But what about you? What is a young fairy doing out all by herself?\u201d Elith found the spirit\u2019s vibrating voice to be very calming. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Elith said slowly. \"It\u2019s a long story.\u201d \u201cI have plenty of time,\u201d the spirit replied.

Elith stretched out her wings feeling the tight mussels ache. A small groan escaped Elith's lips before she stretched the wings again knowing that a moonlit night held no comforts for a lone fairy. At this Elith disputed whether flying would be the best course. There were danger's that came out at night that her mother had told her about, that Elith had only seen in her night mares. Having a feeling of the sudden realization of being lost and the sun setting ,the images of the beast ran through Elith's head, letting a small chill run down her spine.

Or fairy-mothers, who plainly just got ready for preparing the dinner for the family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the thought, Elith cringed.
