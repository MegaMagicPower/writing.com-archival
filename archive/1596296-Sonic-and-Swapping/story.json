Rouge had very good arm and leg straingth, Sonic's arms and legs seem more toned.  Finally Rouge could fly...<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to do that?\"  Sonic asked to again... no one.

Amy couldn't resist sneaking a peek at Sonic as he stripped off his jumpsuit, carefully maneuvering it around his bat wings to reveal his shapely figure. Sonic caught her looking and stretched, pushing his generous breasts outwards; he knew she had always been jealous of them, and he couldn't resist the chance to show them off. Midway through, though, he paused, confused; what was he doing, again? He was having sex with Amy, of course, but still... something seemed to be missing, somehow. He never got further along that line of thought, though, as Amy took advantage of his hesitation to pull him onto the bed with her. He landed on top of her in a flurry of giggles that continued throughout the night, eventually turning into shrieks of delight and moans of joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, Rouge smirked as she listened to the commotion. It sounded like they were having fun, sure, but she knew that Sonic wouldn't really be getting any tonight-- or ever. If he liked her body so much, he was welcome to it. In fact, Rouge was growing to like her new hedgehog body; she found she enjoyed the sensations it produced, and the extra speed was very welcome.

However, Shadow did not return it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch where you're going, faker!\" he spat and continued down the hall, astonishing Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" Rouge glanced down at herself. Ah, now that she has Sonic's body and speed, she must now be Shadow's rival instead of Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge looked over at the retreating Shadow as a sinister idea slipped into her head...</span></div></div>",

Sonic slid the rest of the sheets from his legs to reveil his lilith legs and lustful hips, along with the smooth sex he possessed between them. He then slid his legs over the edge of the bed and stood up. Looking over his shoulder Sonic watched as Amy continued to sleep. \"She sure is great in the sack.\" He chuckled to himself before looking around the room for his discarded jump-suit. Once he located it, Sonic sauntered over to it with a sway to his hips that Rouge normally used when she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Sonic was clothed he made his way back over to the window and opened it up enough for him to sneak out. \"Wish I could stay longer but I've got another new toy waiting for me at home.\" He told her with a grin, knowing his words would never reach her deeply slumbering mind. Once outside Sonic spread his wings and took to the sky, heading towards club Rouge.</span></div></div>",

She looked out her window just in time to get a glimpse of Amy flying away on her new wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm, where to next?\"</span></div></div>",

First all her toys just shrunk in her hands. The second thing was her little dress was getting tighter on her now 10 year old body. Back with 24 year old Vanilla the next change did get Vanilla attention as she shrank down to 20 years old. She lost some body fat and a bit of height, resulting in some roomyness in her clothing. Vanilla noticed it but decided to ignore for now and check up on Cream, who also was dealing with a problem. Cream had just grown another 4 years resulting in Cream growing taller and clothes getting smaller. Though her object of focas was her chest as she noticed her breast begin to grow in size about the size of blazes. Cream paniced at these sudden changes and ran to her mother. As two crash they both realize whats happening as another 3 years pass bewteen them making both 17. As Cream grows older getting taller breasts growing, and with Vanilla getting shorter breast just shrinking a little. The changes continue until Vanila is now a 6 year old buried in her clothes and Cream the size of her mother in tight clothing. They stay there aw struck for moments before.....</span></div></div>",

Sonic thought in wonder. He soon spotted the emerald's guardian Knuckles the Enchidna asleep on top said emerald. With a sly grin on his face Sonic flew down to the island and on top of the emerald. Sonic couldn't help but stare at Knuckles and think at how cute he looked when he was asleep. Deciding to have a little fun Sonic poked Knuckles cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey wakey, sleepy head.\" Sonic said teasingly. Since Knuckles eyes were closed and Sonic having Rouge's voice Knuckles just figured it was Rouge trying to get the emerald again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone bat-girl.\" Knuckles said while swatting away Sonic's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that anyway to treat your best friend?\" Sonic said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not my friend Rouge. You're not even my ally for that matter.\" Knuckles said starting to get annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who ever said I was Rouge?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can it not be--\" Knuckles stopped dead when he opened his eyes to instead of seeing Rouge he saw Sonic wearing Rouge's clothing and make-up. He jumped back so far he fell of the Master Emerald and landed on the ground with a loud thud. Sonic looked down on the ground and found Knuckles sprawled on the ground unconscious due to the fall. He jumped off and layed on Knuckles and put her head to his chest to see if he was still breathing: he was. Deciding on waking him he flicked nose a couple of times and it did the trick. Knuckles came back to consciousness to find Sonic right on top of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me!\" He yelled pushing Sonic off him with blush on his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well excuse me! Is that how you should talk to the person who saved you from a potential concussion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who caused me to fall in the first place!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph fine! I know when I'm not wanted!\" He said about to take-off but before he could even get 5 feet from the ground a strong hand grabbed his leg. He turned his head to see Knuckles holding his leg with a sorry look on his face. Hee lands on the ground and walks over to Knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic don't leave. Look I'm sorry about yelling at you, I'm just really surprised that you have Rouge's clothing, make-up and among 'other' things\" He said while staring at his chest.

He then sped off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, he was standing outside the Thorndyke Mansion. Quick as a flash, he ran up to his friend, Chris' room. He knew that both Chris and Tails would be in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue enough, as Sonic entered the room, he saw that both the Mobian fox and the human boy were standing at the table looking at one of Tails' new devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys!\" Sonic called out.

Since you are both into science, I thought you might want to be the first to try out the remote.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Sonic,\" said Tails. \"I find it hard to imagine that that remote is capable of all those things. It sounds more like one of Eggman's tricks, if you ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Tails,\" said Chris. \"What if it's not a trick? I for one would be amazed if it turned out to be genuine. Plus, I've always wondered what it would be like to be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails sighed. Then he said: \"Well, my studies of human culture and educational evolution might be easier to finish, if I could actually BE a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled!\" said Chris exitedly. \"Press the button, Sonic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" said Sonic, as he did as instructed.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the light from the remote faded, Chris blinked the stars out of his eyes. The flash had taken him by surprise, so he had all his focus on being able to see again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he could see again, the first thing he noticed was that Sonic, and the bedroom, seemed to be bigger. That gor Chris' attention right away; he was usually bigger than Sonic was. Could it be, that....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris got confirmation of this, when he looked down at himself. Exept, he wasn't exactly 'himself' anymore; instead of looking at his normal twelve-year-old human body, he was looking at a yellow-furred body, wearing only white gloves and red-and-white shoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt about it; he was now in Tails' body!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was further confirmed to Chris when he looked to his left and saw his own body looking at itself and it's hands, in surprise and curiosity. Chris was certain that meant that Tails was now inside his human body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging by your reactions, I'd say it worked, right?\" asked Sonic. Chris was startled; the shock of swapping bodies with Tails had almost caused him to forget that Sonic was there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" exclaimed Chris. That's when they discovered another surprising thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's an interesting development,\" said Tails in Chris' body. \"Appearently, we still kept our own voices when we swapped bodies. I'd surmise that it's some sort of safety protocol, so that we don't forget who's been swapped with who.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be,\" said Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was only partially listening. He was more occupied with the fact, that he had just heard Tails' voice coming out of his own body. In fact, this whole situation was just incredibly surreal to him! He snapped out of it when Tails turned his -Chris'- eyes towards him and asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you alright? You seem so quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" said Chris. \"I guess I was just weirded out a bit over the fact that that funny remote that Sonic found actually worked. Well, that, and the fact that I'm currently in your body, Tails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know exactly what you mean,\" said Tails. \"This is strange for me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, guys,\" said Sonic. \"What's it like to be each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels really weird,\" said Chris, as he thoroughly looked at Tails' body, that he now inhabited. \"For one thing, Tails' body is much smaller than my own, so I'm not as tall as I'm used to. Also, I'm not really comfortable having all of this fur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that, Chris used Tails' body's hands to better feel his new body. \"It feels really itchy and hot at the same time.\" Chris looked behind him, at his two new tails. \"These tails are also hard to get used to. It's almost like having two hyper-mobile arms attached to my butt. Plus, I'm having difficulties actually moving them the way I want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed; the tails were clearly moving around haphazardly. It didn't look like Chris had much control over how to move them around properly. This was further demonstrated, when one of the tails hit Chris in the face as he looked at them, causing a few giggles from Sonic and Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the laughs, Chris continued: \"Finally, I'm not quite comfortable with only wearing these shoes and gloves.\" Blushing slightly, Chris attempted to cover as much of his -Tails'- body as possible, with his -Tails'- arms. \"I feel so naked in this body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really don't have to, Chris,\" said Tails. \"It's quite normal for us male Mobians to only wear that much. Everything else is covered up by the fur.\" Tails looked down at Chris' body, which he mow occupied, before he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's somewhat the opposite with me, but no less weird. I'm not used to being so tall, I feel cold without my fur, and it feels weird not having my tails anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails gently tugged on Chris' shirt. \"Another strange thing for me, is that I have to wear so many clothes. I didn't need to do that in my regular body. It's weird to have to wear them, in place of my fur.\" Tails sighed. \"No offence, Chris, but being a human is weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken,\" replied Chris. \"I'm in the same position as you, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tails!\" exclaimed Sonic. \"I just remembered; since you are now in Chris' body, you've actually gotten older! You are only eight years old, while Chris is twelve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're right!\" said Tails. \"Wow! Talk about a growth spurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, man!\" said Chris. \"So not only am I in Tails' body, but I got younger too! I'm not sure if this is what's meant by 'a second childhood'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny further talking was interrupted by the television. It showed several robots on a rampage downtown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eggman never gives up, does he?\" smirked Sonic. \"Don't worry; I'll turn those robots into spare parts, before you can say 'hedgehog'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Sonic?\" asked Tails quickly. \"Would you mind leaving the remote here? It's not that I doubt your skills, but I don't want the remote to break thanks to a lucky shot. It's the only thing that can swap me and Chris back to our own bodies, so I'd really like for it to be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point buddy,\" admitted Sonic. \"We can't have that you guys get stuck in each others bodies permanently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic placed the remote on the table. A quarter of a second later, he had wooshed out to scrap the robots, leaving the body-swapped friends alone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do now?\" asked Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, we should make sure that the remote is safely locked away,\" answered Tails. \"We don't want anything to happen to it, like I said. Not until we need to swap back, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails walked over to the table, but he stumbled before he got there and fell down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails! Are you okay?\" Chris cried out in alarm. He ran over to Tails, only to fall down himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" said Tails. \"But it appears that we both have problems balancing in our new bodies. I'm not used to walking without having my tails and you're not used to walking with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping each other out, the body-swapped buddies eventually got their balancing acts sorted out; at least enough for Tails to be able to safely lock the remote inside a secret vault that he had installed for just such an emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the remote secure, Tails looked back at Chris and said: \"So, how is it going getting used to my tails?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's moving forward,\" replied Chris, as he moved his new tails around. \"It's still a weird feeling to even have them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know,\" said Tails. \"It's also quite a learning experience for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Learning?!? Oh my gosh!!!\" exclaimed Chris, looking at the watch on the wall. \"I almost forgot; I'm late for school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was about to hurry out the door when Tails stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, Chris!\" said Tails. \"You're in my body for the moment, remember? You just can't go to school as you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I need to be there!\" complained Chris. \"I've never taken a sick day in my life and I don't want to take one now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess there's only one thing to do,\" said Tails. \"Since I'm currently in your body, that means that I'll have to go to school instead of you; or should that be AS you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a good idea,\" said Chris. \"You said yourself that you didn't feel comfortable being me. If you do something odd, my classmates might get suspicious. Your voice might even give it away! Besides, you also said that the X-Tornado needs a tune-up, and no one knows that plane better than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Chris. I've got everything under control,\" reassured Tails. \"If anyone should notice that 'your' voice sounds different, I'll just tell them that I have the beginnings of a cold. That will also explain any oddities that I might do in your body, since having a cold can hamper one's concentration. And I still want to study human culture. And the best way to do that, is for me to go to a school. And as far as the X-Tornado is concerned...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a piece of paper and a pencil, Tails quickly scribbled something down. Handing the paper over to Chris, Tails said: \"Just follow these instructions and it'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking first at the instructions and then at Tails, in his body, Chris sighed: \"Okay, Tails. You can go to my school in my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" cheered Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" added Chris, \"I don't want you to do anything that will make it seem like you aren't me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise,\" answered Tails. \"Now, where's all of your school stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there,\" said Chris and pointed at his backpack in the corner. \"It's a good thing that I packed everything before I went up here, including the gym clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Otherwise you... or should that be 'I'... would be even more late,\" said Tails, as he put on Chris' backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, see you after school!\" called Tails, as he hurried downstairs. As soon as Tails had disappeared with his new body, Chris turned his attention to the note that Tails had written for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well,' thought Chris, 'I'd better go down to the garage and tune-up the X-Tornado. But first...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to his closet, Chris took out a pair of shorts and a T-shirt that he had outgrown in his normal body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No offence, Tails, but I just can't stand walking around almost naked, even in your body.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had to use a pair of scissors to cut a hole for Tails' body's tails to go through. Once that was done, Chris put on the clothes, that fit Tails' body perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit more comfortable, Chris grabbed the instructions and walked down to the garage to start the work on the X-Tornado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tails was sitting on the bus, on the way to Chris' school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one of them should we follow?</span></div></div>",

The two sped out of the house at sonic speed, something Sonic was glad to still have.  If Sonic lost his speed as well as his clothes and identity as a male, he'd have to swap back.  His runing style was still the same but only girlier.  Tails still used his tails to move himself forward.  Luckily when at this speed Mina's hair was flowing back far enough not to get cught in the tails.  Finally, the duo arived at Amy's house.<br>\r\n*knock knock*<br>\r\n\"Hello\" Amy poped out from behind the door a couple seconds later.  \"Oh hey Sonic.  Hi Tails.

You look pretty good yourself.\"  The two had reserved a table and conversated for a while.  Rouge ordered a stake and Sonic just had a salad.

His hips expanded and his waist thinned out, giving him an hourglass figure. Not to mentioned his bum grew a bit bigger as well. His chest then inflated to DD cups almost the same size as Rouge's. His penis then converted itself into a vagina. His face became more feminine and rounder with a smaller nose and fuller eyelashes. His quills grew longer and flow downward and became more hairlike, and he grew some bangs on the top his hand. Finally, his fur became a light blue color. He was now a she, and was in total shock and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.\" she said in her new female voice. Then, clothes started to materialize on her body starting with a white bra and panties, and then a pink tank top and tight blue jeans. Lastly, new shoes that were similar to her old ones but for woman. Time then started to move once again. She may have changed, but was she really in a different dimension.

Sonic collided with rouge, except he didn't! Sonic phazed into Rouge, causing her to jolt and pass out! Almost immediately, sonic took control of the bat's body and got up. \"Wow...

He had been talking to Chris, then there had been a bright flash and the next thing he knew, he was laying on the floor. For some reason, he felt cold too<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails sat up, rubbing his gloved hand against his head, to ease the pain of hitting the floor a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second... A 'gloved' hand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat woke Tails up right away. He'd never worn gloves before, so why was he wearing them now? Or was he just imagining things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes to look. Well, he wasn't imagining things; he really was wearing a pair of white gloves with gray fasteners on his hands! The gloves seemed very familliar too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he realized why they looked familliar; these were Chris' gloves! But how come he was wearing them and not Chris? It didn't make...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails' train of thought was interrupted, when he remembered how he had felt cold when he woke up. Coupled with the fact that he was wearing Chris' gloves, there could only be one conclusion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping that he was wrong for once, Tails slowly moved his gaze to look down at himself. Unfortunately, Tails was rarely wrong, and this time was no exeption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails could do nothing but stare at himself in shock. HE WAS COMPLETLY NAKED!!! Well, almost. Apart from the gloves, the only articles of clothing on him, was a pair of white socks, also with gray fasteners, and a pair of red sneakers with white toes and gray soles. Other than that, he was buck-naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails had indeed been right; he was wearing all of Chris' clothes! Quickly standing up, Tails tried to cover as much of his semi-naked body as possible with his hands, blushing bright crimson in embarrasment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waaaahhhh!!!\" This outcry of shock sounded right next to Tails. He quickly turned around to see what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris had woken up, too, and it was him that had let out that cry of shock. Tails couldn't blame him. After all, Chris was currently wearing HIS clothes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red short-sleaved shirt with white sleaves, a yellow collar, a yellow regtangle on the end of each of the sleaves and one on the front of the shirt; the long-sleaved dark-blue undershirt, with a turquise stripe running down the middle of each sleave; blue jeans with a turquise stripe above each of the knees; a green belt hanging off the edge of the jeans; white socks; and a pair of stylish blue and yellow shoes with gray soles and a turquise stripe running down the middle of the toes. All of it Tails' and currently worn by Chris!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was just standing there like a statue and judging by the expression on his face, he was as shocked as Tails was. Turning his head towards Tails, Chris stuttered: \"T-Tails! What's g-going on? Wh-why am I wearing your c-clothes? And how c-come you're w-wearing mine?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I h-have no idea, Chris!\" stuttered Tails in reply, still blushing heavily and trying to cover as much of his body with his hands. \"All I know is that there was a flash, and then I woke up wearing your clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's what happened to me, too,\" said Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat neither of them knew, was that they were in fact wearing their normal clothes all along and that Sonic, currently giggling like crazy outside the window, had swapped their perceptions on whose clothes belonged to whom with a special remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing his laugther, Sonic thought: 'This remote is amazing! Even though Tails and Chris are wearing their regular clothes, this remote has made them think that they are actually wearing each others! This is almost too funny! I can have loads of fun with this thing!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping his giggles, Sonic looked in the window again and thought: 'I wonder how those two will react next...'</span></div></div>",

'How can Chris possibly handle walking around, just wearing gloves, socks and sneakers? It doesn't make any sense to me!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at his near-naked body, Tails continued his train of thought. 'I also don't understand how Sonic can wear only this much. I guess he and Chris have one more thing in common.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally realizing the futility of trying to cover himself with just his hands, Tails instead focused on Chris' clothes, that he currently wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe it's just because I'm not used to wearing them, but it feels so weird to wear gloves,' thought Tails, as he gently tugged on Chris' gloves. 'It's like my hands are imprisoned, or something like that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'His socks and sneakers aren't much better,' he thought, as he lifted one of his feet to get a better look at the sock and the sneaker. 'They feel so uncomfortable in comparison to my regular socks and shoes. Of course, it doesn't make it better, that that, and the gloves, is the ONLY clothes that he wears!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing again, Tails once more tried, in vain, to cover himself as much as he could with his hands. 'I'd much prefer to wear my own clothes, instead of these!' Tails sighed. 'At least I'm not the only one who's uncomfortable right now,' thought Tails, at he shifted his eyes from himself, and over to Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed; Chris was also feeling very uncomfortable at the moment, but for the exact opposite reason. Unlike Tails, who was uncomfortable being almost naked, Chris was uncomfortable wearing much more clothing than he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I just don't get it!' thought Chris, as he too fidgeted nervously. 'How can Tails possibly move around wearing all of this? I don't know how he can stand it!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was looking down at himself, to better look at Tails' clothes, all of which he was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not used to wearing so many clothes; all I've ever needed was my gloves and my sneakers,' thought Chris, as he gently tugged on Tails' clothes. 'So it feels really strange to me, to wear all of this.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Take this shirt, for instance,' thought Chris, as he carefully pulled on Tails' shirt to better look at it. 'It feels very stuffy and constricting on my torso. I find it really uncomfortable, to be honest.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's the same thing with the jeans,' thought Chris, as he gently tugged on Tails' jeans too. 'They feel really weird to wear. They cover up my legs completely; I feel like I can barely move with them on!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Finally; there's the shoes,' he thought, as he lifted one foot to look at the shoe on it. 'They aren't nearly as comfortable as my own sneakers. These shoes are much too stiff for my liking.' Chris sighed. 'I don't get how Tails can possibly handle wearing all these clothes every day. I'd much prefer to just wear my gloves, socks and sneakers.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looked over at Tails and saw that he was looking at him. He'd obviously checked out Chris' clothes, just like he himself had checked out Tails' clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" started Tails, \"do you want to swap our clothes back now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please,\" answered Chris, as he began removing Tails' over- and under-shirts from his body. \"No offence, but I really don't want to wear your clothes for much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offence taken,\" said Tails, as he took off Chris' sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo further words were spoken between them, until Chris had removed Tails' jeans. That was when they discovered that Chris was also wearing Tails' underwear! After a bit of grossing out, they went back to the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had removed all of the clothes, leaving them both fully in the nude, they handed the clothes over to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was the first to get re-dressed, since he only had to put on his socks, sneakers and gloves. Although he was now nearly naked, he didn't mind since he thought that this was how he normally dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a bit longer for Tails, since he had many more articles of clothing to put on. Naturally, he started with the underwear. Because of his two tails, he couldn't wear the tighty-whities like they should, but he managed to do it by letting the back edge of the underpants stop right as they touched the underside of his tails. This caused the underpants to be a little loose on him, but he still managed to get them to fit, without sliding off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came to the long-sleaved undershirt, Tails actually had to roll up the sleaves slightly to fit his arms through them. Plus; since the undershirt was human-sized, it was so big on Tails' body, that the back of the undershirt was actually hanging over the base of his tails, showing off his underwear in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the jeans. Tails not only had to roll up the legs of the jeans in order to wear them, but he also had to put both of his tails through the space between the belt and the jeans, so as not to have them slide off of him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails then put on the short-sleaved shirt. It was the same deal as with the undershirt, exept for the fact that he didn't have to roll up the sleaves this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was only the footwear left. The socks and shoes was easy for Tails to put on. When that was done, Tails turned towards Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is much better, don't you think?\" Tails asked, as he smoothed out a wrinkle in 'his' shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is, Tails,\" replied Chris, as he adjusted 'his' gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them was aware that they were actually wearing each others clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while Sonic was in silent hysterics right outside the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Sonic do next?</span></div></div>",
