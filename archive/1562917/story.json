            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Felix cleaned his master's crown, he thought about how he had ended up in the mess he was in now. As long as Felix remembered he had always been a slave. Well, he was a slave since he was five, but he didn't remember his life before that time. He couldn't remember his parents, but he had always been told that they had sold him into slavery for the money. Felix wanted to believe that was untrue, but he really wasn't sure. He had seen his master do many cruel things and it was possible that his parents sold him, no matter how much he didn't want to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was ten year old now, and he had seen many terrible things while the lord was his master and Felix had learned one important thing, the lord was an evil man. Some might say that people could never truly be evil, but Felix knew that people who thought that were wrong. The lord was an evil man, there was nothing that was remotely good in his heart, just blackness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William wasn't a king, but he ruled over his land like one. He sustained his power through both mental and physical abuse. He was a tyrant who sought nothing but power over all that he ruled, and he was obsessed with gaining more. Felix hated the Lord and he wished he could do something about it. The man deserved nothing but punishment for his sins, yet no one was brave enough to stand up to him and the Lord's Generals were just like him and were loyal to their Lord. Felix was just a ten year slave boy and he could not stand up to the tyrant. He didn't have the power or the will to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Felix never thought of rising up against the Lord, it didn't mean he never thought of escaping. Felix had many plans of escaping, but he could not act upon them yet, because either he was not old enough or he was not strong enough to do so. He had always dreamed of what it would be like to be free and he knew that the first thing he would do is to try and find his family and find the truth about why he had become a slave. He had many dreams about what his family was like, but he knew none of it was probably true. He knew that deep inside there was a memory of his family, but he couldn't remember those memories no matter how much he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave! Slave!\" Lord William yelled. Felix didn't look up, because he was in one of his day dreams once again as he cleaned his Lord's crown. Suddenly, Felix felt a hand smack against his face and he nearly fell out of the chair due to the surprise and force. \"Pay attention when I call you, slave!\" Lord William yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Master, but I didn't know you were speaking to me. You call all us slaves slaves and I didn't know it was...\" Felix tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I ask for an excuse, slave?\" Lord William questioned. Lord William took the crown from Felix and placed it on his head own head. \"Come, slave, I have a another job for you to do as well as all the other tasks you are to have,\" Lord William told Felix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix followed his master through the castle and into the dark prison chambers. There they saw a large wooden cage being rolled into a cell. The cage was about the size of something used to transport an elephant or some other large animal. The cage was shaking and the creature inside was definitely no elephant from the shrieks it caused. \"This creature was caught by General Ethan. The creature will remain here until it properly learns that I'm its true master. Once it understands that, I will be in control of a very powerful creature,\" Lord William explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is my task, Master?\" Felix asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are to take care of this creature by feeding it and cleaning after it. It will be a simple enough task, because the creature will be chained down. As long as you keep out of range it can not harm you,\" Lord William stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the creature, Master?\" Felix asked.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What else could the giant and powerful creature be?\" Lord William asked, \"It's a dragon of course. There's nothing more powerful or fearsome as a dragon. Once it is full grown and knows who its matters is, it will help me take over more countries and I will rule more.\" Lord William had a sadistic smile and an evil gleam in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William was an evil and powerful man who ruled his subjects wrongly. With a dragon under his control, Lord William would be able to use the dragon for wicked deeds and keeping his slaves and subjects under control, and... <i>\"Wait, did he say till the dragon grows up?\"</i> Felix suddenly questioned, <i>\"The dragon isn't grown up yet?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, did you say that the dragon isn't grown up yet?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William snapped out of his daze since he was dreaming of the future on the back of a dragon taking over more land. \"General Ethan says that the dragon is only a baby, but I find that hard to believe when it is already almost as big as the cage its in,\" Lord William told Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Felix could hear the screeches of the dragon in the cell. It sounded like it came from an infant, but the sound was deeper due to the sear size of the creature. Felix became very frightened as he heard the sounds of the dragon and the sounds of the soldiers yelling at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be happy we found it and decided to take it in,\" Lord William commented, \"General Ethan said that he found it alone in the mountains. It probably would have died if we hadn't taken it in.\" However, Lord William didn't sound too concerned, because he only saw the dragon as a tool he could use, not a living thing. Felix knew that the guards were going to torture the dragon and punish it when it didn't do what they wanted it to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Doesn't Lord William realize that torturing such a beast would only anger it and cause it to attack him when its older?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"Unless, it truly is just an infant. If that's true than it's possible that...\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix's train of thought was suddenly cut off when the soldiers exited the cell. Felix noticed that one of the soldier's chest plate had four claw marks on it. The gashes in the metal plate were large, but luckily for the soldier it didn't make it to the skin. Felix gulped when he saw the slash marks on the metal plate. <i>\"If the dragon can do that? How am I supposed to do my job without getting killed!\"</i> Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've chained it up,\" Lord William said, \"The meat and water are down here. Go a head and feed it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-without a-any armor?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's chained up, just keep it out of it's range and you'll be safe,\" Lord William said. However, Lord William didn't sound seem concerned about Felix's safety, because he knew that he could just get another slave to do it if Felix should die. Before Felix could say anything, Lord William left and one of the guards pushed a cart to Felix. The cart was had a large pile of food and a large bowl of water set on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix sighed and pushed the cart to the cell door while another guard started unlocking it. Felix's whole body shook while he waited to see the horrifyingly fearsome and large beast in the cell. The door opened and Felix pushed the cart in. The cell was large, but it was a horrid and dreadful place to live in. The walls and floors were made of stone and concrete and they hadn't been cleaned in years. Then again, it was a prison and wasn't supposed to be cleanly. There were no windows except the barred opening on the top a hundred feet above. The place was only lite up by the ceiling window and the torches around the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Felix long to see the dragon in the room. The dragon was easily close to twenty feet tall and between two or three times that length because of the neck and the tail. Judging from the size proportions of the head and the legs to the body, the dragon seemed like it was still an infant even though it was close to twenty feet tall.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon had...</span></div></div>",

Make sure you do what I told you by tomorrow, or I'll make you regret it!\" With these words the Lord and his men went out of the cell, the doors of which they closed with a loud clang, leaving Felix and the creature inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had never seen such a large and frightening creature before with his own eyes. He shook with terror when the dragon stared at him. But then he noticed that somehow the eyes did not look menacing. They looked... gentle. Felix was quietly surprised, but also somewhat relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery carefully he made a small, quiet step towards the dragon, just to have a closer look. He noticed something most unusual. <i>Every scale on the dragon's body had some strange symbols or writings on it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix wondered: what did those symbols and writings say? Could they be spells, maybe? And where did those symbols and writings come from? Did someone engrave them on the scales? If so, it must have been a lot of extremely hard work. And why would anyone want to do such a thing anyway? But if it wasn't someone who engraved them on the scales, then what else could explain the presence of all those symbols on them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was thinking of all this, when suddenly the dragon's head came very close to Felix, and <i>the dragon licked him!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stumbled back several steps with shock, wiping the dragon's saliva off his face. As he did so, he felt a strange, tingling sensation on his skin. He had heard some people say that dragon saliva is supposed to be extremely magical. But if so, what sort of magic would it be? What sort of effect would it have on him, harmful or beneficial?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he wasn't hurting. In fact the sensation was actually mildly pleasant. In any case, he was greatly relieved that the dragon viewed him as a friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix summoned his courage and came real close to the dragon. The dragon rubbed his head gently against Felix's face!</span></div></div>",

There was one in the middle of the dragons forehead just between the eye that interested Felix a lot it was no different but something about it seemed alluring. It had wings but nothing could be said about them as in this room there is no space to allow them to stretch, Felix imagined that they would be a spectacle to behold. And now he noticed the tail it was long a stream line with the engraved scales shining all the way down. 'it must be 15 feet long at least' he thought and at the end was a strong, sharp and piercing arrow head tip that looked deadly in its own right. 'Wow' thought Felix \"I'm just glad you view me as a friend\" he said, wondering if it could talk back to him, but this time there was no response at all. <br>\r\nThree sharp bangs on the door and a rough voice yelled \"you still alive slave? Hope then beast hasnt thought you were it's food! Hahaha\". Felix placed the food and water at the dragons head, reached to stroke it but thought better of that idea and said \"ill be back later, hopefully we have more of a talk then\" with a smile he left and returned to his other duties. </span></div></div>",

The moment that he stepped inside, a splitting roar filled his ears, forcing him to drop his hands from the cart in order to cover them. The chains echoed through the room as they clattered about, the dragon snarling and snapping towards him. Its claws lurched towards him, bound away, but still causing his heart to race as he saw them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to try to run, but the look of the guard wasn't that much more appealing when he knew that a harsh punishment was waiting if he didn't do it. It took a few seconds, but he nervously threw a large piece food at the dragon before backing away to the wall, pressed back against it. It continued shouting and reaching at him, ignoring the food to thrash about and try to reach him. He couldn't do anything but hold still in the wall, the dragon only slowly quieting down as it exhausted itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as it started to move less, it was still quiet violent, and as Felix started to move back to the cart, he hesitated going anywhere near the dragon as he did his task. The food was all thrown out carelessly, although the creature paid little attention to it. When it was time to place down the bowl of water, he only pushed it to the edge of where he though the dragon could reach, quickly running away soon after. He gave a breath of relief as his job was done, slowly turning to move away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave a shout as he felt something slam hard into his back, pushing him to the ground. He landed violently against the cart, tipping it over as the dragon's voice was back to its full volume. He didn't dare to look back again, dragging himself back up and pulling the cart along the ground, too worried and hoping that nothing was broken as he stumbled out.</span></div></div>",

Though it wasn't fatal, the feel of his clothing rubbing against the wounds was more than enough of the reminder of his encounter with the beast the previous day. He could barely manage to walk properly, and though he had a rough time stumbling out, it was all he could do to try to stand the pain for long enough to return the cart and say that he had finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was less than pleasant as well. Despite his injuries, he was expected to do his other usual duties. Fortunately for him, they weren't too straining, but it was still difficult to clean his master's clothing or even run from room to room with the constant reminder of his encounter burning his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed as he slowly rubbed his fingers over the wounds. At least they wasn't bleeding at that point, but though the dragon didn't actively try to scratch him, it was quite clear that its scales had managed to do that much. He did his best to try to fall asleep laying on his front side, uncomfortably shifting as he closed his eyes. It was difficult to tell how long it would be before he would be able to rest again with the wounds still fresh on his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when he was asleep, it did nothing to relieve him. In the dark, every slight light reminded him of the dragon's eyes staring at him, of its scales flashing as they rushed towards him the moment he turned away. As his eyes closed, his ears made the sensations worse, every stray breeze reminding him of the dragon's growl, of its heavy breathing when he was close to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dreams were haunted by those sounds even as he did his best to shut everything out. No matter where he ran, he always seemed to stumble into the beast, its ferocity never giving him a break, pushing and throwing him around so easily even as he tried to escape. Even as he tried to run, a claw always managed to grab onto him, to drag him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible to get away. And despite it all, he didn't know why he could even stand it. The dragon was toying with him, but he still was in one piece. He tried to figure out why he would be, even his mouth opening to ask. \"Why are you-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sentence never finished. He was thrown too quickly, the dragon's maw opening as he found himself tumbling towards it, teeth bared towards him as it opened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, slave!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped as he rolled over, a sharp stinging on his back dragging him out of his dream and back into reality as he looked up. One of the men was already glaring at Felix, looking as if he'd be punished if he didn't quickly get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's morning. You're to continue to feed the dragon right after sunrise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But... It just injured-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your own mistake got you your injury. It's no excuse to stop doing your job. Or would you prefer we throw your meals to the dragon instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he grimaced a bit as he tried to stand, Felix just quietly nodded, his head held down as he quietly walked towards the prison. He did his best to try to keep himself steady, but the pain combined with his worry did little to relieve him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wordlessly reached the cart, and as he tried to ask for it, his throat seemed far too dry to ask for it. When he received it, he got a better look at what he was giving, his mind oddly registering the fact that most of its food was meat, and was a lot better than what the slaves would get. It felt a bit odd for him to know that an untamed treatment might be getting better treatment than most people in the castle got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he took the cart and reached the cell's door, he swallowed. Although he didn't know if it was safe, there didn't seem to be much of an alternative. However, he kept his eyes open this time around, determined not to end up with another injury. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take too long for Felix to find the elephant sized dragon ruby colored dragon, well it was the height of an elephant, but much longer because of the tail and neck. Felix expected the dragon to be on all fours, pacing furiously and growling and roaring at him, but the dragon was just lying on the ground. It was lying on his stomach in a position that roughly looked like a C with it's head looking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix hoped that the dragon was sleeping and that he'd be able to sneak up to the dragon and just leave the meat, but when the door slammed, the dragon turned its head around. The hard scales on the ground scratched the floor as it dragged it's neck till it looked straight at Felix. Felix became frightened once more and didn't move a muscle for the longest time. The dragon just stared at Felix with hatred deep in it's angry eyes. However, the hate wasn't as ferocious as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix began to wonder why the dragon didn't seem to hate him as much as before. Felix looked around the cell, it took much effort tear his eyes away from the dangerous and savage dragon, but when he was able to do so, he saw that all the meat he threw around was still on the ground and the water bowl was still full. <i>\"It never ate or drank yesterday. It's weak and exhausted. It probably wasted all it's energy acting so savagely and since it didn't eat or drink anything...\"</i> Felix thought to himself, <i>\"This is better for me anyway. It might be too weak to attack me. I might not be injured this time. I still better keep an eye on it, though.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix slowly pushed the cart closer and the dragon growled as Felix approached. The dragon curled its lips upward and barred its teeth as it growled. The growl was weak, but its teeth still scared Felix. Felix saw the line on the ground which was the farthest the dragon could reach. Felix stayed over his side of the line and set the meat over the line. Felix kept his eyes on the dragon, but the dragon didn't make a move, it just growled a few yards behind the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Felix finished with the pile, he backed away from the dragon with the cart. Felix didn't dare turn his back to the dragon. As Felix backed away. The dragon's eyes focused on the meat and tried to push itself up, but it didn't have the strength and just fell back on its stomach with a grunt. The dragon stretched it's neck as far as it could, but it wasn't close enough to the line to just stretch its head and get the meat. It was still too far away. The dragon stuck out its long snake tongue, but still couldn't reach the meat. The dragon struggled, but still couldn't reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stopped in his tracks and watched the dragon struggling. The dragon, though much larger than himself, looked so weak and helpless. Even though the dragon had tried to kill him, Felix still felt a little sorry for it. <i>\"It shouldn't have worn itself out. It's its fault, not mine,\"</i> Felix told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's not what Lord William would think. If the dragon dies, he'll blame me and I'll be sent to death,\"</i> Felix argued with himself. He knew he was right. Lord William wouldn't care if it was the dragon that staved itself. He'd still blame Felix and being a slave, Felix had no rights and could be put to death with the snap of a finger. \"Shit!\" Felix cursed under his breath before leaving the cart and walking towards the pile of meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of the dragon's tongue was still two feet away from the meat and it was too focused on the meat to notice Felix. However, when Felix picked up the first piece of meat, the dragon looked up at Felix with hatred again. Felix took a few steps to the tongue and crouched down holding out the meat for the tongue. The dragon only brought its tongue in its mouth again and growled at Felix. \"I know you hate me, just take the meat. I'm handing it to you,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon just looked past Felix and tried to reach the pile behind Felix, but still couldn't reach the pile.  Felix tried to place the meat on the dragon's tongue, but the tongue retracted once more and the dragon growled. \"What the hell it wrong with you?\" Felix growled back, \"Just take the meat or you're going to starve!\" The dragon stared at Felix for a long time and Felix threatened, \"You need my help to get fed, if you don't let me help you, you're going to starve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother emotion entered the dragon's eyes along with the hatred. The other emotion was a sort of sadness, a defeated and failure kind of look along with the hatred. The dragon stretched out its tongue and Felix was able to put the meat on the dragon's tongue. The tongue wrapped around the meat and pulled it in its mouth. The dragon chewed and growled with hatred as it did so. This process continued until the dragon finished all its food and Felix even picked up the meat from the other day to feed the dragon. The dragon seemed to both hate and love eating the meat Felix gave it. Felix couldn't understand why the beast would feel such a way. Felix was just glad he wasn't injured from the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon, Felix was ordered to feed the dragon once more. Felix got the cart ready and pushed it down into the dungeons. When he reached the right hallway, he could see soldiers run out of the cell from a distance. They shut the down and one man yelled, \"Is Lord William insane? We can't tame such a beast for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second man replied, \"Every creature his its breaking point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But were dealing with a fire dragon, here! Don't you realize what that it?\" The first man questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll be able to tame an infant dragon,\" the second man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But fire dragons are the most ferocious of the dragons. They are the dragon equivalent to Spartans!\" the first man argued, \"Fire dragon love war and bloodshed and they are taught to never break. They kill or abandon the weaklings, even it it were their own child. Though this is an infant, it will never give in or break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix didn't here the rest of the conversation, because by then, they had walked past him and were far enough down the hall. One of the guards by the door smiled sadistically and informed Felix, \"The dragon's all worked up now, good luck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard opened the door and Felix walked in. The dragon was pacing around the cell furiously and snarled and growled. When the door slammed behind Felix, the dragon snapped its head in Felix's direction. The dragon opened its mouth, ready to roar at Felix...</span></div></div>",

Even as he stepped in, Felix was forced to push his hands to his ears, to try to block out as much of the sound as he could. Though he couldn't leave or just run away, it was impossible for him to do much of anything with so much noise echoing through the cell. As the minutes passed, the sound at least died down long enough for him to stand it, even though he almost squinted as he tried to force as much of the sound out as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the last meal, it was a bit surprising to Felix that the beast had recovered so quickly. It hadn't even been a day, and it was already at it once again, thrashing about, the chains on it already somewhat strained and marks strewn everywhere over the ground. There were the signs of a few injuries around as well, and it was easy to guess that so far, the attempts at taming the dragon had not gone smoothly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I get it, you're upset!\" Felix found himself shouting at the dragon, though his voice was drowned out by its continued shrieking. The dragon kept struggling down on its chains, trying to push away, the racket from its struggles only adding to the din in the room. \"I'm not happy about this either, so let's just make sure we both survive!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved to try to get a better view, but another roar forced him back a little bit as he kept his eyes pointed at the dragon, trying to catch its motion and not get injured again by it. However, though it was still thrashing about, its claws didn't seemed to be aimed in his direction anymore, though its gaze certainly was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just calm down! I don't know whatever made you this way, if it's because you're a fire dragon, or because you're chained up, or whatever! But as long as you're here, I have to try to take care of you, and as much as you might not like it, I don't think anybody else is going to be taking the job!\" Felix kept shouting, uncertain why he was even trying. He could barely hear his own voice, and he had no idea if the dragon would understand or even hear his shouts. But there wasn't any better way to get the beast to calm down, and it seemed to at least respond to him earlier, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound suddenly quieted to a growl as Felix just stared at the dragon, realizing that at some point, he had stepped away from the cart and put himself into plain sight of the dragon. He swallowed as he recalled the conversation he had heard earlier, worried that he would be caught in a blast of flame or the like. However, the dragon simply continued growling, and though it didn't seem happy, at least it was quiet enough for him to think and to move without a huge worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... I've got your stuff here... I'll just...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt a bit awkward for him to try to move to the cart and get everything without turning from the dragon. Even though it was uncomfortable, though, he forced himself to not break eye contact for a moment. And though the dragon still made a few stiff motions at its bindings, it at least stopped thrashing as it watched him. Its motions were gentler, though it could hardly be be described that way when its claws still slammed into the ground when they moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here... Here you go...\" Felix stepped forwards slowly, carrying a piece of meat at arm's length. He held his breath as he walked forwards, his gaze starting to wander a little from the dragon to the ground, knowing where he would no longer be safe, wondering if he should even try to do it this way. His instinct told him to just throw the meat at the dragon, and to keep himself safe, but another, nagging part of him said to at least try it, and that he could pull away fast enough. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dragon continued to stare down at Felix angrily. Felix gulped as he walked closer. He hoped that the dragon and him had a decent enough understanding. Felix didn't want any trouble with the dragon, and he sure as hell wouldn't try hurting the dragon. It may have been an infant like the soldiers said, but it was still viscous and the size of an elephant. <i>\"Hope it understands I'm the one feeding it and keeping it alive. Maybe if it understands it won't try to hurt the hand that feeds it,\"</i> Felix thought to himself, <i>\"Besides, I did save it life by hand feeding it. Surely we should have some sort of mutual understanding.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Then again, it's just an animal and can't understand anything. By the way it's acted so far, it seems like some savage and wild beast with no signs of intelligence, yet,\"</i> Felix argued with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's angry glare looked away from Felix and it stared at the meat in Felix's hands with hunger. \"Okay, I'll hand you the food and you can...\" Felix tried to tell the dragon to be careful, though he really didn't know if it could understand. However, the dragon either didn't understand or wasn't paying attention to Felix, because when Felix started to explain what the dragon needed to do, the dragon launched its head forward with it mouth open wide and its sharp fangs gleaming from the little light the cell had in it. The mouth was aiming for meat, but the dragon didn't seem to care that it could easily engulf both of Felix's arms as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix jumped back in a panic and was just in time to dodge the mouth as it snapped shut only catching air. Felix fell backwards on the ground and the slab of meat landed on his torso. The dragon shook its head, not understanding how it missed and Felix crawled backwards till he was out of range. He had no idea if the dragon tried to kill him on purpose or the dragon just didn't understand that Felix's arms were there two. Whether it was on purpose or accident, one thing was for certain, The dragon was angry that Felix backed the meat away from it. The dragon roared once more at Felix and continued to growl angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you expect I'd do? You nearly snapped my arms up with the meat,\" Felix yelled at the dragon. The dragon bared its fangs in a way that it looked like it was smiling and the eyes didn't seem to concerned that Felix could have died from the attack. This made Felix think that the dragon purposefully tried to kill him. \"Did you... did you... try to kill me?\" Felix questioned still on the ground with the meat on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's 'grin' just widened. \"What the hell have I done to you?\" Felix abruptly questioned, \"I wasn't the one who captured you. I'm not the ones trying to tame you. I'm just supposed to feed you and make sure you stay alive. I saved you for gods sake. I'm even offering to hand feed you so that we could try to have some sort of mutual understanding. Yet you still try to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mention of trying to hand feed the dragon, the dragon growled furiously. Felix found it strange that the dragon decided to growl at that particular moment. <i>\"Does it not like being hand feed, or was that growl just a coincidence?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"It did seem more angry when I had hand feed it and it didn't accept the food right away even when it was spent. It is possible it doesn't want to be hand fed, but why? Many of the nobles that visit Lord William love being hand fed by slaves.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix then remembered how the soldier compared fire dragons to Spartans. Felix had heard tales about Spartan. They were a proud race that never gave in, no matter the odds. <i>\"Maybe it wants too proud to even want to accept being feed by a human,\"</i> Felix suggested, but it was a guess more than anything. \"Here!\" Felix yelled and threw the meat in next to the dragon. The dragon ate the meat while still staring at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix walked back to the cart and threw the rest of the meat to the dragon and while the dragon ate, Felix filled up the bowl with water again. Felix stared at the dragon as it ate. It was such a strange creature to Felix. Felix was about to push the cart away, but then a thought came into his mind. <i>\"If I'm not mistaken, the soldiers had captured the fire dragon and it was alone. Yet, I think the soldiers had said something about the fact that the fire dragons live in packs. Why was this infant alone?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix remembered hearing the soldiers mentioning that the fire dragons throw away their weak children. Felix turned back to the fire dragon who was still eating. Felix couldn't see the fire possibly being thought of as weak, but it was possible that its parents abandoned it if the fire dragon was found alone. <i>\"If it was abandoned when it was a child, because it was thought of as weak, and the dragon survived the wilderness before it was caught. The dragon must feel it needs to act strong in order to prove itself to its clan,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was purely a guess and Felix didn't know if it would be wise to bring this up to the dragon. For one, the guess could be completely wrong and the dragon continues to hate Felix. Or, the guess could be right and the dragon could be very touchy about the subject and hate Felix even more. However, Felix felt as though he needed to get to know the dragon more in order to make some sort of mutual agreement with the dragon, because Felix was starting to feel as though the dragon was more intelligent that it acted.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix slowly watched as the dragon continued to swallow all of its food, the amount he threw almost completely gone. He quickly pushed the full bowl of water within range of the dragon while it was still distracted eating, quietly backing away the moment it was safe again. Then, he turned back, looking at the door. He was done. He could leave now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that would only mean dealing with the same raging dragon again the next time it was time for a meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down, shaking his head a little as he crossed his legs. As things were, he wasn't going anywhere. He would have to just wait and let the dragon finish its meal, and hopefully, he could try to make sense of things from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dragon finally finished its meal, it took its time taking a drink from its bowl. It buried its face into the bowl the best it could, shaking and spilling water everywhere as it pushed through it. Felix watched, his mind somehow just mildly interested at how it drunk what it was given. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of its draught, however, its eye turned to Felix. A forceful snort blew the bowl away slightly, as it pulled back, still growling as he moved closer to Felix, both eyes pointed to him now. He jumped a little, but tried his best not to break eye contact. \"You're... feeling better now, then. That's... good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got a quick, sudden snort in response, the dragon turning away from him, suddenly intent on staring at the wall. Felix continued to look at the dragon, speaking a bit louder as he just tried to get a better view of it now that it was staying still. \"Okay, fine. You don't want to deal with me. I don't know why you have to get so defensive about it, though. I mean, like it or not, I'm the one that's going to be taking care of you, and I don't exactly want you to end up miserable around here. There's more than enough of that already, though I suppose your situation isn't exactly comforting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sound came from the dragon, whose gaze was starting to wander up to the ceiling now. Though it didn't exactly look at Felix, at least it wasn't snapping at him. It felt odd to be ignored by a dragon, of all things, but he was quite used to being ignored in many different ways. He put his concerns on hold for the moment and continued to speak, though it felt more and more awkward to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's see... You were alone when they caught you, right? But, they said that you're still young... I guess you learned enough to survive, at least? Better than me, at least.\" He shook his head a little, turning away, looking down the length of its body. It was difficult to see much of anything, but it still seemed to be in good shape. \"Not enough to actually fight, though... I guess that's why they caught you?\" The tension was visible as the dragon's body shifted a bit, an expected growl resonating through the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix shifted back uncomfortably, trying to figure out if there was any way to calm the beast down. \"I guess you weren't hurt too much, at least. Caught, but at least not hurt during capture. I mean, your body looks okay. So I guess you know what attitude you're supposed to have, but not... too much else. It's kept you alive alright so far, though. I mean, capture's awkward, but at least you were willing to eat.\" Another soft grunt came from his head as his eyes closed shut. \"Oh, don't act like accepting food's such a bad thing. No matter what kind of creature you are, you had to get some from your parents at some point. Even dragon newborns shouldn't be capable of hunting from birth, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix half-expected some soft of response, but there wasn't even any slight movement that time. \"Look, point is, you're being taken care of right now, so you might as well make the most of it. You've actually gotten a lot more food than important visitors have already. It's... a bit weird, really, knowing that you're getting better treatment than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon actually gave a bit of a snort, a half-grin appearing on its face. Felix just sighed as he put his hand to his forehead, shaking it a bit. \"Okay, that settles it. You might not be nice, but you definitely understand what I'm saying, don't you?\" The dragon made a deep, rumbling sound. Felix nearly started to back away, before he heard the odd tone in it. \"Is that... Are you laughing?\" He paused for a moment, only to notice the noise continuing. \"Great. I find out you can understand me, and then I find out that you think that this situation is <i>funny</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the sound quieted down, the teeth of the dragon's maw were still showing as he turned to Felix, who swallowed. Even though it might have been in a good mood, its appearance was still more than enough to worry and scare him. He gripped the best he could on the ground, doing his best to continue talking. \"Well... I guess that's something, at least... Knowing for sure that you understand...\"</span></div></div>",

It was a very uncomfortable sight for Felix to have large, sharp teeth that could rip in to shreds right in front of him. The dragon had even lowered its head so that the teeth would be level with Felix. Felix looked into the eyes of the dragon, expecting to see anger, but instead, Felix saw something else. The eyes looked confused and weren't fused with anger, but a strange sort of curiosity as it looked Felix over with its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why is this dragon curious all of the sudden?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"Is it because its in a better mood after seeing this situation as funny, to it, or is it something else. Hell, why does it even think this is funny. Was it because I told it it was being treated better than me, or is it because I finally realized it can understand me. Either one could possibly be considered funny to this dragon.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix decided to try and communicate with the dragon again after a long period of silence. \"Look, if you can understand what I'm saying, could you also speak in my tongue?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confusion and curiosity left the dragon's eyes and was replaced with some anger again. The dragon's grin ended and the dragon turned his head away from Felix once more with a snort. Felix thought about how he could interpret the reaction. <i>\"Either, the dragon is telling me its obvious it can't speak the same tongue, only understand it, or the dragon just doesn't want to speak to me,\"</i> Felix thought. Judging from how the dragon had acted thus far, Felix was leaning more to the suggestion that the dragon could speak, it just chooses not to speak to Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can understand what I'm saying, you could probably speak it. However, I'm guessing you just don't wish to speak to me. I can understand why you don't want to speak to humans and I understand why you must hate humans, but I'm not the one that captured you. I'm not the one forcing you to stay in this cell and keeping you captive. I'm just the guy sent to take care of you and make sure you're alright,\" Felix informed the dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon kept it's head turned away from Felix, but the dragon turned it slightly to see Felix with one of its eyes. \"I have a feeling that you're not going to listen to what I say or even care, but in a way, I'm kind of like you,\" Felix said while looking at the ground, \"I'm not here of my own will either. Hell, if I had the choice, I wouldn't hesitate in leaving this place behind. However, I can't leave. I'm a slave. The lord of this castle owns me. I'm his property. Funny, humans are probably the only creatures in this planet that are capable of such evils as viewing others as property and not people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cell was the quietest Felix had every heard and that silence lasted many long moments. Felix finally looked up at the dragon and saw something very different in the dragon's eyes. For a brief moment, Felix thought he saw sympathy in those eyes, but the dragon's face soon hardened and it looked away from Felix, turning its whole body away from Felix this time. \"I think I better leave now,\" Felix informed the dragon, \"I'll be back with your dinner in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix pushed the cart out of the cell and the dragon was left alone in the cell again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours past and the dragon was still alone, thinking about what had happened at lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Stop it!\"</i> the dragon yelled in its mind, <i>\"Don't you dare feel sorry for that miserable creature. It's a human!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But, if it's true that he's like me and that he's a slave...\"</i> the dragon began to wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Or the human could be trying to trick me. Face it, a human could never be as strong as a dragon. Humans would have to use other means to defeat me such as lies and trickery,\"</i> the dragon reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But, if he's telling the truth, he might be willing enough to try and help me. He does seem to be a lot nicer than the other humans,\"</i> the dragon continued to argue the possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, a human can't help me. How could a human help me? The one that feeds me seems older than me, and look how small he is compared to me. Humans are too small and too weak to be of any help. That's my the clan looks down upon humans. They are nothing. Just pitiful insects, and because we're bigger and stronger, we have the right to do whatever we want with them. Dragons should be the supreme rulers of the world,\"</i> the dragon thought to itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I must find a way out of this place myself,\" the dragon decided, \"If I escape by myself, maybe the clan will accept me. They'll see how strong I've become in the past five years. I had to hunt and survive by myself my whole life and I've succeeded. Maybe if I show them how strong I've become, my parents will finally accept me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon thought back to the day he was abandoned by his parents because the clan believed the dragon child would grow up to be weak. It saddened the dragon when it thought about that day and tears were trying to force their way out. <i>\"NOOO!!\"</i> the dragon screamed in its brain while shaking its head to try and force the tears back where they belonged. <i>\"There is no need for such weak emotions. I need to be strong. I need to be tough. Showing such emotions will only prove that the clan was right about me. I can't give in to those emotions!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon heard the door open and it turned around to see...  </span></div></div>",

He even felt an odd bit of relief in the corner of his mind, glad to know that there was someone he didn't have to worry about at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking himself up from the ground quickly, the dragon charged forwards, only to be restrained by the same chains. However, this time, he had no problems pulling and jerking at them, not even letting them stop his movement as he swung back and forth, never holding still for an instant, not even caring as he felt his scales scratched at by the soldiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's acting up again! Get better restraints on it, and find something that'll pierce its scales!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even as they all gathered, more and more trying to reach the dragon, some even starting to shove spears at it, they were pushed back simply from the force of his motions, some just losing their grip and others who stood too close getting injuries that were much, much worse. The injuries that the dragon received were minor, and despite the slight stinging it felt, it never stopped, even looking excited as he lashed out towards all the guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore chains went around the dragon's body, though it took the guards a good deal of time and effort to do so. The sounds filled his head, it just making him grow more and more involved in it, more and more upset but just feeling right, feeling like it was his place to keep fighting the humans this way. In the end, however, he felt himself straining, doing his best to move, eyes closed and a muffled roar coming as he could barely open his mouth with his muzzle nearly tied shut, only just able to push. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's chained down firmly, then? Good. The beast is restrained where it belongs. It's time to teach it, and to make sure that it understands what its place is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's eyes opened just enough to give a glare at the man who spoke. He carried around a bit of an arrogant air, and it was clear that he was the one commanding everybody around. He was responsible. For his capture, for his prison, for everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And killing him would show everybody that I'm capable of getting revenge on my own...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being bound, the dragon did his best to lunge forward, to do something, anything, to the man who was keeping him here. However, he only heard a quiet laugh as he just barely pushed his chains apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you don't understand your position, beast. I am your master. And you are to listen, or be punished.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar suddenly came out of the dragon's muzzle, though he did his best to keep it down. Though he barely saw the man touch him, he knew someone did something to trigger the heat that seemed to rest under his scales. But the pain shooting through his head and neck made it too difficult for him to do much of anything else. The pain, somehow burning him, just seemed to seep further and further through as he shook about, trying to push the man away, to get him to stop touching him, to do anything but let it keep going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, it was a relief when he finally blacked out. But when he woke up again, there was only one thing on his mind: the pain he felt, far beyond that he thought was possible for him to feel. For anything like pain from heat to hurt him should have been impossible. But it still happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe issue lingered so much on his mind that he barely noticed the boy standing close by for a few minutes, and it was only when he wandered right in front of his eyes that he realized that Felix was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight growl came, but as he tried to turn, the dragon realized that the chains were still firm on him. He could barely even move enough to reach the food laid so close to his face, and though his mouth could open, it was difficult for him to push the meat there into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I can't... let him take care of me again... It's not...</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon closed his eyes, not even sure of what he could even try to do after what the humans had just done to him.</span></div></div>",

Felix turned his head to see that the dragon was awake and already growling at him with anger. \"Nice to see you again too,\" Felix replied sarcastically. The dragon seemed to try and turn it's head away, but the chains on the dragon were too numerous now. It was pinned to the ground quite well. \"I know you're don't like me because I'm a human, but can't we have some sort of mutual understanding. I don't really appreciate you growling and roaring at me every time I enter, when I'm the one thats feeding you and taking care of you. We don't have to be friends or anything, but could we agree to be a little nicer to each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon moved its eyes to look away from Felix. \"You are one very stubborn infant, you know that?\" Felix stated. The dragon gazed angrily at Felix again and Felix replied, \"Well, you are still only a child, aren't you?\" The dragon looked away again and growled. The dragon's growl was much weaker now and it sounded more like an infant growl than the growl of a powerful beast. When the dragon was at full strength, it had a powerful growl despite being an infant, because it was much larger than humans and humans heard a powerful roars and growls from the dragon because of the size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix began wondering what happened to the dragon to make it so weak. Sure, it was being chained down and it could have exerted all it's energy by trying to get the chains off, but Felix had a feeling it was something else. Felix had heard that Lord William came down to visit the dragon. Felix soon noticed the mark on the dragon's left arm. Well, the dragon's front left leg, but Felix called it an arm because it looked more like an arm than a leg because the front feet of the dragon acted like hands and looked like hands. \"Lord William touched you today, didn't he?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon looked at Felix again in confusion. <i>\"How does the human know I was touched?\"</i> the dragon wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix noticed the dragon's confused face and explained, \"You have the brand on your arm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon became horrified. Not only did he hate the fact that a weak and puny human touched him, but now he had more reason to hate it now that the human left a mark on him. If his clan knew that he was touched by such a weak creature... The dragon tried to turn his head to see the mark, but his head wouldn't move due to the chains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix noticed the dragon struggling to move in order to see the mark so Felix stated, \"I have the mark as well. Lord William brands it into his living property. Its his way of showing his dominance and trying to make people think he truly owns you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix turned his back to the dragon and lifted his shirt. The dragon saw the mark on the boy's shoulder. It was a black and red hand print with a terrible eye in the middle of the palm. The mark was a wicked and terrible thing. Something the dragon wanted to rip off his scales. The dragon also noticed other scares on the human's back from multiple whip lashes. This shocked the dragon. He had thought the human was lying about being treated worse than the dragon, but it was clear now to the dragon that the boy really was being treated unfairly amongst the other humans. <i>\"Maybe, we do have things in common,\"</i> the dragon wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix lowered his shirt and turned back to face the dragon. Again, Felix saw some sympathy in the dragon's eyes before it hardened again. \"I know how much the touch weakens people and I know your strength must have been diminished. I'm going to feed you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix picked up a piece of meat and brought it to the dragon. With the last bit of strength, the dragon tried to leap forward with all his might. All this did was move him enough to just give Felix a little push. Felix was pushed back and he hollered, \"What is wrong with you? I'm trying to help you. Why don't you want my help?\" The dragon moved his eyesight to look away from Felix. \"Is it because I'm a human?\" Felix wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, that was one of the reasons the dragon didn't want Felix's help. Felix was a human and the dragon thought it was a sign of a major weakness if a large and powerful dragon had to get help from something as small as a human. Plus, the dragon wanted to do things himself. He had been keeping himself alive for five years right after his parents and the clan abandoned him a few days after he was born. To him, he felt it was a disgrace having to be fed by someone else, especially a small human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This dragon is either very prideful or very stubborn, maybe even both,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knelt down in front of the dragon's muzzle. Too weak to try and push Felix again, the dragon tried retreating his head. \"You're worried you'd be weak in accepting my help right?\" Felix guessed. Felix got his answer when the dragon looked at Felix with a 'how did you know' kind of look. \"You may think it's a weakness for you to accept my help, but I assure you, it's not,\" Felix tried his best to convince the dragon to eat, \"It may seem like that in the short run, but it isn't in the long run. Think about it, if you don't eat and die of starvation, it would seem like the easy way out. It would also seem like a cowards way out, because you'd give up the fight against Lord William and his torturers. Accepting this one humiliation will give you more strength you can use to try and fight off Lord William and his men.  Accepting this food is not a weakness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon shut his eyes tight and his expression was filled with obvious shame. The dragon then opened its mouth and stuck out its tongue. Felix proceeded to place the meat on the dragon's tongue and the dragon wrapped its snake tongue around the meat and reeled it in. As Felix did this, he noticed that the dragon was doing its best to hide and cover his emotions. <i>\"It must think certain emotions like sadness is weak as well,\"</i> Felix concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bottling your emotions up is not a good thing either,\" Felix informed the dragon, \"You may think certain emotions are weak and you'd be strong to hide them and keep them inside, but doing so will only make you weaker. Hiding your emotions in yourself will make you crumble on the inside. I have seen it happen many times. People who do that in this place tend to go insane because of the dark and twisted atmosphere of this castle. What you need is someone to talk to. Someone you can tell your problems to, otherwise the emotions inside of you will destroy you and you will be nothing but Lord William's puppet. I know what it's like to feel alone, as if everyone could care less about you. I could probably understand most of the things you're going through at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix noticed the glare was in the red dragon's eyes once again. \"But you don't have take my offer,\" Felix sighed, \"You can just keep roaring and growling at me, and you can keep hating me. You could also ignore the fact that we have more in common than you realize and that we're in the same situation together. And you can keep being alone in this place.\" Felix had finished feeding the dragon and he placed the bowl near the dragon. The dragon drank by lapping up the water with its tongue. When that was finished, Felix started heading out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The dragon called out to Felix, telling him to wait. The dragon may have been a very proud and stubborn creature, but it was still a five year old dragon and very desperate and lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The dragon said nothing and Felix left the cell.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The walk out the door did nothing to comfort either of them. Though Felix didn't hear the dragon make any noise that sounded upset, the fact that it didn't even grunt did nothing to comfort him. Although it was an improvement over being attacked, it didn't feel like it was much of one to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon only started moving again when he was sure that the boy had left. However, instead of trying to break free, it simply collapsed, glad to no longer have to hold itself up. Although the pain was gone, his body still felt stiff and awkward as he tried to shake off the tiring feelings it had left him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Loneliness... The human's got that part right, at least. I haven't seen another dragon for... How long has it been now... At least one year? Two?\"</i> The dragon growled quietly as he closed his eyes, trying to keep himself from becoming depressed by the thought. <i>\"Why is it that the first one to talk to me since then had to be a human... If he weren't such a weak creature, we'd both be free by now!\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon tried to give a growl, but despite it still sounding the same to him, it felt hollow as it left his throat. It was tiring for him to move at all. He only managed to turn his muzzle slightly. \"<i>At least he's talking to me... That's better than any of the animals I've so far, at least... Why is it that our languages are so similar? Dragons never should speak with them... We all know that... So how did it ever get like this? Maybe they stole it from us in the past...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight scratch appeared on the ground as the dragon tensed, though he couldn't keep his claws there for very long. \"<i>Of course... Humans would steal everything from us... They're all like that... There's never one that would be different... They would never stop...</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know exactly when he fell asleep. Somewhere along the line, he was simply unable to hold on anymore. He should've been more aware. There was a nagging part of his mind that wanted him to push his eyes open again, to not let himself be caught unaware even while he was chained down this way, but it was shut out, just too tired to force himself awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, until the middle of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon jerked awake roughly, nearly jumping as found himself waking suddenly, pressing uncomfortably into his bindings. He gave a loud roar automatically as he felt them, forgetting everything for the moment, just struggling and shouting as he tried to break free. However, as the hours passed without even a person peeking in, it soon became clear to him that it was pointless, that now, even his struggles didn't attract attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he was aware now, it soon turned into borderline paranoia. Even the sound of his own motions forced him to try to turn his head, to try to see everything that was going on, and to ensure that nothing happened within the cell that he was unaware of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the morning came, he was already more tired than he felt before he slept. His mind was calm only because there was nothing else that he could do. It felt tiring just to turn his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This isn't working... Why can't I get free... I'm not... I'm not that weak...</i>\" The dragon growled quietly as it just lay there, trying to figure out what it should do, or even what it could do. \"<i>Maybe the humans will slip up sometime... And then, I can get away... just run away... come back when I can just break this place down...</i>\" The dragon smiled a little bit to himself at the idea, just distracting himself for a little while thinking about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts respite was broken by the quiet sound of the boy entering again. Though it growled quietly, the kid didn't seem to be quite as nervous as he prepared his foods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He's seen me far too often now... He knows how I am... I can't believe this... I can't even scare a human kid the way I am...</i>\" The dragon shook his head. \"<i>No... If you can't win a battle... Wait for the next one... Recover before striking them down... And this kid... If I talk to him, if he's acting, he could help... Yeah... I can at least talk to him, and then I'll know for sure that he doesn't deserve it...</i>\" The dragon smiled a little, a growl finally coming out. It caused Felix to pause for a moment, the sound of it quite different from the fierce snarls that had be coming over the last days. It was still deep and strong, but almost gentle. The dragon just gazed at him quietly, a little distracted by the thought, at having some small plan again, and some part of him relieved to have an excuse to start to speak with the only being around who might actually listen. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix stared at the dragon. He had never heard the dragon make such a growl. <i>\"What does that growl mean? he sounded gentle. Has everything I said to the dragon finally broke past its thick skull? Is it trying to befriend me now?\"</i> Felix wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix waited for the dragon to do something, but the dragon did nothing. It seemed to be in deep thought and distracted by its thoughts. Felix just ignored the dragon since it looked as though it wasn't going to do anything. Felix got the food ready and placed it on the ground near the dragon's mouth. The dragon was a little stronger now that it had gotten some sleep. The dragon would be able to scoop the food up from the ground. Besides, Felix didn't want to hand feed the dragon unless he had to because the dragon hated Felix when he had to feed the dragon that way. Once all the food and the water was near the pile, Felix decided to just try and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was deep in thought because he didn't know what he should say to the human. Hell, part of him didn't even want to go through with it. Fire dragons weren't supposed to speak to humans, let alone befriend a human, which part of the dragon desperately wanted to do. Humans were weak beings that believed they were the rulers of the world, and fire dragons hated that. Fire dragon knew that dragons should take that rightful place of rulers of the world. Unfortunately, nearly the rest of the dragon species didn't have the same beliefs as fire dragons and just let humans be. Fire dragons believed they should show humans were they rightfully belonged, under dragons. That was why fire dragons were supposed to kill, eat, torture, and humiliate any human that believed they were better. Fire dragons were big and strong, and humans were small and weak. Humans needed to be under fire dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the fire dragon part of the dragon didn't want him to go through with it. That part didn't want him to talk to the human, otherwise he'd be viewed as weak along with the human. It would be a strong blow to the dragon's pride to speak to such a weak being. However, there was another part to the dragon, the part that got him abandoned. The \"weak\" part of him that gave into emotions and compassion. It was a part the fire dragon was trying to get rid of. The part he tried to hide so that he could possibly be accepted into the clan again. This \"weak\" part wanted to talk with the human, wanted to tell the human everything and finally gain a friend, which the dragon had never had in the five years of his life. The \"weak\" part of him wanted to let out all his emotions that had been bottled up inside him for far too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire dragon made a compromise within himself. He decided he'd talk to the human to please his \"weak\" side and slightly harm his pride in order to gain information. However, he wouldn't speak of his past or emotions and he would not try to befriend the human to make his fire dragon side happy. Suddenly, the dragon realized that the human was leaving and he had to act quick. \"Wait. Don't leave yet, human!\" the dragon commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the way the dragon said the order, it sounded a little more along the lines of a plea. This ashamed the dragon to know it was more of a plea than an order and the dragon avoided the human's gaze, hoping the human didn't notice his command was more like a plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix heard a voice call out to him. It sounded like a plea, although the voice tried to make it sound like a command. Felix turned around to the only other living creature in the cell to find its eyes avoiding him and looking ashamed. Felix knew that the dragon had spoken to him, because not only was it a voice that was deep and powerful that had the sound of an toddler's voice as well, but the way the plea was said was very much like the dragon's personality. Felix had noticed that every time the dragon showed sadness or sympathy in its eyes, it quickly tried to hide it. What the dragon had said and how it had said it, was very much like all its other actions because it tried to disguise its plea as a command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to talk to me now?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon continued to look away from the human as if trying to hide the fact he was speaking to a human from himself. \"Is everything you said to me about yourself true?\" the dragon demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, everything I told you about myself is true. I have no reason to lie to you,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \"weak\" part of the dragon was glad to hear the human was telling the truth. That part of him was happy to know there was another being in the same situation as himself that he might be able to befriend. However, the fire dragon part of him was hoping the human was lying so that there would be nothing in common and so that there would be a reason to hate the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wish to speak to me now?\" Felix questioned. The dragon continued to keep its eyes aimed in a different direction. The dragon seemed to be uncomfortable about speaking to him as if ashamed. <i>\"These dragons must really hate humans to be ashamed when they talk to one. It looks as though his pride is hurt by talking to me,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I see it's hard for you to speak to me. You're species must hate humans or something along those lines, and it's making you hard to speak to me. However, it's alright to speak to me,\" Felix tried to encourage the toddler dragon to speak, but the dragon said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know about me, why don't you tell me about yourself? What's your name?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not supposed to talk to humans,\" the dragon replied quietly. So, quiet that Felix couldn't even hear the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not supposed to speak to humans,\" the red dragon growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to answer your questions. I'm a fire dragon and you're a human. Fire dragons are strong and humans are weak. Fire dragons are higher than humans,\" the fire dragon snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Physical strength isn't the only thing that determines strength,\" Felix informed the dragon, but the dragon didn't say anything in response. \"I see how you act. You try to hide your emotions. You act tough. Why do you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire dragons are supposed to be strong,\" the fire dragon replied, \"I need to be strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix could see that the dragon was again hiding its sad emotions within itself. The dragon saw sadness as a weakness and if it saw it as a weakness, then all the other dragons in it's clan... \"I was told fire dragon were like Spartans and I know that Spartans tend to throw away the children they think are weak,\" Felix stated. The dragon turned to look at him and knew where the conversation was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were abandoned, weren't you?\" Felix asked. The dragon did not answer and just tried to hide his sadness. \"I never knew my parents, but I was told that they sold me into slavery. I know what it's like to grow up alone,\" Felix stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop making it sound like we are the same, human,\" the dragon hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not really as tough and mean as you are trying to be. You're disguising the real you to try and be what the other dragons want you to be, but no one is making you have to change yourself. Besides, their the ones who threw you away. You think you honestly need to prove yourself to creatures that didn't want you the way you are?\" Felix said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though he was trying to sound calm, the dragon's noises still shook Felix a bit. Despite being young, its voice was already deeper and harsher than any human voice that Felix had heard. However, the tone of the dragon's voice was easily recognizable, despite its depth. It was far too similar to his own to scare him. Despite the arguments that the dragon was trying to make, he could just barely make out the other meaning behind them. \"You were raised a certain way, but... that doesn't mean that the things you were taught are right. I know that what I'm taught can't be right. Lord William definitely shouldn't be in charge, for one. So, what you're taught as a dragon could be wrong as well, couldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix swallowed quietly before taking a step forwards, within the dragon's reach again. He tried to look over the dragon, but it felt a bit odd to be looking at its eyes, fully aware that it knew exactly what was happening to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>am</i> dragon. No matter what, that's not going to change.\" The dragon growled quietly, pushing itself slowly, its claw managing to give Felix a bit of a shove. Though it wasn't forceful enough to give him an injury, it was still enough to knock him off his feet. \"And that means that if I run into some stupid human, I'm going to deal with him. That's not something that I'm taught, that's something that's common sense. I'm strong enough, and the way humans act, they all know that it's what's supposed to happen, too. So any human that comes my way is going to get treated that way. I'm more than strong enough to take care of a few bugs.\" The dragon moved its head close to Felix, almost pressing it against him, his breath forcing Felix to sweat a bit. \"And seeing as I'm always going to remain a dragon, I'm better off learning to be a proper dragon! I don't need to learn anybody insect's lessons! Things are way too different for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix picked himself back onto his feet, his heart starting to beat faster, hoping that things wouldn't get any worse. \"I... know. I know that we're not the same. I don't even remember my parents that well, so I can't say I know if what you had to go through is the same as what I did. It's probably a different feeling. And I know that since I'm a human, I won't understand everything about you.\" He clenched his hands together tight, doing his best to keep his voice stable at the reminder. \"But... that doesn't mean that I don't know what things are like here and now. And right now, things are the same for the both of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that this is the same?\" The dragon made a heavier swipe with his other arm, letting the chains clatter loudly as he did. \"Funny. I doubt you've had to suffer this kind of... indignity.\" He tried to pull his arm forwards, trying to see his brand, but unable to turn his arm enough. \"If a mouse left a scar over your face, I doubt you'd take it as a mark of pride.\" He growled quietly as he tried to push the mark against the ground, trying to grind it out against the cell's floor, but he didn't even wiggle a few scales around, and the mark never touched the dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I'd still learn to watch out for mice afterwards. And you've had some... experience with humans now, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Learned not to let them near me.\" The dragon gave a glare to Felix, his anger starting to act up further. \"Next time, they're going down my throat the moment I see one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix signed a bit as he pulled away. \"If that's what you think... Then I can't really stay near you safely, can I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon gave a sharp noise, it clearly worried this time. \"That's not what I... I mean...\" His eyes suddenly snapped with worry for a moment, before he forced a bit of a laugh. \"Sounds like what a human is supposed to think.\" He tried to keep what he thought was a proud look on his face, but his eyes held the nagging worry that the human would really leave. He shook his head for a moment before trying to hold himself up. \"You're a lucky slave, you know. I doubt many even get to get close to a dragon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix gave a small smile as well. After all the time he had spent in Lord William's service, he was more than used to dealing with all sorts of people, knowing when to come for orders and when to stay out of the way in order to avoid punishment. And though the dragon certainly was different from any human he had met, the infant was hardly experienced enough at hiding his feelings. \"If you say so, then. I suppose I'm safe enough while you're in here, so I'll try to stay when I can. \"A part of him was nervous in saying that when he was well aware that even the chained dragon could injure him, but the way the dragon was acting, it was a risk that he was more than willing to take. \"I'm not going to get to be this close to any other creature of your strength, will I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon gave a large nod, a real smile showing even more at the complement. \"That's right. Remember I can still do quite a lot chained down, so you'd better listen to me, understand? Answer when I talk to you, and then you'll survive... for now.\" The dragon was slowly relaxing, both parts of his mind satisfied with what he thought was a good threat that would keep the human obedient and subservient, and what he thought would also ensure the human would stay close. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix could see that the dragon was a very strange and tormented creature, there was no doubt about that. It was clear that the dragon was troubled by two different personalities within himself. One part of the dragon was what he really was like, the part that was still just a child wanting someones love and affection. This part of the dragon was desperate looking for any help it could get, even if it was from a human slave boy. Felix knew that this was the part of the dragon the dragon was trying to hide. It was the part of the dragon that would plead to Felix before fighting with itself and then changing the sentence pretending nothing happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's other half was trying to be strong and prideful. Well, there was no question that, although the dragon was younger than Felix, the was far stronger than Felix in physical strength do to the dragon's large size. The dragon was easily twenty feet tall from the ground up and could break Felix's bones with ease. This half of the dragon probably wouldn't mind killing humans, seeing humans and insignificant pests. This half of the dragon was very different from the other half and Felix believed that this half of the dragon only existed because of the dragon's abandoned by its own family because of its original personality being viewed as weak.This half was trying to destroy the other and act tough and emotionless in order to be accepted back into his own clan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix understood the dragon's desires in wanting to be accepted by his family, because Felix knew that he surely wanted to know who his own parents were and what they were like. But he was also told so many times that his parents sold him for money and didn't care that they gave up their own flesh and blood. Felix didn't know the truth due to the fact that he couldn't remember anything that happened before he woke up one day as a five year old slave five years ago. So, his parents not wanting him could be is not out of the realm of reality, and if it was truly true that his parents didn't want him, Felix wouldn't want to try and prove himself to win the acceptation of people who abandoned him. This dragon's parents really did abandon the dragon and Felix truly felt sorry for the dragon wanting to win the acceptation of parents who just threw him away just because they thought he was weak. It was a truly horrifying and terrible thing and Felix wanted to show him why it was wrong to have to change oneself so drastically to win the acceptation of people who didn't like him the way he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Felix knew that he had to ease into it. The dragon was in a very traumatic setting and if the dragon was having any of the same thoughts and emotions as he had when he became a slave five years ago, Felix knew that the dragon's mind could break easily. The only way Felix could help the dragon there is to be there for the dragon and try to help him get through the experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the war between the two different personalities in the dragon's mind, Felix knew that it was best not to try and force a personality upon the dragon. The dragon had to make the right decision by himself. The dragon had to figure out who he truly was. The kind side of the dragon seemed to want to befriend Felix, and that might be enough for Felix to be safe with the dragon and cause that side to take control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been a long silence with Felix and the dragon just staring at each other. Felix was beginning to feel a lot more comfortable with the dragon now. The dragon was making threats that sounded more like light hearted jokes and the dragon seemed to be seeing Felix as exception of his hatred towards humans. Felix knew he wasn't completely safe with the dragon. There were still things that Felix could do to accidentally offend the dragon's pride which would be a very dangerous thing. However, Felix realized that Felix was safe around the dragon as long as he kept on its good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I see you've regained your strength and you can eat by yourself so that I don't offend your pride again,\" Felix informed the dragon, \"So, I think I should be heading out now so that I can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" the dragon interrupted with an outburst that sounded like a plea. The dragon quickly regained his composer and his second half took over and ordered, \"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I would love to stay here with such an impressively strong creature that has been gracious enough to let me get so close,\" Felix replied trying to as apologetic as possible to keep on the unstable creature's good side, \"However, I have other duties to attend to. I'm a slave to the evil man and I have to do as he says. If I don't, I can be punished, put to death, or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bending to another's will is worse than death,\" the dragon stated as if it was one of the lessons he was taught by teachers like laws needed to be repeated for remembrance, Felix wouldn't have doubted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a strong and powerful will and I envy it. But I learned that there are times when people can't always listen to their pride alone. Unfortunately compromises must be made help survive in the long run. I still wish to escape this place and I still want to defy Lord William, but until I find a way out, I must keep the act going. Also, there are much worse things in this castle than death, if one defies Lord William too long. He knows some dark magic. He has the power to keep controlling his slaves after they've died. He isn't able to do it all the time, but he has done it before trapping their soul in this Gods forsaken place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to break such a strong spirit, because one needs a strong spirit to survive and resist the torment. But there are times to hide that spirit in order to survive to fight later,\" Felix continued, \"Now, I must leave and do my other chores to avoid the whippings. I will be back to give you lunch and we can talk more then. I know you might think it's weak to confide in a creature that's like a mouse compared to you and that I'm nothing like you, but I'm the closest thing you have that's similar to you in this castle. I may not know everything that's going through your head, but I should know enough to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Felix left and the guards didn't say anything about him being longer than usual. Either the guards weren't suspicious for Felix or they just didn't care if a slave took a long time feeding the dragon. They thought it would be the slaves fault if he stayed in long and was eaten by the dragon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dragon silently laid in place as he saw the door close behind Felix. He held tight for a moment before just falling to the ground, sighing and shaking himself a bit. He felt like he could stand the place a little more, but he didn't know how much more. Part of him wanted to start clawing at himself just for even daring to speak to that kid. It wasn't right to depend on humans for anything, even admiration. Humans were just little pests, to be splattered if they ever appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he also smiled to himself a tiny bit as he remembered their conversation. There was a slight nagging in his mind as he wondered how much of the human's talk was serious, but the complements that he had received still him a slight sense of pride as he laid there, his maw curled upwards slightly on his face now. Hearing someone else speaking to him without some threat involved was comforting to him, even if it was just a human kid, and the fact that the kid was willing to complement him, even if only to calm him down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Heh... So humans still think that, do they... At least, most humans do... That guy still understands how humans should behave... even if he doesn't always act along those lines...</i>\" The dragon silently clawed at the ground, his breathing a bit off as he thought. \"<i>Even if he's faking it, he still understand that humans should keep me amused... And he doesn't seem that bad to be around. Sure, his conversation's a little bit forced, but at least he acts nice, unlike the others... I can be a little less careful around him, </i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed a bit for a moment before his eyes suddenly closed, shaking his head violently. \"<i>No. There's no way I can let my guard down for a moment here. Even around him... I can't let myself get soft. I have to... I have to make sure to protect myself... Protect my treasure... Act like a dragon should...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft part of his mind jumped at the opportunity. \"<i>So what if he's one of my belongings? Then, I have a reason to keep him close... To make sure nobody 'damages' him... And it's okay to keep a pet or slave or something, right?</i>\" His heart started to beat a little bit faster, hoping he wouldn't be able to seal the loophole that he had tried to make for himself. \"<i>Around here, anything I can get is treasure, so... Even bringing back a human would prove that I can... raid human lands, wouldn't it? That I can come into their lands, and take what I want for myself...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the darker part of him tried to find a way around it, it didn't try very hard. If he had a bit of loot from this whole ordeal, things would be even better. And if the human counted, then both parts of him would be glad to keep him close. All he needed to do was figure out how to get close to the human, and then he would have a new bit of property. And after, it didn't matter what he did with his property. He could even talk to him, and he wouldn't be weak for wanting to use...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeak. He couldn't help but pause as he thought of the word. Dragons rarely even wanted to support one another. Looking for the support of a human was unheard of. Even though dragons were allowed to use tools, he didn't know if they would count a human as something like that. If any of the other dragons saw him talking to a human... If they saw him like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The others... I wouldn't want them to hear... Ugh. I shouldn't care about what they think of me. That... that would also be weakness, to depend on them to get through this.</i>\" The dragon sighed quietly as he just closed his eyes, laying his head down onto the cold floor. \"<i>I'm not getting help from them... And they're not going to hear anything about what's happening to me. That human... That human's right... I'm not going to prove anything to anybody else. Until I can get out of here, at least. I only have to make sure that I make it through this. </i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But you have to prove to yourself that you're not weak. Do you think you can believe that while you're being so kind to a human? While you're depending on him?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... not a weakness...\" The dragon muttered the words to himself, his eyes still closed as he thought. \"It... means I'll do whatever it takes to survive... That I'm strong enough to survive...\" The dragon just grunted, the mark on his body starting to itch, a reminder he absolutely hated. \"And... my pride can survive dealing... with one human...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix opened the cell door, expecting to hear the dragon roar, growl, or give some sort of acknowledgment of his arrival. However, Felix heard no such acknowledgment. Felix began hoping that the dragon didn't roar because he was starting to see Felix as a friend or an ally. When he opened the door all the way, Felix soon saw that wasn't the case at all and the dragon wasn't even looking at the cell door. The dragon was lying down on the ground staring off into space as if in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I should have known better. The dragon couldn't possibly see me as a friend yet. It's been abandoned and has had to take care of himself this whole time, making it harder for it to trust people,\"</i> Felix thought to himself, <i>\"As an added effect, he has the beliefs of a fire dragon penetrated deep in his skull, and he wants to still please the dragons that abandoned him. It still doesn't occur to him that he doesn't have to please those who abandoned him and have to change he he was just to do so. He's still very young and it's going to take much more convincing for him to understand.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Felix pushed the cart in the dragon's cell. Felix thought that the sound of the cart bumping along the stone floor would get the dragon's attention, but the dragon still didn't look away from the wall as his head lied flat on the ground. <i>\"He must really be deep in thought,\"</i> Felix realized, <i>\"I just hope my words are actually getting though to him. The guards say that he's about five years of age, despite being twenty feet tall, but he's a little more mature than most toddlers. Maybe its do to him having to live on his own. Some say I'm smarter for my age and I to had to live alone, well... live without love or care.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix made it all the way across the line that marked the dragon's reach and the dragon was still staring into space. Felix placed the cart close to the dragon and then stepped away from the cart to try and step into the dragon's vision. The large eyes didn't notice the movement. Felix was a little concerned now. It seemed strange for him to be concerned for a large beast that had been violent towards him more than it has been kind, but Felix did find himself concerned. \"Dragon, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire dragon's eyes moved and locked upon Felix before the eyes widened and the head lifted straight up fast. Suddenly seeing Felix next to him caused the dragon to be startled and he even jumped up onto all for paws and took a step back as the clattering of his chains echoed through the large room. Thinking the dragon was suddenly angry with him, Felix fell backwards onto his butt as well. The dragon just started down at the human before him, trying to calm his breathing. When Felix figured out the dragon wasn't angry and not going to kill him, Felix stood up on his feet and looked up at the dragon while apologizing, \"Sorry, for startling you, but you were in a trance and I was only trying to snap you out of it so that you could eat your lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... startle me? That's impossible. I can't be scared by such a little creature. I'm a fire dragon,\" the dragon quickly replied with a puff of smoke bursting from his nostrils, \"You were the one who was scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knew he couldn't get the fire dragon to admit that he was startled as well, so, Felix didn't bother trying to argue with the creature. The fire dragon may have been a lot more friendlier than it had when he first saw it, but Felix knew that the dragon could just easily end his miserable life with little strength. \"You were in a trance, is something wrong?\" Felix questioned changing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the question was simple enough, the dragon allowed himself to answer the little human, \"I was just thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking about what?\" Felix wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a question the dragon was uncomfortable to tell the truth so the dragon just said, \"I was just thinking about some things. Besides, my thoughts are private, why would I reveal them to a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just a little worried is all,\" Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire dragon thought about it and did remember that when the human woke him from his thoughts, the human did sound worried. <i>\"Great, I'm a so weak that the human is worried for me?\"</i> the dragon thought. Though deep inside, he was a little gladdened that someone actually was concerned for his well being, he just wished it didn't have to be a human of all creatures. \"Why should you worry about me? I'm much stronger. You should be more concerned about yourself than me,\" the dragon questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't even notice me enter the room and I had to go up to you just to get your attention. I was worried that Lord William had done something to you. You remember what I told you about his spell, right?\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember what you said, human. It's only been since this morning, I'm not stupid,\" the dragon growled, \"Besides, no human has entered since you came with my breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't come today, but why?\" Felix wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they finally realized I can't be their tamed dog,\" the dragon growled, but the growl was towards the soldiers, not Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might not be a good thing. That might cause Lord William to take worse measures,\" Felix informed the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what. Lord William is a human and I can handle any human. Humans can match the strength of a dragon,\" the fire dragon said with his chest out and head held high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't underestimate Lord William. Did you forget that he left his mark on you already?\" Felix pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the fire dragon looked down at Felix with furry. The dragon crouched down low with his neck lowered till his muzzle was level with Felix. Only then did the dragon curl his lips back showing off his teeth as he growled, \"You don't have to remind me of my dishonor, human. I should rip you to shreds for reminding me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you?\" Felix questioned. He knew if the dragon wanted to kill him, the dragon would have done that instead of speaking, though Felix had you use much effort to not shake in fear or look away from the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon soon stood back up and looked away from the human. \"You're not worth it, human,\" the dragon stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please stop calling me human? I my name is, Felix,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet, you call me dragon,\" the dragon remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because I don't know your name. If you tell me your name, I'd gladly call you by it,\" Felix said.</span></div></div>",

What's that supposed to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing you need to worry about!\" The dragon snapped a bit, not wanting to remain quiet for even a moment. The human had already seen him distracted before, and he didn't want to give him another reason to be suspicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there wasn't that much he could say. The dragon simply didn't have a response. He was still a child, and he wasn't old enough to be of worth yet. Until he could prove he was a strong individual, he would simply be called a child. If he couldn't prove himself... Then nobody would give him one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no way he could say that to the human. He had already shown enough of himself, and there was no way he would admit to anything else. The human would just use it as another excuse to lecture him, and he simply couldn't accept that. He would try to earn it, just like everything else. He would take charge of it himself, and prove he was worth it to everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head a little as he suddenly saw the kid watching him. He growled quietly, hoping he wasn't distracted for too long. \"What is it? Felix, was it? Why are you staring? Just want to take a good look at me?\" He grinned a bit as he spoke, a bit of pride clear in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix hesitated for a moment before responding. \"So... You're okay with calling me that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon scoffed a bit as he growled. \"Better than calling you human all the time. You're... a bit different from the rest.\" He snorted a bit, a tiny bit of smoke coming as he did. \"I might as well know the only person I'm actually talking to here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... I suppose that's one way to describe it. So, what's yo-\" Felix started to speak before he saw the dragon's muzzle starting to move. Though he wanted to move aside the moment he saw the motion, he held in place as the dragon simply turned to the cart. He was rather rough in pushing against it, knocking its contents about as his muzzle made contact. However, though Felix was relieved that he wasn't going to be harmed, it was still rather nerve-wracking for him to see the dragon snapping a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Could you please be careful?\" The dragon stopped, growling quietly. Although Felix was nervous to ask something of the dragon, any punishment he would receive wouldn't be any better than what the dragon might do to him. \"If the cart gets damaged, I...\" Felix hesitated for a moment before figuring out what he could safely say. \"I probably wouldn't be able to come again.\" The dragon growled quietly for a moment, his eye turning to Felix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Get the stuff off. I'd rather not lose the bit of entertainment I have in this place.\" The dragon grumbled quietly as he barely pulled back, there barely enough room between him, the cart, and the wall. Felix swallowed a little as he had to move close just to reach the cart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he walked up to the cart, he felt the dragon staring at them. He could even feel himself sweating as he saw a bit of smoke around him. The dragon was clearly watching him closer than he would like, and there was more than enough trouble. Though he had been close before, it wasn't like this. It felt like he could snap at any moment, and the wounds that he had from the first attack were still firm in his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon even gave an amused snort as he saw Felix so close to panicking. A small puff of smoke was enough to make him tense a bit, and the dragon chuckled quietly as he saw Felix so jumpy. It wasn't a surprise that he tried to hurry through, and it only took a couple of minutes before a bit of meat and water were both on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the experience, Felix didn't feel too comfortable speaking immediately. He quickly moved aside after he was done, still barely in the line. However, the dragon wasn't speaking either, more focused on his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I don't think you ever answered me...\" Felix broke the silence rather nervously, not sure if he should stay within the line, or if he was better off further away. \"Um... Do you have something I can call you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had been thinking about it in the back of his mind, he had to make a decision. As he finished swallowing the bite of food he had, he opened his mouth to respond. </span></div></div>",

Plus, the dragon didn't want the human feeling sorry for him. <i>\"It's bad enough that I'm starting to rely on him for help and comfort from my loneliness,\"</i> the dragon thought, his thoughts stinging his pride like venom. <i>\" I don't need the human feeling sorry for me as well,\"</i> the dragon continued, <i>\"I don't want to be pitied. I've gone through too much for people to think I'm weak. I...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do have a name, don't you?\" Felix interrupted the fire dragon's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire dragon had to think of a reply quick. The dragon automatically gave into his prideful side since it was the first to think of a reply in that short time. \"I do have a name, but a small human like you isn't worthy enough to know it,\" the dragon growled. Normally, the dragon's two sides would have thought of a compromise between them in order to think of a clever lie that wouldn't hurt his pride and wouldn't harm Felix. However, the dragon's gentler side couldn't think of a good enough reply that wouldn't reveal he didn't have a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was truly hurt by the dragon's reply. Felix had thought that he was at least getting through to the dragon a little bit. He could even explained away some of the dragon's other actions that was done to purposely scare Felix. Those action were only to show dominance over him since dragons, at least fire dragons, wanted to feel strong and the dominant species. Even if it did prove the dragon was dominant, the dragon seemed to make those actions, seemingly light heartedly, as if the dragon wanted to show Felix that he could do whatever he wanted with him, but choose not to harm him. Though the dragon was acting as though he was a powerful and mean creature that cared nothing for humans, Felix had thought there was something in the dragon that was kinder and gentler he could befriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after such a comment from the dragon, Felix felt as though all those hopes were dashed away. Felix had been nice to the dragon and had even saved the dragon's life by feeding it, even after the dragon had injured him. Yet, none of that seemed to mater to the dragon. It seemed as though to the dragon, Felix was nothing more than some insignificant creature that could amuse him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire dragon saw how much his comment had hurt Felix's feelings and started feeling... <i>\"No,\"</i> the dragon thought as her turned his head away and looked down at his food which he started eating again, <i>\"I can't feel that way, especially not to a human. I mustn't feel sorry for such a weak creature. Predators don't feel sorry for their prey. So, why should the strong feel sorry for the weak?\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something deep inside the dragon felt sorry for the human whose feelings he had hurt despite trying to hide it from himself. The reason he keep from looking at Felix was so that feeling deep inside didn't grow. <i>\"Why should I even feel this way?\"</i> the dragon questioned, <i>\"Is it because the old me, the me that was banished, is still in me? Is it because I've been alone for so long that I've become lonely and this human is the only one who has cared about me in such a long time? What is happening to me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not worthy!? Not worthy!? Not even to know your damn name!?\" Felix yelled, too angry to care he was screaming at a dragon that could easily kill him, \"Do you realize how nice I've been to you? All I'm required to do is make sure you're feed, but I've stayed to talk and keep you company. I have saved your life by feeding you when you were too weak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually felt sorry for you,\" Felix continued, \"You've been abandoned and outcasted by your own clan. You've had to live all alone. You've become so lonely that you want to still be with the ones who abandoned you and change who you are just to prove yourself to them. They could care less about you and you try to be like them just to gain acceptance. I even felt a connection between us, because we have both been abandoned by those who were meant to take care of us. We have more in common than you want to believe, yet I'm not worthy to know your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon lifted his head and moved it directly in front of Felix with his lips curled upwards and his teeth showing. The dragon growled, \"I don't want your pity, human! Having such a weak creature feel sorry for me is a disgrace and so is the strong pitying the weak. Save your attempts, human. We are not alike and we will never be equals. Now quiet your tongue or I will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll what? Kill me? Go ahead and kill me!\" Felix demanded, \"I wouldn't mind dying this moment. It would be better than having to live through this shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was surprised by the human's response. All their other past discussions were about pressing on and doing what ever it takes to stay alive. The human used to promote hope, but now it seemed like he was giving up on life. \"You said surviving was an act of strength to fight another day, that dying and giving up was the weak action,\" the dragon responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been here for five years and I can't take it anymore. So, if you want to kill me, than do it. It would be doing me a favor. No one cares about me, and no one would ever miss me in the slightest. I am nothing. I'm not even considered a person to my own kind. I'm just property to my own species and just an insignificant bug to you dragons. I am absolutely nothing, and no one would ever remember me. So, is the fate of all who are abandoned and become slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon examined Felix and saw that Felix truly had no more fear of death. The dragon had to admire such bravery even if it was only because Felix had no more care about life and just wanted to give up and die. The dragon had never seen such sadness before. The dragon sighed, \"I'm not going to kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I'm not even worthy to be stepped on or eaten by such a mighty fire dragon?\" Felix replied angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon replied...</span></div></div>",

It would be simple for him to kill the human, and part of him knew it. He knew that he had caused plenty of injuries to the other humans that had come in, and this one wasn't even close to threatening him. His maw was wide open as he shouted, his eyes glaring over the kid as muzzle pushed him onto the floor. However, though he was a bit shaken from the move, Felix's expression remained the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Just kill him! One quick bite and the problem will be gone for good!</i>\" The dragon reached his claw around, holding Felix down, pinning him effortlessly as he pushed towards him. However, despite what his mind was telling him, he hesitated. His anger was still clear and his glare was still threatening, but even before he had found a reason, he had stopped himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You don't want to do that. You don't want to get rid of him when he's the only one who's not out to get you around here.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's roar quieted to a growl as it just glared at Felix. \"<i>He's going to keep doing this! He's going to keep acting this way as long as he's around! Just take care of it now, or else you're going to stay weak and vulnerable the entire time! Dealing with him is what's keeping you weak!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dealing with him is what's kept you alive. Like it or not, if you had tried to act strong and independent, you would've already starved and died.</i>\" The dragon's breathing slowed, his expression fading slightly. \"<i>He's helped you survive. He's helped you a lot more than anybody else.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon kept growling, but moved off of Felix, quietly moving back further into the cell, curling up slightly as he stepped back. \"I'm not going to kill you...\" He spoke with a bitter tone, and continued to glare at Felix as the kid slowly got up. \"You're...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm what? Just say it!\" Felix shouted back, his voice still clear despite his situation. He was getting more and more upset at the dragon, not even caring about the danger anymore. His life had always been at risk ever since he had become a slave, and his <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated. There were plenty of things he could say. Even without killing the human, the proud part had already found half a dozen ways of responding. However, none of them sounded very appealing, and the dragon knew it. The other part of him, however, seemed to be quiet, only a few faint thoughts in his mind. \"<i>You could just tell him what you're thinking... He's already seen you in worse situations. He's fed you, and he's already seen you after you got the brand. There's nothing left that could make you any weaker in his eyes, is there?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you're worth has nothing to do with it.\" The dragon spoke quickly, even coldly, just trying to get everything out before his doubts silenced him. However, as he continued, his voice fell in tone, becoming quieter, and turning unsteady. \"You're... helpful...\" The dragon strained himself to admit that much, nervously speaking. He didn't even know what he was trying to say, much less the way to say it. \"You're a human, but you've been... good.\" He was visibly quivering, a large part of him hesitant, even scared to say that much. He half-expected the human to burst into laughter at him, or to start taunting him, though he wasn't even watching or listening for any reaction at all. \"I won't kill you... I like having you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon turned away quietly, closing its eyes and just curling up in the corner. He clawed a bit at himself, the brand on his arm stinging slightly. \"<i>You idiot... You'll never be a true dragon if you keep acting this way!</i>\" He scratched harder at himself, clawing a bit more at his his arms, even wanting to punish himself for his admission, but felt unable to do enough. He wanted to find an excuse, to say Felix was a possession, to do <i>anything</i> to cover up what he had just admitted to, but he wouldn't let himself make a sound now. All he could think of was how pathetic felt after what he just did, but he didn't want to risk driving Felix away any further. He couldn't show his pride, his weakness, his sadness, anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned quietly, eyes closed tight and clenched shut forcefully. He almost wanted to cry, but no matter what, he couldn't do that either. </span></div></div>",

Felix's anger started depleting once he heard what the dragon had said to him. <i>\"The dragon actually likes me around him? But the way he acts... He's just conflicted with who he is and what the other fire dragons want him to be like,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"That half of him that wants to be like the other fire dragons is strong inside him. It's clear when it took so much to admit to me his true feelings. He needs help, but I don't know what to do for him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix sighed, \"I have to try something. He's very confused and lonely. If he knows it or not, he needs someone's help, and I don't think anyone else around here will do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix slowly approached the curled dragon who shill had his eyes clenched tight as he tried to fight off his emotions. Felix knelt beside the dragon. Felix wanted to help the dragon and calm him down, but Felix didn't know what to do or say. Felix placed his hand on the dragon's bicep which was the only thing he could touch from that position since the dragon was curled away from Felix. Felix was hoping stroking the dragon would calm him down, but the dragon only growled when Felix placed his hand on him. Felix quickly took his hand away and the dragon stayed curled. \"I want to help you,\" Felix informed the dragon, \"But I don't know how to. Every thing I can think of saying or doing would easily comfort a human, but it would only seem disgraceful to a fire dragon. Usually when a human touches another human who is distressed, it's to show the distressed person they're not alone and there is someone there for them. But dragons would want to be touched by a human. Even if that human was only doing it to comfort the dragon, the dragon would see it as a disgrace having a human touch them, am I correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right human,\" the dragon replied with his eyes closed and head still turned away, \"It would feel as a disgrace to us dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to help you, but I don't know how to. Is there a way I can help you?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way to help me,\" the dragon muttered, \"Just the act alone of helping makes me feel weak, makes me not a dragon. But that may be too late for me. I've already proven that I weak. The fact that... I like... having... human company shows that I am weak. And all the other things I've done is an embarrassment to my species. I'm now dragon. The dragon was struggling with those words. Part of him didn't want to say them, ordering him not to say things, but the dragon was sad and his thoughts and feelings were too strong to hold back. At least he wasn't crying and his voice was emotionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not weak and you're still a dragon,\" Felix informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... appreciate that, but I'm weak and not a dragon. You had to... help me. A dragon being helped by a human. It's weakness. With weakness, I can't be a dragon,\" the dragon replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still a dragon no matter how you act,\" Felix told the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have a body of a dragon, but I have to act like a dragon too to be a dragon,\" the dragon stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't gone through what you have, but I can tell you're conflicted, like there are two parts to you. I can tell their clashing with each other and you think you're weak. But think about it. Which part was stronger? Which part of you is winning the fight inside you, shouldn't that be the stronger half? Wouldn't that mean that the winning part of you is the strong one and not listening to it makes you weak?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was silent, thinking of an argument that would make the human's statement false. \"Listen, I like you too. We could be friends if...\" Felix started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be friends with a human,\" the dragon interrupted, \"It's forbidden. It's not dragon-like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet we like each other. That's friendship. If you were a human, would we be able to be friends then?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm a dragon and not a human,\" the dragon argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe there have been stories of humans and dragons becoming friends. I believe it is possible. You may think that friends make a person weaker, but it makes people stronger. No matter how weak or small, friends make a person stronger. They have more knowledge, power, and numbers. Friendship is not a weakness,\" Felix explained, \"I have many plans on escaping this place, but I was never able to do any of them whether is was because I wasn't physically strong enough, didn't have the numbers, or other reasons. With your help though because of your strength, size, and abilities, there might be a plan that we can do and we might be able to escape together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon didn't answer, he just collected his thoughts. \"I have to go know. I'll talk to you when I bring your next meal,\" Felix informed the dragon before he left. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Time passed slowly. After all that had happened, the dragon felt too tired to even force himself to move. He could barely even manage a growl the few times that a guard looked into his chamber, and had to settle for simply lying there. It was painful to hear them speak and laugh. Though they hadn't guessed the reason, it was clear that they thought he was broken. Though it was not their master who had done it, the thought of being treated like a failure of a dragon still felt worse than anything else he had experienced the entire time in his prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even know what he could do. The only time anything seemed to change in the room was whenever someone came in, and he didn't know how long it would take. It could've been night for all he knew, but despite his exhaustion, he didn't feel like it was the right time to sleep. All he could do was wait, and perhaps something might happen for the better the next time Felix came in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You're pathetic... Letting a human capture you, and then letting another one get to you like this... You were supposed to teach yourself to be a dragon, but instead, you've just become even weaker! If you keep going like this...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If you keep going like this, then you'll actually have someone as a friend.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon clenched its claw, scratching at the ground as he did.\"<i>You can't have him as a friend! Humans will never be close enough to dragons to be friends! He's not even important enough to speak with you! He's just a servant! Having such a human a friend is unacceptable, and even if humans weren't weak to begin with, dealing with such a small one is ridiculous!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Human or not, you want to speak with him more than anybody else, don't you?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Useless! Talking with humans is useless! You know that they can't do anything!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If he was as weak as you believed, then he would have died the first time you struck him.</i>\" The dragon's body tensed a bit at the memory, uncertain as to what he should feel about it, and whether or not Felix was injured by him. \"<i>He's the one who decided to stay after getting hit. He's already done a lot more than any other human, hasn't he?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>All of them are weak! The moment you escape, all of those cowards are dead!</i>\" The dragon gave another weak growl as he tried to move, to force himself up from the ground. \"<i>There is no way you can just sit around and wait for him to return! Just get out on your own!</i>\" He shook his head slowly as he let his claws grasp at the ground. He barely managed to push himself off the floor, trying to get into what he thought was a strong stance. He felt a slight bump as his head brushed against the ceiling, growling a little louder as he felt it. \"<i>That's right... You're a dragon. You're bigger and stronger than any of these puny creatures, and you can prove it!</i>\" His growling amplified as he put more effort into it, trying to gear himself up for a roar, but as he started, his voice faltered. He heard the door open, and he only managed to give a small one when he saw Felix walking in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix quietly looked at the dragon, his expression still shaken by the roar. However, after a moment's pause, he resumed moving into the room. The dragon stared back for a moment, trying to continue growling, but it fading completely as he saw Felix's steady approach. Felix pushed the cart up to the edge of his reach and barely paused for a moment before quietly continuing over the boundary, pushing it close to the dragon once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon hesitated. It was his reflex to strike at Felix for his audacity, but he felt as though he would fall if he tried to force his limbs to move again. \"<i>Don't you dare collapse again! You've shown enough weakness! Just get this creature away before he does any more!</i>\" He grunted a bit as his claw move towards Felix, but though he felt the back of it make contact, he couldn't make himself push any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked up to try to meet the dragon's eyes, letting himself step back as he was nudged. \"If you still need time, I can leave. But that probably won't make any of this easier.\" He let himself move a bit more, reaching down to grasp at the dragon's claw, but pausing before his hand touched. \"But I don't think either of us want to stay here, so... If you ever become willing, let me know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't... I can't accept help from you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you have to be strong, and because you have to be the one to handle everything.\" Felix quietly moved back to the cart, getting the dragon's meal off of it. \"Is it that important for you? To be a proper dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't gone through exactly the same things as you, but that doesn't mean I won't understand.\" Felix sighed as he sat down quietly, looking back up at the dragon. \"You have a lot to deal with, don't you?\" He looked at the dragon, only to get a slow nod in response. \"Whatever happened to you in the past isn't making this any easier to handle. Are you certain that you have to do this?\" The dragon didn't even move this time, and all Felix could do was wait for a response, watching as the dragon seemed to lose himself in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He's trying... But maybe it's too much for him to take in. He wants to be my friend, and that part of him is obviously stronger right now, but the other part of him won't allow it, and it keeps holding him back. Should I ask him to ignore that part? It hasn't worked so far, but maybe with support, he could learn to block it out. On the other hand, he's probably been like that for a while, and he only started talking to me when that part of him was satisfied. Maybe I should try satisfying that part of him, too. If it's enough to let us talk, and to get him to listen, maybe it's worth a shot.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he had decided on what he wanted to try, Felix didn't speak immediately. He wanted to give the dragon enough time to decide something for himself if it was possible. However, after another minute, it was clear that the dragon was still arguing with himself, and Felix spoke to snap him out of it. \"If it's too much for you to accept my help, let's do things on your terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon stopped for a moment to look at Felix, uncertain of what he might have meant. However, both parts of him were listening carefully, both eager for any advantage that the boy could give them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix quietly placed the food down at the dragon's feet, going back to the cart. As he noticed the confused look that the dragon had upon its face, he paused to speak, his hands still on the water bowl. \"For now... What if you help me instead? If you help me, and I agree to serve you or something in exchange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was quiet for a moment as he bent his neck down, picking up his food but keeping his eyes on Felix the entire time. Servants were definitely allowed, but dragons should kidnap them or threaten them, not bargain for them. However, even seeing the opportunity seemed like enough to satisfy both parts of him. \"It... It might work, but not for long. Humans can serve for a while, but they don't tend to live long if they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix put the bowl of water down nearby, speaking from a short distance away as the dragon kept its head near the ground. \"I'll take my chances. I'd much rather serve a friend than serve William.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wouldn't... We wouldn't be friends.\" The dragon shook his head hesitantly and pulled away. \"I can let you serve me, but we wouldn't be friends.\" His words were half-hearted as he said them, not wanting to admit them as they escaped his mouth. Even if Felix could accept that, the dragon didn't know if he could. It was the best solution for one part of him, but the other was saddened at the thought. Even if they could get out together, if it meant losing what seemed like the first friend he could make for years, he didn't know if it was worth it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix sighed, rubbing his face. He sat down on the cold stone floor, the dragon watched him with his bright eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans. . . humans and dragons. . . are not that different you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon let out a growl, but Felix didn't even flinch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard this story once. It was about a young dragon, maybe about 11 or 12.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix closed his eyes, remembering the story he was told by one of the older slaves. She had been the closing thing to a mother until she died two years ago. The dragon snorted, but settled down, listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It goes that the dragon was flying home during a storm, and even though he was strong, the storm threw him around until he crash into the ground.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon stared at Felix, wondering why he was telling him this story. Felix just sat on the stone floor, eyes closed as he recalled the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A man that lived in a small hut with his wife nearby saw the dragon go down and went out and took him home. The man nursed the dragon back to health inside his barn. The wife, though, kept telling her husband to kill the dragon. For if he didn't, it would surly kill them when it was healthy again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon snorted, thinking how the wife was correct. No dragon would let a snack go, even if it did help him. The dragon stopped though, his eyes landed on Felix. The dragon could not see him seriously hurting this human. Felix continued the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the dragon was healthy again, he offered the man to come to his lair and to take some treasure, a thanks for helping him. The wife had screamed and yelled at him to stay, and that when getting to the dragon's lair, the man would surly be eaten. 'You will stay here!! The dragon trusts you and while he is not looking, slay him!! We shall take his head to the king and be rewarded' the wife had screeched. Unknown to her and her husband, the dragon was listening in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix moved from his sitting position to laying down on his back, arms behind his head. The dragon looked at Felix and spoke <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, the man agreed but the dragon killed him and his annoying wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix smiled slightly and snorted, his eyes still closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No actually, the dragon was about to kill them both but the man spoke to his wife 'I shall not kill him, for he is my friend! If you can not see that we can be friends, then you are not the women I thought I married.' The dragon, who was still hiding was touched. His human friend had stood up to his wife to protect the dragon. The wife, though, was outraged. She quickly grabbed the knife on the table and brought it down on the man's shoulder. The dragon lept out from where he was hiding and quickly killed the women. Lifting up the man, the dragon flew quickly back to his lair and took care of his wound. When the man was well again, the dragon turned to him and said, 'My dear friend, your wife is dead and I'm sure the village near by had bunt your house down so. . .' The dragoon circled the man and playfully swished his tail by the man's feet. 'so you are my prisoner now and you shall live here. I brought several servants to do what ever you want' and at that time, three beautiful young ladies walked from around a corner. The man smiled and the dragon, the man, and the three ladies live happily together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix finished his story, laughing inside at the dragons face. The dragon had a confused and skeptical look in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me this?\" Felix cracked open one of his eyes before closing it and shrugging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just 'cause, I mean the dragon and the man become friends even though both of their species are telling them not to. They even save each others lives.\" The dragon looked at Felix, so many emotions swirled in his eyes, they couldn't be told apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Dragon was stupid. If he had his own lair and had human slaves, then he lived alone, no clan at all. He was probably poor and soon died after this story.\" Felix stood up suddenly, and turned to the dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what!! You are weak! You're just a weakling who can't do anything for himself\" Felix yelled at the dragon, his own anger flying out in waves. The dragon growled, how dare a human, even Felix, yell at him as if he was better then him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to know the reason you're weak? It's because you wont accept friendship!\" Felix now paced in front the dragon, just out of reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably wouldn't even make friends with another fire dragon because you think all emotions are weak, but that itself just makes you weak.\" Felix turned on the dragon again, his eyes ablaze. The dragon growled out in anger and thrashed his paw out, trying to at least injure the boy, but Felix was out of reach. Felix glared before turning and stomping to the metal door. Just before he opened the door, the dragon called out <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was this dragons name? The one from the story.\" Felix didn't turn his head or even move to say he had heard, but he answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Dragon's name was Freith and the man was Rodoc\" Then Felix left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Freith and Rodoc?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon's eyes widened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreith was the elder from his old clan, and he had told stories of his friend named Rodoc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Was Rodoc human? Freith had never said he was human, but he never said he was a dragon either. Freith had said he was small and could not breath fire or fly, but I always thought Rodoc was just a small, old dragon. . . could he have really been Freith's human friend?</i></span></div></div>",

By letting Felix become a servant, to the dragon, it would comfort both parts because the dragon would be closer to Felix, but still satisfy the fire dragon side who sees humans as weak beings that could only serve dragons. The fact that the dragon couldn't bring himself to see Felix as a friend showed that his stubborn side still was strong enough to make decisions for the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I've seen people with conflicting sides within themselves before. He wouldn't be able to chose the other just over night, and forcing his to chose one side won't work,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"The process has to be gradual. I have to satisfy both sides and the dragon will chose a more preferable side eventually. The more I stay with him, the more likely he might realize I'm a friend and that it's alright to befriend a human. That side of him is strongest at the moment.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd still be my servant, even if I can't accept you as a friend?\" the fire dragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may not be as accepting, but I see you as a friend, even if you are sometimes stubborn and dominating,\" Felix informed the dragon, \"Besides, I'd rather serve you that Lord William. Believe it or not, but Lord William is a worst master than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know that, you never had a fire dragon for a master,\" the fire dragon said. He said it as if he was trying to convince the human not to be his servant. Sure, he wanted to be closer to the human, but he was worried would his other side might do to a human servant. He was worried he might be a cruel monster and too demanding of the human who had the possibility of being his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you act the same way you do to me now, then I might be relatively safer than with Lord William,\" Felix stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm too soft and weak,\" the fire dragon muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix wanted to assure the dragon he wasn't weak for being kind, but had explained it too many times and needed to wait for the message to sink in and for the dragon to figure that out himself. \"Also, you're the closest thing to a friend and I feel like I need to escape with you, even if I have to be your servant to do it. You're the person I trust the most. For some reason, being near you gives me hope of escape. I don't know if it's because you're a strong, powerful, and defiant creature, or because I feel semi-comfortable around you, but I do feel like we have the power to escape,\" Felix told the dragon, \"Besides, I've seen masters become friends with their servants. It's never happened to Lord William, but some of the other Lords that have visited had friends who were once servants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was surprised that the human trusted the dragon and still had hope that they could become friends, when the dragon himself didn't have much hope. \"And if that never happens?\" the fire dragon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't force you to do anything. You have your own mind and you're far too powerful to boss around. I now you have two conflicting minds and over time, you'll decide for yourself which one is your true self. You're the one who chooses who you are and all I can do is wait for your decision,\" Felix informed the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you'd still be willing to be my servant?\" the fire dragon questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then so be it. Lord William is no longer your master and when we escape, you are mine,\" the dragon stated, \"Now, how do you suggest we escape this place?\"</span></div></div>",

While he was relieved to have the dragon's cooperation, it hardly meant that the most difficult part was over. There were still so many problems that could come up, and even his cooperation wasn't enough to guarantee an escape. Still, it was a relief that he could make plans with the dragon, and the thought that he might get out soon was enough to motivate Felix as he slowly turned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon watched as Felix quietly looked around the room, uncertain why he had suddenly gone silent or what he was doing. \"Well? What is it? If you've got an idea, then say it, Felix- er... servant.\" The dragon seemed to pause for a moment upon saying it, his movements stopping as tried to figure out his own reason for hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He's already agreed that he's your servant, so treat him like one! There's no need to use his name, it shouldn't be important to you!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It doesn't matter if he's a servant or not. You know his name, and you want it to be clear when you're talking to him. If you get more servants, you don't want to get them mixed up, do you? Especially not with your first one, and the one that's here because he actually...</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon quickly shook its head, realizing he had been quiet long enough for Felix to notice. He growled a bit, hoping to keep Felix from making a comment. However, Felix seemed to take it all in stride, simply nodding towards the dragon as he spoke. \"Call me whatever is more comfortable for you. And would you prefer I call you 'master', then?\" Though his tone was slightly sarcastic, the smirk that suddenly appeared upon the dragon's face made it clear that he didn't take it as such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Felix could say anything else, the dragon gave an amused snort. \"It would be appropriate, wouldn't it?\" He bent his neck, letting his head move closer, a bit of smoke obscuring the space between the two of them. A quiet coughing filled the room after as Felix tried to wave it out of his face. \"It will do until I have a... it will do for now.\" The dragon fell silent again, and even through the smoke, it was clear to Felix that the dragon was deep in thought again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It looks like neither side of him has a problem with the nickname, at least. I hope there's a way to keep him from calling me servant, but it's still better than anything that William's called me.</i>\" Felix turned away from the dragon, letting him think in silence as he took another look around the room. \"<i>Now, let's see... The guards said that the dragon was shipped in through a large door, but even William wouldn't be able to deal with too many people around here knowing about it. The passage they brought him in through is probably hidden, and it's definitely one way out. It shouldn't be very well guarded, there aren't very many other reasons for it to be used. The guards outside his cell don't look in here often enough to be a problem, or I'd never have gotten to talk this much with him. If we can use that, then the biggest problem is probably getting him loose...</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix kept trying to find some sign of how they might've moved the dragon in, but besides the doorway that he had entered through, it was difficult to make out anything in the limited. \"<i>It doesn't look like there's another way in, but there has to be somewhere. Maybe it's hidden, or blends into the wall or something. I'll have to ask the dragon about it once he's a bit more talkative. As long as he knows the way he came in, I can just focus on getting his bindings off. He might've worn them out somewhat. Even if he hasn't broken them, he's been violent enough to at least damage them. If that hasn't been enough, he might be able to try melting them. Dragon flame is suppose to be one of the hottest things in existence. If he can do that, then even strong chains shouldn't be a problem.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to open his mouth, but before any words came out, Felix stopped, his lips slowly sliding closed. \"<i>He's never tried breathing fire, has he? If he could, he would've tried using it to escape before. And knowing him, it's probably another thing that a 'proper dragon' needs to be able to do. If I ask him about it, it could be a touchy subject. I wish I knew more about dragons right now. It would sure come in handy when I had to talk with him...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix's gaze went back to the dragon as his eyes followed the chains from the wall back to the dragon's body. \"Regardless of what else we do, we have to get you loose first. The chains are still on tight, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately.\" The dragon gave a grunt as he pulled at his arm, the chains fastened to it loudly rattling as they shook, clanging loudly but holding tight. \"It's been rather annoying to always have these things on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hold still for a moment? I want to check something out.\" Felix moved close to the dragon's arm, his hands gripping onto one of the chains as he approached. The dragon pulled back slightly, Felix stopping as he saw the questioning look that the dragon had. \"It's not to comfort you or anything like that. I just want to look at the chains. That's okay, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon stared at Felix for a moment before simply lowing its arm, letting it down in front of him. \"Fine. If you can think of a way to get these things off, do it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a minute for Felix to look over the spot, but he shook his head as his hands let go. \"It's no good. It's not going to just slip off, there's not enough room for that. Unless the others are different somehow, it looks like we'd need a key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an odd noise in the air as Felix let go of the chain, following it back to its base. The dragon had let out something between a grunt and a sigh as he had heard the news. \"Can't you steal one or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if I had any idea where to find the right one. I'll keep my eyes open, but we shouldn't plan on any miracles here. How about you? Have you been able to get any looser or something? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon growled as he gave a sharp pull, lunging forwards as he did. The heavy chains shook violently, nearly smacking into Felix as they kept the dragon from pulling himself any further. \"You've already seen for yourself! If I could just pull these out, I would've been long gone! What do you think I've been doing, jingling these for fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you've just been pulling... But even if it didn't do anything to loosen the chains, it might've done something.\" Felix began following the chain to the wall a bit nervously, uncertain about how hard the chains would hit him if the dragon was still jerking them around and causing them to whip everywhere. \"If you've been pulling the entire time, it could be weak where it's attached to the wall. Give me a moment to check.\" Felix swallowed quietly as the clattering around him dimmed, the chains stilling as he approached the spot where it was anchored. He took his time as he examined the end of the chain, hoping it was damaged enough that he wouldn't have to risk having another conversation that could cause the dragon to hesitate. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite everything that the dragon had done, the chains were somehow undamaged. They had obviously been reinforced to secure the dragon, and it was clear that they were still doing their job well. However, it was clear that the ends of the chains were not in the same condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix's pulse started to race as he turned to the dragon. There was definitely a chance to get out now, and the knowledge that freedom was close caused him to quiver in his excitement. \"Can you take a look at this? I think it might be weaker here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's eyes jumped at the words as it tried to turn around, the chains tangling against his body as he did. Despite the numerous bindings now resting against his side, however, the dragon managed to turn enough, pushing his head towards the wall. It bumped Felix to the side somewhat, but the dragon was able to bend far enough to get a good look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's the thing look different from the chains? I thought that they were all made together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place has been used as a prison before, so the anchors are probably older. They probably got new chains for you, but they still needed to use the old anchors to keep you in place. I think they're built into the wall, so they can't replace those very easily. It looks like you pulled it a bit, so it's not totally embedded very deeply in the walls anymore. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon grinned as he lifted his arm towards the anchor. \"Good. If these are supposed to be for weaker creatures, then this will be simple.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" Felix barely was able to speak in time, and the dragon's claws jerked suddenly to the side. A loud thunk echoed through the room as his claw took out a chunk of the wall nearby, and the sound of the stone breaking off and onto the ground was clear. Felix nervously turned towards the doorway for a moment, absolutely silent in the worry that the guards had heard something. However, after the few seconds of silence, the dragon quickly turned back to Felix, growling with an irritated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I can finally get these things off, and you don't want me to? You'd better have a good reason for it, <i>slave</i>.\" The dragon's glare made it clear that he was irritated, and Felix had to pause before he could muster a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we need to be sure we can escape before you try. If you break them now and we can't get out, they'll just replace them with something that can hold you. If they figure out that you can break free, we're sunk. We need to make sure that we can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the hard part? They brought me in through a huge tunnel, and nobody else was there but the ones who caught me! We'll just get out the same way! Even if there are people this time around, they're not going to be able to catch me again!\" The dragon was getting more and more rowdy, its movements more obvious as its head stood close to Felix. \"If you're going to wait around while there's a clear way out of here, I'm going to leave you behind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You've finally got a chance to get out! The humans aren't going to catch you off-guard again, so you won't get captured again! Just get out before that chance vanishes!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how to get into the tunnel, then?\" Felix took another look around the room, still nervous that the guards had heard the noise. Although the sound in the room never seemed to leave it, he could never stop worrying that the two of them would be overheard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's right there!\" The dragon jerked his head towards the enormous doorway he had been brought in through. His body was clearly lunging harder now, the anchors visibly straining. \"It might be blended in, but you should at least be able to tell there's a passageway!\" The dragon took a quick sniff before snorting at Felix. \"It's pretty obvious, there aren't exactly many other places fresh air gets in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix turned to the doorway that the dragon was brought through. \"So we'd have to get through two stone doors before we could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stone is nothing! That thin door can't hold me! The tunnel's available, and I can get free, so stop wasting my time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I want to get out of here as much as you do!\" Felix's voice was rather strained, his excitement now replaced by his anxiety. He was still shaking somewhat, but it was due to his uncertainty on whether or not he'd be able to convince the dragon of anything. There was clearly no part of the dragon that wanted to stay around his captors for any longer than necessary. \"But rushing out right now could end with a lot of trouble. Just give me a day to look around and try to make sure it's safe. The guards will still be outside, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's growl grew even louder, and Felix was forced to stop as he heard it. \"All right. Give me a few hours. I'll... I'll figure out something to distracted the guards, and I'll see if I can get any supplies or anything that would be useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe volume in the room slowly rose as the dragon looked at Felix before starting to look past him, glaring at the doorway. \"<i>That's enough! You've listened to him for far too long! If you're going to let your one chance slip away again, then you've sunken far too low! Just get out of here, and let him follow like a slave should!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But he's been right so far, hasn't he? Listening to him hasn't hurt you before, and it won't hurt this time... Just trust him.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You've already been enough of a coward, and you're going to drag him with you! Stop letting him decide everything and just act like the creature in charge should!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was slightly shaky, but it was quite loud \"I... I have to get away...\" Felix hesitated as he heard the words, and his body felt ready to jump aside the moment that the dragon moved. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I can't... I can't wait any longer!\" The dragon's voice was nervous, almost panicked as he turned to the wall. He quickly shifted his arm, the chain tangling around him as he did, but he ignored it as he tried to get it to the wall. Felix tried to open his mouth, but there was only a momentary pause before the dragon's claw tore into the wall, fiercely digging at the anchor. The clang of metal against his sharp claws echoed through the open room, and Felix quickly turned away, his eyes looking at the door in worry. However, the guards didn't seem to notice, dismissing the sound as more of the dragon's usual thrashing. Felix couldn't bring himself to speak or to interrupt, the dragon no longer looking at him. All of his energy seemed focused on the walls and chains instead, not wanting to spend a minute more shackled to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a couple of minutes before the hook snapped free from the wall, the dragon's chains clattering loudly on the ground. With a grin, the dragon moved on to the next one, tearing at it more enthusiastically. Though his face was fierce, Felix could see some level of satisfaction in the dragon's grin as he quickly continued, the chains each falling to the floor, one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>See? This is nothing! If you had actually made an effort, the humans couldn't even hold you for a day!</i>\" The dragon continued, a few clear gashes deep in the wall before the last few chains fell down. The dragon gave a relaxed sigh as he turned around, an obvious grin on his face as he looked towards Felix. Though the boy had retreated to a safe distance, he nervously approached the dragon again as he finished his job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I could do it.\" The dragon gave a small, proud chuckle as he turned to Felix, approaching slowly. For the first time, the dragon stepped over the line that had marked its reach. Felix felt his pulse quickening as the dragon approached, his head dangerously close. Though he had gotten close to the dragon before, it felt even more threatening knowing the dragon could easily chase him down in an instant. \"All that's left is a couple of weak doors and a short run, and I'll be away from this place.\" The dragon turned to try to face the doorway, slowly creeping towards, his limbs a little shaky as he moved. \"I'm looking forward to moving again... This place is way too small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded slowly, trying to figure out what he could still do as the dragon moved past him. With the chains off, there was no time to think of a plan. The moment someone entered the room, they'd know the dragon was loose, and they might even figure out he had been speaking to it. \"Ye-yeah... But you still have to be careful... You don't want to get caught again when we try to get out... I don't want-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should just be grateful I'm taking you along. A human like you doesn't get this chance often, so be glad that you're on my good side.\" The dragon almost immediately snapped at Felix, before pausing again. His first instinct was to simply grab the boy, but the worried look on the human's face made him hesitate. \"So... are you coming? I mean, you'd better be ready to run!\" Though the dragon was doing his best to speak like an eminent tone, he couldn't help but hesitate a bit. Now that he was loose, it seemed odd to still even be talking to the human. Part of him knew that he should've already been breaking through the door in front of him, or grabbing the human on his way out, but instead, he was waiting for the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Stop worrying! You already know that he's your servant! Just drag him along if you have to! You shouldn't worry about him leaving you!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You want him to come on his own, don't you? You're only getting out now because he's trying to help you, and you still want him to help. You don't want to risk driving him off...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked to the door before turning to the dragon. It was easy to see the hesitation in the creature's eyes, and it wasn't hard to see that the dragon still couldn't handle the situation very comfortably. \"Yeah... I'm coming... We don't have a lot of time now, so...\" He paused for a moment before an idea struck, him carefully moving closer. \"So would you mind granting me the honor of riding on your back? I don't think I can run as fast as you can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just this one time...\" The dragon bent down a little awkwardly as Felix approached. As he felt Felix's arm reaching to try to climb on, he gave a small jerk. However, Felix expected it, holding tight to the dragon's scales as he moved. Though they were a bit rough, they made a good grip for him as he tries to get onto the dragon's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You just got loose, and the first thing you're doing is letting a human ride you like some kind of mule? This is insane! You can't-</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You have to. Unless you want to admit that the human can get out faster than you can? He's the one that's asking for permission this time. After what he's done, doing a small favor like that isn't a problem, is it?  You want him with you right now, and you can handle helping your slave out. It's just the easiest way for you to do it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked at the dragon's expression as he thought, but he carefully crept along, trying to do his best to find a spot. It was rough, and though it was difficult to get comfortable, he managed to climb on, his hands carefully clasping around the dragon's sides. \"Will... Will this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon turned quickly, Felix gaping as he was nearly thrown off. However, his foot caught upon a couple of scales, firm in place. He winced slightly as he felt the scales scratching a bit at his body, but he did his best to stand it. \"Just hold on, human.\" Not wanting to take another moment to think, the dragon charged at the doorway. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of the door breaking clean off of its hinges alerted the guards to the dragon's escape. One immediately gave a shout upon seeing the dragon loose, clearly panicking as the others rushed to try and get to a safe distance.  \"The beast's loose! Get someone in here, fast!\" However, before anything more could be said, the dragon lept onto the guards within his reach, his weight forcing them to the ground and his claws tearing at them for a moment before he continued charging onwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more guards rushed in, trying to get a couple of chains over the dragon. However, they were unable to get close enough to wrap the dragon within them. With a fierce snarl, the dragon charged into one of them, knocking him aside. Though one of the chain caught against his arm, the dragon simply continued pushing through, pulling the guards along as he crashed through the wall. Felix could barely hang on as he felt bits of rubble falling around, but the dragon's scales held him firmly as he bucked around in his seat. The dragon paused to give an enormous roar, shaking off the chains and giving a slash at one of the guards holding it. The guard gave a shout as he was thrown to the side, none of them equipped or ready to deal with the dragon so suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry! There'll be more people coming!\" Felix tried to shout at the dragon, but his voice was lost among the shouts of the guards and at the dragon's attacks. Though he could have easily moved on, he seemed to linger just to take the time to strike and bite at the guards. \"We can't stay too long, the people coming will have weapons and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon paused just long enough to give another roar, clawing and biting at the guards within his reach. The chains fell to the ground soon after, but the dragon continued to remain in place, grinning as he looked over the scene. The guards that were still standing seemed to be hesitant to approach him again, and the many littered around the floor were unable to move. The dragon simply gave a small, deep chuckle, his muzzle moving towards one of them as the man tried to back away. He easily snapped at the man, his mouth biting fiercely. The wounds that he caused were clear, blood starting to flow onto the stone floor before he pulled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, dragon... We can't waste more time here...\" Felix's voice was barely audible, but it was loud enough to be heard over the growls in the air. The dragon gave a small turn, glaring at Felix for the moment. He paused, almost thoughtful again, but the sound of more guards drove him back to awareness. The clanking armor and shouts of numerous people was enough to even cause the dragon to move again, and while he hesitated for a moment more, he took off into the tunnels afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them moved wordlessly for a time, Felix too nervous to say more than he had already. Though Felix found it hard to speak after what he had just seen the dragon do, he tried his best to keep his voice calm. With all of the time that he had spent with the dragon, he had never seen the creature do that much damage. While it was chained, it had been possible to speak and reason somewhat. However, now that it was loose, it was quite clear that he could do damage to humans quite easily. Felix had to give a small wince as he was reminded of the wounds that the dragon had inflicted onto his back. The look of satisfaction that the dragon currently held on his face did little to alleviate him of his worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after a couple of minutes, the dragon had begin to slow down. His expression had changed a bit to something that Felix couldn't recognize. While he remained silent for a while longer, Felix couldn't help but begin to worry. He swallowed before he spoke, his voice a little shaky this time. \"Do you remember the way through here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that hard to find out... There aren't many paths large enough, and I can follow the fresh air out.\" Felix could only give a sigh of relief when he heard the dragon speak. Although it was a bit impatient, it didn't seem hostile or upset. It was just a relief to know that the dragon would still speak with him after he had easily charged through a few people, even a little sadistic along the way. However, despite how he had treated the guards, the dragon still seemed comfortable enough with the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good... Do you know where you want to go after we get out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix gasped a bit as he felt the dragon's footing stumble for a moment. The dragon quickly caught himself and continued moving steadily, but Felix had to struggle a little bit to stay firm against the dragon's back. The dragon spoke again, though his voice was a bit more impatient this time. \"Far away from here! I'll try and find my way back to my cave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't that where they found you? It might not be safe to go back there... Maybe we should look for another place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon opened his mouth to speak again, but he paused for a moment, standing absolutely still. The dragon's senses perked for a moment, and the look on his face changed as he closed his eyes for a moment. Felix could only watch with confusion as he turned his head backwards, looking back through the tunnels. Neither of them moved for a few seconds before the dragon broke into a run. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The great creature, despite having rendered Felix speechless with fear, was backed up as far against the wall as possible, so that its raven black shape melted in and out of the darkness surrounding it. Felix took a wary step towards the massive form; immediately, he was met by the crippling stare of two violet eyes, which burned with an intense and bestial fear. It was obvious the dragon was desperately afraid, which made it even more dangerous for Felix. If he didn't keep his mind sharp, it could cost him his life, as none of the guards were going to risk their own skins for his meager existence, which, he reminded himself, was all too easily replaceable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving with the dexterity and careful attention to detail of an assassin, Felix lifted a piece of meat into his trembling hands; it was a large cut, not of the finest quality, but nothing more than a morsel to the dragon. Approaching as far as he dared, his gaze once again locked with the huge violet eyes, which, he noticed, had a mix of fiery pink fused into the color; but this was of little consequence if he got killed. Yet he found himself drawn to the hypnotic power of those eyes, and how they were not of a savage monster brought into confusion, but the misled and frightened glance of a lonely child, enslaved in a harsh and alien environment with no hope or comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped back into his own consciousness. Felix was particularly clever for his age, and had consulted books describing the actions and perils of magical beings. The dragon-stare was one such ability, a mesmeric force wielded by the dragon and able to virtually transfix any adversary given the intent; but how could an infant use such a power, and, if it had intended to entrance and consume him, why had it not done so moments earlier? In his daze, Felix dropped the meat, causing a noticeable echo which rebounded in the hollow humidity of the prison's interior. The dragon flinched, but didn't make a move. Felix, rooted to the spot momentarily, retreated from the creature, keeping level eye contact but never directly meeting the dragon's vision for fear of the dragon-stare taking a more potent effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon moved a little, and Felix saw for the first time the real brutality of the chain it was attached to, blunt and rusted into the wall with no mileage for free movement, ensuring the dragon was perpetually constrained. First one, then another foreleg moved, the diminutive but nonetheless intimidating muscles flexing as if they had been cramped for days, which was entirely possible given the situation. As it approached the meat, the dragon was always aware of Felix, nervously training one eye upon him whilst the other gazed longingly at the food. Finally satisfied, it voraciously gulped down the meat, giving an opening for Felix to make a move. Or to test if he was a threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking some more of the altogether stale meat, Felix decided he should familiarize himself as a giver of nourishment, as to help him stay alive, and, abandoning fear, he gently tossed it in the dragon's direction. The dragon startled in alarm, then settled, nosed the food with its snout, then greedily swallowed it up. Felix repeated the process several times, slowly reducing the distance between the food and himself, until the dragon was physically prevented from going any further, the chain biting into its neck. Now pushing the cart, which still carried a sufficient amount of meat, towards the dragon, Felix could see the overwhelming hunger it displayed. Had Lord William been so blind to taking care of a creature with the potential he had envisaged? Evidently so, and that made it even worse thinking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon strained on the its malicious leash, but even with all its dwindled yet considerable strength, the chain held resolutely to the wall. Felix stopped just so that the dragon could reach the food and water on the cart, but no more. The dragon snapped up the food, making a strange jerk with its head to consume the larger pieces, until the cart was empty. It then proceeded to drain the water bowl with amazing speed, like it had been deprived of any kind of sustenance for a long while. At least a little eased from its predicament, but by no means trusting Felix, the dragon returned to its shadowy corner, but not so much as to make itself intangible from view. As it did so, Felix, pulling away the cart, was able to get a proper look at the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only now he had a chance to distinguish its gender, as there had been no opportunity before, but as the dragon turned from him, there was no sign of outer genitalia. A female then, as it had no significant horns visible either, with a deep blue underside and malnourished body frame. Hardly the terror Lord William wanted it to be, but still a mighty creature. It was only as he closed the cage door, and proceeded to return to his fateful service as little more than a useless wretch, that Felix first was addled by a feeling, deeply conjured in the deepest catacombs of his mind, that blossomed with swift resolve into his heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSympathy. </span></div></div>",

He needed to give it a chance to live its life, to not suffer in the way that he does every day, yet he had no ideas on how to carry out his plan. The chain that the reptile was attached to was fixed into the wall, with no locks or anything to unattach it. He couldn't get too close to the chain either to break it, for fear of his life. Even if he didn't get murdered by the beast he would likely be seen by one of the many guards around the castle and be executed on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to give up thinking on the matter for now and try to get some sleep, given the fact that he was only allowed five hours of rest time every night. He couldn't sleep at all though, despite the fact that he was exhausted from waking up early and running around doing various jobs throughout the day. His eyes restlessly moved about the room, it was made out of stone, and there was only one entrance to it, which was locked. On each side of the room there were many rows of bunks for the many slaves around the castle. There could easily be as many as one hundred people in the room with him. Most of the room's occupants were asleep, and wouldn't notice if he made his way towards the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached his hand under his bunk, which was lowest towards the floor, and pulled out a rock. It didn't seem any different than any other rock, but this one was special. He had found it once when he was out in the castle's courtyard. It had one sharp edge that could easily be used for picking a lock. He figured he could escape from this room if he tried.. He quickly dispelled the idea though, knowing that if he did make his way out of the room, he would have nowhere to go after that, and would probably be caught and captured quickly by one of he knights on a night patrol.  And once caught, he would likely be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed the rock back down under his bunk without making a sound, and turned himself over so he faced the wall, trying to give himself a few hours of sleep.</span></div></div>",

He pushed the cart into the cell, watching the dragon with confusion, caution, and sadness due to its crying. Felix glanced over his shoulder and noticed the guards were watching him, probably to make sure he didn't try anything like trying to free and escape with the dragon.

This was in part due to their larger wing span, which was about one and a half length of the average dragon breed's wing span.  Because of its large wings and sleeker frame, it was also one of the fastest dragon breeds and the best in midair maneuverability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud dragons were also very fierce protectors of their territory and would not allow any intrusion into it lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix felt the dragon's gold eyes glaring at him while he pushed the food off the cart, watching to see if this human would try to hurt him like the others did.

He hated every time he went in there because the dragon was something he feared more than Lord William. The dragon was a vicious creature and it had tried to kill him the first time he entered the cell. All he was trying to do was feed it and it had to go and try killing him for no apparent reason. Plus, every time he heard stories of guards being killed by the creature, scared Felix even more. he sure didn't want to be entering a cell of a creature that seemed to have no remorse in ripping people to shreds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he was frightened of the dragon, he knew he had to go in there and feed it. Otherwise, it would be certain death for him by Lord William's orders. At least with the dragon there was a possibility that Felix could get in and out of the cell quick enough for the dragon not to harm him, and that was exactly what Felix did. He continued to enter the cell everyday at least two to three times a day. He would quickly push the cart over to the dragon without going all the way to the edge of its reach. (He would just get far enough so that he could push it away from him and it would enter the dragon's reach. He would also have the filled water on the cart too.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was evening and it was time for the dragon's last dinner. Felix's entire body shook nervously at the guard unlocked the cell door for him. Every second that passed was more and more nerve raking for Felix and with his pale skin, some would have thought he had died of pure terror. Felix took many deep breaths in order to calm down enough to go into the cell and quickly push in the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door opened, Felix was ready and he hurried as fast as he could to the dragon. Luckily, the dragon was always less aggressive during the night runs. However, the dragon was still at the edge its reach waiting for Felix to approach. The dragon stood tall and proud which made it very large and intimidating to Felix even though he had over heard from the guards that the dragon was only about Felix's own age. The dragon was easily twenty feet tall, maybe more and it was impossible not afraid of something as large as that that was still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was extremely curious of the human that kept feeding it. The human was obviously frightened out of its mind. Yet, it still entered the dragon's territory. The dragon wanted to know the reason behind the human's behavior, even if it meant capturing it and letting it stay in its territory for a little while longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon paced as it always did in wait for the humans to come. It had the timing down pat since it happened at the same times every day. Soon, the dragon found the door opening around evening. The dragon knew it would be the last visit of the humans and it knew it would be the human that brought the food and drink. The dragon knew that the human would try to get in and out of its territory as fast as it could and the dragon devised a crafty plan in capturing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon usually lied in wait at the edge using the full length of the chains that held it to the ground. This time, however, it didn't use the whole length. It was hoping the human would be going to fast to realize that the dragon had done this and would enter its reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, the human rushed to a certain spot, the same as usual, and pushed. The cart usually made it to the dragon, but this time the dragon was farther back and the cart didn't reach it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Felix's horror, the cart didn't reach it to the dragon's paw like it usually did. This meant that he had to go closer and push it again. He was in too much of a hurry and too frightened to see that the dragon was not at the edge. Felix hurried and as soon as Felix's hands touched the handle of the cart, he noticed the dragon hurry to the same spot he was in. He was within the dragon's reach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's hand tried to slash at Felix. Well, Felix thought the dragon was trying to slash when in actuality, it was trying to capture him. Felix suddenly, pushed himself away from the cart which caused the bowl of water to fall and spill on the ground. However, it kept Felix from being hit by the paw. Felix scrambled to his feet and hurried to the exit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was soon out of the dragon's reach, but he ran into Lord William. Felix fell backward again and was surprised to see his master in the cell. \"Master, what are you...?\" Felix began to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've come to check on you progress. It's a good thing I did, because you had spilled the water bowl,\" Lord William replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry master, I'll get another one and...\" Felix started to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not get another one. You will fill that one up again,\" Lord William ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mater,\" Felix argued, \"The bowl is in the dragon's reach. It will kill me and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it look like I care if you live or die. You are nothing but a slave,\" Lord William replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just let me get another bowl and...\" Felix pleaded, but his pleads fell short when Lord William smacked him across the face once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix fell to the ground and Lord William said, \"You will fill the bowl up with this water.\" Lord William set a jug of water by Felix before kicking Felix in the stomach twice. \"You will not leave this room and you will not be fed until the dragon is fed. The dragon is much more useful to me than your pathetic life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William stormed out of the room and Felix cried in a curled ball for a long moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was shocked at what it saw. The human was beat by the evil man, and it gave the dragon an answer to why the human kept going in its territory. <i>\"The human has no other choice. That evil one is making the human feed me and give me water or it beats the human,\"</i> the dragon realized, <i>\"The evil man is doing the same thing to the human as he is doing with me. The evil man keeps trying to make me do things I don't want to do by hurting me. That's what he must be doing to this human too, but the human has given into the evil man, because it can't handle pain like I can.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the human got back up with a jug of water which only conformed the dragon's speculation. The human clutched its side, obviously badly injured. It was terrified, yet it continued to approach the dragon. Eventually, the human knelt beside the bowl and poured in the water. The dragon only looked down at the human as it collapsed after the task was done. The dragon lowered its head closer and the human was obviously unconscious. </span></div></div>",

We have more in common than I thought.  I can take him into my territory for the evening.\"</i>  The dragon nodded to its thoughts.  Carefully, the dragon lowered its head to the human and picked him up by his shirt.  It moved the boy to its side and laid him against part of its body that wasn't held down by chains.  It then lowered its head next to Felix, holding him snugly against the warm torso.  The dragon saw Felix had a content smile on his face before the dragon fell asleep as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came and  Felix slowly woke at his usual time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I don't want to wake up,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"I feel so warm right now in my bed.  I haven't been this comfortable in bed since . . . I can't even recall.  Even if it means a kick, this warmth is worth it.\"</i>  Felix pressed slightly into the scaly body and realized this wasn't his bed.  Quickly his eyes shot open and he saw the large dragon head at his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh Gods, it's going to eat me for a morning snack!\"</i> Felix thought, breathing heavily.  His panic worsened when he saw the large eyes of the dragon open and look to him.  The cloud dragon kept its head low as a sign of welcoming the human into its territory, but soon noticed the human was still scared of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Perhaps his pain has gone on far longer than mine and that's why he's scared of me, even now?\"</i> the dragon thought before moving its head away to give Felix some space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix saw the opening and bolted to the door, pounding on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me out please!\" Felix cried.

The cloud dragon watched the boy flee, wondering if the boy could be a friend in this dark place.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ten minutes later, Felix would come back to the cell to feed the dragon once more, and in those ten minutes, the dragon thought long and hard about the possibility of having the human as a friend. it was clear to the dragon that the boy was in the same sort of situation as it was. The boy had obviously been under the evil man's abuse for a very long time, longer than the dragon had been under his abuse. With the similarities, it is possible for two to become friends even if it was a human and a dragon becoming friends. The dragon had heard of stories from the older dragons about dragons befriending humans in similar circumstances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And let's face it,\"</i> the dragon added to its thoughts, <i>\"None of the other humans that come in here and torture me are going to be willing to be a friend. This boy might be the only suitable friend, even though he's still frightened of me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the dragon began to wonder if it really needed a human friend at all. All the humans it had seen so far were wicked creatures who took pleasure in torturing the dragon, all except the boy of course. Did it really need a find? <i>\"I do,\"</i> the dragon sighed, <i>\"This is a terribly dark and depressing place full of pain and anguish. If I were to try and fight these humans alone, I might fall into a state I could not come back from. The torture and loneliness will get to me and I might fall victim to the evil man, no matter how much I wish it not to happen.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon knew that it would try to fight off the torturers with every once of life it had, but deep down inside, it knew that it might not be enough. No matter how proud of a creature it was and no matter how much it wanted to be independent, it knew that it couldn't do it alone. It could face the darkness without someone else. <i>\"A friend would be able to help me fight off the evil man's control. The boy might not be able to fight like I can, but he could comfort me and be there for me when times grow darker. I know that some time, I will need a friend and right now, the human is the only option.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the dragon could think about regretting its decision on leaving the family to be off on its own, the door opened and the human with the cart entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Felix had prepared the cart for the dragon, Felix thought about everything that had happened. <i>\"The dragon could have ate me last night, but it didn't. Instead, it ate the meat I brought it and while I was unconscious it...\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix shook his head and muttered, \"The dragon only brought it close to me so it could eat me as a breakfast snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yet, it didn't eat me when it had the chance. The dragon had been awake long enough to eat me, but instead, it let me go. It could have chased after me, but it...\"</i> Felix though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he interrupted his thoughts once more and whispered, \"The dragon was probably just tired. it probably loosened it grip when it feel asleep and was too groggy in the morning to realize I had the opportunity to escape. That's the most logical reason, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something inside of Felix wasn't entirely sure about it. The dragon had been being tortured for a few weeks now and it was probably ready to give into Lord William. The dragon did seem different that morning. It was possible that the dragon realized that Felix wasn't doing anything to harm the dragon while other humans kept hurting it. It was a child after all as the guards had said and the dragon might want something else other than the torture it had been receiving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix remembered the first days of being a slave. For the longest time, he had felt alone, and he still did. There was no one to care about him and no one that could give him the love and friendship he needed. He had been in a dark nightmare for as long as he could remember, and it was possible the dragon was starting to fell the same way. It was possible that if Felix showed the dragon it wasn't alone and that he could be there for it then... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But dragons just beasts, aren't they? They can't possibly feel the same way as humans do, can they?\"</i> Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Felix could think upon it any farther, the cell door opened and he pushed the cart in. Felix noticed that the dragon was on the edge once more, but it wasn't standing tall and proud like it usually did. Instead, it was on its stomach with its head flat on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon positioned itself in a submissive stance to try and show the human it meant the boy no harm. The dragon's pride stung, but it knew that if it was to befriend the human, it would have to show the human it meant no harm, and since the human was so frightened of it, the dragon had to lie on the ground with its head flat on the ground. It could only hope that the human would understand. </span></div></div>",

Was it broken while I was out?\"</i> Felix wondered but shook his head.  The golden eyes still retained their spirit they had since the first time Felix saw them.  <i>\"If it's not broken, why is it acting like it is?\"</i>  He pushed the cart to the mouth of the dragon and waited in front of the head.  Felix stared down at the eyes of the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the meaning of this?\" Felix muttered, confused by the dragon's actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down like it was, the dragon's eyes were about as high up as Felix's stomach.  The dragon saw the human's mouth move but couldn't understand the words spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He hasn't fled yet.  Could he be fighting his fears?  Do I need to be more submissive?\"</i> the dragon thought, hoping it wouldn't have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon then saw something pleasing.  The human was bending at the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why am I doing this?  I can't believe I'm doing this,\"</i> Felix thought bending down so he was eye level with the dragon.  Both beings tried not to blink, staring the other in the eyes as though they were searching for something in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was breathing deep and felt a strange feeling.  It compelled him to see just what this dragon would allow.  Slowly, with no sudden movements, Felix's right arm rose until his hand was in his armpit.  And then very carefully, he moved it towards the muzzle of the dragon, praying the dragon knew he meant no harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder any other circumstance, the cloud dragon would have bitten the hand that has fed it, but as it stared into the human's eyes, it knew what the human was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's a sign of trust.  The human wants to know if it can trust me.  If he touches me, I might just have a friend,\"</i> the dragon thought just as it felt Felix's touch on its forehead, slowly and gently rubbing the face that had been whipped by various guards.  As the hand reached the mouth of the dragon, the dragon decided to gently lick the hand of the human.  Trying so hard to show it meant him no harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix saw the large red mass come from the mouth of the dragon and wet his hand.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was very hard, but Felix kept his hand on the dragon's muzzle as it had licked his arm a few times with it massive tongue. Felix was screaming in his head that the dragon was going to eat him and that he should run away, but Felix didn't do that. He just continued to kneel there with his hand placed upon the dragon's muzzle and in those long moments, the dragon did nothing else to harm Felix. <i>\"It wasn't tasting me. It was probably just being friendly. Kind of like a dog's lick,\"</i> Felix reasoned, <i>\"A very large dog that could probably fit me in its mouth if it wanted to.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix shivered slightly at the thought of being devoured by a giant dragon, but he stayed with the dragon and continued to pet its muzzle. Felix had become very fascinated by the creature. Not too long ago, it had been hostile to humans. Yet, ever since last night, the dragon for some reason wasn't as hostile to Felix anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, thoughts of why the dragon was acting differently towards Felix was starting to fall to the back of his mind. Instead, new thoughts overpowered his brain for the moment. <i>\"If this thing become loyal to me, imagine what I could do,\"</i> Felix thought. He began imagining the dragon becoming a powerful and loyal pet. He imagined both thoughts of finally being able to escape the wicked castle and/or using the dragon to finally kill Lord William. Felix fell under a day dream as many possible futures flooded in his mind now that he might have control over a twenty foot dragon that was still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was glad that the boy didn't take the lick in a negative way, because it knew that the human could have thought it was going to eat the boy, or something. Honestly, lick was just a greeting that dragons could use. Another greeting would be nuzzling, but The dragon felt it was necessary not to do that, because it would involve the dragon having to lift its head and bring it closer to the human. The dragon knew that it was more likely that the human would react more negatively and possibly freak out if the dragon was to lift its head and draw it nearer to the boy. No, the dragon knew it was best to lick the human and hope it would understand it to be a greeting and a wish to make friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human seemed to understand the meaning of the lick, because he stayed where he was and continued to pet the dragon's muzzle. At first, the dragon didn't mind the petting for a while, because it was the first caring thing any one had done for the dragon since it had been captured. However, as the boy continued, the dragon became a little more uncomfortable about the petting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was that the dragon still wasn't comfortable about letting the human touch it. It was bad enough it was in its territory, because it was in the dragon's nature to fell it should protect its territory from intruders unless the \"intruder\" was a friend. The dragon still wasn't comfortable about calling the human a friend, because it didn't really know the human all too well and all the other humans it had encountered hurt it and tortured it. The main thing that was keeping the human alive and letting it enter its territory was that the dragon was letting it in the territory and trying its best to befriend the human, even if the human's touch was pushing it a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other reason the dragon felt uncomfortable was that the human continued to pet the dragon as if it were some kind of pet! This was bugging the dragon most, because it was an intelligent life form like the human. It wasn't some mindless beast and being a pet was an insult to the dragon. Again, the dragon's want to be the human's friend was overpowering the possible insult and the dragon's mind continued to reason it was possible that the human didn't understand the dragon was intelligent and not just some dumb animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the dragon couldn't hide the anger and uncomfortableness from its eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix awakened from his daydream when he looked into the dragon's eyes. There was anger in the eyes and the eyes were fixed upon Felix's hand. Felix realized quickly the dragon was angry with Felix touching it and Felix quickly pulled his head away so as to not anger the dragon more than it already was. \"Sorry, I guess I got carried away,\" Felix apologized. He could tell that the dragon didn't mind the touch at first, but after a while the dragon became angry and uncomfortable with Felix's stroking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Does the dragon still hate humans,\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"I would too if I was in its position, and it would explain why the dragon was angered by the long period of contact. However, it doesn't explain why the dragon is being nicer to me than all the other humans.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question of why was brought up again and it was no longer in the back of Felix's mind. As Felix pondered about the question, the dragon lifted it head slowly, but Felix didn't notice, so it started eating the deer meat on the cart Felix had brought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why is the dragon so different to me?\"</i> Felix continued to wonder. That was when Felix noticed the dragon eating the meat and Felix figured, <i>\"Maybe, it is because I give it food. I'm not like all the other humans that enter here, because they torture the dragon, but I just feed it. It must not see me as a threat to it which has made it act kinder to me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But even if that's true, why would it act as submissive as it did just now?\"</i> Felix continued, <i>\"I know it's a child dragon and I'm feeding it, but surely it knows I'm not its parent.\"</i> Felix thought back to the lick the dragon gave him and what he had woken up to that morning. <i>\"The lick was like a dog's lick, like a lick of a friendly dog, and the dragon kept me close last night yet did nothing to harm me. It's letting me get closer and... Does it wish to be friends?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix thought about the concept of a dragon wishing to be friends with a human, <i>\"It might be possible that dragon could have intelligence. It did play that clever trick on me the other day. This dragon might have the same intelligence as a human and it might be wanting to befriend me. It would explain everything that has happened ever since... Ever since it saw Lord William beat me. If this dragon has the intelligence I think it does, then it might have realized we're similar. We're both being held against our will by and evil man that hurts us when we don't do what he wants.\"</i>  </span></div></div>",

The dragon stared at Felix for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He points at me, then his head, then his body and finally his mouth,\"</i> the dragon thought, <i>\"I wish I had learned how to speak human or at least understand what he's saying.\"</i>  The dragon blinked and realized that was probably what the human was asking about.  <i>\"He's trying to see if I'm intelligent or not,\"</i> the dragon realized.  But also knew he didn't know how to express this in the human's body language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stared into the eyes of the cloud dragon.  \"What if the dragon doesn't know how to communicate with me?\" Felix said, thinking like how a dog can understand commands but can't speak.  \"If the dragon is intelligent, then maybe I could show it a way to communicate back,\" Felix reasoned, \"But the dragon has only been shown pain since it got here,  And it's supposedly a young one as well.

And he hits himself and shook the head,\"</i> the dragon thought, <i>\"Is he trying to say a nod is yes and shake means no?  Only one way to find out.\"</i>  Slowly the dragon raised and then shook its head, hoping the human understood it didn't understand his words but it did understand the hand motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's saying no, but how could it respond if it didn't understand me?\"</i> Felix wondered confused.</span></div></div>",

But, I can't give up. If I don't escape this place in time. I'm going to need a friend eventually to get me out of the darkness. If Mom and Dad could see this, they'd probably scold me for not learning the human language. They told me time and time again that I would have to learn so I could tell humans I mean no harm so they wouldn't harm me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon thought back to the day he left on his own. \"You're only ten years old!\" the dragon's mother said, \"You still need to stay with your family and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do things myself. I'm not a baby anymore,\" the dragon replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think you can make it by yourself?\" the dragon's father questioned, \"I'll give you a week before you begin to realize that a dragon cannot survive by itself. Dragon's need mates, clans, and knowledge of humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those pathetic creatures?\" the dragon growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father replied, \"Humans may be smaller than us, but they have unique weapons that can kill us.

Without knowing what humans are capable of, you can never win at a fight with them, and without knowledge of their language you can't speak to them and try and settle a truce or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the dragon had left his family before his father could finish. The dragon snapped out of its daze when the human called out the same word it had last time when the human interrupted the dragon's meal. <i>\"I wonder if the human is calling me dragon like it was my name which would make that word 'dragon'. However, it could be say another attention getter word like 'hey', 'listen', or something along those lines,\"</i> the dragon wondered. The dragon decided to pay close attention to the words from now on to try and pick up the meaning and translate them to its own language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The dragon looks confused. It doesn't understand my speech, but now it's time to try it out with the signs,\"</i> Felix thought to himself. Before Felix could say it with the signs, Felix noticed the dragon went into a daze. The dragon looked as though it was recollecting something. \"Dragon!\" Felix called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the dragon shook its head out of its daze and looked back down at Felix. Even while lying on its stomach and having its head up, the dragon was still far larger than Felix. Felix repeated his question with the motions. \"You,\" Felix pointed to the dragon, \"Don't,\" Felix shook his head, \"Understand,\" Felix pointed to his head, \"My words,\" Felix pointed to himself and then he motioned his hand as if something was coming out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The human points to me first and says a word. Maybe that word means 'you' since he's pointing at me. Then he shakes his head meaning no. However, that word must not mean no. No one but trolls say 'you no'. Maybe it's don't. 'you don't'. That's what those two word might mean. Now he points to his head. This might mean knowledge or intelligence or... know. It might mean know. 'You don't know'. Or the word could mean understand,\"</i> the dragon thought as it listened while trying to understand the meanings of the words from the signs and try to memorize to speak them, <i>\"Now he points at himself like for the word 'me' and he makes motions like words coming out. This could mean either 'my words', 'my language', or 'my speech'. Definitely something along those lines. He must understand that I can't understand his words and he's asking if I can't understand it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix saw the dragon nod, knowing it meant that the dragon was saying, \"Yes, it's didn't understand his language.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're going to have to rely on motions and signs until I can teach human my language. If I can...\" Felix said. Felix stared at the dragon for a while and realized he knew nothing about the dragon's age, name, or even its gender. \"It might be best that I know the answers to these three questions first. I might as well start with the gender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you?\" Felix asked while pointing at the dragon, \"A boy?\" Felix pointed to his crotch area, \"Or a girl?\" Felix then put his hand up to his chest to make them look like imaginary breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon watched the human as it displayed very odd behavior, first touching his crotch then imitating human female breasts. The dragon didn't understand that the human was asking its gender, because dragon females didn't have breasts, because dragons weren't mammals. However, the dragon remembered that only female mammals had breasts and the boy was show parts that separated males form females. <i>\"It might be asking my gender. He probably can't tell, because humans might not understand the differences in female and male dragons,\"</i> the dragon thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat was the answer to Felix's question?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The dragon quickly realized it couldn't answer that question with a nod or shake.  So instead it raised its head and pushed towards Felix's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix got worried when he saw the dragon's head raise and came at his chest.  He was a little more shocked when the tip of the muzzle bumped into his chest.  Felix was happy he didn't freak with the dragon's mouth so close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait, it touched my chest.  It must be a girl......  I mean she is a girl,\"</i> Felix thought, looking at the gold eyes as the head retreated.  He didn't realize the eyes were one way to tell the difference.  Female cloud dragons had golden or silver eyes, while males had other colors, like blue, red, white, and others various colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix gave a nod once the head was fully retracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The human nodded.  He understands I'm female,\"</i> she thought, <i>\"Now what else is he going to ask me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human then pointed to himself and said, \"Name....Felix.  Fe-lix.\" The human did this several times and he would point at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait, I thought 'me' was what designated himself when he was pointing at himself. . . .Unless that's his name.  His name is Felix,\"</i> the dragon thought.  \"And he probably wants to know my name.\" The dragon sighed for a moment, wondering how to tell her name to this human.  After all, Rathnait, which meant \"Little graceful one\" in her language, wasn't something you could sign easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sighed.  Can't she tell me her name?\" Felix whispered, before looking at his hands.  \"Wait, how would I sign 'Felix'?  Maybe her name is complicated so she can't sign it easily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix pointed at the dragon and spoke \"You\", then shook his head \"cannot\", made the talking sign with one hand and put it to his other hand \"sign\", then pointed to her and said, \"your name\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" 'I don't talking hand me'.  That doesn't make sense.  Maybe he means 'cannot' instead of 'don't' and he uses his hands to talk, so maybe he means signing with them?</i>\" Rathnait thought, \"<i>And he used the same word when telling me his name.  So he's asking me if I cannot sign my name?  Perceptive human.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the dragon nod made Felix happy.  Even if he didn't know much about this dragon, he knew she was very intelligent.  She wasn't some mindless beast.  Now Lord William had been saying she was a baby dragon.  But given what she has shown to understand, it made Felix question this idea.  <i>\"Either dragons are very smart when they're babies or she's a child,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix then pointed at the dragon once more.  \"You,\" he said, then with his other hand put it low to the ground, like a foot off it, \"a baby?\"  He put the hand to the top of his head, \"a child\" and then raised the hand high, \"Or adult?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\" 'Am I small, his height or taller than him?' \"</i> Rathnait thought, <i>\"Obviously I'm bigger than him.  . .   But so are the ones who harm me.  Could he mean how old am I?  How old is he?  From his signs, he's probably close to midway between an adult and hatchling.  Well I am ten, but my parents are over two hundred years old.  I couldn't really live on my own, so I'm not really an adult.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the dragon answered. . . .</span></div></div>",

Ten years old might not be considered child in human years. Besides, I don't want that human thinking I'm an infant. If he thought that he might talk down to me. I can't let that happen. I'm bigger than him,\"</i> Rathnait thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait was a considered an infant to dragon, but she had been alive for ten years. She had learned from those ten years and has the same sort of intelligence as a ten year old human. So in reality, the dragon had the same intelligence of the human Felix and and the adult dragons were far beyond the capacity of human wisdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix waited a moment before the dragon suddenly began reaching is hand out to Felix. Felix staid perfectly still as the claw came closer, because he knew the dragon was just answering the question like it had with the gender question. The hand never touched Felix, it only hovered at his side. The hand became level with Felix and Felix understood the dragon's answer was that it was a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense to Felix since she could comprehend so much, yet Felix was wondering how many years the dragon was. He had heard that they lived much longer than humans, but he didn't know by how much. The only facts he heard about dragons were from people like the guards and soldiers speaking of them. Felix couldn't read stories about them, because he couldn't read and even if he could, he wouldn't have the time because he was a slave for life. So, all of Felix's information about the outside world and the creatures in them came from guard and soldier talk. However, he never knew what was true and what was false.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix pointed to himself while the hand was still close to him and he then held out both hands with all his fingers up to show him he was ten years old then he pointed at the dragon hoping it would understand. The dragon gave him a confused tilt of the head as she set her hand down on the ground beside Felix. The dragon was much closer to Felix now and looking down at him with its head held up by its long neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix pointed to himself again and then put his hands out. He counted to ten and put up a finger every time he counted a number. He then pointed at the dragon once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dragon saw both his hand outstretched as if telling her to stop, Rathnait became confused and set her hand on the ground. However, when the human started counting his fingers, Rathnait knew he meant ten. Luckily, dragons and humans had the same counting system. <i>\"Is he ten years old?\"</i> Rathnait wondered, <i>\"Humans lifespans aren't within days or months. This boy has to be ten years old. However, he acts more mature than most ten year old. Like how I'm more mature than other ten years old. he almost seems much older than he should be. I wonder why that it?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait didn't know it yet, but Felix was a slave. He had been deprived of his childhood and the life a normal child would have. This childhood was replaced with work and slavery. This made him become more mature than he should be, making his mind skip the fun loving childhood to the world of the adults. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait looked at her hand, her front legs were now lying on both sides of Felix while he stood between them. She didn't have five fingers pure hand like Felix, only four. <i>\"I'll have to count a different way than the human,\"</i> Rathnait thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix watched the dragon's hand lift and point to herself. Then her tail smacked the ground ten times. Then the dragon pointed back to Felix. <i>\"Did she just repeat her actions? Or was she telling me she's ten year old as well?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"The dragon does seem very intelligent. It must know what its doing.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded to the dragon to tell her he understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait watched the human nod knowing Felix understood. <i>\"I like this, 'Felix'. He really does have the potential of being my friend,\"</i> Rathnait thought to herself, <i>\"I only wish we could communicate better than this.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait decided to show Felix it was learning Felix's language from the signs and Rathnait pointed at Felix and said, \"Felix.\" She then pointed at herself and said, \"Rathnait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult for Rathnait to say such a strange world, but Rathnait knew that she would have to refer to the human by that name eventually. So, it was better to start early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was surprised to hear his name by the dragon. It was pronounced strangely, but it was his name. The dragon's voice sounded famine, yet it was still deep due to its size. The word it said while pointing to itself had to have been her name. Luckily, dragon's have a language that didn't consist of growls and her name was pronounced how a human would pronounce it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had trouble pronouncing the name properly though, because he had never heard of such a name. Eventually, Felix said, \"R-Ra-th-nait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon nodded. </span></div></div>",

Dra-a-gon,\" Rathnait said.  Felix nodded.  He guessed it would be best to go over some body parts first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix grabbed his head and said \"Head.\"  He then pulled on the hair and said, \"Hair.\"  \"I have hair on my head,\" Felix said.  \"Rathnait  does not have hair on her head.\"  Rathnait looked at Felix with a confused looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head. Hair,\" Rathnait said pointing at Felix before shaking her head.  \"No,\" she said.  Felix thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I jumped a bit there,\" Felix said, \"I'm sorry.\"  Felix then knelt and lowered his head.  \"Sorry,\" he repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Does that mean going down to the ground?  Or is he trying to say something else?\"</i> Rathnait thought confused, <i>\"He's acting submissive.  Perhaps this means he wants to atone for something?  Like saying those long sentences that I didn't understand.\"</i> She was happy Felix saw his mistake and apologized, while teaching her at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Rathnait said, looking down at Felix.  Felix rose and guessed that meant she accepted his apology or thought kneeling was said by \"sorry\".  He prayed it was the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to continue, Felix then touched his body in several places and said \"Touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch.\" Rathnait said, then Felix punched his own hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit,\" he said, before gently touched the hand and said touch once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit,\" Rathnait said and she saw Felix spread his hands out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long.\"  And then brought them together to a smaller distance.  \"Short.\"  Rathnait nodded.  Then Felix pointed at Rathnait.  \"Rathnait's head big.  Felix's head small.\"  Rathnait was starting to understand the simple sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix touch Rathnait,\" Rathnait said, deciding to try making sentences.  \"Humans hit Rathnait.  Rathnait hit Felix.  Rathnait sorry.\"  Felix had to contain his joy at seeing Rathnait talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Accepted,\" he said.  Rathnait nodded, before wondering something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans hit Felix?\"  Felix was somewhat taken back by her suddenly asking a question.  He was unsure how to answer.  She had seen him being hit by Lord William the day before.  So she knew it was true.  He didn't want to lie, but then his eyes came to see some of the scars made on her, from the chains and torture methods used to try to tame her.</span></div></div>",

The lashes were numerous and they were many different ages. There were new ones and old ones a like that covered his whole back. Rathnait looked down at the cuts from a recent whip attack. She was lucky that she healed quickly, but it seemed humans didn't heal as well as her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can't believe other humans hurt him like they hurt me,\"</i> Rathnait thought, <i>\"Sure, it's understandable that humans hurt me. They must not realize I'm intelligent and they want to use me like a beast of burden. Yet, they seem to be doing the same thing with Felix. They're treating him slightly the same as me. How could this be? I wish I knew how to ask that question.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait had no idea the what a slave was, because dragons didn't have slaves. Rathnait didn't understand the concept of slavery and the way the evil man was treating Felix was something bizarre, because it was as if Felix was a beast of burden, but the same species as the evil man. Rathnait's mind just couldn't wrap around the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human hurt Felix. Rathnait no understand,\" Rathnait with both confusion and slight anger in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragons probably don't have slaves do you?\" Felix asked forgetting that she wouldn't understand him, \"Felix is a slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave? Felix human,\" Rathnait replied confused. <i>\"I thought Felix said he was a human. Now, he says he's a 'slave'. What does that would mean?\"</i> Rathnait questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some humans don't see me as a human,\" Felix muttered to himself. Felix continued to look down at the ground and he sighed, \"I've been broken. I wish I could be more like the dragon. I wish I could have her spirit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait didn't understand what Felix was saying, but it was clear that something was troubling him. At first, Rathnait thought he was in pain because of the scar, but she then realized it had to be something else.She couldn't figure out what, but it was something major and something deep inside himself that was causing much pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it suddenly hit her when she remembered why she might need him in the future. She would need him for strength and for him to be there for her if times should get even darker than they already were. <i>\"He looks like he's in a state that I might eventually be in. It's as if his spirit to live on if gone. He's broken!\"</i> Rathnait realized, <i>\"He might need my help, but should I?\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait could heal Felix. She had limited healing powers since she was young. Yet, since Felix was so much smaller than Rathnait and most of Felix's scars were old, Rathnait could heal Felix without having to use too much energy. However, would she just heal him, or something more?</span></div></div>",

He looked at Rathnait and saw her eyes were glowing and his pain from recent whips was gone.  \"Did you heal me?\" Felix asked, looking bewildered at Rathnait as the eyes stopped glowing and returned to their original color.

She had healed the human and she had acted kindly to it against her instincts. She had to fight hard against her pride and her hatred for humans to actually nuzzle and comfort the human in his time of need. Felix seemed grateful for the moment, but now, he was motioning her to get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis turned into anger and Rathnait crouched low before the human and growled at him. Rathnait spoke in her language despite the fact that Felix wouldn't be able to understand it, \"I healed you and helped you, you ungrateful human. Now you're telling me to go away. Maybe I should have eaten you last night and not shown you the mercy I've been showing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix became frightened of Rathnait's growl and her language filled with fury and anger. Felix was trying to understand why she would suddenly become taken back by such a simple request. Then Felix remembered how Rathnait acted towards the humans that would try to force her to do anything. Rathnait would try to kill anyone that harmed her or would try to order her around. <i>\"She doesn't like orders. She doesn't want to do anything against her own will. Her spirit is powerful not only against the torture, but against becoming someones tool.

I need to show her the reason why, but will I be able to get through such anger?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had to try and he pointed to the cell door and said, \"H-human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait calmed down enough to look at the door and she could hear the clicks of the lock on the door as a key turned inside. <i>\"A human is coming. Felix is worried the human would see us close together, but why?\"</i> Rathnait wondered, <i>\"That Evil man! He wants to use me as a beast of burden or some kind of weapon he can control. What would he do to Felix if he saw that Felix was befriending my. Felix would be ruining the evil man's plan. The evil man had no remorse in harming Felix, and the evil man could kill Felix. If that happens, I might never find a way out of this place.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait realized she couldn't let Felix die and she had to suck in her pride once more. Rathnait took a deep breath and backed away into the darkness. Rathnait believed she had followed Felix's request only because he was a means of escape and she needed him alive. However, something inside her felt differently. She didn't know it yet, but a part of her was starting to care about Felix as a friend, because he was so much like herself and he was the only human she had met that was kind to her and truly wanted to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was surprised to see that Rathnait actually took a deep breath and obeyed Felix's command. Rathnait backed into the darkness and Felix thought, <i>\"She... she did as I asked. Is she really seeing me as a friend? Or is she using me?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix didn't know the answer and before he could think on it more, the guard opened the door and questioned, \"What's taking you so long, slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I was taking my time, because my next task doesn't need to be done right away and...\" Felix began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix began running for the door, but as he got there, the guard questioned, \"Who else is in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Felix asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard another voice,\" the guard explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talk to myself a lot,\" Felix explained, \"Can I go now, Claude?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude let him pass and closed the door. When Felix was out of the dungeon, Claude began thinking to himself, <i>\"The slave was in the dragon's territory, but the dragon didn't attack him like it does with the rest of us. And who was speaking to him? I know I heard a girls voice. I need to keep a close eye on him from now on. There is something very wrong about this whole thing. Once I know more, Lord William would like to know, and I might just get promoted.\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two weeks had passed since the start of Felix and Rahnait's companionship.  And in that time, a pressure was building ready to erupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween Rathnait and Felix, Felix had helped her learn most of the human language in a short time and they usually conversed quietly and shortly now.  After both the scare from Claude and Rathnait noticing the door never seemed to be fully shut, both Felix and Rathnait guessed correctly that the guard suspected something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even with their time together being short, Rathnait was comforted by Felix's smile that had developed and a look of hope in his eyes.  She knew, that even though it had cost her some pride, Felix was now mended and it would soon be time for them to try and escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically, though, Rathnait had grown some in the month and a half she had been held captive.  She was now closer to twenty-five feet tall and the humans had to increase the number of chains in order hold her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix, with his spirit mended, felt more confident than he ever was before meeting Rathnait.  The fellow slaves noticed this change in demeanor.  He was still subservient and he never acted up, but something seemed off.  Even his weekly beating from the guards didn't seem to dissuade him, while they themselves felt far worse than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even with their increased actions towards hiding the truth, they couldn't cover it all from Claud's inspections.  He hadn't caught Felix staying too long with the dragon and he had gotten the feeling the dragon could communicate and was doing so with Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I have no idea what they're talking about, but I doubt it's about the weather,\"</i> Claude thought, walking down the hall to Lord William's main chamber.  While he had nothing concrete, he had a gut feeling he had to tell his Lord what he knew now before it was too tale.  He knocked on the door and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William was also very displeased before Claude's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That damn dragon hasn't been broken yet?\" he yelled at his beast masters.  They shook their heads, not wanting to dare speak or have the lord's anger focused unto them.  \"You failures have tamed the most wild horses and yet you fail in this baby dragon?\"  He was about to continue when a knock came.  \"Enter!\"  Lord William bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaude came in, scared by what might happen if the lord didn't believe him, but he felt he had to say what he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire, I believe I know why the dragon is hard to tame,\" Claude said quickly.  Lord William glared at Claude.  It was a bold statement and both men knew it because if the reason was because of a fool's mistake on Lord William's part, Claude would be punished for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have one minute,\" Lord William said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe the slave feeding it has befriended the dragon and that is why it resists your torture,\" Claude said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why do you say that?\" called one of the beast masters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the past two weeks, since you made him sleep in the dragon's chamber, he has been staying longer in the room than he did previously,\" Claude said, \"And I believe they have some means of communication because I have heard voices in there, my lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no other proof?  Nothing seen with your own eyes?\" Lord William asked, both angered and intrigued by these words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry my lord, but I do not,\" Claude said, feeling William's gaze upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we will test it by flagging the boy in front of the dragon.  If you are correct, then the slave will die and the dragon hurt.  And you will be rewarded.  If you are wrong, the slave will die anyway and you will take his place and rank,\" Lord William said before thinking on what time it was.  \"The slave will be dusting the east wing.  Bring him to the chamber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord,\" Claude said, running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later, Felix was shaking with fear as Lord William and Peter, the leader of Lord William's beast masters, waited.  Peter had his red whip on him, grinning darkly.  And Felix knew all to well that the whip wasn't originally red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord William, may I ask why I was brought here?\" Felix asked, fear evident in his voice.  Lord William smiled at that fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to test an idea,\" was all Lord William said before the guard opened the door.  Five men entered the dark chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait was back against the wall, like she usually was, ready to try and defend herself from the men as they entered. However, when she noticed Felix among them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Felix, what is he doing here with those guards?\"</i> Rathnait thought, watching them chain Felix up to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may begin,\" Lord William said to Peter. Peter unfurled his whip and struck Peter on his back, making a cracking sound like a breaking bone.  There was not three seconds before the whip struck again and again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each strike pain shot through Felix's body but he did his best not to scream.  He knew if he screamed Rathnait would probably react and he had to protect his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Those bastards are hurting Felix!\"</i> Rathnait thought and while she would never have said this aloud, she knew she thought Felix was a friend and it took great restraint for her to not react.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When they had pushed Felix in the cell, Peter quickly ripped off Felix's rag like shirt and pushed him against the stone wall while Claude clamped the cuffs on the end of the chains around Felix's wrists. Lord William was surprised to see that there were no scars on the slave's back. I looked as though previous whips had never happened. The slaves back looked smooth and new!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord William, what did I do to deserve a whipping and why did you bring me down here?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why has the slave started calling me Lord William. He knows to call me Master. What's happening? I hope this experiment explains things,</i>\" Lord William thought as he nodded to Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter smiled and began the whipping. Felix hissed in pain as usual as the intense sting of the pain shot through his nervous system and caused his body to tense. Peter showed no mercy and kept a quick pace that didn't give Felix much time to get enough air in his lungs after some of the stronger hits caused him to cry out. Felix thought about what could have caused Lord William to whip him now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix turned his head to look at Rathnait. Rathnait was crouched low on the ground staring directly at both Peter and Felix. Her talons were trying to burrow into the concrete floor and Rathnait eyes were full rage and anger. <i>\"Claude has suspected something. Their whipping me to see if I really befriended the dragon. They want her to react!\"</i> Felix realized upon seeing Rathnait angrier than he had ever seen her, <i>\"If she reacts, their going to realize what I've been doing, and they'll kill me. She needs to control herself, or I'm dead!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Felix was both a little frightened of her reactions and afraid he might die if Rathnait couldn't control herself, he was also comforted to know how angry Rathnait was to see him being hurt. She seemed very protective now and it looked like she would do anything to help him and to make sure no more harm would come to him. <i>\"I finally have my answer whether she sees me as a friend or a tool. Form her reaction, she really does see me as a friend,\"</i> Felix concluded. Some tears fell from his eyes not only from the pain of the whip, but also because he finally had a friend that would actually protect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait had to use all her strength to keep herself from reacting. Her talons scratched into the floor as she glared at the three men who were hurting Felix. <i>\"I can't react. They might kill him if I react and then I won;t have a way out of her,\"</i> Rathnait thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I shouldn't be reacting like this, if he's just a way out. It's because he's a friend,\"</i> Rathnait realized, <i>\"I should hate humans for what they've done to me and I should be independent. I don't need anyone, but... This human isn't like the others. He's kind to me. He's more than just a way out. He's in the same situation as me. He's in a place against his own will and he's been abused and held by an evil man. We need each other more than I can admit. When we get out of here, I can let him live with me if he wants. He's someone I'd protect more than my territory.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery new gash that opened on Felix's back was difficult to both Rathnait and Felix. <i>\"I have to save him! I have to stop them! I don't know how much more I can take seeing,\"</i> Rathnait thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter twenty lashes, Rathnait couldn't take it and she let out the most powerful and furious roar she had ever made. All life stopped in the cell and something powerful erupted from within Rathnait, something she had never felt before was coming up out of her second lungs, and it was aimed right at Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix heard a roar from Rathnait that had scared him even if he knew it was from Rathnait. Suddenly, he felt an intense heat behind him like a horrible steam. He could hear Peter's agonizing screams, but Felix could turn to see what was going on. All he heard was the hurried footsteps of Lord William and Claude as they ran out of the cell before Rathnait could kill them the same way she had killed Peter. (She had breathed a powerful jet of steam since she was still a little too young to produce fire just yet.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix also heard the chains around Rathnait snap away from the ground and walls as she had gained new strength from the will to protect Felix. However, the chains were still clamped around her and dragged on the ground. Felix heard them drag as Rathnait approached. Rathnait swung her tail which was pointed like a sword-like spike at the end. The tail broke the thin chains (compared to her) and freed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix turned and soon saw Rathnait lower her head close to Felix with her eyes glowing and healing Felix's back. \"Are you hurt?\" Rathnait asked with obvious concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to you, I'm fine,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait surprised Felix and nuzzled him more affectionately and longer than she had ever done before. Felix hugged Rathnait's muzzle as she did so. \"We have to get out of here, but we need to get these chains off us,\" Felix told her as he rushed to Peter's dead body. Peter had the keys to all the chains in the cell. With the keys, Felix took off the clamps on his wrists and all the chains off Rathnait. Felix had to climb on Rathnait to unlock some of them which Rathnait had never let Felix do before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the last chains that were pinning Rathnait's wings were off, Rathnait spread her wings for the first time in close to a few months.\"Stay on my back!\" Rathnait ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to let me ride you?\" Felix asked shocked at the new Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you fly?\" Rathnait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" Felix said. Opression</span></div></div>",

The large wooden doors were soon under attack from Rathnait's forelegs and was creating deep cuts from her strikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix laid down on Rathnait's back, grabbing one of the spikes that seemed to be developing on her back for support as Rathnait stomped at the damaged door, breaking the wood.  Rathnait smiled as she walked through the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, which way out?\" Rathnait asked.  Felix looked around, taking a moment to think of which hall he was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just keep following paths large enough for you to go through,\" Felix said, \"We'll come to the great hall soon after and we can get through the doors easily enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will there be much resistance?\" Rathnait asked, seeing some guards coming now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably,\" Felix said, worried they might be captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Rathnait said in an arrogant tone before charging at the soldiers, roaring once more.  The three men who stood in her way were run over and one would not rise again.  The others were injured and knocked out but alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait continued dealing with the oncoming guards.  While they had superior numbers, being forced to fight in a narrow area against something that filled much of it left them to be nothing more than pins for Rathnait to bowl over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are my elite guards?!  Where is General Ethan!?\" Lord William bellowed at an aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is off in the providences collecting taxes,\" the aid said as they heard another crash, whether it was items on the walls being destroyed, doors broken open or men's armor clashing against the others, Lord William didn't know but grew more and more furious with every second they failed to capture Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are the main doors!\" Felix yelled, pointing to two great doors, twice Rathnait's height.  Rathnait smiled and charged at the doors, scaring the two guards watching them away as she ripped at the doors before feeling something hit her legs.  She stopped and looked at the soldiers gathering around her.  She turned about and felt the power surge once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the release of her steam stream many guards were severely injured, the few remaining were too close and would soon die from the injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her head was dealing with their protection, Rathnait jumped up on her forelegs and kicked the great doors open.  In their defense, these doors were strong enough not to be smashed by Rathnait's power, only dented them.  Feeling the warm sun rays on her for the first time, Rathnait turned about and ran outside, jumping into the air.  Her wings flapped and she was soon flying once more.  Felix was holding on with dear life on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your help,\" Rathnait said, as she flew higher to the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for bringing me with you,\" Felix said, \"Where are you headed to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading home.  My mother and father are probably scared senseless by now, wondering what happened to me,\" Rathnait said, \"You're welcome to come with me.

Her determination and spirit were too great, and nothing could stop her from getting back home to her parents and her many brothers and sisters. Rathnait missed them all, and it was sad that it took being held captive for a couple of months to realize how much she truly missed them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait flew as fast as she could to get to her parents mountain cave. Felix had to hold on tighter by grabbing around the back of Rathnait's neck, while as much as he could wrap around. However as Rathnait got higher, the air grew colder and thinner. Felix was getting very cold on Rathnait's back. Sure the neck in front of him was blocking some of the wind, but her head was slanted slightly and almost level with her back in order to fly faster. Felix was getting hit by the very cold wind of the mountains. Also, Felix was having troubles breathing at the higher altitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait,\" Felix said almost to a point of wheezing. Rathnait didn't hear him and kept going upwards. \"Rathnait, Stop!\" Felix yelled as loud as her could which hurt his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait suddenly stopped when she heard how bad Felix sounded. Rathnait hovered in the air continually flapping her wings and she did her best to look around at Felix. \"Felix, what's wrong? You're voice sounds terrible,\" Rathnait asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm cold... and I... can't breath,\" Felix said while still gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait finally realized her mistake. Felix wasn't ready for the thinner and colder air of her home. He wasn't adapted for it yet. Rathnait had to teach him how to properly breath. Rathnait flew to the nearest ledge that was large enough for Felix and herself. Rathnait landed on the ledge and lowered herself so Felix could slide off onto the ledge. Felix bent over coughing and gasping as well as shivering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, you need to keep your breath deep and steady,\" Rathnait explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I can't,\" Felix replied, \"There's no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is, there's just a little less of it,\" Rathnait explained, \"You just have to take deeper breaths to obtain it. Breath slow and deep. If something as big as my parents can live her, then you can too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a great amount of effort, but Felix started breathing deeper and slower. Surprisingly after a few long minutes, Felix was back to himself again. \"Are you felling better?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Felix thanked, \"I owe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I still owe you. You did a lot more for me than you could possible imagine,\" Rathnait explained, \"If only we could do something about your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like rags,\" Felix replied as he looked at the shredded and dirty clothes that wasn't protecting him from the snowy and freezing wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad has human gold. He can go to the human village in the mountains that respect us dragons and buy warm clothing for you,\" Rathnait informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'd do that?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he will, he's never had a problem with humans, though he's sometimes cautious of them. Plus, once I tell him everything you've done for me, am sure he'd help you and let you stay with us as long as you want,\" Rathnait said, \"Now, until he gets the clothes, me and my siblings or my parents can keep you warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many siblings do you have?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven,\" Rathnait answered, \"Four sisters and three brothers, all from the same hatching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big are your parents?\" Felix asked, a little nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm still just a baby in dragon standards, and they're much, much larger than me,\" Rathnait explained, \"But they are friendly, they wouldn't harm you unless you provoke them. However, it take a lot to provoke father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded, but he wasn't entirely without fear with seeing some much larger than Rathnait when he thought she was already the largest creature he had seen in his lifetime. \"In order to keep you warm during the flight, I'll have to carry you close to my... um...\" Rathnait said, but hesitated slightly to remember with humans called the area, \"chest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait lowered her hand to Felix, but she didn't pick him up. Instead, she let him get in her hand, because he was another intelligent being, and Rathnait knew it would be a little frightening to be picked up by something large without consent. Felix leaned his back against Rathnait's palm and she curled her four fingers around Felix and then brought him to her chest. Felix could fell the warmth a few feet before he even touched the softer surface of Rathnait's underbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait leaped off the ledge and flew towards her parent's cave once more. Who would be there when she arrived?</span></div></div>",

Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw a movement in the clouds but then nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, are there other dragons around us now?\" Felix called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're upon the outer edge of my clan's territory, but because I'm young compared to them, I'm flying much slower than them,\" Rathnait said.  Felix couldn't tell for sure but it sounded like Rathnait was embarrassed by the fact she was so young to her species, compared to Felix being a child.  She didn't say much else as she directed herself to one of the larger mountain ledges.  She soon landed and Felix was in awe of the size of the cave entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Five Rathnaits could stand on top of each other and still not reach the top,\"</i> Felix thought as he heard Rathnait saying something in her dragon tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!  Mother!  Father!  It's me, Rathnait!  I'm home.  Is anyone home?\" Rathnait called, walking into the domicile.  Felix heard nothing then what sounded like a chorus of noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eldest Sister!\" Rathnait heard in response, followed by the sounds of many feet on hard earth.  Soon seven dragons larger than Rathnait, but not too much larger appeared, bombarding Rathnait with questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"  \"Where were you?\"  \"Why do you have a human with you?\"  \"You're smaller now!\" came at Rathnait quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, this human is my friend Felix.  He helped me out while I was away,\" Rathnait said, \"I'll tell you the rest when I tell mother and father.  Where are they?\"  This quelled the questions and brought an awkward silence amongst the other siblings.  Finally the eldest child Alastar, hatched just before Rathnait, spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They went to find you,\" Alastar said, \"Father came in and told us humans had heard of a silver dragon being held captive by a human lord.  He went after there to investigate it.  Mother went to the village to see if any other information came up.  They were both very worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father went after a human lord?\" Rathnait responded, wondering if it was her her father heard about.  \"When did he leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little under an hour ago,\" Alastar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to stop him before he causes trouble,\" Rathnait said, turning back to the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?  He is much faster than you.  It's doubtful you could find him in time,\" Alastar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you could go and look for mother.  She might be able to catch father,\" one of Rathnait's sisters said.  Rathnait nodded.  Females were generally faster fliers then males, while males more agile.  She nodded before jumping off the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, what's going on?  Was it the wrong cave?\" Felix asked, completely left out in that conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the right cave but my father and mother weren't there.  They're looking for me right now, but they're in different locations,\" Rathnait said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, so which are we going after?\" Felix asked.  Rathnait paused for a moment before answering Felix.</span></div></div>",

I have to go to her because she's the only one that might catch up with my dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where is he?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's went after a lord that supposedly has captured one of my kind,\" Rathnait informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think that he went after...\" Felix began to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rathnait knew what he was about to say and interrupted, \"Yes, he's most likely flying towards that evil man, Lord William, and dad could be in trouble if he confronts them. That's why I need to get mom so she can go after him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something very large came out of the clouds, but it wasn't moving fast enough to be a blur like the other dragons that were passing Rathnait and Felix couldn't get a lock on. This one was slowing down and looking straight at Rathnait. Felix quickly became afraid of the dragon. It was a little frightening enough to be among seven other dragons that were around Rathnait's size, but this one was far larger. It was true what Rathnait said about being a baby compared to the dragons, because this one could easily have a head about the size of Rathnait's whole body! (This was also a female which meant it was slightly smaller that males!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait cried something in dragon which was \"Mom!\" and Rathnait flew towards the giant dragon. Felix pressed himself into Rathnait's underbelly (chest) as if he was going to hid by sinking into her. This was the only thing that reminded Rathnait that Felix was in her paws, because she had been so overwhelmed when she had seen her mother. Rathnait stopped and her mother continued. \"Mom, we can't hug just yet,\" Rathnait informed her mother using the human language, because she knew both her parents knew the language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait's mother didn't hug in midair, which was possible, but she did nuzzle her daughter's head and cried, \"I was so worried about. Your father and I were worried. We thought you could be dead after running off like that, and when have you learned human and why are we speaking in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have human company with me and I don't wish for him to be left out in a conversation when he doesn't have to be,\" Rathnait informed her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger dragon lowered her head to where Rathnait's human was clinging and shivering in fear. \"It's alright little human,\" the giant dragon assured, \"I know I must be scary to you but I don't harm humans. You've made a right choice in befriending this family. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Felix,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice name Felix. Mine is Shanaye, and it's a pleasure meeting you,\" the dragon introduced. Shanaye then turned her attention back to her daughter and asked, \"What happened while you were gone. I must know everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have enough time for that,\" Rathnait told her mother, \"You have to stop Dad from getting to the lord. That lord is dangerous and he could be captured like I was or killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were captured?\" Shanaye exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but Felix helped me escape and we can talk about this later. You have to stop Dad,\" Rathnait pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do what I can,\" Shanaye replied, \"You will go back to the cave and wait with your brothers and sisters. None of you will leave the cave. Then you will tell us everything that happened and don't think you're not in trouble because we were worried sick about you. You'll still be punished in  some way for leaving on your own.\" With that Shanaye flew off and Rathnait flew back towards the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait came back to the cave and her brothers and sisters were waiting impatiently. When she landed, they all crowded around her, but Alaster was the first to speak and he asked, \"Did you find Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she's going after Dad now and we are to wait in her till she gets back,\" Rathnait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she noticed the two youngest girls and the youngest boy were crouched low to see the human being held under Rathnait. The youngest boy and girl were twins since they came out of their eggs at the same time. Their names were Eshne (the girl) and Egan (the boy). Both their names meant little fire. The second youngest girl came out a little before the two of them and she had always been a playful and curious dragon. Her name was Soscelyne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing you all wish to see Felix, but remember he's a person just like all of us. Not some pet or something,\" Rathnait warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we know that, we're not three months old or something,\" Sorcha, the middle female, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only saying this because Felix is my friend and I don't want any of you to harm him,\" Rathnait explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragons nodded and Rathnait whispered towards Felix in human, \"Felix, I'm going to set you down so that my siblings can meet you. I told them not to harm you and I'm sure they'll listen, but if you still scared, you can stay close to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait set Felix on the ground close to her. She then lied down on her stomach and Felix stayed close to her chest. All the other dragon lied down as well and formed a semi-circle around the front of Rathnait to see the human. Felix sat down and leaned against Rathnait's chest as Seven sets of dragon eyes were staring in amazement at him. (Rathnait was looking at everyone else.) The dragon had never seen a human before, but they had been told so much about them from their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlaster was the first to speak and surprised both Felix and Rathnait when he said in human, \"My name is Alaster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can speak human?\" Rathnait asked in dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom and Dad taught us a few phases and sentences in human. They were hoping we could help search for you by asking humans questions about you. We don't know too much of the human language, but we can properly introduce ourselves in human,\" Alaster explained to Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait nodded and told Felix, \"My bothers and sisters can speak in human, but only a few phases. However, I believe they wish to introduce themselves to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Allehe,\" a female dragon said. This particular dragon was the third to hatch after Rathnait and looked a lot like their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Sorcha,\" Sorcha introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Brodee,\" the second son and fifth child said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Soscelyne,\" Soscelyne said. (The sixth child.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Egan,\" Egan said and the last dragon soon said her name was Eshne shortly after Egan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two are twins,\" Rathnait informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Felix,\" Felix told all of them, \"And it's a pleasure meeting all of you.\" (Rathnait had to translate the last bit to them.) <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Rathnait's mother comes back with the father, but it takes a long time. Meanwhile, the siblings have questions for Felix and Rathnait has to be the translator for most of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Rathnait mother comes quickly. Rathnait's father had either been captured or killed by Lord William before Rathnait's mother could get to him. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So how old are you?\" Egan asked.  Rathnait translated for Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ten years old, a child to humans,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's ten but for humans, that means he's a older than us,\" Rathnait explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you wearing such little clothing?\" Sorcha asked.  Rathnait was about to respond when all eight dragons looked to the entrance.  Felix looked as well, then heard a roar.  Suddenly the entrance went dark when Shanaye landed and entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, what's wrong?\" Rathnait called, seeing a near feral rage in her mother's eyes.  Felix saw this too and was scared by the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans have captured your father.   I came back to get help in killing the bastard humans who did this,\" Shanaye growled.  Felix noticed shocked looks on many faces and they quickly turned to anger, even Rathnait's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, what happened?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father was captured by human,\" Rathnait said, \"Do you think it was Lord William?\"  Hearing her daughter speak a complex sentence in human made Shanaye look down and remember Felix was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your mother see any marking on the soldiers?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Shanaye replied, making Felix jump, \"One of them had a snake eating its tale with a large eye in the middle of the enclosed space.\"  Despite being so small, she saw Felix's eyes grow wide.  \"You recognize this symbol, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's General Ethan, Lord William's most powerful soldier,\" Felix said.  He could feel Rathnait quake in rage and her body growing hot by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, how did these humans capture father?\" Alaster asked, wondering why his mother had returned and not taken vengeance on these humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They had a dust in the air that made me feel woozy and your father was barely awake on the ground, yelling to me it would paralyze me and make me sleep,\" Shanaye said in dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how they caught me,\" Rathnait growled, \"That dust won't come off easy on its own.  But water will help a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, where is this human live?\" Shanaye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five hours my flight,\" Rathnait said, \"West of the human forest called Breen.  It's the only castle in the area.\"  Shanaye nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of you are to leave this cave.  I will be back with your father,\" Shanaye said, \"Disobey and you won't know the meaning of the word punishment.\"    Felix saw the anger in the young dragons turn to a fear from the words and glare their mother had given them.  Shanaye left and Rathnait and the others went to the entrance and watched their mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShanaye let loose a terrible mournful wail and within moments dragons her size, some larger and some smaller came from the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, what is this?\" Felix asked as the dragons congregated.  He lost count at thirty dragons present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That roar my mother made is called the Rashinko, roughly translated, it means call of duty.  It's done when  we are in trouble or danger.  All dragons who are of age are meant to respond and aid in the calling dragon's plea.  Normally my mother wouldn't have made the call to save my father but she's worried about being captured by that dust,\" Rathnait said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded and saw something amazing.  Around the mass of dragons, the air seemed to become wavy, like when you look above a fire and the vision of what's beyond it shifts a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that their body heat affecting the air?\" Felix asked, amazed.  Rathnait nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father and mother are well respected for their size and diplomacy with humans,\" Rathnait said, \"Now watch and you'll know who is going to journey with my mother to help her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't understand drag-\" Felix said before nearly every dragon present lifted its head and breathed fire into the clouds above.  Then, with blinding speed Shanaye led those who breathed off to Lord William's castle.  The remaining ten went off in another direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those who remained will now watch over the territory to protect  from possible invasion,\" Rathnait explained, \"While my mother rescues my father and will probably kill every human in that castle.\"  Rathnait then lowered her head to the ground.  \"And if anyone dies, it's my fault,\" Rathnait said in dragon tongue, crying slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Alaster asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean because I ran off to begin with and was captured by that human, it led to father being captured and possibly killed,\" Rathnait said.  Felix didn't understand what Rathnait was saying but saw a deep sadness in her eyes the likes of which he had never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, is there anything I can do to help?\" Felix asked, feeling woefully inadequate at the moment.  Rathnait looked at Felix and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just sit near me.  I'll feel better once my father's returned, everyone else is safe and hopefully that evil lord is dead,\" Rathnait said.  She saw Felix's face come alive with realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't know what Lord William looks like!\" Felix said, \"He could try and escape and then come back after other cloud dragons.  He knows where you come from, so he could set a trap for others.\"  Rathnait's eyes widened as well as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister, what is it?\" Eshne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The man whose responsible might have made a trap for other dragons or he might escape from punishment,\" Rathnait said, \"I need to tell mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't!  We were told to stay here!\" Alaster said, moving in front of his sister.  Rathnait looked at her elder brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will move brother and you will move now,\" Rathnait said with a look that put fear into Alaster's hearts.  \"I have to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then tell one of the remaining adults and they can try to catch up,\" Alaster said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't know what he looks like!\" Rathnait said, grabbing Felix and running past her brother and taking flight.  Rathnait held Felix close to her chest as she flew harder than she had flown before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, where are we going now?\" Felix yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To catch up with the  force to tell them what he looks like and it might be a trap,\" Rathnait said, pushing herself beyond her limit.</span></div></div>",

Although Felix didn't understand the language, he did hear it and he questioned, \"Rathnait what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the guards is trying to stop me,\" Rathnait explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should stop and tell the guard what Lord William looks like. The guard will be able to catch up with the others faster,\" Felix reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we'd have to give a good description on what Lord William looks like and hope he can remember and...\" Rathnait started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it better than getting into anymore trouble that you're in now. It looked like your brother Alaster tried to stop you before you left,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom ordered us not to leave the cave,\" Rathnait informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it might be best to tell a dragon and let him carry the message,\" Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound just like my brother,\" Rathnait said as she slowed to a hover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of it though, wouldn't it take you much longer to catch up to them? They're faster than you and the battle could be over by the time you get there,\" Felix added, \"Lord William probably would have escaped and you'd just be in more trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Rathnait sighed, \"But it's just that I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You rather do things yourself. You like to be as independent as possible,\" Felix finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you know?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're spirit is far stronger than I've ever seen in a person. I kind of guessed when it took you a long time to trust me,\" Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it from my mom,\" Rathnait told Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of guessed it when she got so angry,\" Felix replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon guard flew in front of Rathnait and hovered in front of her. The dragon's name was Scilti. he was about a hundred years old and just become of age. Scilti's parents were good friends of Rathnait's family and Scilti sometimes helped watched Rathnait and her siblings when her parents were away. This was probably because he was an only child, something extremely rare in the lives of dragons. Usually they would lay three to ten eggs on average per batch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, where do you think you're going?\" Scilti questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't know what the lord looks like and if he escapes...\" Rathnait began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he will die. With the way your mother is acting, she'll kill everything in the castle. She will not miss anyone,\" Scilti tried assuring Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we give you the description anyway and you can catch up with them to relay the message?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but whose we?\" Scilti asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait lowered her hand from her chest and held Felix out towards Scilti. Scilti wasn't as large as Shanaye because Scilti was much younger. However, he was still very large to Felix. \"Greetings human,\" Scilti said in human and he spoke in human the rest of the time along with Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, you know the lord better than me, could you tell him the description?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded before explaining, \"Lord William is a tall man, taller than anyone in the castle. He also has a descent muscular structure with long blank heard down to his shoulder blades and a long beard a little past his neck. He is apparently a cunning and strong warrior, but he tends to let others do his work unless he has no other option. So, he would be in the castle during the battle. There are supposed to be secret escape routes from the castle that he might escape through if the battle isn't in his favor. I don't know where the passages are. You must give them, these warnings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall relay the message,\" Scilti replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, not all of his subjects are willingly under his rule. He has many slaves and most of his soldiers only do his bidding because they have no other choice. There are many innocents under his rule. The only ones that are willingly on his side are the generals and General Ethan's troops, plus a few of the guards,\" Felix warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, there are many innocents, as well. I shall tell them this so that can be careful about who they kill,\" Scilti replied. Scilti then looked at Rathnait and ordered, \"Go back home with your brothers and sisters. I will tell your mother that you just called from the cave to give me the message.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Scilti,\" Rathnait said before he flew with great speed towards the dragons that had left for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait flew back to the cave wondering the outcome of the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Some bad news. Scilti was able to relay the message before the attack. This saved many innocent casualties. However, Lord William still escaped through a secret passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Really bad news. Scilti didn't make it in time to relay the message before the attack. Many innocent people were killed because of Scilti not being there in time and Lord William had plenty of time to escape. </span></div></div>",

No one spoke much, given the severity of the situation.  Felix sat near Rathnait, who was keeping a vigil near the entrance, hoping her message had made it in time.  Praying her father was rescued safely and no dragons were harmed.  And while she was indifferent personally about the other slaves at the castle, for Felix's sake, she hoped they weren't slaughtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister is very close to that human,\" Eshne whispered after some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suspect he was her only friend at that evil human's place,\" Alaster replied.  He was about to speak more when he, and the other dragons as well, heard a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix saw Rathnait suddenly stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, what is it?\" Felix asked, rising as well<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're back!\" Rathnait said, straining her ears.  \"Mother and father are both back!\"  Felix felt happy for Rathnait, when suddenly, she pushed her head against him.  \"We need to move back so my parents can enter,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Felix said, recalling how large a space Shanaye took when she came in.  He hurried back with Rathnait as the cave suddenly went black.  He looked up and saw four eyes in the dark, a pair of silver and a pair of green.  Felix then heard all the dragons seem to say the same phrase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father!\" the children exclaimed.  Bringing in their wings allowed for more light in the cave and the parents walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" he said, \"That human dust just takes a lot out of you.\"  His eyes looked over his children and came to Rathnait.  \"Welcome home daughter,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, I'm so glad your all right,\" Rathnait said, crying tears of joy that her family was all together once more and safe.  Her father and Shanaye smiled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was also thanks to you that I am child,\" he said, \"And your actions helped save many human lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was actually Felix who realized mother didn't know what Lord William looked like,\" Rathnait replied.  Shanaye blushed a little from embarrassment, while her mate lowered his head to look at the tiny human.  Felix stared into the deep green eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your aid young Felix,\" came a deep calming voice.  If Felix had been scared by this dragon, he knew this voice would have helped calm him.  \"I am Dracus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Felix said, waving a little.  Dracus shifted his head and spoke in dragon tongue once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for your punishments for running off and leaving the cave,\" Dracus said, \"I feel your leaving the cave earlier was done for the right reasons, so no punishment will be given.  But for leaving us like you did, that will take some time to decide a proper punishment.\"  His gaze turned to Shanaye.  She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with your father on this,\" Shanaye said when they heard Felix yell something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me, but what about Lord William?  Is he dead?  And what did you do with the other slaves?\" Felix said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the fall of General Ethan, some of the slaves saw him fleeing through a passage way leading underground,\" Shanaye said, \"He escaped us just as we attacked the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for the human slaves, after some discussion we knew we would be wrong to free them and give them little chance of survival without becoming thieves, so they are being transported to a village we have ties with and ask the ruling lord to give them a place to stay,\" Dracus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for that,\" Felix said, \"And are you going to punish Rathnait for what she did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said they'd forgive me leaving the cave today, because it helped them but me running away won't be,\" Rathnait whispered to Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you were tortured and beaten by Lord William, shouldn't that be punishment enough?!\" Felix replied before noticing Shanaye and Dracus become rigid and seemed much warmer than moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tortured you?\" Dracus asked slowly in human tongue, he didn't want the others to know that fact just yet. But the rage contained in his words were recognizable in any language. Rathnait nodded.  \"For how long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For as long as I was there, over a month,\" Rathnait said.  Shanaye and Dracus exchanged looks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What sort of torture did they preform on you?\" Dracus questioned, still using the human language. It was a question that Shanaye and Dracus wanted the answer to as well as didn't want to know. They wanted to know how much hurt their baby received so that they could help her, but they also didn't want to know that their daughter had been tortured by the wicked lord and his minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They tortured me everyday,\" Rathnait said sadly with tears forming, yet the tears never fell, \"They would do many different things. Things such as whippings, cutting me with axes, chaining me and imprisoning my in a dark cell with little light. They did many more terrible things, but they were too horrible to remember,\" Rathnait answered in human. Rathnait knew there was a reason her parents were speaking in human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would they do that to you? Why would they imprison and torture you?\" Shanaye growled. Her anger grew just as fast as Rathnait's anger when it grew. Shanaye wanted to rekill all the evil humans she killed in the battle as well as find Lord William and personally rip him to shred, or maybe torture him for a month like he had done to her daughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait didn't answer for a while so Felix spoke up. The only thing giving him the strength to talk to such large creatures was that he was right next to Rathnait and they were her parents. \"They wanted to use her as a tool,\" Felix explained, \"They didn't know dragons had intelligence and they thought they could train her to be loyal. However, his way of training something as by showing his dominance through abuse. It didn't help when he thought Rathnait was only an animal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those monsters,\" Shanaye hissed, \"Didn't they see she was only a hatchling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little hard for us humans to believe Rathnait's age when she is so big compared to us,\" Felix admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think we are one of the smaller species of dragons,\" Dracus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had troubles imagining something larger than Rathnait's parents, but he couldn't even wrap his mind around something larger than them. \"Does Rathnait still need to be punished?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've learned my lesson,\" Rathnait informed her parents, \"I realize now I can't do everything myself. I'm still too young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents realized how much it hurt Rathnait to cut into her pride like that and they knew that what Lord William did to their daughter was far worse than any punishment they could think of. Dracus looked to his wife and she nodded. Understanding what Shanaye meant, Dracus answered, \"You have learned your lesson and you won't be punished, but if you run off again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, I promise,\" Rathnait quickly interrupted. She didn't think she could ever truly recover from what she was put through and it would always be a reminder that she couldn't do everything alone. She even needed a human, which was far smaller than herself, to help her. She was still far too young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, will you tell us exactly what happened?\" Dracus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wish for me to speak in human still?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we'll decide what to tell and not to tell your brothers and sisters,\" Shanaye replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About three days after I left, those humans found me. It was during morning and I was still asleep. They must have used the dust that they used on you father, because the next thing I knew I was in a large cage. The humans then chained me in a dark cell and tortured me to try and 'tame' me,\" Rathnait said, \"I fought every human that came in my cell and tried my best to fend them off, but i couldn't stop them all the time. I realized that I could be trapped there for a long time. If that was the case, I was worried they would break me and I would be their tool they could control. There was only one option left to try and keep my spirits up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Dracus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to make a friend. I had to befriend a human that would be able to comfort me and rekindle my spirit if it were to ever be broken,\" Rathnait explained, \"I choose to try and befriend Felix because he was different from the humans that entered. He was the one who had to come in to feed me and give me water. He was afraid me and only entered because he was forced to by Lord William. I realized this when Lord William beat him in front of me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took a while but we became friends,\" Rathnait continued, \"I probably wouldn't have been able to make it in that place without him. He taught me his language and he was there for me when I needed him. he was the only hope I had in that hopeless place.\" Rathnait paused for a moment to nuzzle Felix who was sitting against her chest once more. \"Thank you, Felix. I don't think I could ever stop thanking you for what you've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you escape?\" Dracus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They figured out that Felix was befriending me,\" Rathnait explained, \"but they weren't entirely sure and they experimented with their theory. They whipped Felix in front of me and I could stand seeing him hurt. Not after everything he's done for me. A new strength erupted from me and I was able to break the chains as well as use stream breath to kill the man whipping Felix. I then broke his chains, he uncuffed me, and I forced my way out with Felix on my back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are your mother,\" Dracus commented, \"When those she loves are in trouble, she gains a powerful strength and determination that none can match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracus turned his attention to Felix and said, \"I would like to know your story, young Felix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been a slave to Lord William since I was five years old,\" Felix replied, \"I never knew my parents. I don't even know if they sold me into slavery, if they died, or what. I'll I know is that I've been a slave for as long as I could remember. I'm sure you wish to know why I helped your daughter, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we would like to know why,\" Shanaye answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at first I thought Rathnait was just an animal, because I knew nothing about dragons. However, when she started acting different towards me, I was able to get closer. When I tried communicating to her I realized she was intelligent and when she healed my back I knew she could be a friend. She was like me in many ways. We were both being held by Lord William against our will and being tortured by him as well. We became true friends and I had to help her,\" Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, Dad, can Felix stay with us? He has no where else to go and he's my best friend.\" Rathnait asked.</span></div></div>",

Humans sometimes don't adapt well to living with us,\" Shanaye said, \"Because of their size and inability to fly, we must carry them and make sure they have access to goods that they can eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, it isn't like we are alone in the mountain range.  There is the human village nearby that we could arrange for him to stay in,\" Dracus added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but how did you become so friendly with a human lord?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The current lord, Lord Michael, when he was a young boy, he and his family were traveling through the lower parts of the mountains fifty years ago,\" Dracus explained, \"He got seperated from them and was lost in the mountains.  I came across the young Michael and took him back to his family.  Up until that point we had an unspoken live and let live policy.  But rescuing his son, his father realized we could be more aquainted than before and we started conversations.  They have helped us by not allowing any dragon hunters to make camp in their towns and we have helped them by aiding to protect them when they were attacked or if they suffered a famine and we had food to spare.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Lord Michael even helped us look for you Rathnait by sending out people to look where we could not,\" Shanaye said, \"It was how we learned of a young dragon being held captive by Lord William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told me he would help us find you or die trying to repay that debt long ago,\" Dracus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why he was so accepting with you bringing in the former slaves?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well .. .  that was made more business than a personal thanks,\" Shanaye noted, \"We'll need to give him some gold to help cover the food, clothing and shelter for them until they start working themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like I'll be a burden on you either way,\" Felix said, \"Because I doubt Lord Michael would accept another former slave for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll come to that path if we need to,\" Shanaye said, cutting Felix off, \"Because right now, you are our guest for all the help you gave our daughter.\"  Dracus nodded then looking at his children who had been left out for the past few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Eshne, Alastar go cut up enough meat for your siblings and Felix,\" Dracus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, may I ask what you got so angry about?\" Alaster asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you may not, now go,\" Shanaye replied sternly, \"That goes for the rest of you as well.\"  Rathnait didn't look back at her siblings right away, instead looking down at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have dinner now.  It's a long way to the main part of the den.  I think I should carry you so my siblings don't eat your share of food,\" Rathnait said, blushing a little as she squatted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Rathnait,\" Felix said, climbing on her back.  Rathnait rose and sarted off.  \"What's for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either basilisk or hydra,\" Rathnait replied, licking her lips, \"I can smell both right now.  I really missed this type of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those safe for me to eat?\" Felix asked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Felix,\" Shanaye said as Felix turned to face her, \"We can cook the basilisk with our fire to make it edible for you.  And hydra is fine once cooked as well.\"  Felix nodded, then had a look of concern on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are either of them intelligent creatures?\" Felix asked.  Dracus nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but they are more instinctual creatures than intelligent like us or humans,\" Dracus said, \"So it would be no different than a human eating a dog.\"  Felix was going to say humans viewed dogs as pets but resisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.  Thank you for the clarification,\" Felix said before turning forward.  As Rathnait walked on, Dracus and Shanaye slowed to talk quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait truly sees Felix as a friend,\" Shanaye said, \"For her to grow in strength like that.\"  Dracus nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish he was older, but he's young and can still learn much from other humans,\" Dracus replied, \"He would grow up away from his own kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering how his kind had treated him, he may want to,\" Shanaye replied curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know there are good humans.  Michael and his adult son Adam are two such people.  They have never broken a promise with us, at least not intentionally,\" Dracus replied.  Shaneye sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should at least give it a night to think on it,\" Dracus said, \"Because if we take him from Rathnait, she might be very up set and try to stay with him.\"  Shanaye nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if its decided he would be best with humans, what then?\" Shanaye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam has only one child, a daughter Felix's age.  If we think he should live with humans, I will ask them to take Felix in to raise and educate,\" Dracus said, \"He would be close and safe to the point I think Rathnait won't try anything immature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wise as always my love,\" she said, nuzzling his neck the way he likes it nuzzled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Rathnait arrived with Felix on her back, her siblings were cutting up two large creatures to get there share. Felix was starting to get used to seeing giant creatures. The hydra was about the size of Rathnait's parents, but it hand many more heads than just one. In fact, the hydra had close to nine heads. It's necks were long and there heads had the likenesses of a dragon and a snake in one. The hydra's body was like a dragon with four legs, but it had no wings and the spikes on its spine were different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basilisk was a very large green snake. Its eyes were cut out which was so that it couldn't turn the dragons into stone when it had been alive. The giant snake was large and its height was about the height of Rathnait and her siblings. Yet, the basilisk was much longer than Rathnait's parents making it look enormous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"All that meat to feed a small village,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"Yet it's just a meal for this family of dragons. I'm glad there are other creatures as large as dragons or they'd have to eat a lot humans' game.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix watched as the dragon children walked up to what they wanted and cut enough meat for a good helping with the sword-like end of their tail. They would then bring it back to a place to sit and eat. Felix was glad that the dragons were civilized enough to do that. He was a little worried that they would just all tear into the food like a pick lions eating a kill or something along those lines. However, they still did eat raw meat and eat their share of meat like a \"savage\" animal. \"What do you wish to try?\" Rathnait asked Felix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the other dragons looked up from their food and wondered what Felix was going to choose. They didn't know what Rathnait had asked from the human language, but they guessed that Rathnait asked Felix what he wanted. They were curious what Felix would choose. \"Well, I've never had either of them and wouldn't know what to choose, because I have no idea what they taste like. What would you recommend?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I personally like hydra better, but I can give you a little of both if you want. I'm sure I can give you both, because a mouthful for us probably would be many helping for you, right?\" Rathnait informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there's no way I can eat as much as you and your siblings,\" Felix replied. It made him realize how small he really was compared to the dragons. It also surprised him that such large creature could act that he was there equal. Rathnait took off a little of the basilisk for Felix and a large chunk of the hydra for herself. Once she went to her normal spot, she took some off the hydra piece for Felix as well. She kept Felix to her side, because she didn't want him anywhere near her food or mouth in case something should go wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorcha, Joscelyne, and Egan and Eshne the young twins, came a little closer to Rathnait and Felix. They were very curious of Rathnait's new friend. Shanaye cooked Felix's food and Felix gladly thanked Shanaye for her help. However, he felt like he was a burden for her. He wished he could make a fire himself so that they would have to cook his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dinner was quiet and there was little talk. Once dinner was over, it was the children's bed time. Rathnait's parents allowed Rathnait to have Felix sleep with her, mainly because they realized how attached Rathnait was becoming to Felix. Rathnait's parents only hoped Rathanit would understand if Felix had to live with the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait laid herself down on her stomach and she motioned Felix to lie against her side. \"Is it starting to get cold for you again?\" Rathnait questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is. I'm going to have to get warmer clothing as soon as possible,\" Felix said as her approached Rathnait side. Rathnait's body heat was warm, but Felix still shivered slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with Felix?\" Eshne questioned with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's cold,\" Rathnait explained, \"Humans don't have an internal flame like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEshne, Egan, and Joscelyne, who were still close by because they were still curious for Felix, approached closer. \"Should we sleep next to you too to keep him warm?\" Joscelyne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait craned her head to Felix and asked, \"Do you mind if Egan, Eshne, and Joscelyne sleep next to us? They're a little worried about you being too cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they roll around?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're all still sleepers, most of the time,\" Rathnait informed Felix, \"You can sleep closer to where my front claw will be. That way I can cover you with it like a shield or blanket.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell them I don't mind and I sleep next to your claw in case,\" Felix replied. Rathnait relaid the message and the three dragons slept close when Felix was safe near Rathnait's claw. The dragons positioned themselves against each other, but in places where they wouldn't harm Felix accidentally. Eshne, Egan, and Joscelyne fell asleep quickly. Before Felix and Rathnait could fall asleep, Sorcha approached them with one of her front claws closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wish to sleep with us too, Sorcha?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'll sleep with Alaster and Allehe as usual, but I wanted to give Felix something,\" Sorcha explained. She lowered her paw and slanted it towards Felix. Two strange looking rocks rolled off and in front of Felix. \"Gift,\" Sorcha was able to say to Felix in human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he's wondering what they are, because I don't know either,\" Rathnait said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him if he hits them together, sparks form and he can make a fire,\" Sorcha informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait relayed the message and Felix asked, \"Why did you give me this? I'm glad you gave me a gift and I'm thankful, but why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed to have help my sister greatly,\" Sorcha answered once Rathnait told her what Felix said, \"I'd like to thank you, and I saw how embarrassed you seemed when mother cooked your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Rathnait told Felix what Sorcha said, Felix thanked Sorcha again and Sorcha left to sleep with Alaster and Allehe. However, Allehe was talking to Brodee when he suddenly growled at Allehe to back off. Allehe slept with Sorcha and Alaster as usually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with... um...?\" Felix hesitated, trying to remember the dragon's name. It was hard to remember such strange names, but it was harder trying to tell the difference between the dragon children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Brodee, the second son,\" Rathnait explained, \"He like to sleep alone. I don't know why. No one understands why he does this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix left it at that and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracus woke up early in the mourning before his children and wife and set off for the village. He knew Adam was an early riser and Dracus might be able to converse before the children woke up. Dracus flew down to the village which was still deep in the mountain range. They lived in a more manageable altitude for humans though and the part of the mountains they set the village on were still fertile and they could grow crops, (just think Incas in Chile, but not necessarily the same government and religion as Incas, because it still run by a lord.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracus knew he had to land fairly far away from the village. He was simply too large to land close the village otherwise he might blew too strong of a wind when landing. Dracus walked the rest of the way till he came to the wall where a guard was waiting. \"Hello, Dracus,\" the guard greeted, \"Are you here to see Lord Michael?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm here to talk with his son, Adam, as well as finish our agreement,\" Dracus informed the guard while handing some bags of gold to guard who knew where it was supposed to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give word to Adam and he'll come,\" the guard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll wait in me normal spot,\" Dracus told the guard. Dracus was too big to go in the village and had to wait outside the gates. Dracus waited and eventually Adam arrived outside the gate and climbed to where Dracus was positioned on a small mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish to speak to me?\" Adam asked as soon as he sat on a ledge near Dracus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my mate informed you about a human my daughter came home with?\" Dracus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, what about him?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boy, Felix, was a former slave of Lord William. Felix was the one who helped Rathnait escape and helped her keep her sanity in that place I'm sure. They've grown close, but I don't think Shanaye will be able to care for him. He's still too young and I don't think it's best for Felix. Shanaye and I wouldn't mind taking care of him, because he is a nice boy, but we don't want to force him to live away from his own kind. He can still learn from humans,\" Dracus explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know where this is going, but why do you need me?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping you could care for him and raise him. He's the same age of your daughter. However, I'm sure I'll still have to pick up Felix from time to time with he and Rathnait wish to meet, but I don't mind that. Could you take care of Felix?\" Dracus asked, \"If not, I'd understand and we could care for Felix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you give me a day to think it over?\" Adam asked, \"I'd need to say what Ashley thinks about having a brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I shall come back tomorrow around this time,\" Dracus informed Adam.   </span></div></div>",

I couldn't bare to think what I would do if my Ashley ran away like that.\"  Dracus nodded slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a feeling any loving parent would dread to feel,\" Dracus said.  Adam nodded as well and waved goodbye to Dracus, picking up the gold the dragon placed near the bottom of the hill.  As Adam passed through the gates of the town, Dracus turned to walk back to the landing zone when he smelled someone close to him but behind his position when he was talking with Adam.  He saw a human figure shimmer from behind a tree, like moving a glass and how the image is slightly distorted.  Dracus paused slightly before focusing on seeing only body heat and the figure became clear.  Dracus lowered his head and growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" he asked in human tongue.  While he wouldn't say it crassly, given his friendship with Lord Michael and his son Adam, Dracus saw the village as part of his territory and disliked invaders into it.  Normally he wouldn't take control but as this was no normal human, this was a special case.  He felt warranted for a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A being with magic,\" the figure said, dropping his cloak and revealing himself.  He was tall by human standards, past six feet.  He wore a black cloak on top of grayish shirt and black pants.  Dracus couldn't place the man's position in the human world because his clothes were hard to place.  His face was clean shaved and his black hair was short.  But his eyes were a brilliant blue.  His expression was blank as he moved from behind the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what business do you have listening in on a private conversation?\" Dracus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I live in the area,\" the man said, \"And I was on my normal walk when I saw Sir Adam conversing with you, so I hid.  I assumed you didn't want someone to suddenly walk by while making business deals.\"  Dracus growled slightly.  He didn't like this man's tone nor his scent.  There was something inhumane about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By what magic can you hide from human eye?\" Dracus asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are many magics that can give someone the power to hide from certain sights,\" the man said, \"I can use a plethora.\"  He gave a cocky smile, before returning to a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Then why do you not call yourself human?\" Dracus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some mages and druids consider themselves not human because they are capable of magic,\" the man said, \"But look, I mean this land no harm.  I'm simply in the business of hunting certain hard to catch game because of my abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I do not trust this being.  I question if he is human or not.  His scent . . . . I can't place it.  It smells of human but that could be because he lives near them.  If I attack him and he is a good human, it could damage my relationship with Adam and trying to get Felix to live here,\"</i> Dracus thought.  After careful thought, Dracus finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take your word but if you ever cause harm in this village I will personally hunt you down and kill you,\" Dracus growled at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that would be interesting to see.  Good day,\" the man said before walking towards the gates but he didn't aim right at them, instead he walked to the side as though he would walk around the village.  Despite his desire to follow the human, Dracus went to the landing zone and jumped into the air, flying back to his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the cave, Felix had discovered there was not much variety in a dragon's plan for that morning they had what they had last night for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will we be having the same thing for lunch and dinner?\" Felix asked Rathnait as he clicked the rocks together, making a small fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Shanaye said, \"We don't like to waste food, so we will eat a kill until it is bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you do with the bones then?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sell them to humans sometimes.  The bones are very hard and not easily broken.  In fact, one of the outer walls of the village is made from hydras' bones,\" Shanaye said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably a sight to see,\" Felix said, shivering slightly.  Rathnait and Shaneye noticed Felix shivering again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, once Dracus returns I'll take you to the village to find some decent clothes,\" Shanaye said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, may I come with you?  I haven't been to the village in a while and someone may try to steal from Felix,\" Rathnait spoke in human tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anybody is foolish enough to steal from Felix, they'll won't get very far,\" Shanaye said simply.  Felix looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you are our personal friend and if that is known and you are attacked, both Lord Micahael's men and us will want to find the human quickly.  And they would be better found by other humans inside their village, or face our wrath,\" Shanaye replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Lord Michael has no issue with that?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He understands we take attacks to ourselves, kin and friends very seriously,\" Shanaye replied, \"He knows we considered them guests to our lands because they are kind to us and live very close by.  But he also understands if someone offends us and they are outside his jurisdiction, they better have a very good reason for it.\"  She noted his fire wasn't very strong.  \"Would you like some help with your breakfast?\"  Felix looked at his tiny fie, knowing it was too small to cook on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix looked at the small fire before him and he realized he had made a mistake. Instead of lighting and starting the fire with the dry grasses, he used the wood. So, when the fire was finally going, he had used most of the wood Shanaye had offered, The dragon's for some reason carried much wood and dry grasses in another chamber of the cave. This was in case they had human company that needed their food cooked, but they hadn't had company in a long time before Felix had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knew he could ask for more wood, but it seemed worse and more of a burden for Shanaye if he asked this of her. She would have to go back and get more wood which would interrupt her breakfast more than just cooking it for him. Felix sighed at his mistake and failure and said, \"Could I please ask for your help again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure may,\" Shanaye replied before breathing fire to cook his meal with a constant steam of intense flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Next time, I won't make the same mistake,\"</i> Felix thought to himself, <i>\"Next time I'll be better prepaired.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorcha watched Felix and knew all to well what he was thinking. Sorcha was always good at sensing others, even humans who were different from dragons. \"Mistakes are meant to happen. Otherwise, we can't learn from their lessons and can't be better,\" Sorcha muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait was close enough to overhear and she turned to her sister. She was surprised by the wisdom her younger sister already had. Sorcha was always more mature for her age even though she was close to the middle of the batch that hatched. \"Do you wish for me to relay the message to Felix?\" Rathnait asked Sorcha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can tell he understands the meaning of mistakes already. I can see the determination on his face,\" Sorcha replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had heard his name being said. He felt a little uncomfortable about the giant infant dragons talking about him in their own language. Even though he knew they would never truly harm him or say such bad things about him, it was still uncomfortable for a large creature to be talking about him in a foreign language. \"What were you talking about?\" Felix questioned Rathnait when she turned her head back to her meal between her front legs with Felix siting against the other side of her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Rathnait answered, \"Just that we have confidence that you'll make a better fire the next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breakfast was much like the dinner last night. The dragons didn't speak much. It seemed dragons were much different about meal conversations with family than humans. The dragon paid more attention to their food, while human families took more time talking than eating, or that's what Felix had heard. Felix was gladdened there wasn't much talk. Not only did he learn it was better to eat instead of eating from his life as a slave, but he also knew that is long conversations happened, Rathnait and Shanaye would have to translate what was being said and their meals would take long to finish. Then again, it wasn't like their food would get cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix's meal took the longest to eat since he had to wait for his food to cool enough to hold and he didn't attack his food as viciously as the dragons. Eshne, Egan, and Joscelyne were playing their dragon games which looked like a form of tag, which Felix didn't know because he never knew any games while he was a slave. Sorcha and Allehe were talking and Alaster, being the big brother type, looked over his siblings carefully. Brodee, as usual, was alone in his own world. It wasn't that the other dragons shunned him, he was just a dragon that liked to be alone. Shanaye had a watchful eye over her children and Rathnait stayed with Felix as he finished eating. Rathnait even placed her head to the ground and formed her body in a C as Felix was allowed to lean against her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was glad to have such a good friend. It was the only thing Lord William had ever done that benefited Felix. If he hadn't have captured Rathnait, Felix would still be trapped in the terrible place and he would have never met Rathnait. <i>\"Funny how things turn out,\"</i> Felix realized as Lord William had given Felix the greatest gift he could ever want without realizing it, friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Felix was done and Dracus flew back into the cave, Rathnait asked her mother, \"Can I come with you and Felix to the village? You're too big to walk through the village, but I could if I'm really careful and I could help Felix find the stores and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see,\" Shanaye informed her excited daughter, \"I must talk with your father first.\" Shanaye looked at her oldest son and commanded, \"Keep a watch on your brothers and sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, mother,\" Alaster replied as Shanaye and Dracus spoke in a private area in the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was Adam's answer?\" Shanaye asked right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he wishes for one more day to think about it. He needs to know what his daughter thinks as well,\" Dracus stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's understandable. Adopting someone is a big decision,\" Shanaye replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is something else you should know,\" Dracus told his mate, \"Someone listened to my conversation with Adam. He claimed he was only out for a walk, but I fear he was out just because he had interest in the matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is he?\" Shanaye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He claims to be a villager, but there is something strange. He smells of human, but only because he has been around them for so long. There was another scent underneath it. Something both similar and foreign at the same time,\" Dracus informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could it be?\" Shanaye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but he could become invisible to the human eye,\" Dracus added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does he want? Do you think he wants something from Felix?\" Shanaye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but if he truly has lived in the village a long time and never caused harm to us, there might not be cause for alarm,\" Dracus explained, \"Yet still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should be careful and keep a watchful eye,\" Shanaye finished, \"Should we let Rathnait come with Felix and I? We were leaving to help buy him warmer clothes. If Rathnait comes, she can be closer to Felix if trouble should occur. All I could do is stay on a close by mountain top that could watch over the village. If trouble should occur, I couldn't help Felix like Rathnait could. However, that might put Rathnait in trouble. I have a preferred suggestion, but I want to know your take on it as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Dracus believe was best?</span></div></div>",

We also need to consider that man.  If he can be seen only by dragon eyes, then we would need one close to warn Felix and the only one who speaks enough human and could walk with Felix down the street is Rathnait.\"  He took a breath.  \"So, in the worst case scenario, only Rathnait can protect Felix adequately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she was just learning to see that way,\" Shanaye replied, \"Do you think she can sustain it while she's with Felix?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know how her abilities matured while she was held captive.  While her physical growth may have been stunted, her dragon abilities may not have been,\" Dracus replied, \"After all, she was able to produce steam powerful enough to kill a human, while the others haven't been able to make anything more than warm air.\"  Shanaye looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to say we should let Rathnait stay,\" Shanaye said, \"But with this unknown human in the mix . . . it seems the best option for Felix is to have Rathnait go with him.\"  Dracus nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we will go tell them she can go with him,\" Dracus said, following his wife back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed and Rathnait was grinning ear to ear after being told the good, to her anyway, news.  Her brothers and sisters exchanged looks for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, isn't this a bit of a reward considering her behavior recently?\" Alaster asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Shanaye replied, \"Your father and I choose to consider what happened to Rathnait while she was gone punishment enough for her actions.\"  Alaster nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Alaster replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix watched the talk from Rathnait's chest.  \"Rathnait, what's going on between your mother and Alaster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing important,\" Shanaye replied, \"Shall we head out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please,\" Felix said, before looking at Rathnait.  \"You may pick me up.\"  She nodded and reached down, pulling Felix to her chest.  Dracus handed Shanaye a small, to them, sac of gold and Rathnait followed her mother out of the cave and they took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, your father and I were wondering something,\" Shanaye said in dragon tongue as they flew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it mom?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is your eyesight developing?\" Shanaye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's coming along all right.  I was able to use it a few times at Lord William's to see when the guard was close to the door or not, but I couldn't do it for long,\" Rathnait replied, embarrassed by this failure.  Her mother caught that tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't say that.  The fact that you could breath steam so early is proof you're coming along nicely.  It's just some dragons see before they breath and others breath before they see,\" Shanaye replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knew they were talking but he didn't feel safe asking about what.  They were flying faster than the day before and he didn't chance to speak for fear of throwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I haven't had that much to eat for two meals ever,\"</i> Felix thought as his body was getting used to eating more food.  <i>\"I hope we land soon.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wish was granted as a few minutes later, Shanaye landed in the landing zone and Rathnait landed soon after.  She pulled Felix from her chest and set him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" Rathnait asked, seeing Felix's woozy expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I ate too much for breakfast,\" Felix said, dropping to his knees.  Rathnait recalled one of their talks in her cell, when she learned \"more\" and \"food\" and said how she needed more food and Felix confessed he also didn't eat much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you can't walk, you could ride on my back,\" Rathnait replied.  Shanaye's eyes narrowed a little.  For her, it was one thing to carry a human in the air but another to act like a horse or mule.  It was very degrading and people might think less of her if she did that.  But thankfully Felix shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can walk.  But thank you,\" Felix said, not wanting to be a burden on his friend.  Rathnait sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, this way then,\" Rathnait replied.  Shanaye waited to let them get ahead of her before walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief chat with the guards as to why they were there, Felix and Rathnait entered the human village, the gold on Rathnait's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking for a tailor... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix was amazed by the human village that was before him once he past the gate with Rathnait. The entire village was built on the side of the mountains. They had carved deep into the mountains and to make rodes as well and houses against the mountain wall before the roads. The roads went up in a spiral all the way up the mountain and were wide enough for a young dragon to walk on, though dragons a little older and bigger than Rathnait would take up the whole road. This spiral upward building was one at least five mountains and a stone bridge connected the other mountains to each other. In the center mountain was a large stone castle in the center which was even bigger than the castle Felix had lived in for five years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix also noticed that the outside walls of the villager were built to the bottoms of the villages. They were only structured around the bottom level. However, the walls still protected the village because it was strong with many guards on it. Plus, if they were to be attacked by humans, a human army would have to climb the mountain to get to the wall or use the path for the main gate. Felix also noticed farming on the mountains as well which seemed impossible to him. Only one of the mountains had this and the crops where on what platforms that jutted out of the mountain like steps. They had been caved in and replaced with soil for the crops. Felix could only imagine how long it took to built such a wondrous place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Felix wonder, she knew he was contemplating how this village was possible. \"My clan helped this village once we arranged a truce with each other,\" Rathnait explained, \"Apparently, the village was basic then because they couldn't carve into the mountain, but the adult dragons could and it had helped them out a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why the roads are large enough for you?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They used young to stand on the roads to judge it was large enough for the humans. It wasn't necessarily meant so that we could, but humans don't mind us and father's such good friends with them that it does happen from time to time,\" Rathnait explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we start going now?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait looked up at a higher mountain first and saw her mother perched on top of it. Shanaye could see the entire village and was making sure everything was fine. However, she knew that if something were to happen, she wouldn't be able to interfere. Rathnait then looked back down and Felix and said, \"Let's go, most of the shops are on this mountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Felix and Rathnait walked up the spiral path, looking for shop that would sell clothes. Rathnait was extremely careful where she stepped, not wanting to accidentally step on Felix or anyone else for that matter. Neither of them expected to run into a friend of Rathnait's family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait,\" a man called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait looked up from her feet and stopped while Felix stayed a little closer to her front legs. A man was walking down the path in expensive clothing, but nothing like Lord William's clothes that he liked to show off. The man also had a sheathed sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam,\" Rathnait remembered. \"Felix, this is Adam, the son of the lord father saved long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix understood he was a friend of Rathnait's family, but he was still a little nervous being around a son of a lord. So far, Felix hadn't had any good experiences with nobility which made him nervous around Adam. \"So, you're the Felix Dracus has told me much about,\" Adam said with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you know about me?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dracus told me much about you when he came into town for the payment he promised. He told me you save Rathnait from a terrible man and you helped her escape,\" Adam answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did all the fighting, I just unlocked the chains and taught her to speak human,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just being modest,\" Rathnait told Adam, \"He did a lot more than just that, and I'm very grateful for everything he did for me.\" Rathnait lowered her head to nuzzle Felix a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam was a little surprised about how affectionate and close Rathnait was to Felix. <i>\"Rathnait must have been through a lot of torture, and Felix must have been the only light in the darkness for her to be so close and affectionate,\"</i> Adam realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of ironic,\" Adam stated, \"Your father saves mine and now a human saves you Rathnait and both were saved from being lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and it would have been more ironic if it was one of your bloodline saving me,\" Rathnait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is would,\" Adam agreed, \"What brings you here Rathnait and Felix?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came to buy warmer clothes for Felix,\" Rathnait answered when she saw Felix wasn't going to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be sure to buy warm clothes, Felix,\" Adam stated, \"It gets very cold in the mountains, especially at night and especially at the altitudes the dragons live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded and Rathnait asked, \"May I ask what you're doing down here and not at the castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The traders are coming to the village soon and I always like looking at the things they sell. It is interesting to see what can be obtained miles away across land and sea,\" Adam told Rathnait, \"Be sure to be careful when you leave in case they come before you leave. I don't know how many have seen a dragon before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall be careful, Adam, thank you,\" Rathnait said before she let Adam pass and she and Felix started walking again. They soon came upon a shop with human clothes and Rathnait said, \"Go on in, Felix. I'll be waiting out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded and walked in the store. The store had many warm clothing as well as fine and expensive ones. A large and portly woman soon noticed Felix walk in the store and rushed to his attention. \"Oh you poor thing,\" She said, \"Look at those rags on your back. You must be freezing to death. Come, come, let's get you some warm clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portly woman quickly wrapped him in one of her own coats and let him sit in a chair. \"What happened dear?\" she questioned, \"Where did you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm one of the slaves that came from evil lord,\" Felix explained like it was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And nobody's attended to you yet?\" the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been with my friend the whole time,\" Felix explained, \"We haven't had time to come to the village until now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was slightly confused till she looked at the window to see a large dragon eye looking in on them. \"Oh, you're friends with the dragons,\" the woman realized. She then called to Rathnait, \"Don't you worry, I'll have warm clothing for him in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage walked out of his home, well the place he paid rent to live in. it was a place he had lived for five years, but the woman he lived with didn't mind. Kaage opened the door to see a baby cloud dragon three houses down looking into the window. Kaage stayed still by the door with his black cloak's hood still over his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched for the longest time and saw a boy and the store keeper come out to the dragon periodically. The boy was asking for the dragon's advice and listening to it to find the right clothes for him. it had been five years since he had seen the boy, but Kaage recognized him right away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage quickly opened the door and walked back in the medium's store. \"Kaage, I thought you were going to the marketplace,\" a woman who seemed to be in her twenties asked. (She wasn't actually twenty, but an immortal and a true medium as well as fortune telling, telling the future, and many other forms of magic.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have told me Felix would be here today, Rhian,\" Kaage replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't ask me if you would see Felix in your recent future,\" Rhian informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he remembers me?\" Kaage questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, I can't tell the future of someone until I meet them?\" Rhian replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam might be taking care of Felix, but I don't think he's decided yet,\" Kaage said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, you already told me that. Why don't you care for Felix yourself? Wouldn't his parents would have wanted you to...?\" Rhian began to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage interrupted, \"I can't. He needs to be with humans. If he is with me, Felix and I would both me in danger. They recognize me, but they wouldn't recognize Felix. I'm always in danger, but I can't let Felix be in danger too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't encountered them, the ones who chase you and wish to kill you and Felix, in quite some time,\" Rhian informed Kaage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't risk it,\" Kaage told her, \"I also have to get Felix away from those dragon. Seeing a dragon and being with dragon long enough might make him remember me. He might want to be with me and I can't let that happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaage, I sense someone is coming, hide,\" Rhian ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage stepped away from the door and turned invisible right away. Who walked in?      </span></div></div>",

Her brown curly hair bouncing as she did.  Adam waved his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I do not like being called Sir and you know it,\" Adam replied, \"I use that title only when I need to.\"  Rhian giggled slightly and lead Adam to a medium round table with the faces of the moon embroidered onto it.  And one chair sitting at each phase.  Above was a chandelier casting light down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.  Now what may I help you with today?  It's not near your wife's anniversary or birthday and you don't know what to get her?\" Rhian said, sitting at a new moon seat.  Adam took the customary full moon seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  I'm sure you noticed the number of people in rags yesterday and today,\" Adam said.  She gave an affirming \"Mmm\" and nod.  \"Well I was wondering about the fate of one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the person's name?\" Rhian asked, as she sensed Kaage drawing close to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix.  Dracus asked me a personal favor to raise the boy personally,\" Adam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know I can't see on the unknown,\" Rhian said, picking up her cards and started shuffling them, \"Have you even met the boy?\"  And this was true as well.  Her visions of the future were clouded if the person didn't know much about what they were asking or looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, not an hour ago.  He was very close with Dracus' first daughter,\" Adam said, \"She actually nuzzled him in a public street.\"  Rhian's eyes widened with true shock.  She had known many dragons in her ages and rarely had she heard of one who was openly affectionate with a human.  Even considering Adam and Michael's close relationship, the most they ever got was a bow and lick when they were younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you wish to know if it is right to separate that friendship with the distance between their domain and this town?\" Rhian asked.  Adam gave a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is conflicting.  Not only because I do feel after living a slave for that greedy bastard Lord William, Felix needs some strong human figures in his life.  But also, at his young age, trying to live alone with dragons can be very difficult.  I doubt many of the other dragons, even Dracus or Shanaye would like their daughter becoming so open with a human.  But in the same breath, I remember twelve years ago on a trip with my father, we stayed at Lord William's keep.  Every servant had some bruise or injury.  The atmosphere was dark.  He also inquired greatly about the dragons up here and how my father 'tamed' them.  He didn't believe my father when he said the dragons would die before being broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened?\" Rhian asked.  It was not often Adam spoke of his past to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the next two years, Lord William's men ventured to the lower parts of these mountains, only to leave when faced with my father's guards.  Father and I thought he had given up but . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something about my last reading gave you cause to look at him as Rathnait's holder?\" Rhian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'An old thorn of noble man from old woods has risen again to ensnare what was desired for many turns.  Only by finding light in shadow, can fresh air be found,'\" Adam recited, \"The old thorn of noble man meant someone who had antagonized the dragons or my father.  We have only few nobles who live by old woods.  Lord William was the only one who fit both.  I can only assume the second part was about Felix and Rathnait finding each other there.\"  Rhian nodded, her eyes darting behind Adam for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems likely,\" she said, holding out her hand.  Adam took her hand and waited for the other to start calling on her powers and show him his fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage moved behind Adam, listening intently.  With much focus and control, he made only his head visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make him believe Felix should go with him, regardless of what the cards tell you!\" he pleaded silently. Rhian looked up at him and gave a cold glare informing him at once, not to insult her by asking her to give false predictions.  Kaage flinched from the glare and hid himself once more.</span></div></div>",

This is because I have to look through your future since you are the one here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, and I understand that the more you dwell into the future, the more cloudy it becomes,\" Adam replied still holding Rhian's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is because the future is not truly set. Humans and other intelligent creatures have free will. They have choices. The more choices, the more the future can change,\" Rhian explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why everything you say is a possible future and not a set one. However, you possible future is the most likely path that would be chosen,\" Adam said remembering what she told him every time he asked her to see the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhian nodded and began calling her powers and the help of the spirits. After a few minutes, Rhian's head tilted back and and shook before dropping her head and drooping it over the table. Adam waited anxiously as Rhian prepared herself for the sight. Suddenly, Rhian's head raised and her eyes opened, revealing pure white eyes. \"Dracus has given you one day to decide, and you shall not obtain Felix until that time. I can see your second meeting with Felix, now,\" Rhian said in her predicting voice that sounded like many people speaking at once, female and male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhian drew a card. It many needles covering his a human brain as well as a heart. \"There will be some emotional pain for Felix being separated from Rathnait,\" Rhian explained the card. She picked up a knew card showing a man on top of a mountain with his arms stretched out to his sides at shoulder height. \"Yet, Felix will overcome this pain,\" Rhian said before drawing a new card and saying, \"Because he will accepted easily as a family member.\" The third card she drew was of a family embracing each other. A fourth card was drawn showing a woman on a balcony with a man climbing to her. \"And Rathnait will visit Felix and he will visit Rathnait frequently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, there seems to be things that will inevitably happen to him,\" Rhian continued. Rhian drew a card that showed a man kneeling on the ground with his hands reaching out to a women being pulled away from his by skeleton hands. \"He shall suffer great losses and many he loves dearly. No matter which path he follows loved ones would inevitably die before him.\"  Rhian drew another card. This card pictured a man with a dark cloud over his head and following him. \"He has a dark past he will eventually figure out and he will proceed to try and find the truth of his existence.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhian drew card number eight which featured three heads. \"He will meet three men that will become important. All will be men he had met before. Two from his distant past, he can't remember, and one from his recent past.\" Rhian drew another card with a man comforting a troubled soul. \"One is a friend and only wants to keep Felix safe from harm. A man who also wants Felix to forget his past only to shield Felix from pain and a dark evil.\" Rhian draws a card with an executioner. \"One from his distant past wishes to kill Felix. he is the man the first is protecting Felix from.\" Rhian revealed a torturer at the third man Felix would meet. \"The third is some who wants to torture Felix and enslave him, because of a great power Felix has without Felix realizing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix's future as a good possibility of being dark and full of loss no matter what, but there is still hope he will not succumb to the darkness,\" Rhian informed Adam. \"This is because...\" Rhian drew her final card which showed two dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhian hesitated for the longest time, but Adam didn't interrupt Rhian, fearing she might lose her concentration. \"His friendship will be strong and it will pull him out of many dark situations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rhian reverted to her normal self with a bit of a headache. \"Is it best I take in Felix?\" Adam questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might as well,\" Rhian replied, \"The inevitable cards will happen to Felix no matter what. He needs a family right away. if he stays with the dragons, it would take him longer to be accepted as a family member, but with you, it would be sooner. I fear the inevitable is a recent future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's considered recent?\" Adam questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more than a few years,\" Rhian explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your time Rhian,\" Adam said before trying to hand her a bag of gold coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhian shook her hand and said, \"This one if free, Adam. It is a very unusual fortune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam just nodded and left.  Kaage quickly appeared and asked, \"I'm the one shielding Felix, right? Is it truly inevitable that he's going to learn who I am and about his past?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true. If he stayed with the dragon's it would have been sooner,\" Rhian explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That last card is something I've never seen before. It means something more than what you said, doesn't it?\" Adam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhian nodded, knowing Kaage should know since he was part of Felix's future. \"It's the bond card. A magical bond that will occur between Rathnait and Felix. You know all too well what that means,\" Rhian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. Rathnait is already showing the symptoms as well as Felix I'm sure,\" Kaage said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's happening already. The only question is when will Felix and Rathnait realize it,\" Rhian stated.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Thank you, Madame Ruth,\" Felix thanked as he looked in the polished stone mirror.  He doubted he would have recognized himself.  When he came in he was a scrawny boy in rags.  But now he had a pair of leather pants and shirt, made apparently from hydra hide.  He was told they would help him keep warm higher in the mountains but probably be bad in warmer temperatures, and that was why in a sack, compliments of Madame Ruth, he had some clothes made from wool.  Felix looked down to his rags he called shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're most welcome,\" Madame Ruth, the tailor, said smiling.  She knew better than to cheat a friend of the dragons and also this boy had been very kind and patient while being measured.  She noticed his glare.  \"There's a shop up the street with a cobbler in it.  Warm clothes will do little for your feet,\" she said.  Felix nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you again,\" Felix said, walking to the door.  He grabbed some gold from Rathnait's bag and returned.  \"Is this enough?\" Felix asked.  Madame Ruth had to hold her shock seeing the boy give her three times the gold his purchase cost.  She shook her head with great effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, half will suffice,\" she replied.  Felix nodded and gave Madame Ruth half of the gold in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thank you once again,\" Felix said departing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please make sure you tell any of your friends about me,\" Madame Ruth called as Felix and Rathnait continued up the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for them to find the cobbler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good day sir,\" Mr. Pebbles said, welcoming Felix into his workshop.  \"Are you here to deliver some hide from the dragons young sir?\"  Felix was taken back by how the man addressed him, judging by his outfit to be something like a goods seller for the dragons.  But given what he was wearing and Rathnait looking in the window again, Felix could understand the man's assumption<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no.  I need some shoes sir,\" Felix said.  Mr. Pebbles looked down at the rags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  And what type of shoes do you require?\" Mr. Pebbles asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ones that would do well in mountains sir,\" Felix replied.  Mr. Pebbles nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get you measured,\" Mr. Pebbles said, picking up a two rulers.  He moved Felix to sit in a chair and measured both feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.  I have something in stock now that might fit you,\" Mr. Pebbles said, \"Otherwise, all I can do is give you much larger shoes until your pair is made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to try them,\" Felix said.  Mr. Pebbles nodded and went behind a counter and pulled out a pair of basilisk skin boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These were made for someone of your size but when it came to pay, they just tried running off with them,\" Mr. Pebbles said, kneeling before Felix to put a boot down, holding the other.  Felix took the rag off to reveal a hard, tough skinned foot.  He slipped his foot into the shoe and was amazed at how soft the inside felt.  There was some soft material inside that cushioned the foot while the hard outside was tough and ready for rocky ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's great!  My foot fits like a glove,\" Felix exclaimed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No room for much movement?\" Mr. Pebbles asked, happy his work was appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None at all,\" Felix said, smiling, but Mr. Pebbles coughed and was holding his hand out, glaring down at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then payment please,\" Mr. Pebbles said.  Felix pulled out the other half of the gold he didn't give to Madame Ruth and looked at Mr. Pebbles.  \"Is this enough?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take this much,\" Mr. Pebbles said, pulling only a few gold coins, leaving a good many left.  \"This will cover this pair and the ones I will make for you.\"  He placed the second boot down and went to his money box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I need more than one pair?\" Felix asked.  Mr. Pebbles heard a growl from outside as Rathnait was listening in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because young sir, you are still growing,\" Mr. Pebbles said, ignoring Rathnait's growl,  \"After a short time, those shoes will be too tight on your feet.  The ones I make will be big enough so you only need to come every few months for new boots.\"  Felix nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense,\" Felix said, \"When will my other pair be ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a week, depending on other orders,\" Mr. Pebbles said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The I'll see you then,\" Felix said, walking in his new boots, leaving the cobbler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait looked down at Felix and could hardly believe he was the same scared little kid in rags she snapped at almost two months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we go head off to my mother?\" Rathnait asked.  Felix nodded and they started back the way they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back was peaceful until they heard a scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr-Dragon!\" cried a man in rich looking clothes.  A man in mercenary gear moved forward and saw Rathnait and attacked her without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Felix cried out, moving in the man's way.  But it was a small ten year old boy against a fully grown adult, the result was instantly clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick shove, the mercenary moved Felix to the side, sending him to the ground where he felt a snap in his left arm as he gasped in pain from the break.  Rathnait surged with anger and quickly smacked the agressor and shoved him to the ground, ready to kill him.</span></div></div>",

Though she was an infant dragon, all dragons had little troubles killing. They had the logic and reason of humans, but they also still had animal instincts. Those instincts knew killing was a part of life and animals had to fight and kill to survive. Plus, when someone harmed a friend of a dragon, the dragon would do anything in its power to protect and save their friend, no matter the cost or cause. Rathnait's animal instincts, the same animal instincts that helped her kill the guards and snapped at Felix when she first met him months ago, was now taking over Rathnait as she lifted her left claws to slice the mercenary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something Rathnait could not explain and she didn't understand happened at that moment. When she lifted her paw high, she felt an intense pain between her elbow and paw. Rathnait backed up while favoring her left front leg and roared as the pain as her pain worsened. The pain was too great to ignore and she had to turn her attention to her front leg, but when she looked down, there were no bruises or cuts. There seemed to be nothing wrong except that her bone was in unbearable pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix painfully rolled on his back to see what was going on. he didn't bother looking at his wound, because he knew his bone was broke. In fact, his bone was actually protruding out of his skin. Yet, Felix didn't care about his broken bone. he cared about Rathnait, and he became worried that the mercenary would kill Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix saw Rathnait looking at her leg while the mercenary approached her neck with his sword. A crowd was all around them and Adam was trying to push his way through to save Rathnait, but he wasn't going to get there in time. \"Rathnait, look out!\" Felix hollered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait looked up right away, which suddenly ceased, once Felix yelled to her. She saw a sword swinging towards her neck, but there was nothing she could do to stop it. It was way too late. Rathnait shut her eyes tightly and waited for the blade to kill her. Instead of feeling a blade, she heard two blade clang against each other. Rathnait opened her eyes and saw the mercenary's sword had been blocked by another blade. The other blade was being held by a man in a black cloak with his hood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage had gone to the marketplace, despite Felix being in the village. Kaage went, because Kaage felt that Felix still probably wouldn't recognize him with his hood on. <i>\"Then again, Rhian said our meeting would be inevitable and he will eventually know the truth about me and his parents.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage soon thought about the last card that was drawn. He looked around and saw Rathnait and Felix heading for the marketplace to leave through the front gate. <i>\"The magical bond between them will inevitable happen. of all the dragon species, he bonds with a cloud dragon. I never thought it was possible for a cloud dragon to bond with a human. Because like fire, gold, and frost dragons, cloud dragons are very proud creatures and they only tend to bond with other dragons of their species. Yet, Rathnait is bonding with Felix and even nuzzling him in public despite being a proud creature. She and Felix must have been through very dark times in their imprisonment and Felix and Rathnait must of been each other's only friend in that place for the bond to start so quickly. Then again, Felix isn't a normal human. His father...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage's thoughts were interrupted when he heard a trader scream. Kaage noticed one of the trader's guards, a mercenary, begin attacking Rathnait without thinking. Kaage hated such people who blindly followed orders without thinking. However, he hated dragon slayers worse. Dragon slayers killed dragons because they thought they were monsters. However, all dragons had intelligence, it just that some didn't speak like humans making them seem like blood-thirsty and mindless monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage watched as Felix was pushed to the ground and his frail arm snapped with the bond protruding the skin. Kaage clutched his fist upon seeing Felix in such pain. He wanted to kill the mercenary right then and there. However, it looked like Rathnait had it under control and it was best not to show himself to Felix unless there was no other choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rathnait's left front leg hurt her and she backed off before she could deliver the final blow. <i>\"They can already feel each other's pain. Their bond is developing quicker than I've ever seen before!\"</i> Kaage realized. He also noticed the mercenary ready to kill Rathnait. <i>\"If they can already feel pain, what will happen if Rathnait dies?\"</i> Kaage wondered, <i>\"I can't risk it. I can't let it happen.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage quickly teleported to where the mercenary was and blocked the mercenary's sword with his own sword. The mercenary was shocked by the sudden appearance and Kaage could easily kick the mercenary to the ground. Kaage placed the tip of his sword on the mercenary's neck and glared at him. While Kaage was doing this, Rathnait walked to Felix and formed a circle around him to protect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you protecting that beast? It's going to kill us all!\" the mercenary screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most dragons don't attack humans unless their provoked,\" Kaage explained, \"You probably think dragons are mindless beasts right? You thought this dragon was attacking the village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why else would a dragon be here?\" the mercenary questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had business here,\" Adam interrupted when he finally got past the crowd, \"She was here to buy cloth for her friend. The same human you pushed down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see dragons are intelligent like you and me,\" Kaage added, \"Their not just some blood-thirsty monster. And don't tell me you were just following orders from that pathetic trader. You could have at least waited your blade. If you would have done that, maybe you'd figure out she didn't mean your paranoid friend any harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaage, I believe I can handle this,\" Adam stated, \"You can use magic. I know this since you live with the only other magical being in this village, Rhian. Can any of your magic be used for healing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Kaage answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then help Felix and Rathnait,\" Adam ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage nodded and walked to the protective dragon. Rathnait growled as Kaage approached. \"Easy Rathnait, I mean you and Felix no harm,\" Kaage explained as he held his hands up and kept his hood up as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know are names then?\" Rathnait questioned. The traders that never seen a dragon before, especially the trader and mercenary making the trouble, were shocked upon hearing Rathnait speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam told me your name,\" Kaage explained, \"Please, let me help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait opened up her circle and only let Kaage through before closing it again. Kaage approached Felix who had brought his left arm close to his chest. \"Felix,\" Kaage said, \"I'm hear to help you. I can heal your arm, but you mustn't be afraid. My magical powers look like dark magic, but it isn't dark magic. This will still cause more pain on your arm, but it is to heal you. You both understand this, right?\" Kaage had included Rathnait, because he knew she would become very protective if he were to hurt Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait and Felix nodded and Kaage started. \"I'm going to have to put the bone back in and it will hurt. However, if I don't, it will never heal,\" Kaage explained. Felix understood and Kaage's hands turned back like a shadow. Felix and Rathnait were a little frightened by the shadow hands. They were able to pass through Felix's skin without pain, but they grabbed around the bone and moved it in place. Felix had to fight back his screams and tears poured down his face. Kaage noticed Rathnait feeling the same pain and saw her place her head next to Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the bone was in place, Kaage used a spell to keep it in place and heal the wound. \"Your arm can be used now, and it will only hurt if you use it too much. You have to be careful and not over work it. It might break again,\" Kaage informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For how long?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For at least two or three weeks,\" Kaage explained, \"You can still use it, just be careful not to strain it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you accept a beast like that in your village?\" the trader asked with his mercenary on his feet now by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't traded her before have you? We have a truce with the cloud dragons. We're neighbors and help each other out when in trouble. We accept each other and cooperate,\" Adam informed the trader, \"The guards should have told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that monster is...\" The mercenary explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait is not a monster. She is the daughter of a good friend of mine and I will not have you insult her. Her mother wouldn't like it either. I assume she can hear our words,\" Adam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the trader and mercenary could ask, Adam pointed to a mountain top near the village. They saw an enormous dragon perched at the top growling menacingly at the two men. \"You see,\" Adam explained, \"The dragon you attacked is just an infant dragon. They're the only ones that can fit on our streets. Dragons are very protective of their friends and family. Of all the crimes you can commit against a dragon, harming one of its friends or family is the worst. That is why it is against our law to harm a dragon or a friend of a dragon. Since this crime happened in this village, the dragons will accept whatever punishment my father agrees upon. However, if you leave the village, the dragons can do what they want with you. You don't want to the dragon's punishment for such a crime. Like I said, you have committed the worst crime to a dragon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercenary looked fearfully up at the mother dragon before he drew two knives. He used one to kill the trader before anyone noticed what was happening. With the speed of an highly trained assassin, the mercenary threw his knife at Adam's throat. However, Kaage had already left Rathnait's circle and caught the knife with telepathy. He then twirled the knife and threw it back at the mercenary with the flick of his hand. Adam turned to Kaage in a little bit of shock and Kaage bowed his head before saying, \"Glad to be of service to you, future lord.\" Kaage then walked off to look at what else he could buy from the marketplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's best I walk with the two of you to the landing zone,\" Adam suggested. Felix and Rathnait agreed and They all walked to the landing zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Couldn't think of any choices. Just continue the story with either one.)</span></div></div>",

He looked down at the young man, impressed by how different he looked dressed like he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, besides those men, did you have an easy time with your shopping?\" Adam asked.  Felix nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nice to not be the one waiting on others.  These clothes are warm and my boots, well, I really like them,\" Felix said.  Adam noticed a mark left in Felix's imprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you went to Mr. Pebble's,\" Adam said, recognizing the man's craft mark, \"He's one of the best and cheapest in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  I was worried Felix might have been cheated,\" Rathnait said.  Adam looked up at Rathnait as they approached the landing zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, if you don't mind me asking, what happened back when you had that man down?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I just felt a pain in my front leg between my elbow and paw,\" Rathnait said as a loud thud came before them as Shanaye landed.  Adam saw a look of shock on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were hurt by that man Rathnait. What happened?\" Shanaye growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he didn't even touch me long enough to harm me.  I just felt pain,\" Rathnait said, looking away, confused by what had happened.  But Adam continued looking at Shanaye and after knowing her and Dracus for so long, he knew from her expression something big happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shanaye, will you be going after the others in the caravan or if they leave with a small punishment, as it wasn't them who attacked Felix or ordered the attack, will that satisfy you?\" Adam called.  Shanaye shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given that they didn't harm my baby, I'll leave it for you to punish,\" Shanaye said, before noticing Felix wasn't clutching his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, I'm impressed your healing skills could heal a broken arm,\" Shanye said approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't do it.  A human mage did it.  His hands turned into shadows and pushed the bone back in and healed Felix,\" Rathnait said, \"My leg also felt better.\"  Shanaye nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you take Felix home.  I want to say a few things to Sir Adam about some business dealings,\" Shanaye said.  Rathnait nodded and gently picked Felix up in her right paw and took off.  Once gone, Adam looked at Shanaye with a serious face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind telling me what's happening between them?\" Adam asked.  Shanaye glanced at Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a dragon issue,\" she replied curtly.  Adam was used to the tone.  Whenever he broached a subject the dragons felt was too personal, the dragon would answer the same way Shanaye had just answered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, unless you're rescinding the offer for Felix to live with me, I feel I have the right,\" Adam replied.  \"And add in that I feel I will take him in, it seems I should get some explanation.\"  Shanaye sighed, realizing Adam had a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems Rathnait is bonding with Felix.  This means they will grow closer and closer to the other,\" Shanaye said, \"Shared pain is a symptom of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  Will Felix being far away hurt them?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it will be inconvenient and they will long to see each other but nothing serious should occur,\" Shanaye replied, \"So, why did you choose to let Felix in so quickly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a smart, brave young boy,\" Adam said, \"Not many would stand up to a mercenary like he did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  Well, Dracus and I will talk to Felix this evening and tomorrow, we will let you know if he is coming to live with you,\" Shanaye replied before taking off as well.  Adam turned and walked back to town scowling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhain, did you not tell me everything?\" Adam murmured.</span></div></div>",

I thought he had injured you and then was going for the kill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he didn't even touch me,\" Rathnait told Felix, \"The pain just happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you say you felt the pain?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My front left leg between my elbow and paw. Just the bone hurt,\" Rathnait answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was silent for a while as he thought about what had happened. <i>\"My left arm had been broken by the mercenary and it was at the same spot Rathnait described her left leg hurt,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"Did she feel my pain? But how is that possible?\"</i> Felix had no idea what magical bonds were. So, he couldn't come to that conclusion. Instead, Felix thought, <i>\"She mustn't have felt my pain. There has to be some other explanation for it. But, should I tell Rathnait about the theory? Could she know what could cause someone to feel another's pain?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Felix could ask Rathnait anything, Shanaye caught up with her daughter easily. \"You sure both of you are alright?\" Shanaye asked both Felix and Rathnait with almost equal concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're both fine, thanks to that man in the black hood,\" Rathnait told her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man in the black hood? You mean the one that blocked the sword that was coming at you?\" Shanaye questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he healed Felix,\" Rathnait said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShanaye soon remembered Dracus saying he had encountered a strange human-like creature that morning. The creature had smelled human and looked human, but Dracus knew the creature wasn't human. The cloaked person who saved Rathnait from the mercenary was exactly like the creature Dracus had described. Shanaye hadn't been concerned at the time and didn't realize it looked like the creature Dracus described, because she was too concerned with the safety of Rathnait and Felix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did the man heal Felix?\" Shanaye questioned. She had no idea what the cloaked creature did, because her anger had been focused on the mercenary and the trader. All she knew was that Rathnait had curled around Felix protectively as she looked upon the trader and the mercenary with furious anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His hands turned to shadow,\" Rathnait explained, \"His hands then went through Felix's arm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His hands went everything except the bone,\" Felix interrupted, \"His hands wrapped around the bone and then pushed it in place. Even my bone seemed to go through my skin once he touched it. My bone didn't become physical again till it was in place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could pass through whatever objects he wants and also turn other thins he touches into that shadow-like substance as well?\" Shanaye questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that sounds about right,\" Felix replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShanaye looked away and thought to herself, <i>\"The man sounds like he's a shadow dragon! He might be a shadow dragon in disguise as a human, but why would a shadow dragon live in a human village. They're usually very reclusive. Also, Shadow dragons don't live in this parts. They're from a distant country.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Rathnait asked her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Shanaye replied as she shook her head, \"Let's just get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was silence the rest of the way to the cave in the mountains, and Rathnait and Shanaye decided to fly faster. Felix was just glad Rathnait held him, because he feared he would be able to hold on if he were to be on her back. Shanaye and Rathnait arrived at the cave and once Rathnait landed, she carefully placed Felix on his feet. Felix looked around the cave and the dragon siblings were in there usual groups. Alaster, Allehe, and Sorcha were together, Brodee was alone as usual,  and Joscelyne, Egan, and Eshne were together. Joscelyne, Egan, and Eshne were playing with there father and climbing on there father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they noticed Shanaye, Rathnait, and Felix arrive, all the dragon siblings approached Felix to see his new clothes. As usual, Joscelyne, Egan, and Eshne were the most curious and they were down low sniffing Felix and studying him closely. \"He smells like Felix,\" Egan stated in dragon, \"but he doesn't look like Felix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, Felix looks very different in his new clothes. Are they hydra skins?\" Sorcha questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are,\" Rathnait told her sister, the grouped was still talking in dragon since Rathnait was the only sibling who could speak human well enough. Rathnait looked down at Felix between her front legs and said, \"They say you look like a different human with those clothes,\" Rathnait told Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I feel like a new person myself,\" Felix admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Felix would wish to play a game with us?\" Eshne asked Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it would have to be a game that a human could play,\" Rathnait informed her sister, \"Humans are much smaller than us and we wouldn't want to harm Felix, would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" Egan and Eshne said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, he mustn't strain his left arm too much,\" Rathnait told them, \"He was injured in the village and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Is he alright?\" Were some of the concerned and worried questions the seven other siblings asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A man tried to attack me and Felix tried to stop him. That terrible man broke Felix's arm. Luckily a mage healed Felix, but he can't strain his arm too much or it might break again,\" Rathnait warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we can think of some kind of game,\" Joscelyne said, \"Where's mother and father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They went to the back of the cave,\" Alaster informed the group, \"They must have something important to talk about again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely about what happened today at the village,\" Rathnait said.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: While the dragons and Felix play a game, something else happens that is proof of the magical bond between Felix and Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: While the dragon's play with Felix, Dracus and Shanaye have many serious things to talk about...</span></div></div>",

She saw he was pushing hard into their stone floor as she finished telling him everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracus was taking a few breaths, organizing what he knew into the proper priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, first off I was right about this mysterious man,\" Dracus said, \"He wasn't human, but do you really believe he is a shadow dragon in human guise?\"  Shanaye nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He would have to be.  It is the only thing that fits.  The next closest is he's actually human who knows shadow healing magic, but you discounted that because he didn't smell human,\" Shanaye replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.  Did you tell Adam about this?\" Dracus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it wasn't brought up in our brief talk,\" Shanaye said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this man was known by Adam and others it seems.  Otherwise Adam would have brought it up and asked if we knew this man,\" Dracus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.  Adam is very observant about things around him.  Do you believe Felix would be safe if he lived in the town?\" Shanaye replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so.  Shadow dragons were never ones to pick fights and if he has made his home there, like he proclaimed, then I doubt he would attack from within,\" Dracus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Shanaye asked.  Dracus nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  My grandfather was a shadow dragon and the only person he opened up to outside of his blood was my grandmother,\" Dracus replied. \"He didn't open much to his own grandchildren.  That's why Brodee likes to be alone.  He's his great-grandfather reborn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right but what about what's happening at this moment to our first daughter?\" Shanaye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean bonding with Felix?\" Dracus asked, looking at his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Do you think we should stop it so she doesn't . . . .\" Shanaye replied before Dracus shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you wish it wasn't a human she was bonding with.  But you must remember this means that even if Rathnait hasn't said it, she is gaining absolute trust in Felix and Felix, likewise, is gaining a similar trust in her.  And if it wasn't for that trust, our daughter could have been broken by that human lord,\" Dracus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. . .yes, you are right.  I guess part of me is also worried because once she bonds, she may never find a dragon to mate with,\" Shanaye replied.  Dracus nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if they keep together like they are now.  But maybe if we let them grow up without each other, the bond won't become so great and they can each find someone they care about,\" Dracus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wise as always my love,\" Shanaye said, nuzzling Dracus, \"So, do you want to talk to Felix alone or with Rathnait near by?\"</span></div></div>",

He could either just talk to Felix alone, but he knew that he shouldn't leave Rathnait out of the conversation. \"We might as well tell both of them. This news concerns Rathnait just as much as it concerns Felix,\" Dracus answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" Shanaye conceded, \"If we were just to tell Felix and bring him to Adam's tomorrow without telling Rathnait previously, she might do something rash again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, if we were to talk to Felix alone, Rathnait would most likely listen in,\" Dracus concluded, \"We need to figure out what we will tell them and how we'll go about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Shanaye questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we obviously have to tell them about Adam and what we were planning to do. Rathnait might not like what we were doing behind her back, but we'll have to explain why Felix needs to live with humans,\" Dracus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely, Rathnait and Felix will understand our reasons,\" Shanaye replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but this bond changes things,\" Dracus informed his mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you getting second thoughts?\" Shanaye questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Dracus said, \"Who are we to separate those with a magical bond? Even if it is a bond with a dragon and a human, should we be the ones to stop it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it will never stop. Once it starts up, there's no way to reverse it,\" Shanaye informed Dracus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but separating them from each other at a critical moment...\" Dracus replied, \"It could deeply affect them if separated, especially during the starting stages of the bond. Maybe we should tell them about the bond and let them decided what do do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Shanaye gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be better for them if they willing choose to separate. If they were forced away, it could cause pain to their psyche,\" Dracus explained, \"They could then successfully live separate lives even with the strong bond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they choose to stay with each other?\" Shanaye questioned, \"They couldn't live normal lives then, could they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because a magical bond happens, it doesn't mean love. Use cloud dragons usually are too proud to bond with other species and we bond with our mates. But, magical bonds between different species has occurred before, and it doesn't normally cause those bonded to fall in love. it is possible that Rathnait and Felix could only stay very good friends with the bond, even when they live together. However, that usually results in trying to find another pair that is bonded and...\" Dracus trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're saying that if Felix and Rathnait decide to have Felix live with us and that Felix and Rathnait stay good friends, they can still have a normal life?\" Shanaye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix wouldn't have a normal life if we raise him, and he won't find a human mate up here. he'd have to find one that accepts him and Rathnait and Rathnait's mate would have to accept Felix, even if Felix should choose to live in the village, because the bond would still be strong and noticeable,\" Dracus stated, \"Also, Felix would gain some of Rathnait's abilities with the bond like magic, tough skin but still human skin, and dragon aging. He will live as long as a dragon and if he was to choose a human mate, she'd die much sooner than him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bond makes everything more complicated,\" Shanaye agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Shanaye and Dracus decided on what to tell Rathnait and Felix and they walked back into the main chamber. Rathnait, Felix, Sorcha, Egan, and Eshne were all playing a game together. They were having fun and it seemed a safe enough game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Shanaye and Dracus decided to let the human and dragons play the game.

It sounded like her mother disapproved of what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the other thing we wished to talk with you about.  It involves Adam,\" Dracus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about him?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, do you think it will be easy for you to live here with us?\" Shanaye asked in a polite tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it may be troublesome, especially with meal times.  I mean, I won't be able to eat raw meat, will I?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In cases I've heard about a human bonding with a dragon, no, they didn't acquire a taste for uncooked food,\" Dracus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning you would need to make a fire or have one of us cook it for you,\" Shanaye said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind doing that,\" Rathnait said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also couldn't travel anywhere outside the cave without one of us,\" Dracus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could carry him,\" Rathnait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's their point,\" Felix said, \"I'd be dependent on you for a lot of things.\"  Rathnait looked at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that's bad?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if it's bad, but it doesn't feel right to me,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to be self sufficient for the most part, correct?\" Dracus asked.

Rathnait lowered her head right in front of Felix and stared at him with tear filled eyes. \"Are you really going to live with Adam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it will be harder for me to live with dragons.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though Rathnait was finally falling asleep, all she could think about was Felix and what would happen now that her true friend was leaving to live a the village. Since she was thinking about what would happen next and next stopped thinking about Felix, something strange happened that night and both Felix and Rathnait developed there telepathy with each other. None of their abilities should have been developing so fast, but is was because of the trust they had with each other. It was because of the terrible darkness they were both and it was because they found each other in the darkness and helped each other find light and escape. It was an experience that could only be truly understood by those who had found the light in complete darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had been having a dreamless sleep until he found himself lying against a stone wall instead of Dracus's side. Felix moved his head around, because it almost seemed as though he had been teleported somewhere and was actually awake. He was able to move his body around and everything. (What had happened was that his conscious was teleported out of his mind and into another, but his conscious made it almost like a virtual reality for him.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix found himself in a familiar place, the dungeon hallways of Lord William's castle. Felix still didn't know what was going on and he very confused and frightened. <i>\"Did I somehow get back here? What happened? How'd I get back here?\"</i> Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix heard a roar, followed by deep sobs. Felix knew that roar and the sobs. He knew whose they were and quickly ran down the hallway to the cell that Rathnait used to be in. Felix forced the door open to find Rathnait in the center of the dark and dank cell with chains around her once more. Rathnait was lying on her stomach and her head was lying against the ground with her eyes closed and swollen from all the tears that had fallen from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had never seen the dragon like this before and he was in shock and awe and just stood at the open doorway without her noticing him at all. Felix remember when he had first met Rathnait, she was a proud dragon whose spirit seemed like it could never break. Now she seemed to be in a terribly broken state. Felix couldn't just stand and watch her cry like she was. Felix ran to her head, knelt beside her muzzle, and quickly leaned against it and hugged it will petting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait opened her eyes to see Felix was with her again. \"Felix,\" Rathnait said still crying, but her voice was filled with joy and relief. Rathnait though Felix was part of her dream and not the real Felix, but it didn't matter to her. To have Felix, dream or not, with her in her time of need was a great relief to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, tell me what's wrong,\" Felix replied. He wanted so much to help her and comfort her, but he didn't know what was wrong. he still didn't even know if this was a dream or if it was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're leaving me,\" Rathnait sobbed, \"You leaving me to live in the human village. You'll be so far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be that far away,\" Felix tried to assure Rathnait, \"You and I could visit each other at least one or two days a week and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that doesn't seem enough,\" Rathnait sobbed, \"You've been alway there for me once I met you, once we developed a way to communicate with each other. You were the one that helped me keep my sanity in this place. Without you, I feel like I'm back in this prison cell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait,\" Felix said as he laid against her muzzle closer, \"I will always be there for you, even in I'm a thousand miles away. I'd always be your friend, you'd always be my truest friend and nothing could change that. You helped me just as much and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why is it easier for you that we part? Why are you as sad as me?\" Rathnait questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sad and I don't wish to leave,\" Felix stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you? Why can't you stay here with me. I could take care of you and...\" Rathnait started to argue.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nBut Felix interrupted, \"Because, I know that it would be best for me to live with humans, because I am human. And you need to live with dragons until you're old enough. I understand that sacrifices are a part of life. Sometimes we have to do things we don't want, because it would be better for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to miss you very much,\" Rathnait replied while nuzzling Felix affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll miss you too, but we'll still see each other regularly, just not every day,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Rathnait and Felix begin to realize they were actually sharing a dream, or did they continue to think the other were just a part of their own dreams?</span></div></div>",

What's the last thing you remember?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was lying against your father's tail and then nothing.

The walls and castle were gone.  Only the stone beneath them remained of the castle and it stretched only until where the walls once were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's created by both of our dreams and thoughts?\" Felix said, \"Why don't we look around?\"  Rathnait nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what we'll find,\" Rathnait replied, rising to her full height.  Felix started off, with Rathnait close behind him.  \"It's really beautiful,\" Rathnait said, looking out into the green field.  Her gaze turned to Felix.  She so wished Felix was an adult and she was too so they could be together.  She closed her eyes, wanting that to be so real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is,\" Felix said, feeling off.  He stopped walking and saw his hands looked larger.  He looked down and saw he wasn't wearing what he had before, but something close to what Adam wore in town.  \"What the?\" he said, \"Rathnait, is something wrong with . . .WOW!\"  Felix jumped out of the way as a huge foot came down.  Felix looked up and saw it was Rathnait who had nearly stepped on him, but she was closer to her mother in size now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix?\" Rathnait said, hearing his yell but didn't see him before her.  She looked to the side and saw a very tiny human below her.  She heard it calling her name.  \"Felix!\" she replied.  The figure nodded.  She lowered her large head and looked at Felix.  \"How did you shrink?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't shrink.  It looks like we both grew up,\" Felix said, though his body was older, his voice was the same, \"Did you know what might have caused it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was just thinking what it'd be like for us to be adults,\" Rathnait replied, realizing she might have changed their forms.  She smiled a huge smile.  \"This is amazing.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This means we can probably use this to see each other everyday when we're gone,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, do you want to use this to look into your past to try and remember your parents?\" Rathnait asked.</span></div></div>",

A place that's in neither of our minds but in between. We have telepathy, right? What if we can enter each other's minds?\" Rathnait wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think the two of us can go in one of our minds?\" Felix questioned. he was nervous about this. He had never had someone enter his mind before. It was the only thing he had to himself. Having another enter his mind seemed like violation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait sensed Felix's nervousness and could see it in his eyes, despite how large she was too him. \"Felix, you're worried about me going in your mind. You don't want me there, do you?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not because it's you,\" Felix tried to assure her, \"It's just that my mind has always been my own and having another person in it... well it's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Rathnait replied, \"But you can trust me. I wouldn't do anything to harm your brain. You trust me, right?\" Rathnait slightly nudged him with her huge snout. Despite the massive jaw she had now, she was still gentle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, but there is another reason,\" Felix told her, \"I... I don't know if I want to know what happened. I don't know if I want to know why my parents weren't there for me when I became a slave. Lord William always told me my parents sold me for money and that they didn't love me at all. What if he's right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait could see Felix's tears and she moved her massive head behind him and rubbed her muzzle against his back. \"It will be alright,\" Rathnait tried to assure Felix, \"It doesn't matter what happens in the memory. Even if your parents did sell you, you would have never found me if they didn't. We would have never met and I wouldn't have found a savior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait was new at the comforting. It was usually Felix comforting her and the reverse roles was a little strange for Rathnait. However, she did a good enough job at comforting Felix, because he eventually felt better and said, \"Alright, we'll try to enter my mind and see into my past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I promise you can enter my mind too, if it makes you fell better,\" Rathnait informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait and Felix had no idea how to enter Felix's. So, they just concentrated on wanting to do so. Eventually, they opened their eyes and saw a large hallway of widows that seemed to stretch forever. Felix noticed he was himself again and Rathnait was young again too. However, there was something very different about Rathnait. She was the same size as Felix!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" was all the two of them could say as they looked at each other. Felix and Rathnait looked at each other for the longest time till Felix finally touched Rathnait's muzzle. Rathnait moved her muzzle and nuzzled Felix's neck and cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is very strange,\" Rathnait commented, \"I never imagined you being the same size as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of like it,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like me being my normal size?\" Rathnait questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do like you at you normal size sometimes. You can protect me and let me ride you. I do also like when we fly together and you carry me. However, your normal size is very intimidating at times,\" Felix explained, \"Besides, we can be closer when we're the same size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I shall be the same size as you sometimes when we are in the dreamworld, if that's what you want,\" Rathnait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do anything for me, wouldn't you,\" Felix stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you're my best friend,\" Rathnait answered, \"I'd do anything for you if you ask it of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's find out about my past,\" Felix replied and the walked down the hallway towards the back. The past the windows and each one had a memory with in them. Rathnait didn't look at many of them. She didn't want to feel like an intruder in Felix's mind. She was only there for support, not to intrude on his memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Felix made it to the first memory he remembered, he found the rest of the hall was blocked by a black shadow. Felix placed his hand on the shadow wall and tried to push through. The wall bent, but it didn't break. \"I... I can't get through. It's blocked,\" Felix stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me try,\" Rathnait said, determined to let her friend see his past. Rathnait pushed on the wall, but it still wouldn't budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful,\" Felix warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait then hit her body against the wall with all her might. The wall was strong, but it was beginning to give in to Rathnait's power. Eventually, Rathnait was able to push her head and half her neck through the wall, but the rest was being held back. She continued pushing, but it was no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA window caught Rathnait's eye and she turned her head to look at it. In the window appeared to be the aftermath of a battle scene. Many humans were dead on the ground and only a black dragon, the size of Dracus, was left standing. The black dragon was fearsome with red eyes, large horns, and looked demonic. (All shadow dragons looked terrible and evil, but very few were actually evil. Most shadow dragons were shy and reserved creatures and kind to others.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood stained the black dragon's teeth and claws as he walked over to the cave he was defending. He came upon a baby human inside. The baby looked to be about two years old and very frightened. The black dragon approached the child and lowered his head in front of the child and gave a purr like growl. The growl reminded Rathnait of when her parents tried to assure her and comfort her. The human child hugged the massive muzzle and the dragon nuzzled the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was sadness in the black dragon's eyes and the dragon said, \"I'm sorry Felix, but I can't take care of you anymore. You aren't safe with me. They'll try to find me to get to you and I can't let you death me in my claws. This has to be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the wall forced Rathnait out and she was forced into Felix.

However, when she heard her daughter approach and ask such a strange question, Shanaye lifted her head and looked down at her daughter. \"Why do you ask such a question?\" Shanaye questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait thought about telling her mother about Felix's past, but then she realized it might be a bad idea. <i>\"Felix was worried to have me in his mind. He's closer to me than my parents. he probably wouldn't want me to reveal his secrets to them. Especially since he didn't know them himself. I have to let Felix tell them if he wants to.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just curious, because I know there are many different dragons much different than us,\" Rathnait replied innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. There are at least ten different species that I know of,\" Shanaye stated, \"Each species is unique in their own way and live different lifestyles. All of them except two are actually bigger than us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are dragons much larger than us?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly all of them are. Three of them, the Earth, Silver, and Gold dragons, can easily grow four times bigger than us,\" Shanyae informed her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait was in utter shock. She had no idea something could be larger than her parents, let alone four times that. Rathnait remembered how small Felix look when she was adult sized in her dream. She could imagine being four times bigger than that, Felix would be a speck. \"How can such large creatures live on this planet?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the Earth dragons are usually underground. I don't know what they eat, but it's nothing on the surface. The Earth dragon have a whole society down there and they barely come up. No one has seen and Earth dragon for a thousand years. The silver and Gold dragons don't need to eat to survive. Gold dragons use the sun for energy and the silver dragons draws energy from the life forces around us, without killing things or course. Plus, there are only about ten gold and silver dragons. The gold dragons limit their numbers purposely and the silver dragons come from space. Their eggs are meteors that fall from the sky and another comes only a hundred years after one dies. They automatically bond with whatever creature sees them hatch,\" Shanaye explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait remembered that the black dragon was around her father's size, well, a little smaller than her father. \"Which species are around our size?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the forest dragons are the same size as us. They aren't as fast at flying, but they live in large clans like we do. They live in the forests. Like the gold dragon, they can use the energy of the sun. Forest dragons are very friendly to all creatures and they only kill if they have no other option. They see every intelligent creature as an equal with rights. They are a very strange dragons,\" Shanaye answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the other dragon species around our size?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is only one species that are smaller than us, but not by much. They are shadow dragons,\" Shanaye began to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they have black scales and look demonic?\" Rathnait asked, forgetting she should be less suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they do,\" Shanaye replied while eying her daughter carefully. <i>\"How does she know what they look like? Has she seen the one in the village? Had it been in the cloud dragon territory?\"</i> Shanaye wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they like? Are they evil?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they are not evil. In fact, shadow dragons can be just as kind and generous as forest dragons, despite how evil and scare they look. They are very shy and reserved, however, and they usually like to be alone. That doesn't mean they don't enjoy company, though. They get very lonely at times and are usually kind to those who enter their territory, offering them shelter, food, and so on. Their are a few that like their privacy more than others, but those are rare,\" Shanaye explained, \"You seem very interested in shadow dragons. Have you seen one before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mom, I was just wondering what other dragons are out there,\" Rathnait replied and to keep the act, Rathnait asked more about other dragon species and her mother told Rathnait everything she knew about the other species. Eventually, the other siblings woke up and when Dracus arrived, it was time for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'll have to tell Felix about what I saw. I have to tell him he somehow knows a shadow dragon. However, I tell him at night.\"</i> Rathnait decided.</span></div></div>",

Ashley looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you save something so big?\" Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I befriended Rathnait when we were both in trouble,\" Felix said, \"Because of that, her parents liked me really quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's the reason we have Felix living with us, because he is their friend and Dracus is our family's friend as well,\" Adam said.  Ashley nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that makes sense,\" Ashley said as they entered the town.  Adam walked to two large horses.  They were both brown and black and an attendant was standing near them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir Adam, Milady,\" the man said, then looking at Felix, \"Master Felix.\"  The man bowed his head to Felix.  Felix blushed and looked away, not expecting such treatment or used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, this is Abraham,\" Adam said, \"He is Ashley's caretaker when her mother and I are unavailable.  He will also be looking after you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be an honor and pleasure,\" Abraham said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um . .  you don't have to do this,\" Felix said, his face flushed with blush, \"It's not really needed.\"  Abraham blinked momentarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sire, why don't you take Lady Ashely back so Felix and I may talk some in private?\" Abraham suggested.  Adam nodded and put Ashley on a horse and left Abraham and Felix.  Abraham pulled off the leather glove on his right hand.  \"Felix, I understand your hesitation and issues,\" Abraham said in a quiet solem voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Felix asked.  Abraham knelt down and showed Felix his hand, scarred with a mark burned into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord William isn't the only evil lord who abused his slaves,\" Abraham said, \"I was just thankful Sir Adam was able to pay a price to free me and some other slaves.  We came here and started over.  It was hard at first, but there is such a wonderful feeling in being free Felix.  And you have been blessed by befriending the dragons and that has given you a chance few others have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Felix asked, still looking at the mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean to live well and be tutored to receive a good education,\" Abraham said, \"As well as to learn to fight and protect yourself.  Now come, let's show you your new home.\"  Felix was in slight shock as Abraham lifted the young boy onto the horse and mounted himself.  They rode up the streets to the castle's entrance.  On the great steps stood Adam and Ashley and an elderly man, standing tall and strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new home,\" the old man said, \"I am Lord Michael.\"  Out of sheer reflex, as Felix dismounted, he bowed deeply to the lord.  \"My dear child, you do not need to bow to me.\"  He laughed softly, \"You are a friend and guest in my home.\"  Felix rose but didn't look at Lord Michael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.  I'm still getting used to being free,\" Felix confessed.  Lord Michael walked down the steps to Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is one reason you are here, is it not?\" Lord Michael asked, standing in front of Felix, \"Now look up.\"  Slowly Felix looked up to the old lord.  \"I giev you my word on my friendship with Dracus, I will try will all the power I have to help you grow into a strong young lad and will look upon you as a second grandchild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Thank you,\" Felix said.  Lord Michael smiled and led Felix into his new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were a whirlwind tour of the castle from the throne room to the kitchen.  And all through it, Felix saw something strange to him.  The servants were genuinely happy to work there.  They were kind and courtious to Lord Michael and his son and showed no fear in their presence.  The lunch prepared was one of the best meals Felix had ever had.  It was truly unfathomable how good the food was.  The seats were well cushioned, something Felix was completely foreign to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, Felix was brought before Lord Michael's tailor who took measurements to make Felix more clothes.  He spent the rest of the time in his room, resting from the adventure he had had earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My room,\" Felix muttered again as he laid on the softess thing he had ever slept on, next to Rathnait.  He looked to the window and balcony, wondering how many times Rathnait would come to that window.  As the sun was setting Felix's thought returned to Rathnait.  \"I wonder if we're too far away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Rathnait . .. Can you hear me?</i>\" Felix asked, pushing his thoughts out to his friend.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix felt as though he saw the shadowy figure the dragon had turned into before, but he couldn't quite place it. The shadows had encased the human form so that Felix couldn't see him. <i>\"he probably only looks familiar because I just now saw him in this memory,\"</i> Felix began to assume, <i>\"But still, it seems like I've seen him before, other than this memory.\"</i> Felix continued to think it was because this dragon must have been an important person in his past. The dragon had known Felix's parents and that meant he had to seem familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All ask Adam if he knows anyone that might be able to unblock my memories,\" Felix muttered before he fell back asleep for the rest of the night. Felix didn't have any unexpected memory dreams the rest of that night<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix woke up early like he usually did and had no idea what to do. So, Felix wandered around the castle for the longest time. Eventually, he came around Abraham who didn't seem to be doing anything at the time. So, Felix approached him. Abraham turned and asked, \"What are you doing up so soon Master Felix?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix shivered a little upon hearing himself called Master. \"Please don't call me master, Abraham,\" Felix requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't mean master in the term you know of it Felix. It just means you're higher up, because you're a part of the royal family now,\" Abraham replied, \"Now, what are you doing up so early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbraham was in a hand where there were four large windowless holes with a railing as if it were a balcony. Abraham was leaning against the top of the rail with his arms and Felix walked over to do the same thing. Felix looked out to an amazing view of the mountains that surrounded the castle. It was simply breathtaking and spectacular. \"I guess I'm just used to waking up early after being with Lord William. It also didn't help that I've been with dragons the first days of freedom, because they wake up early as well,\" Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it must be hard to sleep in after all that,\" Abraham replied, \"Did you have a good night though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the second most comfortable bed I've slept in,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the most comfortable?\" Abraham questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait,\" Felix answered answered sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is... oh the dragon. Don't they have scales though?\" Abraham asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet, I felt comfortable there with the dragons. It was the first time i felt like I sort of belonged,\" Felix explained, \"Now I have two places were I belong, but when I was with the dragons, something was familiar.\" Felix didn't know why he was opening up to Abraham. Maybe it was because Abraham was a servant and Felix was a former slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know much about your past?\" Abraham questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know the first five years of my life,\" Felix explained, \"It was as if I never existed till I entered slavery, but now, I fear someone tampered with my memories, some one close to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you think that?\" Abraham asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait helped me obtain a memory,\" Felix informed him, \"From what I saw, I think I know who did it. He seemed to be my guardian after something happened to my parents. I was two years old at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you wish to do?\" Abraham questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I better talk to Adam and ask him if he knows someone who might help me unblock the memories,\" Felix informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe Adam knows the perfect person who might help,\" Abraham replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you had a dream about your past and you and Rathnait believe that your mind is being blocked?\" Adam questioned. Adam was in the throne room, pacing as Felix had told him everything he knew about what Rathnait and Felix discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and the shadow dragon seemed to be my guardian, but he blocked my mind. He seemed to be protecting me from something,\" Felix answered, \"I told Rathnait what I dreamed already and she had told her parents since they know more about dragons than any of us. Rathnait and Dracus might arrive after they are done eating breakfast. Abraham said you know someone who might be able to unblock my memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it something you want to know?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't I?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is someone in the village I consult with during certain decisions. I consulted with her when I had to decide whether to take you in or not. I knew I wanted to already, but I had to make sure it would be the right outcome,\" Adam informed Felix, \"She can tell the future among many other things. She looked into my future to look for information about you and what you might face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she say?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the things she said is that you have a dark past that will haunt you. She said that you would pursue it no matter what and that you will find out about it no matter what,\" Adam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why not find out about it now?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope you're ready for whatever news you might get,\" Adam explained, \"Do you think you're ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me to the women that might help me,\" Felix replied, \"Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Adam told his wife and daughter about the journey to the village he would take Felix. They wished Felix and Adam luck. During breakfast, Felix learned that Dracus and Shanaye allowed her daughter to come along because it was in her interest to know Felix's past as well since they were bonded now. Dracus would fly along with Rathnait. Adam sent a message to let Rathnait in and she would meet them by the gate. It was good that the merchants were out of the village by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Adam and Felix journeyed to the gate and was greeted by Rathnait who nuzzled Felix immediately and whispered, \"I missed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only been a day since we last seen each other,\" Felix informed her, \"but for the record, I missed you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we continue?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait and Felix nodded and they headed for Rhian and Kaage's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: They arrive and Rhian agrees to try and unblock Felix's mind. However, she is unable to do so, because dragon magic is too much for her to overcome. Kaage arrives and tells Felix the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Rhian is able to make some progress, but not much. She becomes more interested in predicting Felix's future.</span></div></div>",

Kaage stood up and hid himself as Adam and Felix entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Rhain,\" Adam said, \"Felix, this is Rhian.  She is the one I told you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very gifted at seeing the future,\" Rhian said, \"That is why you are here, correct?\"  Felix shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have some memories of my early life blocked by magic,\" Felix said, \"I want to see if you can help me see more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He knows about the barrier?! How can that be?</i>\" Kaage asked in thought.  His gaze shifted to the large eyelooking in the window. \"<i>Unless it was because of their bond.</i>  Kaage shook his head but returned to Felix's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how they are blocked?\" Rhian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's from a powerful black wall.  But Rathnait was able to push through it and see a brief memory.  I dreamed it later that night.  It involves what seems to be a shadow dragon who was very close to me making me forget my life,\" Felix said, \"So I need to know where I came from.  Why was that dragon protecting me from those men?  Was anything else blocked?  Why was I left alone on the side of the road?  These questions, I need to answer them Miss Rhian.\"  Rhian's eyes flashed dangerously for a brief moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, I will try and help you,\" Rhian said, \"Just don't ever use Miss or Misses in front of my name.\"  Felix nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way then,\" Rhian said, leading Felix to the table Adam sat at just a day before.  Rhian sat down on one end and Felix another.  Adam remained standing, unaware Kaage was very close to him.  Rhian took Felix's hand and placed her other hand on the deck of cards.  \"Now Felix, bewarned, I might not be able to help you remember everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.  That would be asking a lot,\" Felix said.  Rhian smiled at the boy's maturity and focused on calling for the spirits.  A few minutes passed and both her head and Felix's dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore them stood the black wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is impressive magic,\" Rhian said.  She had known it was there, by Kaage's tales, but seeing it made her realize how good Kaage was at sealing memories.  But then her eyes came to a small hair line in the black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never had dreams of your past before?\" Rhian asked Felix as she walked to the crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, last night was the first time,\" Felix said.  He saw Rhian staring at something.  Her fingers pressed hard on it and the world around them changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was the long stone corridor, now they were in a cave Felix recalled from last night.  But there was no panic, no alarm.  There was a woman, nursing a small baby.  She smiled at the suckling baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that . . . my mother?\" Felix asked in a low whisper.  He looked at the blond haired woman.  Her face was stunningly beautiful as she looked down that the baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so,\" Rhian said, when suddenly a shadow dragon appeared in the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your back,\" called the woman, \"But my love isn't.  Any reason why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was just coming at his own pace, Isabel,\" the dragon responded.  He gazed at the baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was impressed.  When you birthed him, you didn't scream once,\" the shadow dragon said, \"Not many humans are like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a compliment,\" Isabel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then all became black and the corridor returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either you fell asleep, ending the memory or we were forced out of the place,\" Rhian said, shaking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all.  It's just you are a very interesting person, Felix,\" Rhian said, \"I'd like very much to read your future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My future,\" Felix replied, looking at the black wall.  \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you are an interesting person and maybe by knowing what is to come, you can understand what has happened,\" Rhian replied.</span></div></div>",

What's done in the past has come and gone already,\" Rhian told Felix, \"The future however...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can't the future change depending on my decisions?\" Felix questioned, \"The events that you find out about me in the future might not occur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see Adam has told you the basics of fortune telling. Adam comes her often and knows from me that not every even is set in stone and things in the future can change,\" Rhian stated, \"However, there are some things that are set, things that have an inevitability of happening. It's just a matter of where and when that will happen. I wish to see your future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, why do you so interested in my future? Why do you keep encouraging me to show you it?\" Felix questioned suspiciously. He didn't know if he should let her see it since she was so interested, as if Rhian was planning on tricking him in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense that you and Rathnait will have an incredible destiny ahead. And from what I can tell, it sounds like it will be worthy enough to become a legend that many will want to talk about,\" Rhian announced, \"I have never seen so many possible choices for one  person and I only saw it through Adam's future and his lifespan. Now, do you wish to know more about your past or future?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I need to know my past before you tell me my possible future,\" Felix answered. Rhian was disappointed by Felix's answer. She knew Felix's past from Kaage's stories. However, Rhian agreed to help Felix learn about his past. \"Do you think you can unblock my memory completely?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was the dragon that blocked your memories, then I won't be able to do so,\" Rhian informed Felix, \"Dragon magic is far stronger than any human magic. So, if the dragon did block your past memories, then I can't break down the wall. All I'd be able to do is reach in and pull out a few memories at a time.\" Felix told her than he understood and let Rhian go to work. Rhian knew it was Kaage who blocked Felix's mind and she knew she couldn't break it down. However, she still when in Felix's mind to make it seem like she tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't destroy the wall,\" Rhian informed Felix after she went back into her own mind, \"I can only take one memory out at a time through the crack in the wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have five years of blocked memory though. That will take forever,\" Felix argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can reveal a few each day for you, and you'll probably dream a new one each night now,\" Rhian assured Felix, \"It won't take as long as you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will still take long,\" Felix muttered, \"I just want to remember. I want to remember my parents and I want to know why they left me with a dragon that blocked my memories. I want to know why he had to block my memories and send me to Lord William to be a slave. I can't stand not knowing anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stared down at the tabletop. Only one other person understood Felix's sadness, and that was Rathnait, because their feelings and emotions transferred to each other when the emotions were strong and Felix's sadness was extremely strong at that moment. Rathnait wanted to comfort Felix again like he always did for her in Lord William's terrible prison, but before Rathnait could say anything to comfort Felix, a human suddenly appeared out of thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix wasn't facing Kaage and didn't know of his sudden appearance. Rhian already knew where Kaage was and wasn't surprised. So, Adam was the only one to jump when a black cloaked figure with the hood up appeared right next to him. \"Kaage?!\" Adam gasped. Felix turned and saw Kaage in the room with them. \"How did you...?\" Adam began to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Kaage quickly answered before Adam could ask the question, \"I can turn invisible. I've been here since you arrived and I was here when you consoled with Rhian whether to take in Felix or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you spy on me Kaage?\" Adam demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing what happens to Felix is my business,\" Kaage replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Adam asked, hoping Kaage would give a straight answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm partly to blame for Felix's memory loss and his hardships,\" Kaage informed Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam was still slightly confused. However, Rathnait and Felix soon recognized Kaage's voice. It was the same voice as the shadow dragon from the memory. \"You're the dragon from my memory,\" Felix accused, \"You were the shadow dragon that was caring for me and the one who erased my memory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's a human,\" Adam pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a shadow dragon. Shadow dragons can take human form,\" Kaage explained. Kaage turned to Felix and continued, \"Yes, I'm the dragon from your memory and it is my fault you can't remember your first five years of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you block my memory?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Felix, but it was to protect you. You and I were being hunted down. I thought that if you didn't know who you were and you were away from me, I thought that you'd at least be safe,\" Kaage explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to protect him by erasing his memories?\" Rathnait hissed, not caring who was passing by the street behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were hunting me to get to Felix,\" Kaage explained, \"If Felix was away from me and didn't realize who he was, he'd be safe from them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he ended up with a monster, Lord William!\" Rathnait argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that the humans I left Felix with would take good care of him. I had no idea they'd just sell him to Lord William as a slave,\" Kaage replied, \"I had no idea they did this until it was too late.\" Kaage turned to Felix and apologized sincerely, \"I'm sorry, Felix. I had no idea you would end up being a slave to Lord William. When I heard that his slaves were freed and when I realized you made it out alive, I promised myself that I would make sure you lived a better life. I tried to convince Rhian to give a false reading to Adam so that he'd take you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She gave me a false reading?\" Adam questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhian didn't agree to lying. The fortune was true,\" Kaage assured Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you set on Adam on taking care of me instead of you?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still dangerous for you to be living with me. At least if you stay with Adam, they might not expect you to be a noble and Adam can take better care of you,\" Kaage explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're intend on protecting my be keeping me away, why are you telling me all this know?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Rhian saw your fortune, it was through Adam's future,\" Kaage explained, \"In his future, you inevitably learn about your past and figure out who I am. I could have let you learn all of your past through your dreams and through Rhian, but I realized I couldn't let you suffer that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, will you unblock my memories?\" Felix hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I think it would be better that I tell you a few things about your past first,\" Kaage suggested, \"So that you're better prepared when I unblock them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do I need to know?\" Felix sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, there is one thing I need to tell you something that might be the most shocking to you,\" Kaage said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about your father and myself,\" Kaage continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you and my father?\" Felix asked, hoping he'd just get on with it.</span></div></div>",

The children of those who had bonded are more susceptible to being bonded with a magical creature,\u201d Kaage explained, \u201cAnd the fact you bonded with a dragon as well is even further proves you are your father, Felix.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople can be bonded to other creatures?\u201d Felix questioned. He was wondering what other creatures he could have been bonded with if he didn\u2019t meet Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor a bond to form, one creature must have magic in their blood. So, you could have ended up bonding with any magical creature, as long as you both found trust in each other,\u201d Kaage informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, even magical animals that are sentient being could bond with humans?\u201d Felix wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like amaroks and basilisk? Yes, that is possible, but highly rare. The magical creature and the other bonder must gain complete trust with each other for it to work,\u201d Kaage explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix paused for a moment and wondered what it would be like to be bonded with a non-sentient being. He wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to the creature like he did with Rathnait, or would the bond make them understand each other. Felix could only guess what it would be like. \u201cHow did you and my father meet?\u201d Felix wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume it was similar to yours and Rathnait\u2019s meeting,\u201d Kaage stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you kidnapped by an evil lord and tortured?\u201d Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kaage answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd did you try to kill my father when you first met because you thought he was going to hurt you?\u201d Felix added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I never tried to harm your father,\u201d Kaage told Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen how was your meeting like Rathnait and my meeting?\u201d Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the story and you can see for yourself if it\u2019s slightly similar,\u201d Kaage replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Kaage brought in a chair for him and Adam and they all sat and listened to Kaage\u2019s story. Rathnait could only lie down outside and look through the window. \u201cYour father was about your age, Felix and I was eight years old, still a newborn in dragon years,\u201d Kaage began his story, \u201cI had an unusual birth. My birth was more like a mountain dragon\u2019s birth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Kaage\u2019s hood still covered his face, it was obvious in his voice that he was saddened. Felix didn\u2019t understand what Kaage meant by what Kaage said about his birth being like a mountain dragon\u2019s birth and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Kaage, but I don\u2019t understand what you mean when you say your birth is like a mountain dragon\u2019s birth. I still don\u2019t know too much about dragons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMountain dragon are alone their whole lives,\u201d Rathnait explained from outside, she learned about many types of dragons, \u201cThey only meet each other to mate and once their done, the mother lays the egg and cares for it till it hatches. Once the egg hatches, the mother leaves and lets the dragon fend for itself. Is that what you meant, Kaage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I was born with no parents around to care for me. It\u2019s true that shadow dragons like to live by themselves, but their parents at least care for their child till it grows up and moves out first,\u201d Kaage explained, \u201cAnd even if a shadow dragon likes to be alone, they don\u2019t mind company from time to time, it does get lonely being alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to my parents. I don\u2019t know if they intentionally abandoned me or they died somehow,\u201d Kaage continued with his face looking downwards, \u201cAll I know was that I was born alone and I had to fend for myself for the first eight years of my life. It\u2019s understandable that I became extremely lonely, because I was still an infant without anyone else. Because of this, I became different from other shadow dragons. I don\u2019t like the loneliness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that why you live in a human village instead of a cave all alone?\u201d Adam questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s one reason why,\u201d Kaage answered, \u201cAnyway, I actually went up to any sentient being I could find to hopefully find someone that cared. For eight years, I had no luck. That was until I met your father, Felix. I remember as if it was yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage was crying in the cave. He was lonely and sad. He had no one that cared about him, no love, nothing but himself. He had met a human caravan that day and he tried to go up to them for help. He had been going up to every creature he could find in the woods for help. However, every creature he had gone up to was afraid of him. It was understandable, because Kaage was nearly twenty feet tall and even though he was an infant, Kaage still had some of the demonic-like features all shadow dragons had. Sure, his horns weren\u2019t as long as an adult\u2019s, but he still had red eyes, black scales, and a scary looking head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the human caravan Kaage had run into that day only thought he was a monster. They drove him away no matter what Kaage said to try and calm them. Kaage had learned human long ago when he realized they were the only sentient beings around. He stayed and listened to people talk sometimes and learned the words that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage was now in the cave and crying from the unsuccessful day. He felt it was hopeless and that he would be alone forever. It was raining out and a boy about ten years old named Frewen had been playing outside in the forest when it started to rain. Frewen ran into the nearest cave and leaned against the rock wall. <i>\u201cMom\u2019s going to hate it when I come home soaking wet,\u201d</i> Frewen thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrewen was about to sit down when her heard someone crying in the back of the cave. Frewen looked in the direction, but it was too dark to see what was back there. Frewen waited and could here deeply depressed sobs. \u201cIs someone back there?\u201d Frewen called out, \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage lifted his head and saw a human boy in the distance. Kaage wanted to run up to the human and nuzzle him, but Kaage soon realized the human couldn\u2019t see him. The human didn\u2019t know Kaage was a dragon. <i>\u201cHe\u2019s going to run away from me when he sees me,\u201d</i> Kaage thought as he cried harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can hear you crying, whoever you are,\u201d Frewen informed the crying being when he heard no reply, \u201cI\u2019m not going to harm you, if you\u2019re afraid of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d Kaage replied, \u201cBut you\u2019ll be afraid of me. All you humans are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrewen was confused by the statement. <i>\u201cIs the being not human?\u201d</i> Frewen wondered. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you hurt?\u201d Frewen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very hurt, but no one can help me,\u201d Kaage called back, \u201cIf you come back here, I\u2019ll only be hurt more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Frewen questioned. He knew the creature wasn\u2019t human, but he wanted to still help it anyway. The creature sounded so depressed and Frewen just couldn\u2019t let it cry. Plus, the creature sounded like a child younger than himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m a monster,\u201d Kaage cried, \u201cEveryone hurts me or runs. I\u2019m all alone. I have no parents. You\u2019ll only run away from me too when you see me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I run away? Do you intend to hurt me?\u201d Frewen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019d never hurt a human. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m scary looking,\u201d Kaage sobbed, \u201cBut I can\u2019t do anything to change that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re not planning on hurting me, then why would I run?\u201d Frewen asked as he walked into the darkness. Eventually, he noticed something massive in the dark. The thing was moving and shivering at the sobs and deep breaths. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come into the light so that I can see you?\u201d Frewen suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust so that you can see me and run away?\u201d Kaage snapped back. Frewen noticed two eyes open and move upwards. The eyes were a blood red color with slited pupils. Though the eyes looked terrifyingly evil, they were filled with a deep sadness that Frewen couldn\u2019t look away from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to run away from you,\u201d Frewen tried to assure the creature, \u201cYou seem so sad and I want to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, fire appeared below the eyes and engulfed some wood on the floor. The creature was lit up by the light and Frewen could now see it was a twenty foot tall dragon with black scales and a terrifying head that looked demonic, despite the sad expression in the face. \u201cI can see fear in your eyes,\u201d Kaage informed Frewen, \u201cSo, why don\u2019t you just run away like everyone else and leave me in my sadness.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage turned his neck in the opposite way of the human and curled up and continued to cry. Frewen just stared at the dragon for the longest time. He had been taught that dragons were vicious and monstrous creatures. Yet, this one was different. This black dragon was only a child and it was very sad and lonely. That was understandable if it was truly alone without any parents. <i>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine never having parents and having to fend for myself. No wonder this dragon is so lonely and gets depressed when no one helps it. The dragon must feel awful.\u201d</i> Frewen realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrewen sighed. He just couldn\u2019t leave the dragon in such a sad state. He had to help it. Frewen walked around the twenty foot tall dragon that could easily have been sixty feet long with the tail and long neck. Frewen walked up to the head as was slightly larger than his entire body and he knelt beside the crying head. Frewen took a deep breath and touched the dragon\u2019s muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage quickly reacted and pulled his head up and stared down at the human. Kaage was extremely confused and tears still ran down his face. \u201cWh-What are you doing?\u201d Kaage questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to help you,\u201d Frewen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, aren\u2019t you afraid of me?\u201d Kaage asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do look pretty scary, but I\u2019m not going to run from you, because you\u2019re not a monster. You\u2019re just sad and lonely and it would be cruel of me to just leave you here,\u201d Frewen explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage lowered his head in front of the boy\u2019s body; his muzzle was only inches away. Kaage was in utter disbelief and he had to make sure he was hearing the human right. \u201cI\u2019m not a monster and you not going to run away like everyone else?\u201d Kaage questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to run away,\u201d Frewen stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage was joy controlled his actions and Kaage automatically lowered his head to the human\u2019s side and preceded to use the side of his muzzle to nuzzle the human\u2019s side. Kaage continued to cry as he said, \u201cThank you. Thank you for not running away. You don\u2019t know how happy I am right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrewen just took both hands and pet the large dragon\u2019s muzzle until Kaage calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what happened?\u201d Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe became good friends and he promised he\u2019d visit my every day. Your father, Frewen, was my first and truest friend. Those were the happiest days of my life,\u201d Kaage continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one got suspicious that Frewen was going into the woods alone when others thought you were a monster?\u201d Adam questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis mother did, and she followed him one day. She thought I was a monster at first, but when Frewen explained to her I was his friend and that I\u2019d never hurt a human unless I was forced to, She accepted me. She would even come sometimes and she treated me like another son when she found out I never had parents,\u201d Kaage informed the group, \u201cWhen I figured out how to turn into my human form, she was kind enough to take me in and everything. Of course I had to stay as a human while I lived there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI became used to humans then and because if that, I\u2019m more comfortable with humans than other dragons,\u201d Kaage continued, \u201cOne day, Frewen and I realized we could hear each others thought and he could perform some of my powers. Neither of us understood what was happening, but we learned it from a wandering wizard that was passing by. He told us we were forming a magical bond because of our brother-like relationship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo technically, you\u2019re my uncle,\u201d Felix spoke up, \u201cNot by blood, but you were adopted by my grandmother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, Felix, and I would gladly call your father my brother. He was very kind to me and treated me like a brother. I wish you could have met you grandmother though, she was the sweetest human I ever met,\u201d Kaage commented, \u201cBut she died over a hundred years before you were born.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Felix gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father gained a dragon lifespan when he was bonded with me. He and I lived closed to two hundred years before we met your mother,\u201d Kaage explained, \u201cYou will age slowly too once you reach eighteen years.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you meet my mother?\u201d Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father and I were staying at cave in a forest for a few weeks. Frewen was saddened from being nearly immortal and knowing anyone he fell in love with would die long before him. I was trying my best to comfort him when we heard a scream for help. Your father and I rushed out to save the woman in need. We eventually found her at the edge of the woods tied to a pole,\u201d Kaage told Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe funny thing was that many people had seen me and were afraid of me. They decided to give me a human sacrifice to please me. I would never accept such a thing though. The woman was completely hysterical when she saw me and I\u2019m sure she thought she would die,\u201d Kaage explained, \u201cBut eventually Frewen cut her down and she thought he was a knight come to save her from the vicious dragon. It took a long time to convince her I wasn\u2019t going to harm her, but it was worth it. Frewen quickly fell in love with her. Believe it or not, your mother and I became good friends too, once she realized how kind and gentle I was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was her name?\u201d Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer name was Isabel, and she was very beautiful and kind. She loved you and your father more than anything else in the world,\u201d Kaage told Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix then asked\u2026</span></div></div>",

Kaage nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father was a brave man with a just heart,\" Kaage said, \"He would often stand up for people who were treated poorly in our travels together.  Your mother had an equally strong spirit.  Once she opened up to me, we found we had much in common.  Your mother was the child of a prostitute who was left to fend for herself for a long time.  She finally found work in the town near the village, working as a baker.  But when the call for a sacrifice was made, she was chosen quickly, from both her heritage and she was new to the town.  Because of her pain, we understood each other deeply because of our shared pains and how Frewen was our savior.\"  Kaage smiled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you love her?\" Adam asked, noticing the peculiar expression on Kaage's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I loved her as a close friend and because of the bond with Frewen.  When they were together, and the barrier was down, I felt everything Frewen felt for her,\" Kaage asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened then?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We traveled together for a couple of years,\" Kaage said, \"The three of us.  And soon, three turned into four.\"  Kaage chuckled.  \"The look on Frewen's face when Isabel told him she was with child was amazing.  He had never looked like that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did . . . Did my mother ever come to terms with the fact my father would outlive her by decades?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had a hard time accepting the man she loved would not grow old with her and she would one day look old enough to be his mother, while he was young.  But Frewen promised her that she was his only love and would take no other,\" Kaage said, \"We were even looking for a remedy to the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were searching for a being for her to bond with,\" Kaage said, \"But looking for something like that stirred up some trouble for us.\"  Kaage's voice turned dark for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean those people who you were protecting me from?\" Felix asked.  Kaage nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were slayers who sought to kill anything inhuman.  They targeted us for Frewen's bond with me and your mother was friendly with us.  They attacked without warning . . .\" Kaage said quietly as tears came to his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did my parents die?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother was kidnapped to lure us into a fight.  Your father rushed to save her, but fell into a trap.  I felt your father die and I almost suicided to be with him.  I couldn't stand to be alone once more.

It's surely a trap.

Let me go get Isabel. There's no need risking both of Felix's parents,\" Kaage continued to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you're argument, but I feel as though I have to be the one to save her.

You're his uncle and my brother,\" Frewen informed Kaage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a blood relative,\" Kaage sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we are brothers in soul. I see you as my brother, even though you're a dragon and I'm a human,\" Frewen informed Kaage as he touched the side of Kaage's muzzle. Frewen stared into the red eyes of the dragon's lowered head and said, \"I trust you with my child and I know you'd make the right decisions if something were to happen to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I'd be able to go on if I loose you,\" Kaage replied, \"I don't want to go back to being alone again, not after all these years of happiness with you and Isabel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it will seem like those first years you were alone to fend for yourself, but I'd always be with you.

He eventually came upon an alter in the center of the cannon and Frewen dropped his sword. Isabel was lying on the alter and Frewen rushed to her. Isabel's skin was pale and blood drenched the side of her dress. Frewen felt around her mouth and nose, but he didn't feel her breath. Isabel was dead and there wasn't anything Frewen could do. it was too late to borrow Kaage's shadow magic to heal her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrewen placed his hands around her and sat her up in a siting position. With one hand on her head and the other on her back. He brought her against his body and cried on her shoulder. The love of his life was gone and he was helpless to save her. <i>\"Frewen, I'm sorry,\"</i> Kaage apologized. Kaage was using their bond to see through Frewen's eyes and talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"None of this is your fault,\"</i> Frewen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But if you would have never met me and we wouldn't have bonded...\"</i> Kaage started to explain sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's not your fault. You needed me, Kaage. I don't regret helping you about two hundred years ago. This isn't your fault. If I wouldn't have met you, I would have never lived long enough to met Isabel,\"</i> Frewen informed Kaage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But those men are after you and Isabel because of me,\"</i> Kaage argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It takes two to bond,\"</i> Frewen stated, <i>\"And it's neither of our faults. It's the monsters that fear us! The monsters who want to kill us just because we're different.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've come, but where's your beast of a friend?\" a deep voice questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrewen turned his head and saw a large, bald man in his thirties. The man was muscular and looked even larger with the thick armor on him. Frewen new this was the leader of the hunters and he slowly lowered Isabel on the alter again and looked away from the man. \"It's too bad the woman was too stubborn to see you and that demon are monsters,\" the leader commented, \"We never like having to kill other humans, but we do when it's necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was no reason to attack us,\" Frewen stated, still looking away from the man, \"We've done nothing to you. We're not evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are being possessed by that demon dragon,\" the man growled, \"We need to free you before you and the demon infected others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaage is not a demon. He has no demonic blood within him,\" Frewen growled back, finally looking back at the man, \"If you stopped to get to know him, you'd realize that he's a kind and gentle dragon. He was raised by humans and sees himself as a human more than a dragon. Besides, we're bonded, I'm not possessed by him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just what that demon wants you to think,\" the man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you are blinded by ignorance,\" Frewen stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one whose blinded!\" the man yelled, \"Unfortunately, you're too far gone to save. We'll have to kill you and then the dragon. Don't worry. I'll raise your son and make sure he doesn't suffer the same fate as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not touch my son!\" Frewen yelled as he charged, picking up his sword. Frewen swung and two swords clung against each other. \"I will not let you turn him into a monster like you!\" Frewen growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrewen lifted a hand off the sword and borrowed Kaage's shadow magic. Frewen was going to phase into the man's chest and rip out his heart. But when Frewen's shadow hand touched the man's armor, he was forced backwards and fell a few feet away from the man without a sword. The man smiled and hit his chest. \"There is one metal shadow dragons can't phase through. It's the metal that makes this special armor,\" the man stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrewen looked around the cannon and saw many archers on the surrounding walls. \"The same metal is on the tips of their arrows,\" the man smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Kaage, take care of Felix. Keep him safe,\"</i> Frewen requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Frewen!\"</i> Kaage roared, but when Kaage felt as though many arrows had penetrated his body and couldn't see through Frewen's eyes any longer, Kaage knew that his best friend and brother was dead. Kaage's mind was all by itself once again without the hint that Frewen had ever shared a part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt everything your father felt that day, and I felt his thoughts leave my mind. I could feel his very being leave my mind as if it was never there. I was alone again,\" Kaage informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait was shocked at what she had heard. She never knew the bond could be so terrible if one were to die. She hadn't imagined what it would be like if Felix were to die, but now she knew what it would be like and she feared it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have felt terrible,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrible doesn't even come close to describing it. There is no word strong enough for it,\" Kaage stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those monsters,\" Adam growled, \"How could people be so ignorant and blind?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, there are many that don't understand what a magical bond is. They thing the magical creature is possessing the human, especially when a non-sentient creature bonds with a human. They don't understand it's a beautiful and wondrous gift,\" Kaage informed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Kaage,\" Felix said. Kaage slightly flinched at Felix calling him Uncle once more. \"I think I'm ready for my memories now,\" Felix informed his Uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think you are ready, I'll unblock the wall, but it might overwhelm you and might make you pass out. It's five years of memories after all,\" Kaage warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I'm ready,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage placed his hand on Felix's head and his hand became a shadow.

As it came to him, he closed his eyes and thought to the wall he saw with Rhian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kaage's magic took effect, Felix watched the wall break apart and memories began to leak through.  He saw Kaage protecting him in that final battle . . . the look on sadness when his father was murdered . . . his mother's breasts.  Each one preserved by Kaage's magic.  But soon, with the wall completely gone, the memories became too much.  There was so much locked away and now it surrounded Felix.  He felt like he was drowning in his past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Rhian's shop, Those watching saw Felix's face look terrified, then distraught, then happy, and now it looked like all three.  A joyous smile was on his mouth as his eyes were filled with fear and sadness as tears rushed from his eyes.  He grabbed onto Kaage and cried into his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with Felix?\" Rathnait asked through the window.  Kaage looked back out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems he's remembering good and bad things at the same time,\" Kaage said when he noticed Felix had stopped pressuring himself into his torso.  He looked down and saw Felix collapse to the floor.  Adam moved to his side and turned Felix over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FELIX!\" Rathnait called, pressing an eye against the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait, calm down,\" Adam said, \"He just passed out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems he couldn't handle everything at once,\" Rhian noted, before looking at Kaage.  \"You couldn't have made it more of a river instead of a flood?\"  Kaage shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping it would be like that, but there seemed to be a crack in the wall already and it broke unexpectedly,\" Kaage said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  So by forcing the wall to gain the few memories he did, it made the wall break like this,\" Rhian said, hearing Rathnait gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get him to the castle and let him rest,\" Adam said, interjecting.  He picked Felix up in his arms.  He looked at Kaage.  \"I will want to talk with you some more later, Kaage,\" Adam said in a tone that was more an order than request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assumed as much,\"  Kaage said grimly.  Adam walked past the shadow dragon in disguise and outside.  Rathnait quickly lowered her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Adam, I can carry you to the castle,\" Rathnait said, her eyes worried for Felix because in the state of confusion in his mind, Rathnait wasn't able to speak to him.  Adam nodded and stepped onto Rathnait's neck and she took off for his castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Rhian's place, Kaage looked at Rhian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't blame Felix for hating,\" Kaage said, looking down.  Rhian smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your own lack of forethought and patience made you pick that one family that led Felix to five years of hell,\" Rhian said, \"What's there to be angry about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait landed on Felix's balcony, as Adam slipped off and carried Felix to his bed.  Rathnait muttered a curse about the doorway being too small for her to enter as she watched the sleeping Felix.</span></div></div>",

When he didn't fell dizzy anymore, Felix opened them again. He was in his room again. He didn't know how much time had past and how long he was unconscious, but it was still light outside and the sunlight still shined in his room. Felix slowly sat up in his bed and quickly groaned and wished he had waited a little longer. He became dizzy again and had to close his eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy, Master Felix,\" Felix heard a command. Felix opened his eyes and saw Abraham sitting in a chair. \"You've been unconscious for quite a while and you're sure to be dizzy,\" Abraham explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My head is screaming,\" Felix groaned, \"How long have I been out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few hours, you missed lunch,\" Abraham answered, \"I you feeling alright other than your headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine except for the headache,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaage, Rhain, and Adam all recommend that you stay in your room for the rest of the day and try to get as much rest as possible,\" Abraham informed Felix, \"Are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very hungry,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some food will help with that headache. I'll be back shortly,\" Abraham said as he got up. Abraham glanced at the balcony doorway and then back at Felix. \"I believe someone wants to talk to you badly,\" Abraham stated before he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked at the doorway and saw a large eye looking through, an eye that could be only Rathnait's. Felix smiled upon seeing Rathnait and she asked, \"Are you alright, Felix?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix got out of bed and had to wait a while before stepping towards Rathnait. \"I'm fine other than the headache,\" Felix replied. Rathnait backed her head away to let Felix through the doorway, but once he was through, Rathnait immediately began to affectionately nuzzle him. Felix laughed and pet her muzzle in response. \"Miss me?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so worried, Felix,\" Rathnait informed him as she continued to nuzzle, \"I couldn't hear any of your thoughts and I couldn't reach you. I thought something was going to happen to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just unconscious was all,\" Felix informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't like it. Don't do it again,\" Rathnait replied with snort causing some smoke to emerge out of her nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait backed her head away and Felix got a better look at her. She was lying on her underbelly and her body took up most of the balcony. \"Good thing I have a large balcony out here,\" Felix replied, \"Otherwise, you wouldn't have been able to watch over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Adam gave you this room for that reason,\" Rathnait commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you out here the entire time I was unconscious?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have been if my father didn't force me to come back and eat lunch with the family. Other than that, I was here whole time. I found it hard to leave you alone,\" Rathnait told Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I think I understand how Kaage feels,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're finding it hard to be apart from each other and we've only been bonded for a few days. Kaage and my father were bonded for over a hundred years. Now I understood why he cried some nights after my parents died,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you remember everything now?\" Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. I remember everything as if it had all just happened. It seems strange to me how a few hours ago I couldn't remember a thing and now I remember everything,\" Felix stated, \"My parents were just like Kaage described.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Kaage?\" Rathnait asked, \"Can he be trusted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he's my uncle. He might not be a blood relative, but an uncle none the less,\" Felix replied, \"He and my father were bonded a long time and they share many of the same traits because of it. Almost as if they are the same people. Kaage shares the same feelings and loves me as much as my parents did. He would never intentionally harm me. We can trust him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix suddenly heard a knock on the door and Felix hollered, \"You may come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

She gasped in awe at seeing Rathnait so close, for even on the hilltop, she wasn't this close to the adult dragons.

She felt strongly about people ordering around her close friend and the growl scared Ashely, turning Ashely pale. \"No one should be ordering around a friend of a dragon,\" Rathnait growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshely had never been growled at by a dragon and Felix could see the fear in her eyes. Though Felix barely knew Ashely he somehow felt a strong sibling bond to her. She was a part of his new family and important. Felix quickly stepped in front of Rathnait and tried defused the situation before it could get any worse. \"Now Rathnait, it's aright,\" Felix tried assuring Rathnait, \"We must respect the sibling laws like all your siblings do. Besides, Ashely's only concerned about my well being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're a friend to a dragon.

I recall we had this sort of conversation about your parents,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait paused and remember the conversation when Felix was asking about what a family was like and what to expect. Rathnait sighed, \"But you only have a headache, and I was hoping you could stay with me longer.\" Rathnait lowered her head to Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stroked and hugged Rathnait's muzzle and said, \"You never know what a headache would lead to. All my memories were returned to me and anything could happen in there. I'll need to be careful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshely was very surprised by Felix's action. It took a lot of trust just to gain friendship with a dragon, but for the dragon to nuzzle a human and let the human stroke the dragon, it was something Ashely never thought possible. \"You two really are close, aren't you?\" Ashely replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did... Dad... ever tell you what happened to Rathnait and me?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much,\" Ashely admitted, \"He must have let a lot of details out. He still thinks I'm his little sweetie that needed to be blind to the evils of the world. He feels that certain news is too much for me to handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the feeling,\" Rathnait sighed, \"My parents treat me like a newborn hatchling quiet often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Abraham entered the room with a tray of food for Felix. That tray alone seemed just as spectacular as a normal meal at the huge table. \"Felix,\" Abraham said in surprise, \"I thought that you'd be in bed because of your headache.\" Ashely gave a look to Rathnait and Felix as if to tell them she was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to catch up with Rathnait. I should be fine. The fresh air might be helping,\" Felix assured Abraham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should at least sit in a chair, here,\" Abraham said as he set the tray down and brought a chair over to Felix to sit on. Abraham then handed Felix the tray and Ashely a chair to sit on as well. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashely, if something happens to Felix, you know how to call for help,\" Abraham said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Abraham left, Ashely asked...</span></div></div>",

Felix was hoping Ashely wouldn't offend Rathnait. he didn't want Rathnait to get mad at her and he wanted his new sister safe and friends with his best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it's kind of a favor I wish to ask of you,\" Ashely replied, \"But I'm afraid to ask it.

I just want peace between you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still haven't answered why you're on her side,\" Rathnait growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite frankly, you're much larger than her and can easily hurt her more than she could harm you,\" Felix explained, \"Besides, you might be over reacting right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over reacting?\" Rathnait hissed, \"She wants to pet me like some sort of animal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet, Ashely doesn't see you as an animal. She just wanted to show you a sign of friendship. Surely, you noticed how nervous she was in asking you. She didn't want to offend you in any way, Rathnait. Besides, didn't I have to pet your muzzle as a sign of trust?\" Felix argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait calmed down and thought about Felix's claim. it was true that he had to pet Rathnait to gain trust and it was true that Ashely was trying her best not to offend Rathnait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Rathnait,\" Ashely broke the silence, \"I guess it was my little girl fantasies taking over me. I know you're not an animal, but I just felt the urge to pet you. I've never been this close to one of your kind before and I was hoping to make a friend like Felix did with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" Rathnait sighed, \"I understand that you don't see me as an animal and I over reacted a little. Felix pets me sometimes. It's a little unfair if I don't let others do the same. You seem like a possible friend and you and I can try to be friends and see where it leads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, may I...?\" Ashely began to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may pet my muzzle if it helps you trust me,\" Rathnait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshely slowly approached Rathnait's muzzle and was very hesitant. Eventually, Rathnait moved her muzzle towards Ashely's outstretched hand to show her it was alright. Ashely was surprised by the texture of Rathnait's skin and it felt more like leather than actual scales. Ashely was amazed that she was actually petting a real living and breathing dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait was also surprised by Ashely's touch. Ashely was even more gentler than Felix. Rathnait noted the slight tremble in Ashely's hand and realized Ashely was still nervous about touching Rathnait. <i>\"She really is concerned about me being offended or not,\"</i> Rathnait realized, <i>\"Which means she doesn't see be as some dumb beast that could be her pet, but as a possible friend.\"</i> With that thought, Rathnait calmed down a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Ashely stopped petting and...</span></div></div>",

It was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley,\" Rathnait said, \"Would you . . stroke my muzzle again?\"  Both Felix and Ashley's eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ashely asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you didn't like being petted,\" Felix noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well . . . It was nice,\" Rathnait said, \"I liked it.  I don't know why.  Maybe because you were not thinking of me as some common beast, but what ever the reason, part of me liked it.\"  Ashley nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want me to stroke you again?\" Ashley asked slowly.  Rathnait nodded slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Rathnait said.  Ashley gulped and like handling an old precious urn, she rubbed her hand on Rathnait's muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix, meanwhile, thought about this strange behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Why is she allowing this?  I thought dragons didn't like this sort of thing unless it was from their mate or possibly one their bonded with?</i>\" Felix thought, as he saw genuine contentment in Rathnait's eyes.  \"<i>She never would have allowed this back at Lord William's . . . .</i>\" when Felix's train of thought came to an odd conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It couldn't be,\" Felix whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't be what?\" Rathnait asked, having heard the whisper loud and clear.  Felix looked and saw Ashley was done stroking Rathnait and was also looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking of a reason for why you liked being stroked,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is the 'be' that couldn't be?\" Rathnait asked.  Felix looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you'd like the reason,\" Felix said, gulping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix,\" Rathnait said, \"Please, I won't get angry with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, it's just . . . you might,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, what is the reason?\" Ashley said in a stern tone.  Felix sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because you might have been partially broken by Lord William,\" Felix said, watching shock and anger coat Rathnait's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did not just say that,\" Rathnait growled, causing Ashley to back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please listen,\" Felix said, \"You and I, we found comfort in each other, especially when you let me rub the bruised parts after being tortured.\"  Rathnait nodded.  \"And in those moments, you took pleasure from my kindness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Rathnait said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what if part of you will take comfort from a genuine caring human touch now because it brought you comfort then?\" Felix suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still means I was broken,\" Rathnait said, growling, \"It means he won, in some small part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it means he lost because he wanted you to lose hope.  This only means when a kind human touches you, you will trust them,\" Felix said, rising and walking to her and touching her muzzle.  \"You trust me, correct?\"  Rathnait looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one. . .  No one can know about this,\" Rathnait said darkly, looking from Felix to Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't tell a soul,\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know you can trust me,\" Felix said.  Rathnait nodded, but was still disturbed by this revelation.</span></div></div>",

They all got to know each other better and they all began to trust each other as they continued their conversations. None of them spoke about Lord William again in the conversation, knowing Rathnait was uncomfortable about the revelation. Felix could feel Rathnait's uneasiness about such a conversation as if it were his own feeling in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the time Felix finished his food, the door to his room opened up again. Ashely and Felix turned their heads to see that it was Abraham entering the room with both Adam and Kaage. \"Good evening, Felix,\" Adam greeted while Kaage simply nodded. \"Is your headache gone now?\" Adam questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think the food helped the headache move along,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam seemed relieved and Abraham approached Felix and took the tray away. As Abraham turned to the door, he ordered, \"Come with me, Ashely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I stay with Felix and Rathnait?\" Ashely asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaage and I wish to speak to Felix and Rathnait alone,\" Adam explained, \"Now go with Abraham, Ashely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshely sighed and followed Abraham out of the room. When Abraham and Ashely were long down the hallway, Adam and Kaage approached Felix and Rathnait. Adam sat in the chair Ashely had sat in and Kaage preferred to just stand near the doorway. \"So, how are your memories coming along?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember everything,\" Felix replied, \"It feels strange to me. I knew nothing about my past a few hours ago, but now I know more than I would normally would. I don't think most people remember when they were really young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You memories were preserved behind the wall,\" Kaage explained, \"Normal people forget the memories of their younger years because they get blurry as they get older. You're memories were preserved and you just gained them back. It feels as though they had just happened to you, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly how it feels,\" Felix replied, \"I even remember my birth quite clearly because of the preservation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember my birth quite clearly, but those are for different reasons,\" Kaage muttered out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember my parents just as clearly. I remember what they looked like, how they acted, who they were,\" Felix said, \"And because I'm older now, I see more of their character and who they were. They were just as you described. They were good people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were,\" Kaage agreed as he looked to the ground and sighed, \"They didn't deserve to be killed like they were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you even more,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage looked up and asked, \"What do you know about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one, You seem to blame yourself for my parent's deaths as well as feel guilty for my memory loss,\" Felix started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if your father would have never met me, he would have never died that day and you...\" Kaage started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wouldn't have bonded with him, my father wouldn't have grown old enough to have met my mother and I would have never been born,\" Felix informed Kaage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I wouldn't have bonded with him, he wouldn't have been hunted by those monsters,\" Kaage growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will always be evil men like those monsters. Unfortunately, we can't change that,\" Felix replied, \"It's those monsters that killed them, not you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else did you learn?\" Kaage questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very much like my father. You and him were bonded for so long, you two became like twins. You share many of the same feelings and characteristics of my father,\" Felix continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When two are bonded for a long time, it is true they become one in the same. But the fact that your father and I were bonded at such a young age helps that effect even more. He gained some pf my personality and I gained some of his. We shared the same feeling. Because he was in love with your mother and you, I gained his feelings as well,\" Kaage explained, \"That's why I'd do anything for you. You father cared about you more than anything else and that strong feeling went into me as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So because of your bond with my father, you see me as if I were your son two?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little more complicated than that, but that is a simple way to put it,\" Kaage agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you reasons for what you did to me. I understand it was only to protect me and I will not hold that against you,\" Felix told Kaage, \"You are my Uncle after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage sighed, \"I am your Uncle. My be not by blood, but we are nephew and uncle through spirit. I wish I could take care of you like your father asked me to do, but it's still too dangerous to be with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you been living in this town for five years? Surly those slayers have forgotten...\" Felix started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage interrupted, \"I don't think I can risk that. Besides, if they ever do find me, they won't find you if you stay with Adam. Looking in the castle of a lord and searching through the royal family is the last place they'd ever look. You're safer with Adam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But surely we can't stay apart the whole time,\" Felix argued, \"I do miss you, Uncle Kaage.\"</span></div></div>",

They just haven't gotten an opportunity to take action,\" Kaage said, \"Or in their warped minds they feel you have tamed the dragons.\"  Rathnait growled at that remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Felix may still be in danger even without seeing you,\" Adam concluded, \"Which means it could actually hurt him if you weren't here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Kaage asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what these men look like, if you aren't around Felix, we might miss some warning signs before it was too late,\" Adam said.

They might wish to exterminate the family because of this and having Felix bonded with a dragon is much more severe. Then again, there is also the possibility that they wouldn't mind such things because cloud dragons aren't as evil and they might think you tamed the dragons. The major reason they hunted me was because I was bonded with a human and I like demonic. It's unfortunate that people should judge something as evil just because of their looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet,\" Kaage continued, \"They might be the type of people who think that because one species of dragon is 'evil' then all the other species of dragons must be as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can someone think that?\" Rathnait questioned, \"Just because Lord William is evil, it doesn't mean all humans are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, that's how some people see the word,\" Kaage sighed, \"Just because they think one member of a species or one race of a species is evil, they might think all individuals of that race of species are evil. And those type of people are too stubborn to be told otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if their search leads them here, I'd still more than likely be in danger, even if they don't figure out my relation with you,\" Felix pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is still another option. I might be able to keep them from coming here in their search,\" Kaage replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the option?\" Felix asked, not liking the sound of it already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were to leave the town and go somewhere else and do something to get their attention. They'd be on the right trail again and might not even notice the town. I can lead them away,\" Kaage explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we'd be further apart again,\" Felix argued, \"I just learned that I still have family and now you plan on leaving me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, I...\" Kaage started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't leave me. Because of my memories are back, I'd miss you more than ever,\" Felix explained. Felix rushed up to Kaage and embraced him, pleading, \"Don't go. Please, don't go. I'd miss you too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage tensed up at first when Felix started the hug, but Kaage relaxed and hugged Felix back who only came up to Kaage's chest. Kaage bowed his head, inwardly wishing he was his dragon form so he could nuzzle his nephew who felt like a son to him. \"I was only suggesting it, Felix. If we deem that it's best for me to stay, then I will. I must do whatever is best to keep you safe. Plus, I'd miss you to and I wouldn't want to leave just as much as you don't want me to leave,\" Kaage replied.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What happens if they still come despite you leading them away? The merchants that come in go probably always talk about how we befriended dragons. They might come just for that,\" Adam stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those monsters might be evil enough to kill all of you, and Felix would still be in danger without me gone,\" Kaage said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wouldn't it be better for you to stay here?\" Adam asked, \"If they were able to find this place and attack the castle, it's unknown how long it would take the cloud dragons to rally up and come to our aid. Plus, they can't really land in the town of stop them if they're in the castle. You're the only dragon living here and you are Felix's best defense because not only can you try to stop them as a dragon, but you can turn human if they make it inside the castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all true,\" Kaage agreed, \"Plus, with me here, I'll be able to pick them out in a crowd. I know how to spot them, how they act, what they wear even when their in disguise, and what their leader looks like. I know their techniques. I can warn you faster then anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, you'll stay, right?\" Felix asked pulling out of the hug,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm staying here,\" Kaage answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about us meeting each other on a regular basis?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage was a little more hesitant to answer, but he finally answered, \"I suppose we can work something out. I still want you to live with Adam, because he can care for you better and he's human while I'm a dragon. But, I'm sure I'll be able to see you certain days of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was happy with Kaage's answer and hugged him once more. He had his Uncle back.</span></div></div>",

From a small twenty five feet, she had nearly doubled it, now standing forty feet tall, she was just large enough to still walk in the streets of the city.

But as she looked on her brother, who was not her brother, at times, her heart beat a little faster, but she passed it off as nothing.  And despite their rocky start, she and Rathnait had become friends and were closer than Dracus and Adam, though this was more of Felix's influence on the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage kept his promises and visited Felix at least once a week.  He usually tried to be quick but Felix would always find something to keep him their longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Lord Michael, after so many years of ruling suffered a minor heart attack, he was saved thanks to Felix's healing magic but the pain made him realize he was no longer completely fit to rule over his subjects and passed the lordship over to Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now Felix was being educated in matters of politics and running the city, if for nothing else, to give him a fully rounded education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the looks of it, these traders are trying to give themselves a bigger profit by increasing heir prices, considering the time of year, it seems excessive,\" a young man of fifteen years said, touching his hairless face.

Even if you convince a dragon to show up to the trial chaos may ensue. They might try to kill the dragon before it can explain that it's sentient. Besides, That won't get the dragons of the hook. They'd still have to explain why they attacked William,\" Abraham pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might need Rathnait to explain to the King what William did to her. I know dragons don't have the same rights as humans, but if we can prove to the King they're sentient beings, it could change,\" Adam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Dracus will want Rathnait to go to court,\" Abraham replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's way I will need to talk to him,\" Adam said, \"I might have to talk to him at his cave since Dracus and his mate will want to listen and the landing platform can only hold one adult dragon. Of course, I'd need his permission to be there which means Felix is going to have to talk to Rathnait to ask. Kaage will need to be their since this involves Felix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what will you do?\" Abraham asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Felix and Ashley get back, I will talk to Felix and send word to Kaage to come. When their both here, I'll tell them the situation and tell Felix to talk to Rathnait and ask for Dracus's permission for an audience in his cave. I know Kaage won't go till an invitation is confirmed. He is a dragon after all,\" Adam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if Dracus doesn't let you come to his cave, or he won't carry you and Felix there? I know he wouldn't carry Kaage, so Kaage would have to fly, but...\" Abraham started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll deal with it when we come to that, but for now, I must tell Kaage and Felix of the situation. We have two weeks till the trail,\" Adam interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Felix and Ashley...</span></div></div>",

They're worried about rumors of Lord William returning to power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that can't happen.  You said that the dragons destroyed his old home,\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they couldn't capture him.

Adam bit his lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you heard?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason the merchants are raising prices is because of many rumors that that bastard lord is returning to power!\" Felix raged, \"Tell me it isn't true!  Tell me this is some whisper of stupidity that has no grounds!\" Adam took a moment to think of how to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rumor does have fact to it,\" Adam said, \"The man is spreading malicious lies about his fall from power, claiming I ordered the dragons to attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But father that's absurd!\" Ashley said, having entered and heard everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but some people believe him and it has even reached the king's ears,\" Adam said darkly, \"He is giving William an audiance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't allow it!  I was a boy before, but not anymore.  I will kill him before he can take another slave!\" Felix growled.  He turned to leave, only to find Abraham in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam inwardly thanked Abraham for his forethought in blocking Felix's escape should he become to angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Killing him would only prove him right about this land,\" Abraham said, \"What is needed is evidence we did nothing to him, that it was his own arrogance and pride when he captured a dragon, nothing bad would befall him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Felix, you can get your chance to 'kill' him by telling the king of your past with the man,\" Adam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that be enough?\" Felix asked,  looking at Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it.

Felix could feel Rathnait's worry enter his mind. The worry was very strong, but Rathnait always worried about Felix. This was most likely because Felix was smaller than her despite him being much older than her relative to their species. Well, Rathnait was the stronger one of the bond and which made her the protector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Something has come up, Rathnait,\"</i> Felix told her, <i>\"My father wishes to speak with you and your parents. So, I am to ask you to ask your parents if we have their permission to go to your cave. The matter is of grave importance.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Felix, what's wrong? I can feel how upset you are and it makes me worried. Please tell me what is of grave importance,\"</i> Rathnait pleaded. Felix hadn't seen Rathnait worried like this in a while. It was obvious that she could feel his emotions. The bond was strong enough that they could feel each others emotions as well as their thoughts. it was understandable why she would be worried about him if she could feel his anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I don't know if I can speak of it without getting angrier,\"</i> Felix informed Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait's voice sounded scared now. It must have been terrible for her to hear her bond mate so upset and be too far away to calm him down like she usually did. <i>\"Felix, I never heard you so angry before. Please, tell me what's wrong. I just want to help you,\"</i> Rathnait encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And I'm sure your parents will demand to know that the problem is before they accept Adam and I to come over to their cave,\"</i> Felix sighed. Felix took a few deep breaths to calm down and then continued, <i>\"You know how Lord William wasn't killed? Well, he's causing troubles again.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's that monster doing this time?\"</i> Rathnait growled angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He's spreading lies about this city and the cloud dragons. He's making it seem like his the victim and he was wrongly taken from his seat of power,\"</i> Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What kind of lies is he spreading?\"</i> Rathnait questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"They're too terrible for me to speak of,\"</i> Felix replied, <i>\"But people are starting to believe him and he will have console with the king in about a week.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How can he be stopped?\"</i> Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's why my father wishes to talk to you and your parents,\"</i> Felix told Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I will tell them after lunch what you told me and I'll relay their answer,\"</i> Rathnait informed her bond mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thank you, Rathnait,\"</i> Felix replied before ending the link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix left his room and back to the throne room. Felix opened the doors and saw that Adam and Abraham were still there. However, Ashley was gone. <i>\"Father probably didn't want her to know about our business in any great detail. He still tries to protect her from the evils of the world,\"</i> Felix thought. Felix agreed with Ashley in her conflicts with her father. Ashley didn't need to be babied and protected behind a shroud of goodness. She was older than Felix and had grown very mature over the years. Adam trusted her enough to train her how to rule the city, yet he still protected her from the series evils such as Lord William. Though it was only hurting Ashley for not knowing such things. This was why he and Rathnait had told Ashley all about Lord William and the evils he committed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix also noticed that Kaage was there now and Adam was just finishing telling Kaage everything. Kaage definitely needed to be in the plan since it involved Felix. Kaage was after all the closest thing to a relative that Felix had since Kaage was Kaage was the adopted brother of Felix's father and Adam and his family never even knew Felix's parents. The doors shut behind Felix causing everyone in the room to turn their attention to him. \"What did Dracus and Shanaye say?\" Adam asked his adopted son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait told me they're all eating lunch right now,\" Felix informed him, \"Rathnait will ask them permission when they're done eating and then relay the answer to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When she replies back, tell her to ask Dracus if I am aloud to join you and Lord Adam,\" Kaage asked of his nephew, \"It's one thing for humans to enter a cloud dragon's territory, but it is usually very different when a dragon, especially of a different species, were to enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'd be welcome. You are my uncle after all,\" Felix assured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you need to still ask to be on the safe side, because I'll be the one flying you there. Not only will I have to be accepted by him but it has to be alright with the other cloud dragons since I'm a shadow dragon,\" Kaage explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you want to fly us there?\" Adam questioned, \"Most dragons feel that flying with a human on their back is degrading...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forget, my lord, I was raised by humans and I don't have many of the dragon mentalities because of that. I'm more human in my mind than dragon,\" Kaage told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it must still feel strange since you're a sentient being. I don't want you to feel like you're some beast of burden or something,\" Adam argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see it like that,\" Kaage informed Lord Adam, \"I see it as helping a friend and my nephew. Because I'm more human in my mind, you are my lord and my loyalties are to you and my nephew and his new family. Besides, I miss giving Frewen and Isabel rides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery well, when Felix gets word from Rathnait...\" Lord Adam started, but one of the side doors opened up and Ashley fell into the room. She had been listening in on the conversation and accidentally twisted the doorknob, causing the door to open and her to fall into the room. \"Ashley!\" Lord Adam yelled, \"What did I tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, it's not fair. I need to listen to this!\" Ashley argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for Felix and...\" Lord Adam started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're only keeping me out because you want to protect me from the evils like Lord William. That's why you never told my the details of Felix's life. But you shouldn't hide me from such things,\" Ashley argued, \"If I happen to be in control of the city, I'd need to learn about such evils so that I will know hoe to properly handle them. All you're doing is making me blind from them so that they can sneak up behind me and destroy me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Adam listened to Ashley's words and was surprised by her mature words. \"But you don't even know what happened to Felix. How could you help?\" Lord Adam questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rathnait and I told her, father,\" Felix informed Adam, \"I realized long ago that she was only being hurt by not knowing what happens in other places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to come along, father,\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Adam hesitated for the longest time and eventually sighed, \"Both of you are right. I should hide you from the real evils. You may come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Rathnait linked back up with Felix. <i>\"Can you hear me Felix?\"</i> Rathnait asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I have two more people coming other than just me and my father,\"</i> Felix told Rathnait, <i>\"Ashley's coming along as well, and Kaage has decided to fly us there. Are they allowed to come?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was long silence as Rathnait asked her parents if Kaage and Ashley were aloud to come as well.  Eventually, Rathnait replied... </span></div></div>",

The four travelled down the way to the landing zone outside the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they arrived, Kaage moved away from the humans and released his spell, slowly transforming into the giant black dragon few had seen.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The flight to Dracus and Shanye's cave was strange to everyone involved. For one, it was the first flight got Ashley and Adam. King Adam respected the dragons and knew that they wouldn't take kindly to a human riding on their back. It was one thing if a human was injured or could only get somewhere by flying and even than the dragon \"carried\" humans. Even with such exceptions, there were dragons that wouldn't ever let a human be carried, they felt it was demeaning to be considered no more than an beast of burden. Though it might not be the human's intention to make it seem that way, it is what goes through most dragons' heads. There were a few species of dragons that would see giving humans a ride as being helpful, though those were forest, silver, some gold, and some water dragon. Fire dragons, Snow dragons, and Cloud dragons were too proud of creatures and most saw letting humans ride them as demeaning. (by the way, there are nine known species of dragons all with their own personalities and beliefs.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only because of the respect for dragons Adam had, Adam also knew all too well that dragons were intelligent being. He felt uncomfortable having to ride Kaage to get to Dracus's cave. If it wasn't for Kaage persistent assurance that he didn't mind letting them ride him and the fact that the only way to get to the cave was to fly, Adam would have never agreed to going through with it in this manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, like her father, was a little uncomfortable with riding a dragon. She shared his beliefs and knew all to well what could disrespect a dragon. She was taught how to deal with them and all the what to do and not to do's around dragon, because it was clear she'd have to eventually deal with them. Those these beliefs existed, there was another part that existed in her ever since she was a child: the desire to be able to fly. She had always wanted to fly, even more so when Rathnait described to her what it was like to fly. Ashley was sometimes tempted to ask Rathnait to give her a short ride. Rathnait and Ashley were good friends and it was quiet possible that Rathnait would give Ashley a ride if she asked it. However, Ashley didn't want to risk her friendship for a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight was strange to Felix as well. Sure, Felix had flown many times with Rathnait and he was used to the flying experience. However, it seemed strange to be on the back of a large creature he called Uncle. He had flown with Kaage before, but those were times before he had his memory erased and had become a slave to Lord William. He now remembered those memories, but those memories were still strange to Felix, as if they never happened or happened to someone else. They felt foreign to him and flying on Kaage seemed new to Felix because of this fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage hadn't been in his dragon form, his true form, for a very long time. He had stayed human ever since he had come upon the village in the mountains after leaving Felix with humans he thought he could trust. Because of this fact, the flight was also strange for Kaage. It wasn't that he was used to flying, because dragons were natural fliers, well the dragons with wings, because some water dragons and Earth dragons didn't have wings.This strange feeling came from all the things he missed about flying. Flying was a way Kaage used to relieve his stress and before he and Frewen were being hunted. Kaage may have enjoyed being in human form to be with humans since he was raised by humans, but he was still a dragon and most dragons loved to fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kaage flew to Dracus and Shanaye's cave, Kaage once again felt free and alive. He missed flying way too much and it would be near impossible to describe the happiness he felt at that moment and it made Kaage feel even better to have people that were close to him sharing the experience together. It was in no way demeaning to him to have them on his back, as long as they didn't see him as a beast of burden, which he knew they wouldn't do, he would be fine giving them a ride. It reminded him of the happy times he had when he flew Frewen and Isabel on his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Kaage enjoyed the flight, Adam and Ashley were scared of the flight and were a little uncomfortable. Ashley was a little less terrified than her father since she always wanted to fly, but no matter how much one wants to do an exciting activity, it's always scary the fist time. It also didn't help matters that Kaage was a terrifying beast that looked demonic with black scales, wicked looking horns, and blood red eyes. No matter how much Kaage warned them of his dragon form and no matter how many times he had assured them he was the same man they knew, there was still a hesitant moment where Ashley and Adam took a while to get on Kaage's back initially. People's fearful glances was something that Kaage did not miss about being a shadow dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage soon began to slow down and Felix questioned, \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage turned his head slightly to see his passengers with one of his large red eyes and answered, \"I'm in Cloud Dragon territory now, and I think there might be a patrol guard up a head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix and the others couldn't see anything in front of Kaage, but sure enough, a large cloud dragon suddenly swooped down and blocked Kaage's flight path. Kaage was glad he slowed down before hand. Any more sudden of a stop and some of his passengers might have fallen of his back. The patrol dragon was a male and one of the larger cloud dragons of the clan. Because of this, the male was far larger and more intimidating than Kaage. Kaage was about the average size of an adult male shadow dragon and that was slightly smaller than the average size of an average adult female cloud dragon. Kaage was small compared to the cloud dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in these mountains, Shadow Dragon?\" the patrol dragon growled, \"This side of the mountains range is Cloud Dragon territory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm well aware of that fact and I have been invited to the cave of some dragons from your clan,\" Kaage informed the cloud dragon. Kaage tried to be as polite and careful with his words. Kaage hadn't spoken to many dragon in his lifetime and only knew the basics of certain thing he could and couldn't say. Kaage was far more comfortable talking with humans and because he was raised by humans, he talked like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't told of a shadow dragon arriving, and what is on your back?\" the dragon questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloud dragon changed his position to see what was on Kaage's back. Kaage wanted to move with the dragon to keep the dragon's gaze off his nephew and friends. Though Kaage had to fight his protective urge for that moment and let the cloud dragon inspect his back. It was the patrol's job to see everything going in the clan's territory. Plus, Kaage didn't want to anger the already grumpy larger patrol dragon anymore. If he were to get in a fight with the Cloud Dragon, his passenger and himself might not make it through such a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the cloud dragon saw that there were three humans on Kaage's back, the cloud dragon immediately glared at Kaage and growled, \"You're letting humans ride you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm giving them a lift,\" Kaage started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're their pack mole, is that it? You're their horse or their pet?\" the dragon interrupted. The patrol dragon obviously saw Kaage's behavior as disgraceful. \"How could you disgrace yourself by becoming a tool for humans?\" the patrol dragon questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see no disgrace in helping my friends. They have been invited as well, and they have to get to the cave somehow,\" Kaage commented. Kaage tried to stay as calm as possible, but the dragon seemed to have no regard for the humans on Kaage's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet you don't seem to be disgraced by this fact. How can you be fine with this?\" the cloud dragon questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not disgraced because I am helping my family, and if you keep talking about them like that...\" Kaage began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're family?\" the cloud dragon questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was raised by humans,\" Kaage explained, \"The young boy on my back is my nephew and the others are my nephew's new father and sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your family? You're a dragon! You're not a human. You're one of those freaks that think their humans. Many of you shadow dragon have those problems because you can turn into a human. You probably live with humans and take human form just so that they can accept you, is that right?\" The dragon roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was abandoned by my true parents. I never even met them. Humans were the only ones that were kind enough to take me in and I can't stay here and listen to you talk about them like that and not do anything. So what if I live with humans. They are the only ones that have accepted me for who I am. I may be a dragon, but it was humans that took me in. I would...\" Kaage started to yell<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" a voice called out. Both Kaage and the patrol dragon turned to see Dracus flying towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This shadow dragon and his human masters are trying to come into our territory and...\" the patrol dragon tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let them through, they are here to speak to me and my mate,\" Dracus ordered, \"Lord Adam has something of importance to speak of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patrol dragon just snorted and flew back to his perch. \"Follow me,\" Dracus commanded and Kaage followed closely.   </span></div></div>",

Felix smiled as he saw Dracus' cave approach and the large cloud dragon land and soon Kaage landed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix!\" came a cry of happiness from inside the cave as Rathnait sensed her bond-mate approach.  The forty foot tall dragon walked outside to greet her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Rathnait,\" Felix said as he slid off his uncle's back.  He helped his father and sister off as well.  Ashley looked around at the dragon's home.  But a snort from Dracus made them look up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in so we may talk,\" he said, leading the way.  Rathnait walked near Ashley and Felix, used to doing so when she visited the town.  Adam looked back to Kaage and saw an awkward expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Adam asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm unsure if I should revert back to my human guise or not,\" Kaage replied, \"I prefer being in human form because I'm used to it, but . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I think you should enjoy the time you have to be in your natural form,\" Adam said quickly, \"It's not often you're in it and it might make this meeting go better if you don't change back.\"  Kaage nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense,\" Kaage said, his worry dissipating and then followed the human lord into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last pair entered they heard Dracus informing his other children Felix's visit was not merely social when they wanted to ask him how life at the town was, Rathnait was the only child permitted to visit the town.  Leading the group into the back area, Shanaye waited with a dark look on her face.  Once the group had fully arrived, Shanaye spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are these lies that monster is spreading about us?\" she asked in human tongue.  Felix took a deep breath.  He knew it would be best coming from him because of his closeness with the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is saying Lord Adam ordered a battalion of cloud dragons to destroy his keep and steal his land and property, that there was no just cause for such an attack,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One merchant told me one rumor he heard is that some of the slaves taken were used to feed the dragon force,\" Ashley spoke up.  Shanaye immediately looked at Ashely with a deep look of disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of these rumors, the King my father and that man bow to has agreed to an audience so he may state his grievances and ask for retribution,\" Felix continued, drawing Shanaye's gaze back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of ramifications could occur if he is believed?\" Dracus asked in a cold voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Alfred could reinstate his title and lands and even strip me of my title and right to rule the city,\" Adam said, \"And he could also agree to have men come and attack your people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans have a hard time attacking us,\" Shanaye replied curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but even the Imperial Army has means of fighting dragons.  I'm sure you remember the powder they used to capture you Dracus,\" Adam replied.  Dracus growled at the reminder of that incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we do have a plan to stopping him,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill him?\" Shanaye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that would only solidify his claims,\" Adam said, \"Felix is going to testify against these charges.  But his word alone would only do so much against such rumors.  He could be seen as just a former slave not wanting to return to his master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else can you do?\" Dracus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were wondering if you'd agree to allow Rathnait to accompany us and testify as well, saying she was captured and it was that capture that led to your attack on his castle,\" Adam said, steadying himself for the anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" Shanaye replied loudly, her voice echoing off the walls, \"We won't let her go and reveal that to an entire crowd of ignorant humans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mother!\" Rathnait replied, \"If it means his defeat  . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Shanaye replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shanaye, it will also be seen as what could happen to some ignorant human if they try and capture one of us,\" Dracus commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious Dracus?\" Shanaye replied, looking at her mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" Dracus replied, \"But obviously you will not agree to her going alone.  So, what if I accompany her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious!  To let them know of that . . .\" Shanaye started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The good of this community is more important than my own pride,\" Dracus answered, \"Besides, Lord Adam has kept every promise with us.  He has kept any slayer from using his city as a base.  If he should be stripped of rank, we don't know who will come to power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could even be William,\" Adam added, seeing Shanaye's eyes fill with even more anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So mother, may I go?\" Rathnait asked.</span></div></div>",

I'm sorry I left you two in the dark about this, but I didn't think it was possible for people to believe such a man as William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShanaye sighed and asked, \"Who would be going on this journey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Felix would have to and I will go to show the King our treaty with your dragon clan. We did preserve the original contract thanks to Rhian,\" Adam stated. Felix was slightly shocked to hearing her name. She looked young yet she was apparently around when the contract between the cloud dragons and the people of the village was formed. Felix knew that she could wield magic, but he had no idea how old she truly was. She might be immortal for all he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I will join them as well,\" Kaage spoke up for the first time in the cave, \"I must make sure my nephew is safe. He has suffered enough torment when I was away from him, and I will not let that happen to him again. Plus, I can become human and travel with them and give them the protection of a dragon when no dragon can fit in the city.\" Adam nodded to show Kaage that he was welcome to come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish to go too, father,\" Ashley told her father, \"I know I can't help in the trails, but I wish to be with my friends in this dark time.\" Adam was reluctant, but he nodded his head again to show it was alright for Ashley to come along as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShanaye looked at her mate and looked at him for advice or assurance. Shanaye still didn't want Rathnait to leave again and be so far away from the family. She was worried that Rathnait could be captured again and this time, Rathnait might be gone forever. \"I understand your worry, for I'm worried too, Shanaye,\" Dracus informed her, \"But Rathnait will be among friends on the journey. We have an alliance with them, and I'm sure they won't let any harm come to Rathnait. Rathnait will be far away, but she will be safe with them. Besides, if you allow it, I will go with them as well and keep her safe. She will not be captured again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just that I'm worried about,\" Shanaye replied, \"But she'll be going to a city where humans don't see dragons the way these humans do. You know that most humans don't believe dragons are sentient beings. There are humans that can't comprehend the fact that there are other creatures out there with intelligence. I'm worried some of those humans could be violent towards Rathnait because they'll thinks she's a monster or some demon because she can talk and they think dragons can't. There could be a whole range of dangers from going to a city with such ignorant humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will make sure our daughter is safe,\" Dracus assured his mate, \"I will do whatever it takes to protect her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long hesitation as Shanaye thought about what she should do. She weighed out the possibilities of harm coming to her daughter by being so far a way with the pleasure destroying William's chances of ever coming back into power. It was a difficult decision and she didn't want to put her daughter in danger, but it was a risk that had to be taken to stop William for good and ensure the safety of the cloud dragons and the human village they supported. Shanaye sighed, \"Rathnait, will go, but only if you go with her, Dracus. You need to promise me you'll keep her safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my word, my love. I shall keep our daughter safe,\" Dracus replied as he nuzzled Shanaye affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I can help stop William?\" Rathnait questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Dracus answered. Dracus looked down at Lord Adam and questioned, \"When do we leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be best to leave sometime tomorrow afternoon, unless that too soon for you,\" Lord Adam informed Dracus, \"The capital is is far away and will take a few days to get there even if we fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we will leave tomorrow,\" Dracus replied. </span></div></div>",

They in turn nodded to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe preparations went well and the following day the six travelers set off.  Kaage, after some persuasion from Lord Adam, chose to fly in his dragon form.    During the travels, the human travelers would alternate between dragons, though only Lord Adam rode on Dracus and Felix was almost always riding Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group would travel well after dark, as it was easier because seeing the dragons at night was more difficult.  With each time they rested, Dracus and Rathnait were educated on human politics and key things they were to know if things were to go well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the final night of their journey, they were finalizing their plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you will approach first and Felix will call Rathnait when we are to come?\" Dracus asked, looking down at the humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we will need to first get an audience with him and then we will inform him of our side of the story,\" Lord Adam said.  Felix sighed and laughed in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" Rathnait asked, sensing something deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking how if I still had my scars I would have more evidence to show what sort of monster William is,\" Felix replied.  The others looked at him with a little shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that Felix,\" Rathnait said, \"I couldn't think of you bearing those wounds.\"  She lowered her head and gently nuzzled her bond-mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right,\" Ashley said, \"We would have never guessed that this man would come to power once more.  So there was no need for you to keep them.\"  Felix looked at his sister and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're both right,\" Felix admitted.  He gave another sigh.  \"I guess I'm just worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we should rest so we are not worn out for tomorrow,\"  Lord Adam said.  Dracus agreed and Felix and Ashley put their mats near Rathnait to rest.  Felix was near Rathnait because of their bond and Ashley because she felt safe near Felix.  Kaage elected himself to stay up and keep watch.  It had been many years since he was near another human civilization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning  Lord Adam, Felix, Ashely, and Kaage walked the mile to the castle town as Dracus and Rathnait were soaring high in the clouds above them.  As they reached the castle town gate, the guard recognized Lord Adam's coat of arms and sent a messenger ahead to alert the castle of the desire for an audiance with the King.  He also called for a carriage to take them to the front gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father,\" Ashley said as she rode, \"Do you think that man will have arrived by now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope not,\" Lord Adam answered in a quiet voice, \"It would be best to explain to King Alfred without William's presence.  I doubt Rathnait could restrain herself from killing him for what he did to her.\"  Adam looked to his son.  \"I expect you to keep yourself in control as well Felix,\" Adam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to behave myself Father,\" Felix said, not looking at his adoptive father.  Under his skin he could feel his anger growl at the thought of seeing William again.  Rathnait held a similar feeling.  But he knew he could not lose his temper in front of the king.  He could not become a wounded child raging against that man.  He took a deep breath as the castle gates came into sight.  He looked at the vast land between the inner wall and the castle.  He smiled, knowing there would be plenty of room for both Rathnait and Dracus when they landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the castle . . .</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before the carriage could arrive in the courtyard, they had to cross a large bridge with a not so wide, but very deep canyon that separated the castle from the capital. The metal gates rose up, revealing the opening where they could pass through the outer walls of the castle. Felix looked through the carriage's window to examine the courtyard. The courtyard was massive and Felix knew that Rathnait and Dracus would both fit in the courtyard together, despite Dracus's incredible size. <i>\"We haven't talked with the King yet about letting you join his audience, but it looks like the courtyard is big enough for you both to land in without much trouble when it is time to join us,\"</i> Felix informed Rathnait with his bond, <i>\"Where are you and your father now?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We're on the same side of the canyon where the castle is,\"</i> Rathnait answered, <i>\"That way, we won't have to fly above the town to get to the castle's courtyard, and it won't cause as big as a panic.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You know townspeople will still probably see you guys land in the castle and get worried,\"</i> Felix pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We know, but at least we won't be swooping over the town before we land in the castle. Landing at the castle will be better since the castle is sturdier and won't fall apart from the wind from our wings,\"</i> Rathnait stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the carriage was parked, the door was opened by a servant of the King. When the four individuals got out of the carriage, the servant motioned them to follow him. They were lead to two large double. The double doors were the entrance to the castle and about fifty to sixty feet tall! Felix knew that Rathnait will be able to fit through the entrance, but Dracus would not. Though Rathnait was 15 years old in human years, she was still a child and in dragon years, she was about seven and a half years old. Rathnait was forty feet tall on all fours, and if a seven year old child was that large, adult dragons were over one hundred feet tall. Rathnait wouldn't get that large till she was thirty-two years in human years. No human doorway could ever fit Dracus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doors were opened, they found themselves in a large waiting room like area. The only other doors leading out of the room lead farther into the castle which Felix believed lead to the main hall. That doorway was the same height as the other. <i>\"Rathnait, you'll be able to fit through the doors, but your father...\"</i> Felix started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I know,\"</i> Rathnait interrupted, <i>\"I can see through your eyes now. Father feared he wouldn't be able to fit, but his head and neck can make it to the main hall, and that's good enough for him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I forgot we can now look through each other's eyes,\"</i> Felix replied. it was a bond power they had both obtained on their way to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant turned to the group and stated, \"The King is in a meeting right now, but if you tell me of your business with the King, I can tell him and if it is important enough, he will let you join.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him we are here to defend our case against Lord William's accusations,\" Lord Adam ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant bowed and said, \"I shall tell him why you are here, Lord Adam.\" The servant went through the large doors and they closed behind him and the four waited to be called in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage noticed Felix's nervousness and questioned, \"Are you and Rathnait nervous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, both of us are worried that Lord William is in there,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take deep and calming breaths. Breathe in your mouth and out your nose and try to calm yourself. Tell Rathnait to do the same as well,\" Kaage ordered, \"Your and her emotions leak into each other through the bond you have with her. This leakage can make you both feel the same way, and if you are both feeling the same way already, then it can lead to you both being controlled by your emotions. Nervousness can lead to frustration and anger which could make this situation dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded and tried to calm himself down and he relayed Kaage's message to Rathnait. Eventually, the servant came back to tell them they could join the King's audience. The doors were pushed open fully and they entered the grand and enormous main hall where the throne was. They noticed King Albert was standing towards the center of the hall conversing with another man. That other man happened to be Lord William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doors shut behind the four travelers, William and King Albert heard the sound and turned there attention to the new arrivals. Felix glared at William, though William wasn't staring at Felix. Felix could also feel his mind being contaminated by Rathnait's anger. <i>\"That monster must die. He must pay for what he's put us through,\"</i> Rathnait growled in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Rathnait, we must keep ourselves calm,\"</i> Felix said, trying to defuse her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But what that man did to us...\"</i> Rathnait began to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We can't change the past, no matter what we do. Killing him now will only make us look like the bad guys. We have to prove to the King that William is the evil one and the King will make him pay,\"</i> Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm sorry, Felix,\"</i> Rathnait sighed, <i>\"But seeing that man through your eyes just makes me so angry. I can only imagine what it will be like when I see him with my own eyes.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I understand. That man did many terrible things to us that we could never forget. I'm angry as well, but we can't let anger determine our actions for us. We must keep calm. We must be there for each other,\"</i> Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it's true. The traitors did decide to join,\" William said angrily as he noticed Lord Adam walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Adam, there have been serious accusations against you and your father. Could you care to explain to me what is going on?\" King Albert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have already told you what those bastards did to me and...\" Lord William started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Albert interrupted, \"I must hear their side of the story as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you will hear from them will be lies. Though it is true that one must hear both sides to truly understand what is happening,\" William replied, obviously trying to stay on the King's good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"William says that you have actually tamed dragons and used them to attack his castle without reason! Is this true, Adam? Did your father actually tame dragons to do his bidding?\" King Albert questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see William left out the reason why he was attacked, but before I can successfully tell you the reason why he was attacked, I have to explain to you our relationship with the dragons. My father never tamed dragons. They can't be tamed. For one, their pride would never allow them to be tamed, and two, dragons are sentient beings,\" Lord Adam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sentient beings?\" King Albert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it is hard to believe, because dragons look like animals, but they do have intelligence,\" Lord Adam told the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't tell me you believe this rubbish,\" William spoke up, \"Dragons are mindless and savage monsters. There is no way they could possibly have intelligence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you have some sort of proof to back this claim?\" King Albert questioned. King Albert didn't seem to believe that dragons were intelligent, and he couldn't be blamed for that. Humans were taught that dragons were monsters and weren't intelligent beings. Humans were taught at an early age that only things that looked human could be intelligent beings, (elves, dwarfs, fairies, and so forth.) Dragons had once tried to explain they weren't evil monsters, but since humans killed dragons out of fear, most dragons had given up on convincing humans and just let them be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have brought three dragons that have agreed to come along with me,\" Lord Adam explained, \"They can speak human and prove to you that dragons aren't mindless monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You brought dragons!\" King Albert gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, he brought monsters to try and overtake the crown!\" William hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My King, I did not bring dragons to attack you, but only to prove to you that dragons are not what you think. The dragons are safely away from the castle and will come if you welcome them so that they and defend themselves against William's claims,\" Lord Adam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To prove that they are reasonable creatures, I have brought a treaty that was formed between my city and the cloud dragons of the mountains,\" Lord Adam continued as he asked Ashley for the treaty she had been keeping safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You formed a treaty with dragons?\" King Albert questioned with much confusion and astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a long time, our city and its people feared the dragons of the mountains and we wouldn't go near them. The dragons just kept to themselves and thought that as long as we didn't bother them, they wouldn't bother us. As my father had once described to me, our people always feared a possible attack from the dragons, but the dragons never attacked, this was when they believed dragons were mindless animals,\" Lord Adam informed them, \"When my grandfather was in charge of ruling the city, my father, a boy at the time, got lost in the mountains. A younger dragon found my father. Neither of them could speak each other's language and my father had told me how scared he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Adam continued, \"However, during that encounter, the dragon tried communicating with my father though gestures and got far enough to explain that my father was in no danger. My father soon trusted the dragon and the dragon brought my father back to the city unharmed. My father told his father everything and my grandfather eventually found where the dragons lived and found some knew English. A truce was eventually formed and they put it on paper. The dragons and humans decided to help each other out. We help by keeping dragon slayers from coming and they help us when ever we need it. Some friendships between dragons and humans had also been formed through this truce. The young dragon that saved my father is a family friend and is one of the dragons who had decided to come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Adam handed King Albert the treaty and King Albert examined it. William looked over it as well and commented, \"This treaty looks new. They could have wrote this down last night to try and complete the lie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks new only because it was preserved through magic. There is a woman, who is not entirely human, who knows much magic. Her name is Rhain and she's been in the city ever since it was formed long ago,\" Lord Adam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, this is definitely your grandfather's signature,\" King Albert told Adam, \"I've seen this signature before in the achieves. There is no doubting it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you have a treaty with them, you could have had them attack your enemies, and you could make them attack me,\" Lord William growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't make the dragons do anything. They do what is in their best interest. If an army were to attack the city, they would help, but if the enemy isn't directly affecting us, we can't make the dragon's help us,\" Lord Adam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did dragons attack William?\" King Albert questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is something you must ask the dragons that came here with me. They would better explain why William was attacked. If you let them land in the courtyard, the child dragon could fit in this room and her father could fit his head through the doorways,\" Lord Adam suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring dragons here!? I'm not sure if that is safe. I see this treaty you've made with the dragons, and I want to believe you, but...\" King Albert started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you may, your majesty, can I speak?\" Kaage questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who might you be?\" King Albert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am resident of Lord Adam's city and a friend. You have no need to worry about the dragons. They have given their word not to harm any humans on their travel unless it is to defend themselves. The dragons will not harm you,\" Kaage tried to assure the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how can you be so sure?\" King Albert questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I am the third dragon Lord Adam mentioned,\" Kaage answered, \"I know it sounds odd, but I'm a shadow dragon, a dragon that can take human form, among other useful abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are to believe you're a dragon?\" William laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage transformed into a dragon before their very eyes. However, he had the ability to change his size and didn't make himself his real height, only enough to reach the ceiling. King Albert and William looked up at the scary demonic looking dragon before them. \"You see, my King, I am a dragon and if the dragons truly wanted to harm you, we would have done it by now. You can trust us. Please here what the dragons have to say about why they attacked William's castle,\" Kaage requested while bowing his enormous head to the King.</span></div></div>",

He watched it bow its large head in subserviance, like any of his subjects would.  And his words held an apparent truth.  If Lord Adam wished to take the kingdom, one dragon alone would be a force to recognized and feared.  But this one was not harming him and was even bowing to him.  Taking a deep breath, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are the other two dragons of your species?\" King Albert asked in a firm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they are Cloud Dragons,\" Kaage said, \"And it is wise to say I am different from most every other dragon as I was raised by humans since I was very young.  So I consider myself human in heart and mind, but dragon of body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lies,\" William was able to mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" King Albert replied, looking at William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being like that, it's impossible,\" William replied, \"This is either a well trained dragon to mimic human mannerisms or it is a human using a mystical spell to appear to be a dragon.\"  King Albert looked at William and then to one of Kaage's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not believe that is the case.  My cousin is one quarter elf and his grandmother, an elf, told me how she was a war orphan found by the family Rela and raised as their own.  She described her self in similar words.  Human in spirit and elven of body,\" King Albert said, he turned his gaze to Lord Adam.  \"You may bring the dragons into this chamber.\"  Lord Adam smiled.  \"Alert the castle guards,\" King Albert said to his Captain of the Guards.  The strong looking man, who had not flinched when he saw Kaage transform nodded and left in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Rathnait, you and Dracus may come down,</i>\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Excellent,</i>\" Rathnait replied, \"<i>We are decending now.</i>\" Felix gave a slight nod to his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are coming now,\" Lord Adam said.  King Albert looked confused and looked to Kaage for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you tell them this?  Are you sending them the words of this meeting Shadow dragon?\" King Albert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No your majesty,\" Felix said, stepping forward, \"I am because of my bond with the child dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your 'bond'?  You speak of the exchange of powers and deep connection between two mystical beings, correct?\" King Albert asked.  Felix nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Rathnait, that is the child's name, and I have this bond.  And we both have words to say about that, \" Felix said, carefully omitting certain words from what he wanted to say, \" . . . Man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam looked on the boy who was speaking.  His eyes seemed familiar.  But a loud thud from the outside broke his concentration.  King Albert looked to the second group of guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the parent dragon, Dracus,\" Lord Adam confirming the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His daughter is waiting for the front guards to move,\" Felix commented, \"They are scared and confused about their sudden arrival.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Captain Arik was a strong and well trained soldier. He was the King's most trusted General in times of war and the King's most trusted guard when there was no war. Since this was not a time of war, Arik was the Captain of the guards at that moment. King Albert would have liked Arik to be an adviser rather than a guard, but Arik insisted that war and killing was the only thing he would successfully be able to advise the King on. Therefore, Arik told the King that his advice was only good as a General during war or on the brink of war. King Albert was worried that giving such a noble and well qualified man the duty of Captain of the Guards would be demeaning, but Arik didn't feel it was demeaning at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Arik walked quickly towards the doors. He hoped to get to the courtyard before the dragons landed so that he could keep the rest of the guards from attacking the dragons. It seemed strange to him that he would be telling his men to not attack the dragons. He, like, nearly all humans, was taught that dragons were just simple minded monsters that would attack a person on sight. He would have never believed it was possible that dragons could actually be as intelligent as humans, since dragons looked like fearsome monsters. Once he saw that human, or it appeared to be human, turn into a black dragon and speak before his very eyes and ears, Captain Arik began to believe it was possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I've heard many tales that ended up being untrue. The stories of dragons being monsters could be true. When we humans see creatures that are large and scary looking, we tend to dub them as monsters and if they don't have humanoid form, we call them mindless beasts,\"</i> Captain Arik thought to himself, <i>\"And when humans dub creatures as monsters, we kill them mercilessly. if all dragons are as intelligent as the black one, they must hate humans for what we've done. I'm glad I became a soldier instead of a dragon slayer. I would have been horrified if I killed an innocent creature without any reason other then it being a dragon.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Captain Arik could reach the doors, he heard a loud boom along with the ground shaking beneath him. <i>\"They must have landed,\"</i> Captain Arik realized as he pushed open the doors leading to the courtyard. In the courtyard, Captain Arik found a sight he could have never imagined, a massive dragon easily over one hundred feet tall on all fours was in the courtyard. he had heard stories of dragons becoming very large, but he never would have dreamed they could get as large as the dragon in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Arik couldn't turn his eyes away from the dragon until he saw movement in the corner of his eyes. Captain Arik looked on either side to see the guards meant to guard the main doors rising to their feet, looking at the massive dragon in shock. Arik looked to the walls and saw that the men on the walls were rising to their feet as well. <i>\"The wind from the dragons' wings must have knocked them all down. It was luckily that they were able to react in tome to grab onto something. Unless the dragons just landed extremely carefully,\"</i> Captain Arik thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he noticed the door guards raise their spears and the guards at the walls aim their arrows. Captain Arik inwardly feared the dragon would become savage and attack causing much trouble. Yet, the dragon just looked around, stood tall, and stayed calm. <i>\"Dragons are nothing like the stories,\"</i> Captain Arik knew at that moment, <i>\"Well, they don't act like dragon from those stories, but they sure look like how they are described to be, massive beast-like creatures.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the guards could start attacking the dragon, which would have been a stupid thing to do however brave, Captain Arik commanded, \"Hold your fire! Stay your weapons! The dragon is not to be harmed!\" All the guards were confused by the Captain's order. The men on the wall lowered their bows slightly, but the men at the entrance kept their spears up with shaky hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! It's a massive dragon that just suddenly swooped down to attack us and...\" one of the door guards started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This dragons did not come to attack us,\" Captain Arik explained, \"The dragons came seeking audience with the King. The King has sent me out here to tell that the King has agreed to talk to the dragons.\" Captain Arik spoke up loud enough for all the guards to hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's a giant monster. It can't speak!\" the guard argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive dragon opened its mouth and with a deep voice said, \"You will find that I can speak your tongue quite well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the guard stared at the dragon in utter amazement once the dragon spoke. Captain Arik was the only one not fazed by the dragon's ability to speak. \"The... the b-b-beast... s-s-spoke!\" the guard gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Arik growled, \"Dragon or not, this is the King's guest. Act respectively. You don't want to anger both a dragon and our king, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no Sir,\" the guard quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then begin opening the doors so the dragons can speak with King Albert,\" Captain Arik ordered. The guards turned to the doors and began opening them. The guards on the wall were still nervous, but returned to their duties. Many still kept an eye on the gigantic dragon. Captain Arik turned back to look up at the massive dragon before him and approached without fear or hesitation. Not only was it because Arik had listened to the previous conversation with the King and he had learned dragons were intelligent, but it was also due to the fact that Arik was a brave and hardened soldier and had little to no fear. Dracus admired the human's bravery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDracus lowered his head a little lower to be able to see and hear the human more clearly. \"I apologize for the for your inconvenience. I tried to warn my men about your arrival before you got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is quite alright,\" Dracus replied, \"I understand that most of your species fear us as monsters and I've come to expect such reactions. Though, you seem to be a much braver and more understanding human. it's always a pleasure seeing a human with a more open mind. I makes encounters much more peaceful. I am glad you arrived when you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My King has allowed you to see him,\" Captain Arik informed Dracus. Captain Arik looked at the doors and them back up at Dracus and pointed out, \"Though, I'm not sure you can fit through the doors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe my head can fit. Then I could stretch my neck into the main hall,\" Dracus informed Arik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Arik looked around, but didn't see the second dragon. \"I was told that there would be two of you. Where is...?\" Captain Arik began to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am here,\" said a smaller dragon head as she peeked out from behind her father's wing. When the humans had got up to attack, Dracus had covered Rathnait with his wing to protect her Captain Arik gave a slight small seeing that the large dragon cared more about protecting his daughter than attacking humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You I believe can fit through the doors,\" Captain Arik informed the younger dragon. She sounded as though she was about eight years old from her voice, though the voice was deeper due to the fact she was forty-five feet tall. \"I will take you to my King and the rest of your companions,\" Captain Arik informed the dragons. Captain Arik walked to the doors and the dragons followed behind. Dracus had to wait for his daughter and the human to get through before he could lie down on his stomach and put his head through the doors and stretch it into the main hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage transformed back into his human form and Captain Arik soon entered the main hall with Rathnait who walked very carefully behind him. King Albert was relieved to see that Rathnait wasn't as large as Kaage, but when Dracus put his head through and stretched it into the room till his large head was behind Lord Adam's group, King Albert looked at the massive head in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Albert, these are the dragons we have been talking about,\" Lord Adam informed the King, \"This is Dracus, the one who saved my father when he was a child, and his oldest daughter Rathnait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really saved Micheal's life long ago,\" King Albert questioned, hardly believing such a massive creature could care about something as small as humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was younger, but yes. I couldn't just let him die in the mountains,\" Dracus answered, his deep voice filling the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are the one magically bonded with this boy?\" King Albert questioned Rathnait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait kept her eyes focused on King Albert. She tried to keep her eyes from seeing William. She had herself calm and she wouldn't do anything stupid, but she feared that she would if she saw the man once again. \"I am bonded with Felix, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Felix is a great friend,\" Rathnait answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Albert noticed that Felix moved over so that he was beside on of Rathnait's front legs. Felix also was leaning on Rathnait's leg with one of his arms wrapped around as much of the leg as he could. Rathnait broke her eye contact with King Albert and gave Felix a small nuzzle before returning her gaze to King Albert. King Albert could tell Felix and Rathnait were close like most who were magically bonded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that you dragons have a pact with Lord Adam and his city and that you're intelligent beings, but I still don't know the reason you attacked William and his castle,\" King Albert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason begins with Felix and my daughter,\" Dracus told the King. All eyes turned to Rathnait and Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ran away from home,\" Rathnait informed King Albert, \"I wanted to live on my own, but I was too young and foolish. I was captured by humans and held prisoner. William was the own who kept me prisoner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preposterous! Why would I want to capture a dragon?\" William argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I listened to your side of the story without interruptions,\" King Albert told William, \"Now let me hear their whole story.\" King Albert turned back to Rathnait and told her, \"Go on, child, continue your story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait continued, \"William threw me into a dungeon and chained me down. He thought I was a monster, and since I didn't know the human tongue at the time, I couldn't do much to convince him I wasn't a beast. William made his guards hurt me and he tried to tame me like I was some beast so that he could control me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the reason your people attacked William?\" King Albert questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family didn't know where I was. That's not why they attacked the castle,\" Rathnait replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was one of William's slaves,\" Felix spoke up, \"I was in charge of feeding and taking care of Rathnait. At first she thought I was the enemy as well, but when William beat me in front of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Albert turned to William and asked, \"Do you beat your slaves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore William could say that it was a lie, Felix said, \"He does whatever he can to make us obey him. He views us as only property. He rules by abuse and fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I soon realized Felix was in the same situation as me, and tried to make friends with him.He taught me his language and we soon became good friends. He helped me escape the castle and we both flew back to my home,\" Rathnait said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before they could reach us, I was getting worried and heard from Micheal of rumors of William capturing a young dragon. I flew there after Rathnait and Felix escaped. William captured me with sleeping gas. My clan attacked William's castle to save me and because of the inhuman things he did to my daughter,\" Dracus explained.</span></div></div>",

It is there were this group of slayers live and work together to take down all the creatures they think are monsters,\" Felix informed the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this group is a group of monster slayers, then I understand why they would be after Kaage. Even though I know that Kaage isn't an evil monster that needs to be slain. I understand why others might think Kaage is, because he's a dragon. However, I don't know why that would possibly be after you,\" the King replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaage is my uncle,\" Felix simply answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... are you a shadow dragon too?\" King Albert gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Kaage and I aren't related by blood. When my father and Kaage were younger, the met each other during a storm, because they had both taken shelter in a cave. Kaage didn't have parents to take care of him. He never knew what happened to them. Kaage was sad and lonely. My father was kind enough to erase his fear of Kaage and comfort Kaage in his time of need,\" Felix explained, \"Eventually, my father's family adopted Kaage, despite Kaage being a dragon and raised them as their own. Kaage and my father became brothers and eventually become bonded with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix continued the story, \"After many decades of living, my father finally found a woman she loved and who was accept his brother being a dragon since Kaage and my father were nearly inseparable due to the long lasting bond. My parents had me, but soon the slayers discovered them. They viewed Kaage as a demonic beast and they don't believe in the magical bond. They thing the bond is the magical creature possessing the individual. They killed my mother and father. Kaage took me and cared for me as we escaped that kingdom, hoping the group didn't have more stronger branches in other kingdoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is true, then how did you become a slave to William?\" King Albert asked, astonished by the story Felix had told so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaage feared they would follow us and he didn't think I was safe around him. The group knew what he looked like in both his dragon and human forms, but they had no idea what to look for for me. Kaage loved me as a nephew because of his brotherhood with my father and he also loved me as if I were is own child due to the bond he had with me father. He could never forgive himself is something happened to me because of him. So he gave me to a human family he thought would care for me,\" Felix finished his story, \"But, he had no idea that family would decide to sell me into slavery for William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix also added, \"If the slayers find Kaage and I, we won't be the only ones endanger anymore. Rathnait and her family could be endanger from the slayers' wrath because their dragons and the bond I have with Rathnait. My new family would also be endanger too, just for taking care of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" King Albert replied, \"I will do what I can to keep these slayers out of my kingdom. I will tell the lords of the dragons' intelligence and hopefully we can make friends from other clans and species of dragons. Dragon slaying will be banned and only permissible if a dragon attacks first without cause or reason. They will have the same rights as humans in my kingdom and I will make it into a law so that dragons will be safe in my kingdom long after I pass.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few minutes earlier Kaage's eyes turned from Dracus onto the man who had hurt him.  But the man was no longer there.  His sharp eyes noticed a shadow fleeing down a servant's corridor and he held a deep growl, slowly becoming invisible and chasing after William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former-Lord was running scared.  He knew he had to escape the castle to where lords sympathetic to him would aide him in hiding until they could take over the kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I escaped before, I'll do it again,</i>\" he thought as ran past servants into the stables.  As he was about to escape, he heard a terrifying sound.  The horses were screaming in fear and rearing up on their legs.  William turned to see nothing behind him, but horses didn't usually react in such a way.  But as he turned back to the exit, Kaage stood before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to flee worm?\" Kaage asked, his voice cold and filled with a deep seeded hatred.  William's eyes narrowed in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can stop me?\" William asked, reaching into his pocket.  From a bag within, he threw a dust at Kaage, but Kaage moved back, avoiding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need to try harder if you want to hit me with that powder,\" Kaage replied, his face shifting into his draconic one, \"And if you fail to strike me, I will kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" William replied when he felt a cool blade cross his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my line,\" Arik commented, before looking at Kaage.  \"The king wants him alive,\" Arik informed the shadow dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't bow to your king,\" Kaage replied, becoming his full dragon form, taking up much of the entrance to the stable.  The true form of Kaage caused the horses' fear to increase even more and they slammed against their stables.  One broke free and slammed down behind Arik, causing him to release Willaim who ran forward, trying to get past Kaage in a small opening, but was quickly slammed down into the ground by Kaage's front claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaage, don't kill him!\" Arik ordered.  Kaage snorted smoke from his nose<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has been many years since I had human blood on my claws,\" Kaage commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think that boy wants you to dirty them on him?\" Arik replied, \"He's scum, beneath even beggars for his crimes.  Don't dirty your claws on him.\"  Kaage's eyes went from Arik to Lord William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not to be killed?\" Kaage asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" Arik said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll see you in the throne room,\" Kaage said, gripping William's cloak with his teeth and leaping into the air, with the former lord screaming for help.  Arik sighed and walked out of the stables as the horses calmed down.  He looked into the sky and saw Kaage high above with a figure of William in his teeth.  Then the dragon started to come down at high speeds.  Seeing he didn't have much time, Arik ran to the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Dracus, would you lift your neck up a small way?\" Arik called out to the large dragon blocking the entrance.  Slowly the head moved upward granting him a passage way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arik is coming this way,\" Dracus informed the throne room as he moved slightly.  There was silence as Arik entered with a slouched head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Arik,\" King Albert called out, \"Where is the traitor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming your highness,\" Arik said as a a loud scream penetrated the room.  Suddenly Kaage became visible and threw the frightened man to the ground.  Arik moved in and called for his men to enter and take the former lord.  Kaage growled before shifting back into his human form.  He walked over to Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's lucky to be alive,\" Kaage muttered, watching the men taking Willaim to the dungeon.  The former lord dared not look at the other dragons in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaage, King Albert has agreed to help us look for the men who killed mother and father,\" Felix replied.  Kaage looked at Felix, then the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Kaage asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, all it would take is your knowledge of what they look like,\" King Albert replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will tell you what I know,\" Kaage replied.</span></div></div>",

Like most of the castle, the dinning room was very large, but the doorways weren't as big as the entrance doors. So, even if this room were to be big enough for Rathnait to fit, the doorway wasn't big enough to get her in the room. The table they seated at was very long and had many seats. Felix inwardly wondered if it was ever used to its full capacity and whether the people at the end would even be able to hear the people on the other end of the table. King Albert was at the head of the table. On the side of the table that was the King's right was Lord Adam and then his daughter Ashley. Across from Lord Adam was Kaage and Felix was across from Ashley. King Albert had no family. This has brought some tension in the past about who would become King after Albert is gone, but King Albert, although fairly old in age, is still fit and healthy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you majesty,\" Felix assured the King, \"They understand completely. Besides, I think they prefer to hunt the food for themselves. They're very proud creatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as prideful as fire dragons though,\" Kaage commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, there are other species of dragons other than Cloud Dragons and Shadow Dragons. What are these Fire Dragons like?\" King Albert questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're lucky, you will never have to meet one. They aren't known for forgiving and gentle nature. They are war like and nearly all of them hate humans as well as other species of dragons. Especially the species that are kind to humans, like Shadow Dragons, Forest Dragons, Gold Dragons, and most Water Dragons and Silver Dragons. They believe they are the strongest of the dragons and are very stubborn about their beliefs. One could say they are infected by their high pride. The only thing that can compare to them are the Spartan humans. Who heard of them, I presume,\" Kaage explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have. These sound like dragons I don't wish to met,\" King Albert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't make deals or contracts with humans. They see them as weak insects that need to be killed. They only way you'd find a good fire dragon is if it is outcasted because it's considered weak, and somehow survives on its own,\" Kaage replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many species of dragons are there?\" King Albert wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know of at least twelve species, but I'm sure there are more types in other lands that I have not ventured,\" Kaage answered, \"I do not sound to be rude, my King, and I don't want to offend you, but I thought you wanted to know about the people that are after Felix and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, Kaage of the Shadow Dragons, business comes first,\" King Albert agreed, \"It's just that I could have never dreamed to actually be talking to a dragon. I had been taught that dragons were just animals. Now I've learned that dragons are sentient. This is all so fascinating,\" King Albert informed the Shadow Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" Kaage assured the King, \"I have encountered similar curious humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what can you tell us about your pursuers,\" Lord Adam asked Kaage to keep the subject going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know as much about them as I want to know, but they are a organization of monster hunters. They discovered the potential of working together and realized that taking down creatures was easier with a group of hunters rather than a single one. They do the same thing as normal monster slayers and go around the lands hunting monsters,\" Kaage informed them, \"I do not know how many lands they have spread, but I know the organization it numerous. Just as numerous as a religion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That many hunters working together?\" King Albert gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must have a base of operations somewhere to keep their more outward groups together, but I am unsure where that base is. They are constantly encouraging new monster slayers to join them to keep their numbers up,\" Kaage continued, \"They are merciless and kill everything they believe is a monster. Once they see something as a monster, they deem it and its species as a monster. There is nothing the creature would be able to say or do. There is no changing this organization's mind. Once you are considered a monster, you will always be a monster in their eyes. They will also kill anyone who helps the 'monster'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do this slayers look like?\" King Albert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no specific race, because they obtain any one they can find. They don't have a uniform armor, for some prefer light and some prefer heavy armor. Each hunter has their own style. This keeps their attacks unique. Therefore, if a monster defeats one group, the next group will be very different. There is only one way to tell they are part of the group. They are required to have a tattoo of the organizations symbol to show their loyalty to it. There is not required place to have it, so it can be under their clothing,\" Kaage told them, \"So, it is very difficult to spot them. They could easily have already infiltrated this land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will just have to ban dragon slaying and have a any other sentient creatures that we might be able to make treaties with. This will keep the authorities keeping an eye on monster slayers,\" King Albert explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one more thing,\" Kaage stated, \"When a group is assigned to kill a monster, that group has to keep hunting it till they defeat it. It isn't until they are killed that a new group is assigned to the creature. I didn't kill the group that killed my brother and his wife... Felix's parents. Therefore, that same group is still after me. I saw through the eyes of my brother when he was killed. I know exactly what the leader of the group looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Lord William sat in the prison cell thinking about how King Albert would kill him. He had been so close to winning the favor of King Albert and quite possibly the ability to rule after his death, but now it was all foiled by the very dragon he had captured as well his own child slave. William clenched his fists, growling at the fact that a slave child had tampered and shattered his plans. Now he was locked in a cell and chained to the walls very much like the same treatment he gave the dragon when he had it captured. <i>\"How can it end this way?\"</i> William wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam heard footsteps approaching the cell as they collided with the stone floor. William didn't even look up. He expected it to just be a guard. The footsteps stopped in front of William's cell and just stayed where they were. \"Leave me alone,\" William growled when the guard didn't leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have come to ask you questions,\" a deep voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam looked up and saw that this was no guard. The man wasn't dressed in any armor and had only two daggers. He was a big man with a bald head and looked to be in his forties. \"You're not a guard, who are you?\" William asked, \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard about how you were attacked by Cloud Dragons. I came to see you because I'm looking for a particular dragon. I have heard he has come to this land and is seeking refuge somewhere. I'm talking to everyone with information about dragons,\" the man stated, \"When I arrived, I heard that you have been imprisoned. Why have you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The King has taken the dragons' side and claimed I'm a traitor to the kingdom,\" William informed the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man growled, \"If I was on this assignment, the King would perish for siding with monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by assignment?\" William asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I work for an organization of monster slayers. I am on a different assignment and can't take another until it is finished. I am after a Demon Dragon that can take human form. It has been taking care of a human and might have possessed him by now like it did with its previous victims,\" the man answered, \"The dragon calls itself Kaage. Have you heard about this dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He's looking for the shadow dragon that caught me! He doesn't know he's here right now!\"</i> William thought, <i>\"I can use this to my advantage. If I tell him where this dragon is, he'd just leave me here. But if I tell him I know and agree to tell him once he frees me, I can use him to my advantage. I could...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know this dragon?\" the man asked once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do know about the dragon of which you speak, but in order for me to tell you, you must free me from this cell and out of this city where I'd be safe. Only then will I tell you where the dragon is,\" William said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't care about the conditions William brought to the table. he had been searching for Kaage for nearly ten years and to finally have a trail once again brought him relief. The man released William and began bringing him out of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the guards find William missing from the cell...   </span></div></div>",

Normally there would only be one, but considering who was being held, Captain Arik felt it wise to make sure no supporters made it by.  But as the three stood, something seemed to move past them, but they dismissed it simply enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate it when a draft comes down here and stirs the dust,\" one guard said.  His comrades said nothing, their eyes forward looking when they heard the snapping of metal echoing from within the dungeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" the second guard noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go check things out,\" the third said, walking down the path.  The two others waited patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lone guard walked down the path and saw the door to the former lord's cell open and he was walking out towards a strong looking man, strong enough to go evenly against his captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop right there!\" the guard called, looking at the pair.  The former-lord's eyes narrowed when he saw the guard present.  The man was unflinching and in a swift motion threw a dagger into the guard's chest, causing him to drop to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unexpected,\" the man said, as the sound of other footsteps came rushing down.  One of the guards had come rushing in while his partner went to call for help.  The lone guard saw his comrade and looked to see who had done it, but it was too late as the monster hunter had used the moment of shock to close in and injury his foe, but not before the guard pulled out a dagger and scratched the man's arm in a vain attempt to fight the superior fighter.  With two guards laying dead, William walked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have used a man like you  earlier in my life,\" he mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I serve a higher purpose than what you were doing,\" the man replied, \"It just happens my purpose is in need of your aide.  But know this, if you are lying, I will kill you myself.\"  With that, he started walking down the hallway with the former lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why aren't we running?\" William asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because right now, they won't be able to see us by means of a magic trinket I have,\" the man said, \"But they can hear us, so stay quiet.\"  William wanted to yell back he was not to be ordered around, but he knew to well you don't attack a person trying to save you.  You wait until the threat has passed for that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole survivor raced through the corridors, yelling about the escaped lord.  The guards were immediately mobilized and looked down the paths but saw no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the throne room, everyone had risen in shock of this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could the person have gotten in?\" King Albert yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are magics that can hide a person from human eyes,\" Kaage noted, \"But none from a dragon's.\"  King Albert looked at Kaage as Felix informed Rathnait about what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" was all he said before Kaage vanished and raced after the escaping pair.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kaage was in his dragon form flying above the capital invisible to the human eye. If William and the one who helped him escape were truly using some kind of magic to make them invisible, Kaage was confident in his abilities in finding the wicked human. The capital was large though, so Kaage searched it in sections. In each section, he'd scan it with his normal vision which was the same kind of vision humans had. Then Kaage would change his vision, like nearly all dragons could do, to a different vision that all dragons had. That vision could see the heat of living creatures. Only the more advanced dragons could switch between these two visions. The more primitive dragon-like creatures such as wyverns, benhirs, etc. only had the vision that saw heat. Also, primitive doesn't mean that they're all savage. It just means it's rare to find a sentient being in the \"primitive\" species of dragons, but it is possible to have one that is sentient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage examined the sections and kept track of how many humans were in the section when he scanned with his normal vision. If William and the other person was truly invisible, then they wouldn't show up in his normal vision, but would appear in his heat vision. Therefore, if he found an extra human in the second vision, it would most likely be William or William's partner. It was much harder to do this for the busier streets, this was the capital of the kingdom after all, but Kaage was a quick and observant creature and managed well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Kaage found no traces of an invisible person, let alone two. <i>\"How is this possible? They couldn't have escaped the capital already, there wasn't enough time to do so. But if they haven't escaped, how could I have missed them?\"</i> Kaage wondered as he hovered over the last section of the capital he had searched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage soon fell into denial as he thought, <i>\"He has to be in the city still! I have to find that little bastard!\"</i> Anger swelled up in Kaage. He couldn't let William and his accomplice escape. Normally, Kaage wouldn't bring himself to harm a human being. Not only were they sentient being that needed to be respected and beings that had their own rights, but Kaage felt closer to the human race than his own species. He was raise by humans when his own kind didn't do anything for him. However, Kaage would make an exception for the former Lord William. The human had done terrible things and was the second most evil creature Kaage had encountered. Plus, William had done some of those terrible deed to his nephew who felt like a son to Kaage due to Kaage's brother's feelings still deep in Kaage's mind through the magical bond they had shared for an extremely long duration of time. William was one of the few humans that Kaage would gladly slash to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage flew over the city in the desperation of trying to find William and the one who might have helped him escape the cell, but he found nothing. \"There's no one using invisibility magic,\" Kaage muttered as he flew over the capital for the third time. <i>\"But how could this be. William is known to the humans. He would have to use invisibility magic to make it out of the city without being captured.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a familiar scent wafted up to his snout. Kaage snapped his head in the direction of the scent. It was a recent scent that Kaage had recorded in his memory, and after what the man had done to his nephew, Kaage would remember William's scent until the human was dead. Kaage tilted his body and turned towards the scent. <i>\"Why didn't I notice that scent before? Was I too distraught and missed it?\"</i> Kaage questioned as he landed. Kaage made his large dragonic body passable by every object except the ground itself. That way, he could stay in his dragon form without having to worry about where he stepped and blocking human progression. Kaage sniffed William's scent and focused on only that scent through the hundreds of scents that clouded the area. As Kaage followed the scent, he kept his head low to the ground and many humans past through him, not knowing that he was even there among them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Kaage found himself at the main entrance of the city. <i>\"How did he get past the guards?\"</i> Kaage questioned, <i>\"They had to have been invisible to slip right past them, but I combed the city vigorously. I couldn't have missed them.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage continued to sniff the area and discovered something familiar. Kaage smelled another scent in the area that was familiar and not William's. <i>\"What is that?\"</i> Kaage wondered. Kaage focused on that scent trying to drive away all the others that contaminated the well used entrance to the capital. Through the hundreds of scents that blanketed the area, Kaage was able to focus on the single scent and smell it clearly. Kaage's eyes widened in shock and surprise. <i>\"It... It's him!\"</i> Kaage gasped in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage took off and flew as fast as he could to the castle. Kaage had a feeling that he knew why he couldn't find William. If the man who helped William escape was the man Kaage thought he was, then he would have been able to hide them from his vision: the metal. It had to do with the metal that shadow dragon's couldn't past through. The man who was hunting him had armor of that metal and a way to make himself invisible. Not only could Kaage not pass through that metal, but it distorted his dragon vision as well. The man could be invisible to Kaage on both visions!</span></div></div>",

It would be wise to lie,</i>\" William concluded quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where the dragon calls home.  I'm not lying,\" Willaim said as the horse passed through some brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" came a voice.  \"Who comes here?\"  William saw a figure seem to appear from the shadows.  The horse stopped where it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Death to Darkness, Death to Monsters.  Praise the Light,\" spoke the man.  The guard nodded and seemed to vanish once more.  The horse continued onward into the middle of an small open area.  a small number of one-man tents were circling about a fire.  A tall, thin man looked up from the fire at the arrivals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, we were getting worried,\" the man said, \"We checked the surrounding villages and no word.\"  The man looked behind his Captain and saw William.  \"A recruit?\" the man asked skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Nicholas, a man with information.  He claims to know our target's location,\" the Captain said, getting off the horse.  William felt the raines of the horse land near him.  The man looked to another direction.  \"Abel, if he tries stealing my horse, shoot him in the arm.  We need to hear what he has to say.\"  Willaim looked at his \"savior\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I will be free if I tell you this information?\" William asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As free as a wanted man can be,\" the Captain said with a tone of disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain?  He's a criminal?\" Nicholas, and second in command asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The king of these lands sides with cloud dragons and claims he's a traitor,\" the Captain said darkly.  The tension in the air rose.  The Captain looked at William once more.  \"Now, the information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dragon lives near the Cloud Dragons in the northern mountains,\" Willaim said, \"In all likelihood inside the human city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" came from some men.  Others speaking of the city they felt might need clensing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know this how?\" the Captian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ones who brought the Cloud Dragons to the court to show I am a 'traitor' was the lord of that land and the dragon you seek,\" William said.  A moment of silence came upon the slayers.  But before he could react, Willaim felt a rope slip around his neck and he was hoisted off the horse, dangling in mid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dragon I wanted was right above me and you made me leave its location?!\" the Captian asked darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No . .  They left . . before you came. . . .\" William breathed out.  Darkness was filling Lord William's vision as the Captain looked at the hanging man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage was kneeling before King Albert and Lord Adam.  His face was contorted with contained rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could not find them,\" Kaage said.  Behind him, Dracus' mighty head blocked the entranceway and Rathnait was near Felix and Ashley.  \"But I know who took William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who took the traitor?\" King Albert asked, angry at this escape as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first human I hated enough to kill with my own claws,\" Kaage said darkly, \"The man after me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why did he save William?\" King Albert asked, \"If he was in the castle, why not attack you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps he was unaware of Kaage's presence.  It is well known William has had dealings with dragons.  If they're looking for information, they probably sought him out.  And the price was his freedom,\" Lord Adam said, \"William is not a complete fool and would have used the chance to escape.\"  King Albert nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what would be the wisest course of action we take?\" King Albert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, is everyone packed up?\" the Captain asked.

They were also giving William some spare light armor made from the specific metal that kept them invisible to shadow dragons. \"We're bringing him with us,\" the Captain told is comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, this man is sneaky and I don't think he should be trusted. We should have just killed him right then and there,\" Nicholas replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave my word that if he gives me good information, I'd free him,\" the Captain informed Nicholas, \"He may have told us where the demon dragon lives. If we kill him and find out that he wasn't lying, then I would have broken my word for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we get there and it turns out he's lying?\" Nicholas questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll demand that he tell us better information or we'll kill him. It's as simple is that,\" the Captain replied, \"But I have a feeling he isn't lying. He's is wrongly a fugitive and desperately needs are help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think he was wrongly accused?\" Nicholas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain explained, \"He used to be a lord, but cloud dragons attacked him and another lord, a man who seems to have some sort of pact with these cloud dragons, took all his servants away and replaced the lord with another ruler. Now the King calls this man a traitor for trying to tame one of those beasts. I wouldn't think of trying to train a dragon, since I would never be able to trust such a monster. However, dragons are just animals and if that can be successfully tamed, than they should. It would be one less dragon to kill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, he was trying to train a dragon, probably one of the cloud dragons which was why the cloud dragons attacked him. However, how can the other lord have a pact with the dragons?\" Nicholas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the lord and a few others in the town are being possessed. This town we speak of is where the shadow dragon supposedly lives. Maybe they even got to the King,\" the captain answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going to have to cleanse this town as well?\" Nicholas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if we have to in order to kill the shadow dragon. Remember, our mission is the shadow dragon and nothing else at this moment. We may have to send word to the elders and others will probably be given such a mission,\" the Captain informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are so many crazy things happening right now. A cloud dragon clan may or may not be possessing a whole town of humans which have attacked this man for taking one of their own and trying to tame it and now the King here is siding with the cloud dragons and the town. Now this former lord says that our shadow dragon just so happens to live in the town that had ruined his lordship,\" Nicholas stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how it sounds, but I think he's telling the truth,\" the Captain replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is another side to those who are desperate,\" Nicholas pointed out, \"You said this man was desperate. How desperate is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will keep an eye on him, but he is not to be harmed unless there is reason to harm him. We are monster slayers, not murderers. We only kill humans if it is self defense or if there is reason to do so, such as possessions. Though he had lied to me and didn't tell me the whole truth until I got him out of that cell, he hasn't shown any signs of lying now,\" the Captain explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will keep an eye on him, though,\" Nicholas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at King Albert's Castle, Kaage and the others try thinking of a plan...</span></div></div>",

An even greater number are born blind, but they can all see be sensing the slightest vibrations in the Earth. They can not breath fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The main problem will be finding them,\" Dracus continued, \"They are live deep in the Earth and live together as a pack. However, they are reclusive of the rest of the world. Their reclusive nature is another problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we might not convince them to fight?\" Arik questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are not as passive in nature as Forest dragons, but Earth dragons don't like to be involved with other people's problems. They like to keep to themselves and to their own community. This could make it troublesome to have them fight for you to stop the slayers,\" Dracus answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be some way of convincing them?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage, who had been silent for the longest time, spoke up. \"Is there a human town near the canyons?\" he asked the King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's how rumors of Earth dragons started,\" King Albert answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe be can convince the Earth dragons to see that human town as a part of their community,\" Kaage suggested, \"Despite their reclusive nature, they are almost as peaceful as forest dragons and don't harm humans unless needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how do we convince Earth dragons to view humans as part of their community?\" Dracus questioned in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but think about it. If we could do that, they'll realize that the human town is part of a bigger human community, and they'd become part of that on their own branch. They will feel the need to help any of those branching communities if they need help. They will want to help Lord Adam's home and city from these slayers,\" Kaage explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He only problem is convincing them in the first place to see that town as part of their community,\" Dracus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still worth trying, isn't it?\" Kaage said.</span></div></div>",

Part of his reluctance on the matter was a dislike of asking for aide from other dragons he did not know, without even consulting his clan first.

Dracus pulled his head out of the doorway so Rathnait could exit with Felix and Ashley.  Lord Adam and Kaage were the last ones to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way are we headed?\" Dracus asked as he watched Kaage shift into his dragon form and Lord Adam mounted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw the map.  I'll lead,\" Kaage said.  Dracus nodded and soon the three dragons were off into the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not a long trip to the southern canyons where the earth dragons were said to live.  The three dragons pressed on through the night and through the morning, finally seeing the canyons around midday.  Close to a mile away was a human village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's land and find out what we can from the village first,\" Lord Adam suggested to Kaage.  He nodded and landed several hundred feet from the village.  Dracus and Rathnait followed soon after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of three dragons flying and landing near the village was unseen by many of the villagers, causing many to raise the alarms and called for the local guards to defend the village.  Though many felt a small ban of forty men against three powerful monsters would not likely survive.  When they saw humans around the dragons, the captain of the men, Captain Peter, moved a head of his men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there!  What is your reason for coming here?\" he called out.  One man looked at him, and began closing the distance between them.  The other two humans stayed near the dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Adam stopped about twenty feet from the captain.  \"I am Lord Adam from the northern ranges,\" Lord Adam said, \"I come on a mission from the King.\"  Captain Peter was visibly shocked.  He had heard rumors of the Dragon Lord, as some called him.  A man capable of taming the wild dragons in the north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He has come for those ones in the canyons?</i> Peter thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Captain Peter.

What can you tell me?\" Lord Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one has seen one alive, but we have seen trails and other signs,\" Captain Peter replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of signs?\" Lord Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, about six months ago, we were under attack by a small band of kobolds,\" Peter replied.  Adam nodded, knowing about the little creatures that stood close to three feet tall and were vicious scavengers and raiders.  One had to be sure to kill them all or they would come back in time.  \"But one day, the raids stopped.  A scout told me he found their nest, destroyed by rock that seemed to come straight from the ground up.  He also found dragon foot prints in the region.  My guess is the little devils attacked the dragons and they responded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But have you ever had any trouble from them?\" Lord Adam asked.  Captain Peter shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they have never bothered us, or even the traders who come through the canyons,\" Captain Peter replied.

He had heard rumors about Lord Adam being able to train dragons. If Lord Adam wanted to find the earth dragons and gain control of them like he did with the cloud dragons, who know why he wanted them. Captain Peter noticed the black dragon among the three dragons and assumed that Lord Adam had trained other species of dragons as well. He wondered why Lord Adam would need such power. If he was anything like the former Lord William, then what could all this mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Peter's mind was swarming with thoughts and concerns of danger as he waited for Lord Adam's answer. Lord Adam must have seen the concern, because he replied, \"What have you heard about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only rumors about you being able to tame dragons,\" Captain Peter answered. He didn't tell Lord Adam of the more sinister rumors of what Lord Adam could want from training dragons or how he was able to tame them. \"Is that what you want to do with the earth dragons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need their help,\" Lord Adam stated, \"There are some highly skilled monster slayers heading to my town wanting to kill a friend and they are ruthless and would kill anyone who gets in their way. Having earth dragons on our side would catch them by surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do monster slayers want to kill a friend of yours?\" Captain Peter interrogated. He wondered if the slayers had good reason to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend is a shadow dragon. They fear that shadow dragons are demon, based upon their looks. They thought that the shadow dragon possessed a human. They don't understand what a magical bond is and thinks it is evil,\" Lord Adam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you bonded with that shadow dragon?\" Captain Peter questioned, wondering if that's how Lord Adam was able to tame dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but he was bonded with a human he viewed as his brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want to tame the earth dragons to protect the shadow dragon. You don't have some other intentions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you're worry, but I have no evil intentions in using the dragons for power. As for taming dragons, you would find that is quiet impossible to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of their ferocity?\" Captain Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, because dragons are just as sentient as humans,\" Lord Adam informed the captain, \"Some have the ability to speak human. All they have to do is learn the words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Peter was completely surprised by this revelation. \"Dragons are sentient?\" Captain Peter gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's how my father long ago and my grandfather were able to make peace with the cloud dragons of the mountains,\" Lord Adam explained, \"We were able to make a treaty with them. We agreed to never house monster hunters and they in turn would not attack us and help us whenever we were in dire need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't think the cloud dragons are enough this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese hunters are skilled from what I've been told. They will know about the cloud dragons and will be prepared for the shadow dragon as well as any cloud dragon that should choose to fight. They wouldn't be expecting earth dragons,\" Lord Adam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you plan on getting their help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth dragons are communal creatures and live in packs deep underground. They are reclusive in a sense that they only keep to their own pack or other Earth dragon pacts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why they haven't ever bothered us?\" Captain Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don't bother those sentient being outside of their own pack. They believe the we'll leave you alone if you leave me alone theory. Since you're town and the merchants have never bothered them, they've pretty much ignored your town, but this makes it difficult to get them to help. They're not going to help us if they see us as outsiders,\" Lord Adam informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you plan to get their help then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to try and get the earth dragons to see your town as part of their community,\" Lord Adam explained, \"If we can do that, we can make peace with your town and the earth dragons, even if nothing violent has ever happened between you two. If they see you town as part of their community they would have to veiw the rest of the human kingdom as such too because how our community works and will have to come to my town's aid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Peter was blown away by Lord Adam's words. It was shocking enough to hear that dragons were actually sentient, but now, Lord Adam planned to make peace with the earth dragons and their small town. As Captain Peter thought about everything that had just been revealed to him, Lord Adam asked, \"Where is your lord? Since this plan is going to have an affect on your town, your leader should have some say in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have a lord in this small village,\" Captain Peter explained, \"But if you're looking for the leader of this village, it would probably be me. I act as the mayor and Captain of the guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do you accept this plan?\" Lord Adam asked.</span></div></div>",

Though they have never attacked us, there have been frightened citizens in our village. If we can make a treaty like you have done with the cloud dragons, then those people won't have to be so frightened all the time. It should bring relief to our village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good,\" Lord Adam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough I do have one condition,\" Captain Peter told Lord Adam, \"I wish to come alone on your journey to find the earth dragons. I will have to explain to the village and calm them down first, though. Three large dragons landing so close to our village have scared many people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Lord Adam replied, \"I will wait for you by the dragons.\" Lord Adam walked back to the three dragons while Captain Peter walked back into the village with his men and explained the situation to the village. Luckily, everyone in the village was pretty much gathered because of the shocking sight of three large dragons landing near their village. Lord Adam explained the situation to the five others who were waiting anxiously as Lord Adam had talked to the Captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who\u2019s going to be expected to fly him?\" Dracus questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is a concern for you, Dracus, because of him being a strange, he can ride on my back,\" Kaage informed the larger dragon. Though Dracus was a more accepting dragon when it comes to flying humans compared to other cloud dragons, Dracus was still a prideful creature and didn't want to fly humans he didn't know, fearing they would see him as just some mindless beast of burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Peter eventually arrived. Captain was clearly nervous as he walked slower towards them when he got closer. Lord Adam was the one who introduced Captain Peter to everyone. \"This is Dracus, a trusted friend of my father.\" Dracus nodded his head in a very small bow. \"And this is his daughter Rathnait,\" Lord Adam continued, \"My daughter Ashley and my adopted, but still loved son, Felix. Felix and Rathnait are bonded. Felix and Ashley waved as Rathnait gave a small bow. Captain Peter waved back. \"And finally, this is Felix's \"Uncle\" Kaage,\" Lord Adam explained, \"It's a long story, but Felix's father was the one who was bonded with Kaage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure meeting you,\" Kaage greeted kindly as he bowed slightly, \"I will be the one giving you a ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're flying?\" Captain Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the quickest way to travel,\" Lord Adam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: They have troubles finding the earth dragons and the earth dragons don't reveal themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The earth dragons find them, because it seems odd to them that two cloud dragons and a shadow dragon should enter the valley. They send some dragons to investigate.</span></div></div>",

Kaage chuckled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes more than the force you are using to hurt my skin,\" Kaage noted.  Soon, the three dragons were off into the sky.  It was a short flight to the edge of the canyon, so they didn't go very high into the sky, or very fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should announce ourselves before entering,\" Dracus noted to Kaage, who nodded his head.  As they reached the threshold of the canyon, the three dragons landed softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Dracus?\" Peter asked, looking at the larger dragon.  But before an answer was made, the three dragons released three distinct roars, echoing into the canyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The canyon is the Earth Dragon's home,\" Felix answered, \"It is not wise for dragons to enter another dragon's domain without a call first.\"  Peter nodded, understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we find them, Captain Peter, the onus of making them see the town as part of their land falls on you,\" Kaage noted, \"You are the one who has lived closest to them and would know things we don't that can tip their views.\"  Captain Peter gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" he said before the three dragons walked into the canyon, \"Umm there's a cave entrance we believe was made by them about a three miles into the canyon.  If we go straight, you'll find it easily.\"  Kaage thanked him for the directions and led the group into the canyon.  Rathnait followed behind, with Dracus taking up the rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe calls echoed far and deep into the canyon.  Sentries near the surface heard the announcement and called further down to the three elders.  It had been many years since three dragons entered their domain, this they knew.  Talk was spurred by this fact, as well as what one called a challenge of land.  It was from the one who identified himself as a Shadow dragon.  Heads turned to the youngest Elder, who in her earlier years had met one of the reclusive Shadow dragons.  It was decided she would go forth with some sentries and meet those entering their domain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragons moved cautiously in the canyon, not wanting to miss and sign of being watched.  Rathnait thought back long ago when she first heard of Earth Dragons, and their immense size compared to even Cloud dragons.  These thoughts were shared with Felix and it was clear these were beings who would be found only if they wanted to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Captain Peter called out, as they reached a cave's entrance that was even larger than the cave Dracus and Rathnait called home.  But before they could enter, rocks on the path ahead erupted upwards and as Dracus quickly turned, he saw the path they came by was also blocked.  A soft voice came from the opening in the cave.  None of the humans could fully understand it, but Felix was able to pick up a few words, namely \"Enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Lord Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Earth Dragons wish to enter and state our business,\" Dracus commented, \"It was a different dialect from our language, but I can translate, if need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can I,\" Kaage noted before leading them in.  The group soon stopped once more as three gigantic forms appeared.  Each one was covered in dark brown and red scales, nearly making them invisible to the humans.  Peter wondered if there was a chance he walked right next to one of these dragons and never realized it.  The faces here stouter than a Cloud Dragon's, but still they took up much space in the cave.  The middle one spoke in a dragon tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She wants us to tell her why we, may father, Kaage and I are here,</i> Rathnait told Felix by their bond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage responded, explaining why, looking up at the eyes, noting they were not the same color: the right was dark green, like the other two dragons', but her left was half-white.  The Elder said nothing for a moment, before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Captain Peter, she wants you off me to give your argument,\" Kaage said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"why?\" Peter asked, looking up at the titans, and this was still being forty feet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can sense vibrations in the earth.  They will probably use it to see if you are lying,\" Kaage noted, \"So be honest.\"  Peter nodded and slowly climbed off Kaage.  He moved in front of the Shadow dragon and cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Captain Peter from the human village outside the canyon,\" he started, \"I am here to first thank you for protecting our lands.\"  Kaage translated.  The elder responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They want to know why it's both their land and yours.  The canyon is theirs, not yours,\" Kaage noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we have helped each other in the past.  We are both surviving from the same ground and seek to protect it from harm,\" Captain Peter said.  The elder considered the words.  Her response was short and the Captain guessed it without Kaage telling him. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First the kobolds were a problem to both of our people and we aimed to remove the threat,\" Peter answered, \"Also, while you let humans to pass through your lands, we have never sought you out directly.  We protected you from being known to the world.\"  A few moments passed and a reply came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What concern is other humans knowing of us yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have never done us harm or evil,\" Peter responded, \"In return, we didn't want people coming looking for you, because of your help to us.  Not just the kobolds, though, ten years ago, I was part of a group that hunted down some trolls in south.  We found an egg shell far to large to be from anything smaller than a dragon.\"  When the elder heard this claim, she thought back to a young mother' eggs were destroyed by trolls, but they were dead by the time a sentry found their lair.  \"We also encourage merchants coming through the canyons to not venture in because of unstable caves, so they fear being trapped in a cave and die.  We dismiss any sign they think might have come from you, saying they are mistaken, or send our parties that purposefully fail to find anything.\"  The elder said nothing for a minute.  She finally responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You claim we are allies?\" Kaage said before adding, \"And she means not just friends, but war allies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Peter answered firmly, \"What do you say?\"  The Elder dragon was silent once more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a long silence as the large female elder Earth dragon thought to herself about the human's claim. It was strange for her to consider a creature of a different species, especially a human, as an ally. However, she did not sense any lies from the human. The human was telling the truth or at least it thought it was telling the truth, unless the human is a perfect liar. However, the elder female doubted that. She was one of the best of the elders to be able to detect lies and many of the things the human had said made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can consider these humans as allies. Their village has been on the edge of our territory for a long time now and we have lived near each other in peace ever since. Neither of our races bothered each other, and if this human's claims are true then... just maybe... we can consider them allies and wouldn't have to worry about them ever again,\" the female elder wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female elder continued her thoughts, \"I know the humans have never tried to attack us, but others dragons in this community, especially the older ones, tend to fear the humans will. Some can get paranoid. Probably why our race tend to keep to our race of dragons and not many others. If we consider these humans as allies, maybe that paranoia of humans will cease. However, I'm not sure if the other elders will like that. I'm the youngest of the elders. The rest are much older and tend to be less open of the idea of accepting others into the community.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female elder sighed and finally gave the three dragon and three human newcomers an answer. Kaage translated for Captain Peter which he had been doing for the whole conversation, \"I cannot give you a certain answer, because I am not the only one who has to make that decision. I am an elder, but there are more elders than just me and they have an equal say in the matter. Considering weather you're an ally or not is a very important decision that all the elders in this community has to consider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, do we have to talk to the rest of the elders as well?\" Captain Peter questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I don't think we can just bring you and your group into our community to see them,\" the female elder explained as Kaage translated. The female elder turned to one of her allies and told him to go back to the elders and tell them everything that has occurred. She also told him to ask for their permission to bring the travelers to them and then come back. The male dragon nodded and left to seek the elders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Earth dragon Elder, I know that the other elders have make a decision before me and my village can be considered allies or not, but what is your decision, if I may ask?\" Captain Peter asked. It was a bold question to ask and Captain Peter didn't realize it until he asked it. Captain Peter stood still and quivered a little more in fear as he stood in front of Kaage and stared up at the Earth dragon the put Kaage's size to shame and was even larger than the male cloud dragon Dracus. Captain Peter had been fearful of the Earth dragon ever since he saw them and had to stand his ground before them. He was lucky that he had been able to keep his calm among them. However, his fear increased in fear that he had offended the Earth dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bold question, but when the female elder could feel the human's fear from the vibrations in the earth, the elder knew that he realized the mistake he had made. However, the female dragon wasn't that all offended by the question, at least, definitely not as offended as another elder would have been. Though the human's question did sound like a demand, the elder knew that it was meant to be more of an inquiry. \"Do not be frightened, human; I am not offended by the question. However, you definitely should be more careful with what you say if you are to meet the other elders,\" the female elder warned, \"If you wish to know what I think, I think that you and your village could be considered an ally, but I have no idea how the other elders will see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Peter smiled with relief and the female elder smiled. \"I've never really introduced myself. My name is Elder Ujana,\" the female elder stated.  </span></div></div>",

He and Frewen were traveling soon after their mother passed on.  They had come to this canyon on the other side and entered.  They explored one of the caves, not knowing it was Earth Dragon territory.  As they opened a path hidden by some loose rocks, a sentry appeared, confronting them.  Once explanations were given and Kaage and Frewen said they would leave soon, the sentry did not pursue them.  But she did give her name should they visit again.  \"Were you the sentry I met many years ago?\" Kaage asked in dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUjana looked at the small shadow dragon.  \"You had a human with you, Frewen, correct?\" Ujana asked.  Kaage nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations on becoming an Elder,\" Kaage responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Ujana said, glancing at the tiny humans.  \"Where is your bond-mate?\"  Kaage said nothing for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was murdered by evil humans who did not understand our connection,\" Kaage answered, \"I know of no curse in Dragon or tongues of Man to say the depths of my hatred for them.\"  Ujana said nothing in response.  The communal hatred to the trolls who attacked a nest, killing the young, was massive and shook the earth they stood on.  That same type of hatred flickered in Kaaage's eyes when he spoke of those humans just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Peter stiffened up when Kaage and Ujana began speaking.  \"What's going on?\" he asked, looking around.  Felix was quick to look at Rathnait and she translated by their bond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems they knew each other a long time ago,\" Felix answered.  \"She met my father as well.  She asked what happened to him and Kaage spoke briefly of the men we are preparing to fight.\"  Peter nodded, happy it was nothing against their current action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumble echoed in the cave, making all dragons pay attention.  Ujana nodded.  She began speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be allowed to come further in to make the claim before the other Elders,\" she said as Kaage translated.  She turned her massive body around and moved to one wall, opening it for them to travel through.  Peter quickly got on Kaage and the group followed Ujana with the other sentry taking up the rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey traveled in darkness, with only the dragons seeing through the darkness.  Felix felt Ashley tighten her grip around his waist in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they came to a large chamber where two dragons, slightly larger than Ujana, were waiting.  Above them was a large glowing crystal.  This chamber was an ante-chamber to where the dragons generally lived, unless they were giving birth and used places outside the domain.  Dracus saw quickly both of these Elders were very old, far older than even he or Kaage were.  They glared down at the group.  One finally spoke.  He was the oldest of the three Elders, Elder Kathmor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You claim we are war allies?  Despite us never making contact before?\" Kaage translated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Peter responded, \"We both fight and seek what is best for this canyon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Kathmor responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I told Elder Ujana, we do not seek your harm or removal from this canyon,\" Peter answered, \"If we sought to use you for our gain, we would have called on slayers to kill you to use your remains as trade items or weapons.  But we have not.  We benefit from each other.\"  Kathmor let out a low growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still find this hard to accept,\" Kathmor responded.  He glared at Ujana then to the other Elder.</span></div></div>",

Bring them in as soon as they arrive. They need not too wait any longer than need be.\" The guard bowed his headed and departed through the massive doors which were the entrance to the throne room. King Albert seated himself once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack out in the yard, Lord Adam, Felix, Ashley, and Kaage were out of the carriage and Dracus and Rathnait were preparing to land. The wind picked up as the two dragons started their decent, yet everything in the yard managed to maintain its place, however, all apart from Kaage had to brace themselves to prevent from being blown over. Once Rathnait and Dracus had landed and the wind had ceased, Felix made his way over to Rathnait closely followed by Ashley. Lord Adam and Kaage made their way over to Dracus. Presumably to further discuss what could happen in this audience with King Albert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going to have to contain ourselves, Rathnait. I hope you understand how important it is that we do.\u201d Felix explained. Rathnait growled at the thought of knowing that William may possibly be in the same room as her and Felix and that she couldn\u2019t tear him limb from limb, as she so wished she could for what that menace did. But she understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will control myself.\u201d Rathnait replied, slowly trying to calm down. Both Felix and Rathnait still found it difficult to contain their anger and each could sense it in the other. Ashley could see this in their faces, it began to worry her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease. Please remember that there is still the chance that he won\u2019t be here.\u201d Ashley tried to reassure. It seemed to work as Felix and Rathnait quietened down and then looked at her. Ashley began to fear that she had just said something she shouldn\u2019t have. Like they wanted to believe William was in there. They wanted to believe that he could be struck down there and then, without any consequences. All those thoughts melted away when Ashley saw the smile across Rathnait\u2019s and Felix\u2019s face. She couldn\u2019t help but smile too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will address the king and raise our claim. We will explain to King Albert that dragons do have intelligence and that we have not \u2018tamed\u2019 the Cloud Dragons-\u201d Dracus growled at the word \u2018tamed\u2019, \u201c- it is that we have a contract.\u201d Lord Adam revealed a scroll. Kaage remained quiet throughout the explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is then my understanding that if all goes well; we are to be called around so that my daughter is able to explain about what this evil man had done to her.\u201d Dracus recalled. Rathnait would not be happy that she would have to explain her time in capture, but she had made it obvious that preventing William from getting back into power was more important to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct.\u201d Lord Adam replied. A guard walked out of the castle and addressed everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKing Albert will see you now. You may come in when you are ready.\u201d With that, he returned to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Adam walked over to the castle, closely followed by Kaage. Felix turned to Rathnait, who gave him a quick nuzzle, and Felix then began to move towards the castle.

It is good to hear from your family again.\u201d King Albert made his pleasantries known with a smile across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is good to see you again too, my king.\u201d Lord Adam returned the welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI and your father were good allies Adam. And he was a good friend to me, especially when I needed him most.\u201d King Albert stated. Felix had a sudden flash of Rathnait through his mind. Felix understood what the king meant and how he would have felt. \u201cBut you are here on business now. So let\u2019s get down to it, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, if we could please.\u201d Lord Adam stepped forward.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, my king, like I have said, the Cloud Dragons outside our village do have a high level of intelligence. If it was not thanks to the Cloud Dragons, then you would never have met my father, as I\u2019m sure he had explained.\u201d Lord Adam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, he did say. He was lost when he was young and the dragons guided him back home. Is that correct?\u201d King Albert questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes my king. It is because of that kind deed, that the Cloud Dragons delivered, that we signed a contract.\u201d Lord Adam pulled out the parchment on which the contract had been written. \u201cThis is the original contract on which has the Cloud Dragons and our signatures. It states that we do not allow any slayers, or people as such, to use our village as a base. Also, any crimes committed against the Cloud Dragons whilst inside our walls will have severe punishments. Or else be left to the mercy of the dragons. The Cloud Dragons have accepted that whatever punishment we give is it, and no further action will be taken on their half. So, although our punishments are severe, they are nothing compared to what the Cloud Dragons would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Albert listened with great interest. He listened and understood what was being said.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd in return, my king,\u201d Lord Adam continued, \u201cThe Cloud Dragons agree to help our village in times of need. May that be when we need resources or protection. The Cloud Dragons understood the terms, and accepted them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I see that contract?\u201d King Albert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly my king. That is why we brought it with us.\u201d Lord Adam replied as he handed the parchment over to the king, who then proceeded to read it. \u201cThe Cloud Dragons have not been tamed by us. Nor would they allow themselves to be tamed. They are too proud a race.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix felt as if a great weight had been lifted of his shoulders. <i>\u201dIt is such a relief the William is not here. This meeting is going a lot easier than if he were here.\u201d</i> Felix could feel Rathnait calm down through his bond with her. There was no need to be worried about causing a spectacle in front of the king now, as what might have caused it is not here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, what of this attack on William\u2019s castle? What was the cause behind that?\u201d King Albert questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy king, that had nothing to do with the village. A family from the Cloud Dragons came to the village in need of help. Due to the contract, we were obliged to. An infant of the family had gone missing and we were asked to help discover what we could about the disappearance.\u201d King Albert nodded in acceptance. \u201cWe caught word of, at the time; Lord William had captured a dragon infant. We passed on the message to the Cloud Dragons.\u201d Lord Adam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had heard of that myself. I understand that the dragons at that time would have gone to save their young. Therefore, would have gone through any lengths to do so.\u201d King Albert interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct. But at first, only one went to help. It is very unpleasant for a Cloud Dragon to be caught because of their pride. So I will not state which one.\u201d King Albert accepted this once more. \u201cSo, when things went wrong, there was only one thing that was left to do in that situation.\u201d Lord Adam commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Call of Duty.\u201d King Albert seemed to fade out of himself. He even gave a small laugh to himself. Felix noticed that King Albert seemed to know quite a bit about Dragons and their ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy king.\u201d Felix stepped forward and got down on one knee to bow. Both the eyes of Lord Adam and King Albert turned to him. Ashley was in shock that he addressed the king. Felix got up and looked at the king. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me saying King Albert, you know quite a lot about dragons and their ways, don\u2019t you?\u201d All King Albert could do is chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are indeed correct there. I know quite a bit. I have had my time with dragons. More than one species as well.\u201d All looked quite shocked. \u201cI even know so much to know that your friend over there,\u201d King Albert pointed over to Kaage, who had remained silent and still the entire time, \u201cI know enough to know, he is a Shadow Dragon. Am I not mistaken?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage looked up at the king. Lord Adam, Felix and Ashley couldn\u2019t believe that King Albert had managed to see through Kaage\u2019s human form. \u201cYou are correct, my king.\u201d Kaage said in a calm voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy maintain human form?\u201d King Albert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I think of myself as more of a human than I do a dragon.\u201d Kaage replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s a new one.\u201d King Albert said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is another story for another time. Right now we still have business to attend to.\u201d Kaage stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat we do.\u201d King Albert settled back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy king,\u201d Felix had spoken up again. \u201cCan I ask as to, why you have granted William an audience, when you already knew that his claims about the Cloud Dragons being tamed were false, and that as and when he caught an infant Cloud Dragon, that it would provoke an attack from the Clan?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause, my dear boy, one knows more when one does not.\u201d King Albert said. He could see the confused looks on everyone\u2019s faces. \u201cLet me explain, by granting him an audience with his claims of an unprovoked attack, if I seem to not know anything, William will believe he can say what he wants, as long as he makes it convincing. At which time, I can compare what he says to what I already know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you wanted to discover if his word was a trustworthy one, and that he was a reliable person.\u201d Ashley claimed for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct, and your audience just reinforces my thoughts and knowledge. William will still be granted his audience, as up until know; all I have heard is rumours.\u201d King Albert stated. \u201cSo, Lord Adam, we have discussed the Cloud Dragons and your contract. We have also discussed as to what provoked the attack on William\u2019s castle. But I need to know what went on in the castle to get a fair idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that would be better heard from a former slave of his and the very Cloud Dragon that William captured and tortured.\u201d Lord Adam claimed. King Albert was stunned when the word \u201ctortured\u201d was mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stepped forward. \u201cShall I call Rathnait up now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have bonded with the dragon? Impressive.\u201d King Albert smiled at this. \u201cYes, please do call Rathnait up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Rathnait, you can come up now. There is a big enough balcony outside the throne room for you to land on. The king knows a lot about dragons, so he won\u2019t discard your word because you are a dragon.\u201d</i> Felix called out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon enough, he heard the familiar flap of wings of his bondmate, and he turned to see her land on the balcony. Rathnait looked at all of them in the room, before her eyes settled on the one she didn't recognize, King Albert. Remembering what Felix and his family had taught her and her father about royalty and other such human politics. She nodded towards him, the most she would do. As it was, this was going to be difficult to talk to, but anything to make sure William never rose to power again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are Rathnait...A pleasure to make your acquaintance.\" King Albert said as he stood up and walked over to her. He motioned for everyone to follow him. Felix took his spot next to Rathnait as the other's stood by. \"Yes, I am Rathnait. And you are King Albert.\" It wasn't a question, but King Albert nodded his head none the less as if it was. \"I am willing to hear out your story, Rathnait, of your time with young Felix here.\" King Albert said as he put his hand behind his back and looked at the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRathnait and Felix looked at each other and nodded to each other. They then went into detail of their time underneath William's cruel reign, and Felix went into even more detail about the various dark deeds that William did while he was just cleaning. After all, what lord would ever think that a slave would dare to rise up against them? Ones that were sure that said slave wouldn't of been able to befriend a so called savage beast and hatch a plan to escape together. Well, it was really more of a spur of the moment kind of things, but all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it seemed longer than what it really was, their tale only took an hour at most to tell. All the while, King Albert remained silent the whole time. He looked like he was contemplating things in his mind, as his eyes looked distant, and far.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m a human,\u201d Felix argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re in your human form. I made you forget your past life and you forgot that you are a dragon and believe you\u2019re a human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was in utter shock and couldn\u2019t think of anything to say. Could he really be a shadow dragon? There was much silence as everyone except Rhian and Kaage were in the same type of shock as Felix was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Felix thought of something to argue with. \u201cBut dragons age differently than humans and I\u2019ve aged like a human,\u201d Felix argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been in you human form those five years of slavery. Your human form ages like a human till it reaches eighteen years old. You\u2019re really an infant dragon, but your human form aged like a normal ten year old human,\u201d Kaage explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix couldn\u2019t think of anymore arguments, and he didn\u2019t know if he wanted to. All his life he thought he was a human, but now he learned he was a dragon. He still didn\u2019t know if that was a good or bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I should start at the beginning,\u201d Kaage said, \u201cYour father and I was brothers from the same batch. We hatched out at the same time, so we were called the twins of the batch. We did everything together and we grew very close. When it was time to leave the cave, we stuck together, which was normal rare for shadow dragons.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was like this for two hundred years,\u201d Kaage continued, \u201cWe traveled the world together and stayed in caves for a few weeks, looking for the right one. Eventually, we found a perfect cave that had many deep passages. The only problem was it was very close to a human village. Initially, your father and I had different views about humans. I didn\u2019t want to go near them, but your father did. Frewen, your father, was always curious about humans. He would often become his human form and go to the village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would always warn him not to, because we had heard many tales of humans killing dragons just because they were dragons, but Frewen still went and made friends with the humans. He even brought me along eventually and showed me they weren\u2019t the evil creatures I thought they were. Of course I told them they were only being friendly to us because they thought we were humans,\u201d Kaage explained, \u201cAfter a few years and after most of the town trusted us, Frewen called a town meeting and revealed we were actually dragons. They thought it was a joke at first, but Frewen and I transformed into dragons before them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did they react?\u201d Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey were frightened at first, but we explained to them we were still the same people we befriended, it\u2019s just that we were dragons,\u201d Kaage answered, \u201cIt took a while, but the town realized we meant them no harm. Eventually, the whole town became our friends. We were invited to every party and celebration and we often helped them in our dragon forms when our human forms weren\u2019t adequate enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEventually, another dragon came to the scene, and her name was Isabel. She was your mother, Felix,\u201d Kaage told Felix, \u201cSince the town was already used to Frewen and me, she was accepted fairly quickly. She was also raised by humans when she was young. So, she treated humans with the same respect we did. Frewen and Isabel fell in love very quickly and eventually had you, Felix.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember the day you we born,\u201d Kaage reminisced, \u201cThe whole town came to see the hatching. You were frightened of the humans at first, but then you mother assured you that they would never harm you. You were even able to transform into your human form on the first day, which is remarkably rare. The whole town adored you and our family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut something terrible happened, didn\u2019t it,\u201d Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomehow, monster hunters got word of us. This group of hunters were terrible and evil people. They killed creatures just because they looked like monsters, it didn\u2019t matter to them if the creature was good or evil, just as long as it was different,\u201d Kaage sighed, \u201cThey overtook the town and started killing everyone just because they were friends with us. Frewen and I tried to stop them, but we were outmatched and Frewen died while I was severely wounded. Isabel and I were forced to run away with you, but they kept catching up to us. Isabel was the next to die, and I was forced to take care of you myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaage continued, \u201cI eventually realized they weren\u2019t going to stop and I needed to keep you away from me. They didn\u2019t know your human form and since it would age till it reached eighteen years old, it would be harder for them to recognize you. I had to erase you memory though so that you wouldn\u2019t remember you were a dragon and tried to find me. I\u2019m sorry, Felix, could you ever forgive me?\"</span></div></div>",

However when he looked closer at one of the mountains Felix noticed that a village was built right into the side of the mountain.<br>\r\n\u201cRathnait are we getting close to your clan\u2019s territory\u201d Felix shouted above the fierce winds<br>\r\n\u201cYes why?\u201d Rathnait asked as she craned her head to see what Felix was looking at, \u201coh I told you earlier that human village is allied with us, the leader of the village and my father go back many, many years\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u201d Felix replied feeling immediately stupid as he realized that it must have been the village that Rathnait mentioned earlier, suddenly a realization hit him \u201cYou said that your father and the leader of that village go way back, how so?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh well now that is an interesting story; one day father was out flying when suddenly he saw a little boy who looked like he was lost out in the mountains, not wanting to let the boy suffer he landed near him to see if he could offer assistance. At first the boy was terrified but father managed to communicate to him that he was not going to hurt him, once father got that established he then took the child back to his village.

The gryphon will be very useful to me when it realizes I'm its new master. Gryphons are strong and brave creatures who are very loyal to those who control it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you plan on controlling it?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same way I control everything,\" Lord William replied. Felix knew full well that meant that he would control it through abuse. Felix would have felt sorry for the gryphon if it wasn't such a terrifying creature. (Contrary to belief, gryphons are usually friendly to humans and protect humans from any danger that should arise. Gryphons only attack humans that are evil or that attack them first. If only Lord William would have known that treating a gryphon nicely would gain its loyalty more than treating it poorly and with cruelty.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beast is probably hungry from the long trip. Once it is chained up, you are to feed it,\" Lord William ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, just go in the cell and toss the food to it. As long as you stay out of its range, it can't attack you. It will be your job to keep it alive by feeding it and cleaning after it. If it should die before I have a chance to control it, it will be your head,\" Lord William told the slave before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix came back once the creature was supposedly chained to the ground. Felix was carrying a large bowl of water and another slave was carrying the deer for Felix. The guard opened started unlocking the human door for them. There were two doors to the cell, the large doors used to get the creature in the cell and the regular sized doors for humans to enter without worry of the creature trying to get through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was nervous and frightened as the guard tried to find the right key for the door. It felt like hours were passing to Felix and he didn't know if he wanted the hours to last longer or shorter. Once the door opened, the other slave, Jack, told Felix, \"Now, set the bowl near the ground and them I'll hand you the deer to toss in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to come in with me?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a nice kid and all, but I don't want to go near that creature. It's your job and I'm only required to help you carry the things you need,\" Jack stated. Felix became more scared now he would be alone in the cell with the creature. \"Don't worry, as long as you stay out of its range, it won't be able to kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long are the chains?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can only reach to the edge of light,\" the guard informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix took a deep breath and walked into the cell. The cell was fairly large, but it was impossible to see how big it really was, the only light available was the light that came from the barred circular window on the ceiling at least one hundred feet above the floor. The room was all made of stone and concrete and the only light was the circular light that came from the ceiling. Felix could hear strange sounds that were most likely coming from the gryphon, but he was too scared to look into the dark corner where it was coming from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix set the bowl on the ground and Jack handed him the dead deer. Felix nearly had to drag it across the room as he came closer to the light. The gryphon's eyes opened and a pair of eyes the size of his head were the only things Felix could see in the darkness. Felix was afraid of the gryphon and it took a great amount of effort for him to keep moving closer to the creature. Felix noticed that the eyes stayed where they were meaning it wasn't getting any closer to him. Felix was too frightened to realize that the gryphon was just as frightened of Felix as Felix was frightened of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix placed the deer in the light and quickly backed away. The eyes looked down at the deer before a talon-like hand came into the light and dragged the deer into the shadows. Felix could hear the gryphon eating the deer as Felix carried the large bowl of water to the light. When Felix set the bowl down, the griffin stopped eating and looked at the bowl and then at Felix. Before the griffin could do anything else, Felix had already bolted out of the room.</span></div></div>",

Felix continued to stay as far away from the gryphon as possible and only entered the light to set the food down. Felix also noticed that the gryphon stayed in the corner the entire time every time Felix entered the cell to feed it. When it came time to clean up the feces, the gryphon was sedated so that Felix could go around the entire cell and clean up. However, Felix never wandered near enough for the gryphon to reach out and grab him. He was still very much frightened of the gryphon even when it was asleep. Because of this, Felix had never seen how big the gryphon was or what it looked like for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was still too frightened of the gryphon to realize it, but the gryphon was afraid of Felix because Felix was a human. The guards and other humans that entered the cell would torture the gryphon and abuse it to try and make it do something the gryphon didn't want to do. The gryphon was only about six years old. As the gryphon stayed chained to the floor in its corner, it began to notice that one human was different from the others. It realized that Felix was the only human that entered that never harmed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the human would only feed the gryphon and fill its water. Each time the human came in, the gryphon began to grow more and more comfortable of the human. So much so, that it thought that if it approached the human, it might find comfort in the terrible nightmare it was in. So, one day, it decided not to just stay in the corner when the human visited with food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix entered the cell as usual with the door shutting behind him once the deer was in and Felix had the water jug as well to fill the water bowl. As usual, Felix walked up to the bowl to fill it. The bowl was always in the light. Felix stared at the giant eyes that were always watching him carefully. Felix knelt beside the bowl and began to pour the water in the bowl. Felix looked down slightly to see when the bowl would be full<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Felix looked again, he no longer saw eyes. Felix looked upward and saw a large bird head right above him, looking downwards. In that moment where Felix wasn't looking, the gryphon had got up and walked up to him without Felix even noticing!

It's black feathers, though ruffled, transitioned magnificently into fine black hair on the torso.  There was some sign of the change line, made more apparent because of how unclean the gryphon was from not bathing itself and the beatings.  But he did not notice this feature fully as he was focused on where the head was, and slowly tried moving back to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven gryphon looked at the small human and saw it shaking.  It took her a minute to realize this human was scared of her like she was of other humans.  She felt saddened by this, hoping the reason for it not hurting her was more than fear.  Carefully, she laid down before the human to try and make herself less intimidating.  Slowly she edged her head forward, trying to show she meant no harm to the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix saw the gryphon laid down before him and realized even lying down, the gryphon towered over Felix by a good foot, probably more.

He stared into those strange green black panther eyes. The eyes were as big as Felix's head. Hell, the gryphon's raven head was bigger than Felix's entire body. The gryphon's eyes were so sad. <i>\"Those eyes look so much like my own,\"</i> Felix realized, <i>\"But how? It's an animal. It shouldn't have the intelligence of a... or does it?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon continued to try and reach out for Felix. It's beak was already over Felix's legs, but the beak never came down to grab his legs and drag him into the darkness. The beak just kept stretching to Felix's chest which it couldn't reach. The gryphon made strange and very sad sounds that Felix couldn't describe. They made him feel very sad inside, however, and reminded him of his own sorrows and his own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix wasn't thinking straight and he did something that he would never have done in a right state of mind. Felix lifted his arm and started stretching his hand towards the gryphonn. The gryphon began stretching to Felix's hand and continued to make the strange noises. The gryphon was choking from the ring and the chains around its neck due to the stretching. So, Felix reached out his hand faster and touched the raven beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon wanted comfort form the human so desperately that it was choking itself to reach out to it. When the human began lifting its arm, the gryphon became excited and she continued to desperately fight against the chains for the human's hand. Eventually, the human placed his hand on her beak and she soon found comfort. The gryphon couldn't feel the hand on her beak, but she could see it on her beak and she began to know that there were some good humans out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon noticed that the human was still shaking slightly and it was still afraid. Yet, the human held its ground and stroked her beak. Hoping that the human would realize she meant it no harm soon, the gryphon placed her head on the ground in front of the human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the gryphon's head was on the ground and the gryphon's eyes were nearly level with Felix, Felix snapped out of his daze. He saw his hand was still on the gryphon's beak and he was kneeling by it. Felix became frightened once more when he saw his hand so close to the giant beak, and it caused him to shoot straight up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Felix took two steps backward, the gryphon made the sad sounds again. Felix stopped in his track and stared at the gryphon's eyes. To his surprise, the gryphon had tears watering from its eyes down its cheeks to the stone floor. Felix stood there in shock wondering what to do. <i>\"It doesn't want me to leave,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Because it wants you as its lunch,\"</i> another voice argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But, it had the perfect time to eat me when I was in a daze,\"</i> Felix reasoned, <i>\"It might want me just for company.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Do you hear yourself?\"</i> the other voice asked, <i>\"It's a giant beast. It doesn't have the intelligence like humans do. It can't be reasoned with, and it only sees you as a possible meal.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But if it's not like humans, then how can it cry, and why does it have the same kind of eyes as me?\"</i> Felix's heart questioned his brain. His brain couldn't think up a reason why the gryphon was crying and silence only followed the question. The only thing that broke the silence was the gryphon who was continuing to make the sad sounds that combined that of a cat and a bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't leave,\" the gryphon pleaded, \"You're the only human that seems to care about me. Please.\" The human obviously couldn't understand her words, but it was quiet possible the human understood the meaning due to her tone and emotion. Silence followed and the gryphon continued to let the tears fall from her face as the human looked to the doors and then back at the gryphon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the gryphon's utter amazement, the human started walking back to her head. It was the gryphon who was in shock this time as the human knelt beside her head and placed his hand in her cheek to stoke it. The gryphon began crying out of pure joy and closed its eyes while leaning her head slightly in the human's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stroked the smooth black feathers on the gryphon's cheek and he began to feel more comfortable around it as the seconds went by. The gryphon leaned its head closer, but Felix understood what it wanted. Felix had seen the gryphon's eyes when he had approached it. The gryphon had still been crying, but its eyes were filled with a happiness that Felix couldn't have imagined existed. The gryphon's eyes were closed at the moment and Felix knew the creature was crying from happiness. Felix hugged what he could of the place where the beak met and he continued to stroke the feather while doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Felix told the gryphon while hugging it, \"You just want someone to care about you. You want someone's comfort to escape the reality of what seems like a horrible nightmare. You want a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knew all to well what the gryphon was going through, because he had gone through it when he first arrived in the castle and he was still partially going through it. </span></div></div>",

He nodded indifferently, buying the story as Felix tried ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, aren't you going to feed the damn thing?\" the guard hollered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked and saw that the deer's corpse was still out of the gryphon's reach because it was at the opposite wall. \"Right, I was so scared that I forgot about the food,\" Felix told the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably why it didn't eat you, you're not large enough for a meal. It needs the deer to be full,\" the guard explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded and dragged the deer to the light. The gryphon didn't grab the deer till both the guard and Felix were out of the cell. Both he and the gryphon felt much better knowing they had a true friend in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few days, Felix spent as much of the feeding time holding the gryphon's head or stroking her body.  Both of which she enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He's so nice now.  He's so wonderful,\"</i> the gryphon thought, looking at her human caretaker as he was talking to her about what his day was like, but she didn't understand him just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was also surprised when he looked between the gryphon's hind legs and saw no outer genitals, realizing the \"he\" he had been referring the gryphon as in his mind was actually a \"she\".  Felix also noticed how difficult it was to leave the room as every day the gryphon would become sadder and sadder with each passing day.  This was because of the comfort received from Felix, the gryphon was seeing Felix as its close friend and was very loyal to Felix by now.</span></div></div>",

The feathers below and above its eyes were black as if it had a scar on each side, but that was just the shape the black feathers made. The beak was curved like more birds of prey and the hooked part of the upper beak was a beautiful silver color. The entire front half of the gryphon was a bird and its front legs were bird's legs with sharp talons. The feathers on its chest were a light brown, almost white, with black spots. It wings were folded to the side and where a darker brown but still light enougth to almost seem like a tan color and it had black spots on the wings there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the gryphon's head was the only thing in the light and Felix didn't really pay attention to the details. He didn't see a beautiful creature, only a giant monster that wished to eat him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon didn't really want to eat Felix. It only wanted comfort from the only human that didn't hurt it. However, the gryphon was starting to realize that the human feared him. <i>\"He's scared of me,\"</i> the gryphon realized, <i>\"Is that why he doesn't come near me and doesn't hurt me? Because he's afraid? Why is he afraid of me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human was right underneath the gryphon's head and the gryphon could have lowered his head fast and pluck the human up with its beak. The gryphon could stop the human from running away and bring it to the back with him, but what good would that do. It would just scare the human even more. However, the gryphon need comfort. He had been alone in the cell for weeks without his family and friends. The gryphon was sad, lonely, and hopeless. He needed just the littlest bit of hope to go on. He need someone to care about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon began lowering his head to pick the human up by its shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix fell backwards when he saw the gryphon's mouth open. He watched in horror was the opened beak began lowering itself to him. Felix was too frightened to run or move. <i>\"I should have brought the deer first.

Felix just picked up the large stone and tossed it at the gryphon's falcon head which was coming closer to Felix. Felix didn't aim his throw, but the gryphon's head was close enough that Felix didn't really have to aim. The stone hit the gryphon in the forehead with a loud thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon's head backed away quickly and Felix was too scared to move. Realization hit Felix as the gryphon looked back down at Felix. Felix had just hurt the gryphon and now it was going to kill Felix out of anger. Even though that may have been the obvious result if the gryphon had been grown up, the gryphon was still a toddler. It didn't become angry, it became sad. Tears formed in the gryphon's black eyes as some blood trickled down its gash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was confused by the gryphon's reaction and started to get up slowly. The gryphon suddenly began backing away from Felix as it whimpered and cried. Eventually, it was back in its corner and in the darkness, the gryphon began to cry. Felix began to hurry to the door till he heard the sobs of the gryphon. Felix turned and listened. The gryphon was actually crying! Those were real sobs that Felix knew all too well. <i>\"Why is it crying?\"</i> Felix wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Because you hit it in the head with a rock? Wouldn't you cry?\"</i> Felix began arguing with himself while wondering what he should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, I would have ripped a human apart if I was in the gryhpon's position,\"</i> Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But that gryphon didn't do that. Instead, it cried, like a child who had just been injured,\"</i> Felix pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That things too big to be a child, isn't it?\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How would you know? You don't know anything about creatures like gryphons. They could be very large creatures even as babies,\"</i> Felix still continued to argue with himself, <i>\"Did you notice the feathers?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix began recalling the feathers on the gryphon's head and realized there was something a miss. <i>\"It has the right coloring of a falcon, but its feathers are still fluffy as if it was a...\"</i> Felix began to realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"a toddler,\"</i> his thoughts of reasoning finished, <i>\"This thing must still be an infant. It would explain why it didn't attack when you attacked it and it would explain why it would back away, afraid of you even though it was clearly bigger than you.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But what do you propose I do? It tried to eat me,\"</i> Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Maybe this is your chance. You could make friends with the creature and...\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Are you serious? It tried to eat me!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Think about it, if you go back there and help it, you might be able to befriend it. It has been treated terribly by the guards and soldiers. You might be the only one acting kindly to it and it might see you as something other than food or an enemy. Plus, it might become useful later to have a gryphon as a friend. Lord William did say they were very loyal creatures.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix continued to argue with his thoughts for a little while longer so that he could understand all the reasons and possible outcomes and benefits to both options. It became clear that befriending a gryphon was something very useful even if it meant risking his own life. <i>\"If I'm going to do this, though, I'm bringing the deer with me. It's still hungry, after all,\"</i> Felix reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix took the deer and began dragging it into the darkness while carrying a lite torch he obtained from the wall were the only human exit was. As Felix got closer, he was able to see the gryphon's whole body for the first time. Its entire front was like a falcon's body, including falcon talons for front feet. It had the body of a four legged creature though and the front half was covered in feathers and two wings that folded to the side. The back half was a lion's body with the back paws and tail of a lion. The gryphon was curled up on the ground and Felix couldn't see the private area, but from the tip of the lion tail, he could tell it was a male because the dark furred tip was starting to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was surprised to see the gryphon actually cowering in the corner. It was afraid of him. Felix pushed the dead deer closer to the gryphon. The gryphon peeked out from its curled position and stared at Felix before looking at the dead deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why?\"</i> the gryphon questioned, <i>\"Why me? The first time I wonder alone, I'm taken by these horrible humans. And Daddy said humans were kind creatures. Why do they all hurt me? I did nothing wrong,\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon continued to remember how he had wondered alone by himself. He had seen a group of humans and gladly walked up to them. The gryphon's father had told him how humans were like them and intelligent creatures. The father of the gryphon had protected humans before, but never told his son of the evil humans, because not many humans came to the mountains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the gryphon was trapped in a cell with humans that tortured him for no apparent reason. <i>\"That human was the only one that seemed to care about me. My only hope for something more then this pain has hurt me like all the other humans. I don't understand. Daddy said that humans were good creatures.\"</i> the gryphon cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the gryphon heard something and peeked out. The human was back with the deer in front of it. The gryphon looked at the human and then the deer before...  </span></div></div>",

First, the human didn't seem to want to harm the gryphon, then the human threw the rock at him, and now the human didn't seem too hostile anymore. <i>\"What does he want?\"</i> the gryphon questioned, <i>\"Does he want to be mean to me like the other humans? Is this a trick?\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon was become scared of the one human that it used to think was it's only possible friend. But now, the human seemed to be like all the other humans. The gryphon kept as much distance from the human he could, yet he was already backed in the corner and if the human got any closer, the gryphon wouldn't be able to stop it or back away. Therefore, the gryphon stretched out is bird-like front paw and dragged the dead deer closer to it. The gryphon avoided anymore eye contact with the human and just ate the deer while still crying from both the pain and the loneliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix still had troubles believing the gryphon was actually crying even though he was seeing the gryphon cry right in front of him. Felix watched in disbelief as the gryphon ripped into the dead deer all while still sobbing uncontrollably. <i>\"Maybe this gryphon really is still a child,\"</i> Felix thought as he watched, <i>\"And if it really is a child, it must be frightened and lonely. I know my first week was scary, but this gryphon must have had it worse. It's constantly being tortured while I was only harmed when I failed to do something right. The gryphon is also living in this dark and dank cell with chains around its neck and back legs. The gryphon must be in a nightmare.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA certain realization came to Felix as he thought about his first weeks in the castle and as he thought about when the gryphon had reached out to him. <i>\"What if the gryphon wasn't trying to eat me after all. It must be sad and lonely down here. I'm the only human that comes in here that doesn't hurt it. It might have come up to me because I wasn't hurting it and it wanted comfort from this dark nightmare,\"</i> Felix thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix remembered the how lonely he was during his first months as a slave. He was five years old and he had no one to look after him or care about him. Everyone paid little attention to Felix unless he did something wrong in which case he would be punished. Felix had been lonely, he had no friends, no family, nothing except the clothes on his back. He was completely alone and he was still alone. Felix sighed, \"The gryphon is just alone and I threw a damn rock at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix watched the gryphon as it continued to rip the deer apart. Normally, Felix would have been afraid of the massive beast that was ripping a dead animal larger than Felix to shreds. However, due to the gryphon's tears which still continued to stream down its face, Felix felt sorry for the gryphon's predicament. Felix just couldn't leave the gryphon in such a state. Felix took a step forward, but the gryphon noticed it and quickly covered its face with both wings. The gryphon shivered and cried hard, obviously deadly frightened of Felix. <i>\"The gryphon's not going to let me near it. I have to think of a different way,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix devised a plan and quickly ran back to the bowl of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gryphon covered his face with his wings, he continued to say in his mind, <i>\"Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me I just want to go home. I just want Mommy and Daddy and even my sisters and brothers. Please don't hurt me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the gryphon's surprise, he heard rushed footfalls heading for the exit. The gryphon peaked from his wing and saw the human hurrying away. The gryphon sighed believing the human was leaving, but the human stopped at the water bowl, picked it up, and began walking to the gryphon once more. Not knowing what the human was planning, the gryphon backed up as close to the wall as possible and eyed the human carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix noticed the gryphon back up when he came back with the water and Felix couldn't blame the creature. \"It's alright,\" Felix tried assuring the gryphon, \"I'm only giving you the water.\" Felix had no idea if the gryphon could understand him, but he knew it was possible the gryphon could understand Felix's tone of voice, even dogs could do that. Felix just had to keep a calm and assuring voice and the gryphon would understand. \"It's alright,\" Felix repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix held the water bowl as far out in front of him as he could and the gryphon began to slowly edge forward. Felix approached slowly as well and set the bowl on the ground. The gryphon eventually placed its beak in the bowl and began drinking. Felix waited a long moment to try and let the gryphon get used to him, but eventually, he placed his hand on the gryphon's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon felt it and quickly backed away. Felix outstretched both arms and said calmly, \"It's alright. I'm not going to hurt you. Please, let me closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The gryphon lets Felix come closer and Felix comforts the gryphon. The gryphon knows human language because his father had taught him enough to get buy. However, the gryphon can't speak human because the gryphon has a beak and not a mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The gryphon doesn't understand human and it doesn't let Felix come closer just yet. </span></div></div>",

The gryphon didn't know every human word since it was only four years old. However, it knew enough to get buy. Unfortunately, the gryphon couldn't speak the human language, because it had a beak and no lips. The only way he'd be able to communicate was through telepathy, which was how his father talked to humans and how his father taught him. However, the gryphon was too young to be able to use the telepathy and didn't know how to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, let me come closer,\" the human said as he took another step forward with an outstretched hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon quickly shook its head. He knew it meant \"no\" and he hoped the human would back off once the gryphon shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was amazed when he saw the gryphon's head shake. <i>\"Did the gryphon just say no?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"Well, there's only one way to find out.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you understand me? You know what I'm saying?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon was still crying and shaking as it nodded its head quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know what I'm saying, why are you afraid of me? I told you I'm not going to hurt you. Don't you trust me?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon shook its head and Felix understood why. He had thrown a rock at its head. The gryphon has intelligence like a human, it must have really just wanted help from Felix and he threw a rock at it. Of course the gryphon would distrust Felix after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Felix willed the gryphon while showing his open hands, \"I have nothing that can hurt you. I want to help you. I'm sorry about throwing the rock at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon opened its eyes and looked at the hands of the human. The human didn't have a rock or any of the weapons that the guards used to hurt him. Yet, the gryphon was having troubles believing the human. The human had thrown a rock at him when he did nothing wrong. All the gryphon wanted was some comfort, because he was lonely, sad, and missed his family. He had no idea what he should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to hurt you, I promise,\" the human tried to assure the gryphon. The gryphon was surprised to hear the honesty in the human's voice as the human continued, \"I only threw the rock at you, because I thought you were going to eat me, but you weren't going to eat me, were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon shook his head. Of course he wasn't trying to eat a human. Human were people too and the gryphon would never eat a person, especially when his father had told him never to harm a human unless he had no other option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just scared and lonely here aren't you?\" the human asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon cried harder and nodded his head once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix felt guilty about throwing the rock and the fact that the gryphon was crying harder didn't help matters. Felix took a step forward again and reached out his hand farther. He wanted to help the gryphon any way he could and try to stop it from crying. The gryphon became scared again and Felix whispered, \"Please, let me try to help you. I'm sorry about what I did. Please, trust me. I won't hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon waited for a long moment with tears still wetting its cheek feathers. Felix stepped closer with an outstretched arm and he continued to get closer and closer to the gryphon's head in order to pet the gryphon and try to comfort it. However, it was obvious the gryphon was still afraid of Felix. Felix just hoped that the gryphon would let Felix closer enough to it for Felix to show it that he didn't mean it harm.</span></div></div>",

There was something strange about the human's eyes. The eyes were very different from the harmful humans. The gryphon felt more comfortable about trusting the human as he looked into his eyes. The griyphon decided to try and reach out to the human once again. The gryphon raised his head and inched it forward toward the human's hand. The human stayed where he was when the gryphon started reaching out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon was still nervous about the human's intentions and when the gryphon was only about a foot away from the hand, the gryphon stopped and hesitated. \"It's alright, just a little further,\" the human encouraged, \"I promise, I'm not going to hurt you. Just give me another chance to prove to you that I mean no harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause and the gryphon brought his head the rest of the way, and the human's hand touched his beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the gryphon began lifting its head towards Felix, Felix stood completely still, because he didn't want to scare the gryphon again.  He didn't want to spend the whole day convincing the gryphon. So, Felix kept still and waited for the gryphon to come to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the gryphon's head suddenly stopped when it was only about a foot of the way there. Felix kept his hand outstretched and looked into the gryphon's eyes. The gryphon's eyes were pure black, but somehow, Felix could still tell from the gryphon's eyes what it was feeling. He could see fear still in the gryphon's eyes as well as a deep sadness and loneliness that Felix had only seen in one other person, himself. The gryphon's eyes were filled with the same emotions Felix saw in his own eyes when he looked in a mirror: depression, sorrow, loneliness , hopelessness, and many other dark emotions that made life harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, just a little further,\" Felix encouraged the gryphon, \"I promise, I'm not going to hurt you. Just give me another chance to prove to you that I mean no harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon took a long pause before it suddenly shot its head forward. Felix didn't really have any time to react, one moment the gryphon was a foot away, the next moment the gryphon's smooth hooked upper beak was against Felix's palm. Felix was very still for a long moment as if the gryphon was suddenly going to try and gobble him up, but he calmed down when he felt the gryphon shaking in fear! Felix looked at the gryphon's eyes again, but the gryphon had its eyes closed tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stroked the beak while saying, \"Calm down, please. There's no need to cry right now. Everything alright at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, the gryphon still shivered and cried. <i>\"Poor thing, it's still frightened of me. I'm going to have to use a different tactic in order to calm the gryphon down,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon kept his eyes sealed shut. He didn't want the human to hurt him again. Yet, the gryphon was still willing to give the human a try, because he wanted a sort of release from the terrible nightmare he was in at the moment. The gryphon felt something touch his cheek and he quickly opened his eyes to look down. Standing right next to him with a hand on his cheek was the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon wanted to back away again, but the human's strokes stopped the gryphon from doing so and eventually began calming the gryphon down. The human's touch was the gentlest and kindest thing the griffin had felt since he had been captured and even though he had been capture about a month or so ago, it felt like an eternity to him. So, having the gentle human touch gave the gryphon great relief and comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so much relief and comfort that the gryphon began to cry due to the happiness it was now feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore tears fell down the gryphon's cheeks. Some of the tears soaked into the feathers, but others touched Felix's hand as he pet the cheek. Felix looked up to see the gryphon's eyes filled with a great happiness that Felix didn't realize could exit. Seeing the gryphon so happy caused Felix to smile kindly to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the gryphon leaned its head towards Felix and began rubbing his body with the feathery head. However, the gryphon's cuddle was gentle and Felix was surprised how gentle and affectionate the gryphon, who was the size of an elephant, was.

I know how you're feeling and I want to help you, and the only thing I think can help you now is for me to be your friend, would you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon nodded its head and continued nuzzling. \"Alright, we're friends now,\" Felix told the gryphon, \"And you wouldn't have to be lonely anymore.\"</span></div></div>",

The emperor says \"so, it has come to this... That slave, trying to spoil my war machine. I'll take care of this, personally.\" The lord thought a while and commanded \"Don't feed the beast, a whole month, extra chores for that bastard, and whip him more than usual, make him fail if needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later, the lord ordered went with Felix to the beast's cell, it was famished... Felix muttered \"how could you...\" The emperor slaps him hard enough to make Felix fall. Then the guards tie the boy exposing his back to the gryphon, also they put a mirror to let Felix watch what will happened...<br>\r\nA random slave comes to the cell, and he is tied to a dead deer, bathed in blood and is forced to go near the creature... A guard  cuts the face of the slave and threw the man near the gryphon... It cut the ropes, not hurting the man and swallowed the deer in one glup. The emperor, disgusted, told to the mage \"do it\". The mage used a puppeteer's spell to control the man, forcing him to go towards the creature, the man could do nothing to control his own body... As he got near the beast, the mage contolled the gryphon, forcing him to open his beak and grab the man's head, then the mage breaks the spell over the man, and he screams for help, guards watch, the emperor laugh, as the mage forced the gryphon to savor the man's body, and swallow up to his chest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix yells, \"DON'T, SPIT HIM UP\", a guard whip Felix, he screamed, and again he was whipped...The emperor order the beast, \"swallow\", but it his father's words echoed \"Don't hurt humans, unless there is no other option\" and he tried to fight the spell, the emperor said, \"bring the 9-tails whip\" as he got it handed to him, he whiped Felix, the boy's scream echoed the castle... this whip torn his flesh making him bleed a lot, yet still not fatal, the emperor repeated himself, \"EAT IT YOU FOUL BEAST, or this kid will pay your insolence\", the emperor whipped him again, blodd splattered to the floor, Felix screamed again, just saying faintly, \"don't, please, don't my friend, please\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears ran though the gryphon's eyes, as the mage forced him to swallow the man completely, and alive... He felt the man struggling inside him. Felix was broken down completely, as the same as the gryphon... The emperor had left the whip on fire... When it was red by the flames, he whipped Felix 3 times, the gryphon infuriated, the only thing on his head was to kill the man who tortured his friend so bad... The emperor stabbed the beast many times with a spear, no one noticed... But the bricks where the chains were set began to break down... Felix on the other hand, wanted to protect his friend, also wanted to make the emperor pay for forcing the gryphon to eat a man alive... He felt fire from within... Somehow, his strength was returning to him, maybe cholera...

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The gryphon watched as the human approached him. The gryphon was still conflicted with its thoughts. On one side, the human had thrown a rock at him and he was afraid the human was going to harm him again, even though the human had no obvious weapons in his hands and the human sounded like he was being honest by what he was saying. It was fear that ruled this side of the gryphon's argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other side of the conflict within the gryphon was longing. The gryphon was only a four year old child. He missed his parents and home and he was being tortured by evil humans that didn't seem to care if he was young or not. They just tortured him mercilessly and kept him in a dark and dank cell where he was chained down around his back legs, around his midsection, and around his neck. He was being treated terribly and being so young has traumatized him. The gryphon was going through something a normal person shouldn't go through, let alone a child, and it has cause much pain, loneliness, and depression in his brain. The gryphon was longing for some sort of escape from the nightmare, and he felt that only of those options would be to befriend a human and hopefully find comfort from such a human. He had felt the one feeding him would be his only hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, two options were being played in the gryphon's head. The gryphon could either satisfy his longing for comfort by trusting the human or he could give in to his fear and distrust the human approaching. Fear won in the gryphon's mind. He didn't know if he could trust the human anymore after what the human did and he feared the human would start acting like all the other humans that tortured him. The gryphon quickly covered his head with his wings to keep the human away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Felix could approach the gryphon, the gryphon stretched out its tan colored wings with black speckles and covered its head. Felix felt worse than he had before. <i>\"It seems as though the gryphon was only coming to me because it was sad and lonely,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"But I went and threw a damn rock at it. Now, it won't even let me come close enough to it for me to show it how sorry I am. It dosen't trust me,\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thought came to him. The creature was obviously intelligent enough to understand the human language. Those nods and shakes couldn't have been a coincidence. If the gryphon was as intelligent as Felix thought, it was possible the gryphon was intelligent to lie and trick. <i>\"What if the gryphon is just pretending and it just wants me to get close enough to it so it can eat me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Felix soon dismissed that possibility. He had been within the gryphon's reach for a long time. The chains only let the gryphon go so far and Felix had been within that range for a very long time. Plus, the gryphon had eaten the deer and drank the water Felix had given to it without any signs of wanting to eat him. <i>\"The gryphon doesn't want to eat me. It would have done it by now,\"</i> Felix thought to himself, <i>\"Besides, there is no way those cries are fake. Those have to be real.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix listened to the muffled sobs behind the gryphon's wings. It deeply saddened his heart upon knowing he was the cause of it. The gryphon was just a sad and lonely creature. The loneliness and sadness reminded Felix of himself. <i>\"The gryphon needs comfort and a friend,\"</i> Felix realized, <i>\"I know it will help me to have a friend and if it could help me, it could most likely help the gryphon because we're a lot alike.\"</i> For some reason, Felix didn't have troubles admitting he and the gryphon were alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix noticed a small gap where the two wings met. Felix didn't hesitate as he approached the gryphon's wings and got on his hands and knees. His mind was set. He was going to repent for what he did and he was going to make it up to the gryphon and become its source of comfort and friend. Felix crawled through the hole and found himself in the darkness where only sobs of the gryphon filled the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix didn't see anything, not even the gryphon's eyes. He knew that meant the gryphon's eyes were closed, because those eyes were even blacker than the darkness around him. Felix carefully stood up and followed the sobs with his hands outstretched in front of him. Felix was being as quiet as possible so he wouldn't startle the gryphon before touching it. However, his footsteps were nowhere near as loud as the sobs that filled the feathery prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Felix bumped into a wet, soft, and feathery surface. Felix started right away and began stroking the feathers to try and comfort the gryphon before it got startled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why is everyone mean to me?\"</i> the four year old male gryphon questioned, <i>\"Why can't I find good humans like Daddy? Daddy said humans were good!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon continued to sob, feeling everything was hopeless. He thought he would never see his family or his home again and that he would be trapped in the prison for the rest of his life. He would be harmed and tortured by humans the rest of his life and no human would ever show any compassion to him. He would be lonely and sad for the rest of his life. This was the future the gryphon foresaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt something bump against his cheek. The gryphon stopped breathing out of shock and fear. He opened his eyes slowly and looked down to see the human touching his cheek. (The gryphon can see just as well in the dark as he could in the day.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the gryphon do? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The gryphon was in too much shock to do anything. His black eyes widened in fear and all he could do was shiver at the human's touch. The gryphon stayed as still as he could because he feared the human would try to harm him if he moved. The gryphon closed his eyes and continued to cry. All he could do was wait and hope that the human wouldn't harm him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix saw the gryphon close its eyes once more and more tears dripped down its feathery cheek and on his hand. Felix closed his eyes and sighed. <i>\"Will the gryphon ever trust me again?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"It just wanted some comfort and I threw that rock at it. I guess I don't deserve its trust. I guess I won't gain a loyal friend like I thought I would.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Felix still continued to pet the gryphon's cheek in hopes it would calm down. Felix could only think about the lonely nights he experienced as his first days of slavery, an experience the gryphon must also be feeling. <i>\"But the gryphon's feeling must be worse. It's only an infant. Infants need to be with their parents, but this one is alone in this dreadful cell. The gryphon needs a friend who could help it and comfort it. It needs what I need,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon braced itself for pain and it was too weak and young to know how to fight back. (It was still an infant and didn't want to fight back and hurt people. Especially since his father said that it was just as wrong hurting humans as it was hurting other gryphon and with the gryphon's size and strength, he could truly harm or kill a human.) The gryphon wasn't going to fight back no matter what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, pain never came. Instead, the gryphon felt something he had never felt from a human's touch. The human hand gently brushed against the gryphon's feathery cheek. The hand never turned painful. It just continued to give comfort to the gryphon.The gryphon was soon reminded of his parents when they would rub their heads against them. (Gryphons nuzzled with their heads instead of there hard beaks.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon opened his eyes and saw the human seemed to mean him no harm. The human was just continuing to pet his cheek with a kindness and care the gryphon never dreamed was possible in the nightmarish cell. <i>\"The human... it's not going to hurt me... It's trying to comfort me,\"</i> the gryphon realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the human looked as though he would give up and walk away. <i>\"It's going to leave me here again. No, I can't let it leave. It's the only human that seems to care about me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix felt as though it was no use trying to calm the gryphon down. It was just too scared of him now that he had thrown the rock. Felix couldn't blame the gryphon, because Felix knew he'd be uneasy if he were in the gryphon's position. Felix sighed and stood up more guilty than ever. Just as he walked to the only source of light, Felix heard a strange whine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix turned and see the black eyes of the gryphon open once more. The gryphon edged its head closer and made a terribly sad sound. Felix began to wonder why the gryphon was making such a noise, but he soon figured it out. \"Do you want me to stay here?\" Felix asked the gryphon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon nodded its head and Felix could only see the darker than black eyes move up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you didn't trust me. Why do you want me to approach now?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon edged its head and placed it beside Felix. The gryphon looked down and continued to make the whining noises. \"Please,\" the gryphon was begging in gryphon tongue, \"Please don't leave. I don't want to be alone anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knelt down once more and placed his hand on the gryphon's wet feathery cheek. Felix pet the gryphon, but it caused the gryphon to cry more. Felix soon realized that the tears were of pure joy. It had finally found a human that cared about it. The gryphon leaned its head against Felix's body (but not with all it's might because it would have knocked him over.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" Felix tried to assure the gryphon as he pet it.  </span></div></div>",

Lord William nodded to the guard and the guard opened the human sized door to the cell that was made of iron bars. Lord William shoved Felix into the cell just as the other guards opened the cage once the cage was through the large entrance that could fit the cage through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix tried to catch himself, but he stumbled in the dark cell that was only lite by the torches on the walls and landed roughly on his belly. The stone floor was damp and bare just like the rest off the cell walls which sent a chill up through Felix's skin. Felix tried to catch his breath from the hard impact of hitting the floor, but he stopped when he heard the rustling of feathers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Felix looked up in the direction of the movement. Felix could see the opening of the large cage inside the enormous prison cell he was in. Tucked into the furthest corner of the cage was a mess of golden feathers, a great mound of shiny plumage. Above the mound was a pair of shiny black eyes that were fixed upon him. The eyes loomed closer as the bird extended its neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix held his breath and continued to lie on the floor as the head of a massive bird edged out of the cage opening into the torch light of the cell. Felix lied perfectly still, mostly out of fear, as the phoenix emerged out of the cage and into the cell. The bird was tall and easily as tall as an adult elephant. The phoenix looked like any ordinary bird of prey, but it was covered in many vibrant and beautiful colored feathers that it would be near impossible not comment on such a magnificent and beautiful creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Felix was truly frightened that the giant bird of prey would devour him and he didn't pay attention to its beauty. The phoenix continued to stare at Felix as it walked up to him. Felix began to hyperventilate as the creature's beak descended towards his helpless body. The phoenix probed Felix's back gently. When the smooth beak touched Felix's back, Felix once again held his breath. The phoenix's beak moved the folds of his rough shirt and slid along the exposed skin of his back. Felix could feel his very skin crawl as the cold and smooth beak of the phoenix ran along his naked back. The only thing that kept his back semi-warm was the hot breath of the large creature standing above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's going to kill me,\"</i> Felix thought. His lungs ached with unspent air. The point of the beak sifted through Felix's hair, and he could feel the creature's breath move softly over his skin. Felix watched the wooden cage being moved out while the phoenix's attention was on him. There were two entrances to the cell. One was normal sized, the doorway Felix was pushed through, and the other was large enough to fit the cage in. The large doors were closing now that the elephant cage was out of the cell. Felix was beginning to lose all hope of escaping the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like my phoenix, slave?\" Lord William questioned, his voice smashing the calm of the moment. The creature jerked its head up and cried out, fixing its black stare on the open doorway where Lord William was standing unfazed by the shriek the large bird had given.</span></div></div>",

He threw himself toward the door, desperate to reach safety before the phoenix's beak could come down on his soft flesh. As soon as Felix's feet started to pound on the stone floor below, a piercing shriek filled the damp air of the terrible cell, followed by a flash of golden light. Felix heard the phoenix's sharp talons scraping against the the floor and it felt as thought the air began to boiled behind Felix. Felix could make a good assumption that the phoenix's breath was what was rushing past him which meant the phoenix was close behind with an open beak edging closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix didn't look back once, but he kept the image of a monstrous bird, beak open wide, chasing him to give him encouragement to run faster. Felix to the door with the beak inches behind him. He had no idea he was going to make it to the door in time until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SLAM!</b> Lord William had actually taken Felix's hand and pulled him in just before a guard slammed the iron door behind Felix. The phoenix collided with the door hard, but the strong iron didn't budge despite the bird's strength. It was obvious that the impact was going to either leave a bruise or a bump on the phoenix's head. Felix whirled around just in time to see the bird wreathed in golden light. The spectacular yet frightening golden light flickered across the feathers, breathing life into the colors of the plumes. Felix gaped at it for a moment before bending over and breathing frantically to try and catch his breath. He had never ran that fast in all his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William only chuckled and dusted off his hands. \"Pull yourself together, slave!\" he snapped, \"The thing's too young for real fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded, trying hard to catch his breath before Lord William decided to slap him. Felix thought about Lord William's actions. <i>\"He had saved my life,\"</i> Felix thought. He had thought that the wicked man had finally done something nice for a change, but then reality hit him. <i>\"He just used me as bait. He threw me in there to distract the phoenix long enough for them to get the cage out of the cell!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used me as bait,\" Felix muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's better loosing a slave than one of my guards or soldiers,\" Lord William informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He hasn't changed one bit,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you'll be feeding it twice a day. Get the meat from that fat woman up in the kitchen and bring it down here. All you have to do is throw it the scraps, got that? Right through the bars,\" Lord William told Felix, \"The only thing you can't throw through the bars is the water. However, you could just fill up a bowl and put it in while it's distracted with the meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human sized door was made of tough iron bars that Felix could easily slip his hands through. It would have been easy enough for Felix to throw things through the bars. (That's probably why Felix was chosen out of all the other slaves.) Felix nodded again. As long as he didn't have to completely enter the cell again he'd be fine with taking care of the phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral days passed, and Felix dutifully brought the pail of meat scraps from the kitchen every morning and night. It was unnerving to toss the slimy strips into the dark, listening to that razor-sharp beak snap them up, but he was glad to keep a safe distance. The only time he actually had to open the door was to fill a bowl of water for the phoenix. He would first toss the meat so that the phoenix would be distracted while he opened the door and filled the water. Luckily, the phoenix kept the bowl near the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William seemed pleased with the bird's progress, and Felix had so far avoided getting beaten for any imagined negligence. It was, of course, his main concern - that the creature thrive so no one would have anything to blame him for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings might have continued on in just this way, but one evening, just as he finished throwing the last scrap, he heard the telltale rustle of the phoenix moving. The guards paid no attention. They didn't even hear the rustle because they were at the dungeon entrance on the other side of the door. Felix stood still and watched the creature approach. It stared at him through the bars, then slowly leaned forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feather was held in its beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is it offering this to me?\"</i> Felix wondered. The bird looked at him with shiny eyes and held the feather still, just within reach.</span></div></div>",

Lord William was practically swaggering with pride.  \"Well, slave,\" he repeated harshly, \"what do you think of it?  Tell me.\"<br>\r\n\"L-Lord William,\" Felix whimpered finally, feeling the close proximity of the great, bird-like creature.  \"Please...please don't let it eat me.\"<br>\r\nThe lord laughed, and Felix felt another shudder at the mirthless, corrupted sound.  \"I ensure that you shall be perfectly safe,\" he said.  \"At least, just as long as you obey me.\"  Felix watched as Lord William beckoned to him.  \"Come, slave, come.\"<br>\r\nFelix stared at his master, anxiously shifting his gaze between the noble fowl and the foul noble.  Deciding the worse of the two beign the foul noble, he stood and scurried towards Lord William.  \"Be quicker about it next time,\" Lord William growled, and one of his signet rings cut into the boy's cheek when Felix received another warning slap.  The boy winced from the pain, gasping and clutching his face as Lord William gestured for a few stronger slaves to bring in a great chest, large but plain and wooden.  He could smell some sort of spice in the air as it was dropped next to him.  \"Slave.\"  Felix, no matter how badly his instincts were telling him not to, stepped closer to the cruel man.<br>\r\n\"Slave,\" Lord William began again, and Felix ventured to look up into the nobleman's face.  He recognized the glittering malice of pure evil in his master's dark eyes.  The boy had seen that look before, but only just after Lord William was done torturing his prisoners.  \"Slave, I should like you to care for my phoenix.  You shall be now a sort of stable boy to my creature.  All you need is in this chest, but the breaking...\" Lord William's eyes shone with even greater delight in Felix's fear.  \"The breaking of the beast shall be done by me.\"  Lord William stepped back and out of the cell, his guards falling back with him.  \"There isn't much else you need to know, slave.\"<br>\r\nFelix tried to follow Lord William, but his master motioned for him to remain where he was.  \"Where do you wish me to stay in the meantime, my lord?\"<br>\r\nLord William shook his head, and Felix felt a cool layer of ice coat his insides.  His master was grinning sadistically.  \"Why, if you are to care for my creature, here is where you must stay.\"  The smaller door shut tightly, and Felix let loose a sob as the clasp of the latch metallically clicked what was sure to be the slave's last sound before he was devoured by the winged beast behind him.<br>\r\nIt was not much longer before Felix could feel that hot breath on his skin again.  \"I really am going to die,\" he thought as the sharp tip of the cool, smooth beak rested gently on the top of his head.  The tears spilled forth eagerly like from the spout of a fountain.  He was scared.  What was it like to die?  No one knew, because no one who had ever died lived to tell what happened.<br>\r\nFelix felt wetness slide down the beak as it tenderly nuzzled his stinging, cut cheek.  To the child's surprise, the dull throb was gone in an instant.  He stared up intot he coal-black, shining eyes set amid the dazzling sparkle of gold plumage.  The phoenix was crying, too.<br>\r\nIts tears dried quickly, as did Felix's, and the slave boy slowly stepped closer to the great mythical being.  The phoenix seemed to mean him no harm, as the head at the end of the swan-like, slender neck pressed close to the slave's body.  Felix was at least mildly intimidated that the creature's head was slightly larger than the whole of his being.  Nonetheless, he ran his hands through the soft, downy feathers, like the bird had run its beak through his hair earlier.  The phoenix allowed the slave boy to curl close to its hot, feathery body.<br>\r\nFelix remained close to the being for almost an eternity.  Then, he could feel it beginning to shrink into something approximately his size.  The boy stepped back to see the phoenix, his mirror-image twin, smiling back at him with genuine warmth and companionship.</span></div></div>",

The adult angels are around an average of 80 feet tall. When angels come to Earth, they become mortal, well they still can't die of old age, but they have to eat and such. Unfortunately there isn't much for a giant angel to eat in this world other than living things, no matter how much it doesn't want to eat living creatures. Some Felaryan angels eat humans and find that they love the taste and they become addicted to humans. They always try to eat evil people only, at first, but the addiction could sometimes get out of hand and they begin eating more people. Angels will always feel sorry about eating humans, because they see them as people too. Unfortunately, the addiction could sometimes be too great to fight off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelaryan Angels are very powerful in magic, but their strongest magic is their healing and defensive spells. They also can radiate their feelings into another person. This means that if the angel is feeling extremely happy or depressed, the humans near it would also be able to sense her feeling as if it were their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you chose it to be an angel, then the creature put in the cell is only six years of age and 40 feet tall. (The angel had been scrunched in that cage.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCentaurs- if you pick this type of creature, three types of centaurs and their descriptions will be given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDridder- These creatures have the upper body of a human and the lower body of a spider. These creatures are considered evil by many races, because of the dridders disturbing looks and eating habits. Dridders eat their pray by two ways: if the prey is small enough, they eat the prey by swallowing it whole, but it the prey is about its own size, dridders eat it like a normal spider. All dridders are considered evil and twisted and most races think of an evil dark creature lurking in the shadows ready to snatch up an unsuspecting victim and eat them without mercy. Well, some dridders are like this, but not all of them are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a wide range of heights a dridder could be, but the one that is in the cage will grow to be 100 feet tall, including the long arachnid legs, and it is only a 20 foot tall infant at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMist Elf- Mist elves are half elf and half water dragon creatures. They look elven in structure, but they have sharp teeth, purple skin, and long whitish-purple hair. Their eye could be either blue, green, or more rarely, crimson. They have stronger bones and vision than normal elves thanks to their dragon heritage and they sometimes have a tail, and even more rarely, wings. The male mist dragons grow two horns on their brows. Mist elves also have great aptitude for knowledge and learning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe average heights of these creatures are, 100 feet for females and 120 feet for males. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether or not a male or female mist dragon is chosen in the story, it will end up being 40 feet tall and six years old when the main character, Felix, first meets it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had not the slightest idea what a Felaryan Angel might look like, but it sounded wonderful. Unfortunately, Lord William did not seem inclined to offer any further explanation.<br>\r\n\"When shall my duties begin, sir?\" Felix whispered, keeping his eyes downcast. He did not want to appear too eager, or his master might change his mind. Lord William did not like his slaves to enjoy their work.<br>\r\n\"Report to the Beast Master tonight.\" Lord William's upper lip lifted in an ugly sneer. \"Oh and be careful, boy. I hear angels find human flesh quite delicious.\"<br>\r\nWilliam stomped away down the stone hall, leaving Felix shivering in the cool dungeon, listening to the screams of the newly imprisoned angel. There was a lot of work to do between then and dinner time that evening, Felix reminded himself. If he didn't get everything done spotlessly, the Slave Master would beat him for each transgression. If he was bad enough, Lord William might order a whip. Felix had never been that bad before, but he had seen it done to some of the older boys. One of them, Juno, nearly died. Felix pushed aside his fear of the creature and scurried away after Lord William, determined to find a way to escape sooner rather than later.<br>\r\nAll too soon, however, the time had come for Felix to return to the dungeon. He twisted his hands into the hem of his grimy tunic so the Beast Master wouldn't see them shaking.<br>\r\n\"Right, boy,\" the grizzly, scarred old man growled. \"This beastie is just a baby, so fifty pounds of meat a day should do it. It's not up to eating live prey, so you are in charge of loading its feed tray and then getting the hell out of the way, understand?\"<br>\r\nFelix nodded, not trusting his voice.<br>\r\n\"Go on then.\"<br>\r\nFelix eyed the cart of bloody meat that the Beast Master was gesturing towards and swallowed back the bile in his throat, not wanting to know where it came from. It was an uncomfortable coincidence that Lord William had just increased the penalties for severe crimes to execution without burial.<br>\r\nWith gritted teeth, Felix heaved the metal cart towards a smaller human sized door to the cell. When the door finally opened, it took him a moment to recognize the creature. It was curled up against the far wall, a mighty chain around its neck keeping it tied to an equally massive ring in the floor. As Felix approached, the creature...</span></div></div>",

The wings covered the sides of the angel making it impossible to see the rest of the body. When Felix looked at the wings he saw they were white as snow, which Felix has had o work out in, and with blond hair that went it\u2019s shoulders. The only problem with the Angel\u2019s looks what the scars on its back. As got closer to it he felt a saddening feelings, the feeling of the pain and anger, along with the confusion and despair. All this was flowing through Felix, and to him this is the pain he was so use of feeling. As he pushed the cart into the angels reach the pain grew more and more until Felix stopped. <i> \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why do I feel this way? I thought I got over this feeling years ago\u201d </i> Felix thought, now walking away from the angel. The feelings were still as strong with each step he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felix walks out of the cell he saw the guard cruched over and rocking back and forth. <i> \u201cIs this the angel\u2019s doing?\u201d</i> Remembering he had to clean the guard\u2019s armor, and the punishment for being late, Felix left in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angel sat in its cell alone. It heard the door open and thought it was the people that beat him, but instead it felt no beating, instead the smell of meat filled the room. At first thinking of it was a trap the angel stayed in its corner. Then the door opened again, where whoever was in there left. Turning around no one was in the room with it. Looking down it saw the food. <i> \u201cAm I being feed?\u201d </i> Taking the meat and eating it, the angel just sat there and ate in this horrid place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix returned at dinner time and as he walked to the door he saw the trainer walk out with a wipe covered in fresh blood. Then same feeling as before was the feeling of the pain and anger, along with the confusion and despair, all reappearing again, but so much stronger. Looking at the guard his rocking increased greatly. <i> \u201cIf this has to be the angel\u2019s doing, but why?\u201d </i> As Felix walked into the angel\u2019s cell Felix now saw the new wound marks on the angel\u2019s back, easily over thirty lashes, each dripping blood. Felix kept walking into the angels reach, and saw some white glow now cover the open wounds and seal them shut. They were still scars, but at least they weren\u2019t dripping blood. Felix was caught up in watching the angel heal itself that he walked it the walk, it the angel\u2019s reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> \u201cAll these human\u2019s are damned monsters!\u201d</i> the angel thought healing the new wounds on its back. Before the angel could think of what it wanted to do to these horrible creatures it heard a thud. Looking down at the noise was another human. The angel felt so anger that it grabbed Felix, before he looked at the angel, and hung him over its mouth. <i> \u201cThis human is getting better then\u2026\u201d</i> the smell of food filled the angel\u2019s nose again. Looking around the angel found the food. <i> \u201cThis one is feeding me! But why would it?\u201d </i> taking Felix away from it mouth, hand wrapped around his chest, the angel saw the human\u2019s eye\u2019s shut, shacking it fear. The different style of clothing this one has, compared to the armor the others had. The angel then felt the scars on its back. Turning it around the angel saw the scars that covered Felix\u2019s whole back. <i> \u201cThis human is like me. They beat him like they do to me.\u201d </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix felt the angel grab him and pulled him right to its mouth shutting his eyes, he didn\u2019t want to see his doom. He prayed that the angel would eat him, ironic. Then Felix felt the warm breath of the angel cover his whole body, <i> Oh dear god, please, let me live,\u201d </i> Then as if answered Felix was moved away from the angel\u2019s mouth. Still too afraid to open his eyes Felix just let the angel look at him. When he was turned around, Felix felt his shirt picked up. The angel then put Felix to the floor. Looking up Felix saw that the angel was \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Felaryan centaurs are gigantic creatures however and range from an average of 90-130 feet tall, thanks to the long horse legs. Centaurs are fearsome creatures that eat a lot and eat almost anything. When it decides something is prey, the prey could never outrun it. Centaurs are just to fast for anything to outrun.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen hunting, centaurs either catch prey with their hands, or simply lean forward, mouth wide open to gobble up victims on the ground, tongue licking the ground behind them, pretty much like how horses might graze in a field. Unlike most other hybrid creatures in Felarya, centaurs have their stomachs situated in their animal part. This means it's huge! It would take dozens of humans to fill it, although centaurs will eat just about any creature small enough to be swallowed. When digesting a meal, a centaur will fall asleep, usually for a whole day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe centaur in the cell is 40 feet tall and only a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeerataur- These are the rarest species of centaur to come across, but they are humans on deer bodies with greenish skin and leafy antlers. These creatures are very close to nature and plants, but they have no power over them. Deerataurs have whether based magic though and could make rainfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeerataurs are slightly less voracious than centaurs, as they have a sort of photosynthesis which reduces their need to feed in the normal sense of the word. However, just because they need to eat less doesn't make them any safer to be around! Deerataurs are definitely hostile to humans and will gulp one down whenever given the chance. Their special stomach can drain magic, and their digestion is magically enhanced, making the process a lot faster and less disabling for them than it is for normal centaurs. Some believe the reason they hate humans so much is because humans cut down trees and cause other actions that destroy forests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deerataur in the cell is about six years old and about 40 feet tall. It will grow to be 90 feet eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZebra Centaurs-  A zebra centaur's average height is about 80-100 feet tall. (This would make the six year old zebra centaur in the cell nearly 40 feet tall.) Zebra centaur are more civilized and refined. They easily see humans as people and don't normal eat them. This makes it easier to befriend a zebra centaur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, zebra centaurs have a double life.   During the day they are pleasant creatures, rather friendly to humans and they sometimes escort caravans for a while just for the sake of chatting and exchanging news. However, when the sun sets their eyes begin to glow red and a aura of fear surrounds them. The nonchalant centaur then turns into a fearsome and hungry predator.</span></div></div>",

Felix knew that once you ask the Lord William something he won\u2019t shut up about it until he gives you every fact he knows about the creature. \u201cAll that we know so far about this Felaryan creature is that it\u2019s use of magic to control the weather. We caught it this afternoon, and knowing how many men it ate, it is well feed for now. But you are to feed this being, and be sure it is well taken care of. That means, you have to make sure it eats before you leave, or else.\u201d Felix was about to speak up, but the he remembered the last time he did and his punishment, so he kept his mouth shut. \u201cNow continue with your chores, a guard shall get you at dinner time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes master,\u201d Felix said then walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Deeratuar sat in a dark cell alone. Chains wrapped around its wrists, neck, torso, and its ankles. The Deeratuar sat there in darkness after being captured. <i> \u201cHow\u2019d this happen?\u201d </i> the Deeratuar thought. <i> \u201cOne moment I\u2019m with mommy and others sitting in the sun, next I wake up in a smaller forest alone. And then some humans shot me with strange arrows that made me sleepy. Now I\u2019m all alone and \u2026 and I want my mommy!\u201d </i> the Deeratuar cried. Then some humans came in, some with swords, others with wipes, and one of them said, \u201cTime to show you how\u2019s boss.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey slave time to feed the beast,\u201d one of the guards said. Felix looked to his right, and saw a cart that had some food and water for the beast. Felix grabbed the cat\u2019s handles and started to push it into the cell. \u201cRemember ya\u2019 ain\u2019t come out until that things feed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix keeps walking further and further until he found the creature sitting in the corner of the room. About ten feet tall from head to \u2026second chest, Felix guessed. The creature seemed to be trying to hide, if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that its body\u2019s shape wouldn\u2019t let it do much more then to curl around a little. The pattern on its deer half was something Felix has never seen, a pure light brown coat with some white dots, here and there. As Felix approached the creature\u2019s, limit he pushed the cart in. Looking over at the creature, it hadn\u2019t taken notice to the food, yet. <i> \u201cUh oh, I can\u2019t leave until, I know it\u2019s feed, maybe, I can yell to it,\u201d </i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you!\u201d Felix yelled at the creature. It gave no response. So Felix yelled louder, \u201cTime to eat!!\u201d still no good. <i> \u201cDamn it, it might not be hungry?\u201d </i> Felix walked to the door and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard, didn\u2019t open the door, but yelled to Felix, \u201cWhat do ya\u2019 want slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe beast isn\u2019t hungry ma\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo can do, ya\u2019 have to leave, once the beast eats. If I open this door, and the food isn\u2019t gone, ya\u2019ll be gone.\u201d Felix just backed away from the door, not wanting to be anywhere near the door, if the guard entered. Turning to the beast Felix started to think of a new way to get its attention. <i> \u201cI could try to keep yelling, but if I do, then I could be here and miss some of my chores. One way or another I\u2019m in trouble.\u201d </i> Felix then approached the beast, hoping it was friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Deeratuar just laid there in the corner, after its training. Once the humans started to whip the Deeratuar it turned around and try to cover itself. <i> \u201cI\u2026 wa\u2026want..to..go\u2026.HOME!\u201d </i> the Deeratuar thought trying to hide from all the humans. Once the \u201ctrainers\u201d thought the Deeratuar had enough, they left. All the Deeratuar thought was how bad it missed home. Then in the middle of its thoughts, it felt something on its deer back. Looking over, it was another human. \u201cGet away!\u201d the Deeratuar cried, flipping the human with its hand. That when the Deeratuar looked around and saw some food, just in its reach. Going over it started to eat it.<i> \u201cFinally, something to eat,\u201d </i> it thought. Then, once it was done and full, something out of the corner of the it\u2019s eye started to move. It was the human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Deeratuar ate Felix watched it and saw that it was a young \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Felix stared into her eyes, seeing the sorrow, and fear in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u2026 for the food,\u201d the Deeratuar said, looking at Felix. <i> \u201cHis clothing is different from the other humans, and he\u2019s feeding me, and mommy did say, thank all those that me out.\u201d </i>  Daniel thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, you\u2019re welcome,\u201d was all Felix could think of saying. This thing has just yelled at him, and flicked him into the wall, and it says thanks? \u201cCan you put me down, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, if you can stay and answer some questions for me,\u201d Daniel said, a little unsure if she could put that much trust in this human, compared to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019m Felix by the way,\u201d the small slave said, in the awkward situation. <i> \u201cShe looks younger than me, maybe she just not sure of what to do in a situation like this.\u201d</i> Felix then felt the ground under him again, and to show he wasn\u2019t going to run, he sat right down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m Daniel. Sorry about flipping you,\u201d she said. Looking down at Felix she could definitely tell he was different then the first sets of humans that she met. He had no, shiny clothing, doesn\u2019t look to be strong enough to even survive the wilds, and how beat up he looked, made Daniel believe he was different. With the way he\u2019s acting is another reason too. \u201cCan you tell me where I am, why I\u2019m here and, if there\u2019s any way out,\u201d Daniel almost begged, causing Felix to do a little dark chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I knew a way out, I would be here right now,\u201d Felix began, \u201cYou are in Lord William\u2019s castle. The Lord wishes to use you as a weapon, to defeat all those that defy him and appose against his power. Though he doesn\u2019t know anything about your species I\u2019m sure he would love to learn of them, and use them to his benefits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis Lord William sounds dark. What does he want to learn from me? I\u2019m still a young, if anything he would want one of the older Deeratuars. They know how to control their powers, better than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, what kind of power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Deeratuars have weather based powers. We can make it rain if we wanted. Snow if cold enough, and have little tornadoes,\u201d Daniel said, making her finger twirled in the air, making a tiny tornado. \u201cBut I still don\u2019t know, on how to control my power. Best I can do, is when feel badly and rain clouds appear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be a good thing to keep away from the lord. Try to keep them from learning your powers or else, they\u2019ll try harder to train you,\u201d Felix said remembering the dragon that commented suicide instead of being tamed. He didn\u2019t feed it, but the slave that did tell of how it bit its tongue off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but can you keep a promise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you promise to talk to me every time you come in? I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll just say you weren\u2019t hungry. I\u2019m stuck in here until you eat all your food. That reminds me I have to go.\u201d Felix said getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, where are you going?!\u201d Daniel said worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t do my other chores, I\u2019m going to get punished I\u2019ll be back later, and I can stay longer because I don\u2019t have any chores at night,\u201d Felix said grabbing the empty cart, and walking out of her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll come back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I\u2019ll be back. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. See ya Felix,\u201d Daniel waved goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you, later Daniel.\u201d Felix approached the door, \u201cCan I get out I\u2019ve feed the beast.\u201d He said this quietly trying not to hurt Daniel\u2019s feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf ya\u2019 lying slave,\u201d the door opened to find the slave walking out with the cart. Looking around, the meat was nowhere in sight. \u201cSeems like your good slave, now you must come here tomorrow morning to feed this thing, as well as lunch and dinner.\u201d When the guard said this, Daniel became so happy, to see Felix three time a day. If that was the only joy she would have in this place, then she would be happy to see her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Next day***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix awoke the same way he has for the five years, being kicked in the gut by a guard being ordered to do something. Today, and most likely until he dies he was ordered to feed the \u201cbeast\u201d.  Felix now full awake from the kicks walked right to the kitchen, and found the cart full of food yet again. As he walked back to Daniel\u2019s cell he was wounding if Daniel would be awake at this time. Looking out one of the hallway windows, it was still dark out. Once he got back to the cell, he found the same guard from yesterday. \u201cThere ya are, feed the beast already. Yar be lucky I\u2019m a morn person, or else this beasty may stare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix walked into Daniel\u2019s cell to find her\u2026</span></div></div>",

As he came closer he was able to make out some things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFelix helped e escape now.\u201d Felix had to guess that this was if they escaped this place. \u201cBut he\u2019s a human though.\u201d <i> \u201cWait, what? If we escaped together wouldn\u2019t that mean that she wouldn\u2019t need to worry about me being different then me? Unless\u2026\u201d</i> Before Felix got into some other thoughts, Daniel said the truth about why, \u201cHumans may destroy some things, but Felix is different. He\u2019s not even strong enough to cut down a tree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should wake her up know, I can\u2019t stay here too long,\u201d Felix said as he walked over to Daniel\u2019s arm shacking her. \u201cDaniel time wake UP!\u201d Daniel rolled over towards Felix, catching him off guard. As Felix thought Daniel was going to roll over and crush him, she instead grabbed him from midair and hugged him, like a teddy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Daniel\u2019s dream, she was debating what she should do with Felix. He saved her life, freed her from that horrid place but now should she return to her herd with, or without Felix. Dream Felix looked at her and asked if anything was on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 no.\u201d Dream Felix looked at her knowing she was lying and ran to her, jumped up for Daniel to hug him in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cDaniel I know something\u2019s up. You know you can trust me, no matter what,\u201d </i> Dream Felix said, hugging Daniel. With this Daniel felt so comfortable, until she heard Felix say, \u201cDaniel, can you please wake up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat Felix?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel can you wake up, it\u2019s time for breakfast,\u201d Felix said, now the whole world Daniel was in was fading away, and turning into her cold crude reality. Daniel looked around in fear, her dream seemed so real, yet it was a lie she had told herself. She was about to cry when she heard Felix say, \u201cDaniel can you let me go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry Felix I was, uh\u2026\u201d Daniel lowered the slave back down, going towards the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Felix stopped for a moment before he decided to tell her, \u201cYou talk in your sleep, I can guess it was about us escaping here. You weren\u2019t sure what to do with me once we escape, but understand this. You can trust me, no matter what.\u201d Daniel blushes once she heard Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019d help me escape?\u201d Daniel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but first we need to find a way out for both of us. That means we need a secret passage for you to fit in, so about forty\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually Felix I\u2019m still growing, it might have to be a little bigger the forty,\u201d Daniel informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow big will you get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout ninety feet tall, be glad I\u2019m a girl. The boys are about a hundred twenty feet tall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that means that the only way out, is through the main gates, we\u2019re lucky, the Lord\u2019s general\u2019s out looking for new beasts or\u2026\u201d Felix was interrupted but a groaning noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOps sorry, uh where did you put my breakfast, Felix?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh let me get it for you,\u201d Felix said as he forgot to push it into her reach. <i> \u201cSo we need to get her free. What can we do? What, the chains have to be drilled into the wall!\u201d </i> The slave got it into her reach and said, \u201cDaniel can you check the chains on the wall to see if you can find the welts holding you down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, just let me eat right now. It\u2019s still early, or it feels like it.\u201d Daniel gave a hollow laugh. She then picked up the meat to hear the door knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlave ya\u2019 died in there?!\u201d Felix thought fast and ran up to the door, still closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, the beast is asleep. I\u2019ve been trying to wake it up!\u201d Felix faked whined. The guard didn\u2019t answer but keep the doors closed. Walking back to Daniel, her eyes were watering a little, with some meat in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m\u2026\u201d she was cut off by Felix shushing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t, but I need to look afraid of you when the guards can hear me.\u201d Felix walk to Daniel\u2019s front left leg and hugged it. To Felix, it was like hugging a tree, to Daniel, it was her friend showing that he truly did care about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Felix but can you not talk like that. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Felix looked over to find the cart empty. \u201cI think it might be best if I leave, before the guard gets suspect something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, bye Felix,\u201d Daniel said as she went back into deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later Daniel,\u201d Felix said, trying to lighten her mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do we follow?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What is that master?\" Felix asked, being careful in choosing his words so to not be hit again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a creature that has the body of a spider from the waist down and the upper body of a human. In this world they do not get much larger then humans. So, I had my magicians bring one from another world. This dridder is 20 feet tall and still growing. Imagine slave, when it is fully grown it will be one hundred feet tall and loyal only to me.\" As he continued to talk he turned around gesturing for Felix to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This dridder is only the first mind you, when the time comes I'll use the dridder to catch many more creatures for me, with its paralyzing bite and webbing, I will have an army of creatures to do my bidding. And in time, I will take my rightful place as king of all worlds. No, I will be the god of all worlds. Yes, a dridder is the perfect choice.\" As he said this Lord William had stopped in front of the kitchen where a cart with two dead bucks and a large bowl of water on it sat waiting. \"Now slave this is where you will find its food for all three of its meals. Take it to the dridder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked down at the food and asked, \"But master, if part of it is human won't raw meat make it sick?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Lord William raised his hand to strike Felix, but as Felix flinched, he stopped and set his hand down with a wicked smile on his face. \"No slave, a dridder may look like it's part human but it is not. In fact it eats humans. When it's fully grown it will be able to swallow men alive, but right now what it will do is sink its fangs into its food and inject venom into its victim. But the bite is not what kills the victim. As the venom takes affect, the spider injects digestive juices into its still living meal and it slowly turns their innards into mush. And then it sucks the now liquid innards out and swallows it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William enjoyed explaining how the dridder would eat as he watched his slave's face turn more and more pale as he went along. \"Now go, or I'll feed you to that thing. And remember, the chains on it will not let it cross the line carved into the ground.\" At this Lord William turned and walked away. Felix was terrified, but had no choice. It was serve the food or be it. As Felix pushed the food cart down through the prison, one of the two guards at the dridder's door saw him and unlocked the door and opened it for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked around the large, dimly lit room. It was huge, about two hundred feet high and three hundred feet wide. There was a large line in the center of the room and only the torches on the same side Felix was on were lit. And there were what looked like ropes on the floor from wall to wall across and on each end they were set up on the wall like spider webs. It looked as if the dridder was trying to build a wall between it and the door. And looking toward the back, Felix saw it. As Lord William said, its lower body looked like a spider, but its upper body looked like that of a little five year old girl's. Only, her skin color looked purple. Then again, it was hard to see it clearly in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix gulped as he slowly pushed the cart forward, and to his surprise, the dridder backed up into a corner. As Felix came up to the line, he picked up the water bowl and set it next to the webbing, only spilling a little. When he dragged the first dead buck over, it took everything he had to get it by the water. During this time, Felix kept an eye on the dridder, glad to see it was still in its corner, just watching him. But when Felix tried to get the other buck into place, his hand slipped while he was pulling and he fell back and landed on the webs on the floor. When Felix tried to get up, he found that he was stuck to the webs. \"Help! Please someone help I'm stuck!\" Felix yelled with fear as he realized he was now trapped on the wrong side of the line and with the dridder's food!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arachne didn't understand what was happening. She had been sleeping in her cave, but when she woke up, she was no longer in her cave, but in a large open meadow. She also wasn't alone in the meadow. There were also strange doll sized creatures around here she had never seen before. Though the creatures were smaller compared to her, they were numerous and she didn't have a chance to fight back, especially since she was only five years old and in a very confused state of mind. The strange creatures forced her into a large wooden crate without much of a fight. Arachne didn't attack the doll sized creatures, she only pleaded for them to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays past as the small creatures that had the same sort of upper half as her, but only two legs and no spider body kept her in the crate and only opened it to threw food into it. Arachne cried nearly the entire time. She didn't understand why she was being kidnapped by such strange creatures and why they were treating her so poorly. Arachne even started believing that this whole experience was a dream, but it was no dream and she was really being taken away by strange little monsters that were treating her as if she was some kind of giant savage beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Arachne was a dridder and still young, she couldn't understand why the strange little creatures thought she was some monstrous creature. Plus, their claims that she would eat them seemed absurd to her. It was true that most Felaryan top predators defined a person by their size rather than their intelligence. This was the whole reason why Felaryan predators deemed it morally permissible to eat humans since they were little despite the fact they were a sentient being like themselves. Too them, if they were large enough to eat something, they felt it was right to do so. What they didn't realize was that just because one has the power to do something, it doesn't always mean they should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne, however, didn't have these views yet. Like many dridders, she was left on her own to survive. This meant that the Felaryan moral system wasn't taught to her. Like all dridders and nearly every other Felaryan top predator, Arachne had the fascination of eating smaller creatures. She enjoying swallowing squirrels and rabbits whole. Though, she had never met a human before and didn't even know what they were. She understood they were intelligent beings that could even speak her language and with an added bonus of her curiosity, Arachne had no wishes of eating a person. This was the case for most dridders who were forced to live on their own. However, it usually changed with growth and humans eventually became too small to befriend dridders who had a fascination to eat small creatures. Dridders realize upon their growth that they have to power to do whatever they want with small beings and they had the choice to eat them or not. Besides, who could believe such small beings that are clearly a different species should be given the same rights: the thought that many Felaryans learn to accept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Arachne was let out of the crate and she found herself in a large chamber. The chamber was dark and creepy. A place that reminded her of home. However, the creatures forced her into chains which she couldn't break free from. This was the part that she hated and was afraid of. \"Why are you doing this to me?\" Arachne asked the small creatures, \"Why am I here and why are you chaining me up like an animal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creatures never answered her and just walked away. Arachne cried for a long time trying to will herself that it was only a dream. However, she never woke up in her cave and she continued to be trapped in her chains. Arachne tried to make herself better by making a large web so that she could feel more at home. However, it wasn't working. Nothing was changing the fact that she had been kidnapped, was far away from her home, and that there were chains. She was a prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door had opened and, fearing that more of those little creatures had come to hurt her again, Arachne quickly backed into the corner of the cell where she had placed her webbing to make a fort-like sleeping area for herself. This would be the spot where she would rest and stay hidden from creatures until they became trapped in her web. Arachne only hoped the doll-sized creatures wouldn't find her in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne had expected to see more of the creatures that wore the shinny clothing (armor), but to her surprise a cart filled with two deer and a large bowl of water came into the room first followed by a smaller creature pushing the cart. It was clear that this new small creature was different from the other creatures that kidnapped and hurt her. They were the same species, but this small creature was smaller than the others and younger. This little creature didn't wear the shinny clothing, but instead wore old and dirty clothes that were so worn that they looked more useful as rags rather than clothing. Arachne stared at the new creature with great curiosity as it approached closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This one is different from the others. Maybe it will act differently and not harm me. Maybe I can ask it what I'm doing here?\"</i> Arachne wondered. However, she saw the fear in the creature's face. <i>\"He thinks I'm a monster like the other creatures think I am. He might hurt me like the others and treat me like a beast,\"</i> Arachne assumed. Arachne decided it was best not to risk provoking the creature to attack her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne noticed that the small creature pushed the cart just before he could reach the other side of the line where she could reach. The small creature then took the large bowl and set it in her reach. <i>\"This creature is feeding me,\"</i> Arachne realized. She still wasn't used to the idea of being fed, but it would be the only way to survive in the lifeless cell. Arachne also didn't like the fact that her food was already dead now, but she didn't dare complain to the little monsters, her captors. Arachne was hungry, but she didn't dare approach the small creature till it was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the small creature slipped and fell in her webbing. Pure instinct took over Arachne and she quickly approached the small creature. Arachne believed the small creature was a dangerous creature, but it was in her webbing now, and anything that got caught in her webbing was her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small creature struggled and screamed, but nothing happened and he was still stuck in her web. Soon, Arachne was in front of the small creature as it was lying on the ground with pure terror in its face. Arachne licked her lips, wondering what the new small creature would taste like. Arachne bent down and outstretched her arms to pick up the small creature who was slightly less than a fourth of her size. Before her hands could grasp the small creature, the creature pleaded, \"Please, stop. Please don't eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small creature's plea was simple, but it was effective to Arachne. Arachne stopped her reach. She had eaten everything that had gotten caught in her web before, but there was something different about this creature. It was one thing eating a dumb and mindless beast, but it was another thing eating something that could speak and even speak the same language. Though her instincts told her to eat the small creature and be done with it, she was feeling uncomfortable about eating a living being that was pleading and was actually speaking. Arachne looked into the creature's eyes and saw that it was actually crying. Arachne sighed, gasped the small creature's torso with both of her hands on either side and pulled it off the webbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix tried to yell for help, but no one would come. No guard would risk his life to save some slave boy. Felix became even more hopeless with he saw the giant dridder heading for him. Felix was in pure shock and terror for a moment as he witnessed the giant dridder. The dridder had the body of a five year old human on top of a spider's body. The spider body was large and black. It was easily the largest part of the dridder. Where the head of a spider normally was, the hips of the human half of the girl emerged. The human part of the dridder had a purple tint to her skin and she had black hair. The dridder's ears were slightly pointed and her eyes were a strange yet beautiful ruby color. Since the dridder was still only five years of age, she was still flat chested, but Felaryans developed more rapidly than other creatures and would have decent sized breasts by the age of eight which only made them seem bigger due to the size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix snapped out of his shock and tried to break free, but it was no use and the dridder was soon upon him. The dridder smiled and licked her lips as she bent down to grab him. Felix screamed out as he closed his eyes shut, crying, \"Please, stop. Please don't eat me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a hesitation, but Felix didn't dare open his eyes. Eventually, her felt the large hands grasp him on each side and peel him off the web. <i>\"This is it. It's all over,\"</i> Felix thought to himself. He began to imagine everything Lord William had told him about dridders' eating habits. Felix imagined the fangs biting into him and putting him in to a comatose state while he was wrapped up in webbing. Then, the dridder would ingest his insides  in due time. However, none of that happened. Instead, Felix felt ground beneath him and the dridder's hands left from under his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix slowly opened his eyes and saw that he was standing on the ground in front of the large dridder no longer on the web. Felix was too confused and too scared to move. All he could do was stare up at the giant dridder as it stared down at him. Felix moved to take a step back and the dridder, in a frightened movement, backed many steps away from Felix. Felix didn't know how to react to this, and he...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix was in total shock at what just happened. He thought that the dridder was going to end his miserable life right then and there, but instead it let him go. He knew that it was thinking of eating him when it was walking toward him from the way it looked at him licking its lips. So why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix just stared up at the giant dridder, completely unaware of the passing time or even the fact that he was still on the other side of the line, as he pondered why the dridder that was supposed to be an evil blood thirsty killer without remorse would spare his life. Even if it did have the food he brought it, it could have still just wrapped him up to save for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Felix's eyes opened wide with realization. <i>\"Did it, spare me because I begged for my life? But how? Even if it does have mercy in its heart, it's from another world, or at least that's what Lord William said, so how could it understand me? Wouldn't it have a different language? Well, I guess there is only one way to find out,\"</i> Felix thought as he worked up the courage to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Excuse m-me but c-c-can you understand me?\" Felix asked. The dridder only gave a slight nod as a response. \"A-Are you sparring me?\" Felix asked as the dridder leaned in a little toward him but stopped when Felix took a few steps back. Again he got a single nod as a response from the giant spider girl. \"So you don't plan on eating me?\" Felix asked with worry in his voice. At this the dridder just lowered and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix felt a lot better with the dridder's answer to his last question but still felt fear of this giant dridder that could so easily end his life. \"Can you talk?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I can. I'm sorry, I just had a bad day. My name is Arachne, what's yours?\" she asked with the same uneasiness that Felix had in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Felix,\" Felix replied as a little more tension lifted from the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a loud knock on the door that caused both Felix and Arachne to practically jump out of there skins. \"Hey slave, you dead in there!?\" shouted one of the guards that stood at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine, I just got caught in the webbing for a moment. I'm free now,\" Felix answered as he held his right hand over his pounding heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! you owe me 5 silver coins!\" shouted the other guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first guards grumbled and shouted, \"Well hurry up, slave, you have other things to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sound of the coins clinging when they were handed over was heard in the cell, Felix just dropped his head. The guards had heard his cry for help and only made a bet as to whether or not he would live through it. Felix then jumped over the webbing and dragged the remaining deer into Arachne's reach. Just then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once, Felix dragged the deer in Arachne's side of the cell, Felix turned to see what she was up to. Arachne seemed to be a nice girl and she was a child who spared his life, but she was still a giant dridder. Felix was still nervous around such a large creature and he wouldn't be able to get used to being around such a creature over night. When Felix turned around, he saw giant spider legs before him. Felix quickly looked up to see that Arachne was now in front of him, very close and bending down to reach for him. This nearly gave Felix a heart attack as he fell backwards on his butt turned his head away and covered his face with crossed arms, because he felt there was no time to run. It was too late for him to do anything. Arachne, despite her size, was too fast and to silent . He never knew she had approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Arachne noticed Felix's reaction, she stopped her advancing hands and looked at Felix with hurt feelings. She thought that the little creature trusted her now, because she told him that she wouldn't eat him and she was telling the truth. She just didn't have the will to eat something that could speak the same language as her, even if it did fall in her web. Because she thought the creature understood he was safe to be around her, she thought she could get closer. She wasn't even reaching down for him, but the deer that he gave her. Arachne didn't say a word to the little creature and instead just kept reaching for the deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix thought that the dridder had changed her mind and was going to wrap him up and eat him. However, Felix never felt her hands grasp his sides. Felix peeked from behind his arms and witnessed Arachne grabbing the deer instead of him. Felix lowered his arms and saw Arachne grasp the deer with two hands and lift it. Normally, the deer would still be heavy for something of Arachne's size, but not heavy enough to have too much trouble. Though, Arachne was a dridder and had insect strength which gave her the ability to lift things that were many times her body weight. Arachne placed the deer under her arachnid body and, with the help of her spider legs turning the deer around, was able wrap the deer up in a webby coffin. Arachne then picked up the deer and placed it on the web with the other deer that she had wrapped up quickly as Felix had started to drag the second deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Arachne was finished, she looked down at the little creature that was frightened of her again. Felix noticed that her ruby eyes were wet and on the verge of tears as she lowered her arachnid body in a lying position to make her look smaller and less intimidating for Felix. However, Arachne's upper human body was still over ten feet tall and her arachnid body was still large as she lied on it. Therefore, Arachne was still a considerably large creature even in a lying position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was surprised to see the deeply saddened expression on Arachne's face when she asked, \"Are you still afraid of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was stunned that the creature was actually saddened by his frightened reaction. This was a giant dridder. It could kill him with little effort. Why would such a large creature care what Felix thought about it? The more Felix thought about it, the more he began to understand. The dridder was a child with feelings and intelligence. It's quite possible the child dridder didn't quite understand why size makes a difference and sees Felix as a person since he could speak and had feelings like the dridder. Now, add in the fact that this child had been taken from its world and was now being held prisoner in this terribly depressing and lonely place. Felix knew what it was like to suddenly be held prisoner and become a slave without his consent. Being a slave was all that Felix knew and he had been a slave since he was five years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I became a slave when I was no older than this dridder here,\"</i> Felix realized, <i>\"I remember how lonely and miserable I felt. This dridder must be feeling the same way. Though my size is smaller than her, she seems to see me as a person and want me to accept her. It must really hurt her feelings to see me frightened of her. I know I'd be saddened if people thought I was a monster and fear me in my time of need.\"</i> Though Felix realized this, it was still very hard to have no fear for the giant creature before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stared up at the towering vertical upper half for the dridder as she looked down. Trying his best not to try and harm the dridder's feeling any more than they were, Felix tried to explain the reasons he was afraid of her, \"I'm sorry, but you are quite scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Felix could continue his explanation, Arachne questioned with tears rolling down her face, \"But why are you afraid of me? Why do you and the other creatures think I'm a monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Arachne, that's your name, right?\" Felix questioned. Arachne simply nodded and Felix continued, \"How old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm five, but what does that have to do with being a monster?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm ten years old,\" Felix explained, \"So, I'm five years older than you, yet you're close to five times taller than me. Your species is much larger than mine. You could end up attacking me and I wouldn't have the power to stop you. Wouldn't you be scared of something that could do that to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Arachne answered, \"But I can't help being larger than you. If I could be littler to make you not be scared of me, I would. It's not fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but something that is a different species and much larger is scary to people. It's natural for people to fear things that are potentially dangerous,\" Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not dangerous,\" Arachne argued, \"I won't hurt you, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're telling me the truth, but I'm still going to be fearful of you,\" Felix told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm a monster?\" Arachne whimpered with watery eyes and a quivering lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging from our first meeting, you don't seem to be,\" Felix informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why are you still afraid of me?\" Arachne whimpered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I still don't know you yet,\" Felix told her, \"You are a creature that I have never seen before and because of my natural fear of much larger creatures, you have to give me time to get used to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long till you get used to me?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Felix stated truthfully, \"But you seem like a nice girl and it might not take as long as you think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne sniffed and dried her tears before asking, \"If you get to know me better, could we be friends, Felix?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not,\" Felix replied while finally standing up. This cheered Arachne up and she was getting more comfortable around Felix. \"Well, I wish I could stay, but I have other things to do,\" Felix informed her, \"I'll be back to feed you dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne suddenly remembered the reason she had approached Felix in the first place, other than to grab the deer. She wanted to ask him why she was here and what he and the other little creatures wanted from her. However, Felix seemed to be in a hurry. Did Arachne ask him what was going on?</span></div></div>",

As he was trying to pull the cart up, its wheel got stuck in the line that was carved into the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you and the other...um...whatever you are want with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Felix froze for a moment, completely forgetting the stuck cart and turning to face Arachne. \"Well...er...It's not me or the guards that want you. It's Lord William.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this Arachne leaned her head to the side in confusion. \"Who or what is a Lord William?\" Arachne asked as she sat her spider half back down with her human half still upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well a Lord is what you call a master of the land who is not of royal blood. And his name is William.\" Felix explained as best he could in hopes that she understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"OK I think I get it. But what dose he, she, or it want with me?\" Arachne again questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants your power...He always wants more power. He plans to make you his slave so he can use you to get even more land and power,\" Felix told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Arachne was even more confused now. \"What is a slave?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a slave. A slave is someone who another person owns and does whatever the owner, or master as they are called tells them to do,\"Felix informed Arachne<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now Arachne was getting upset. \"Well he's not going to make me a slave! And you should stop being a slave to,\" Arachne argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just stop being a slave,\" Felix started before he was interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can. Just say no and that will be that.\" Arachne argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that simple,\" Felix tried to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Arachne asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To make you his slave he will hurt you. He will cause you as much pain and fear as he can till you do as your told. All his slaves live in fear of what he will do to us if we disobey. And if he can't break your spirit...There is this spell. I saw him do it once. It hurts him a lot but if he wants you, he will do it. He even explained how it works. What it does is it makes you a puppet. You can see, hear, and feel everything but you can't control yourself. You can't do anything unless he tells you to,\" Felix stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Arachne's eyes widened at this and only fear showed on her face. \"B-But, I don't want to be a slave,\" Arachne said as tears flowed from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one wants to be a slave. It's just the way things are,\" Felix said as he lifted the cart out of the carved line and started pushing the cart toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-F-Felix.\" Arachne said as tears flowed down from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Arachne,\" Felix said as he turned to face her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Can I have a hug?\" Felix was surprised by this but he remembered when he first came to this place and was going through what she was. He was so depressed, he would have killed for a hug, so how could he say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK but just for a HEY!\" Felix was cut off as he was snatched up by Arachne while he was walking to her.  Arachne clutched him close to her chest with a firm but harmless grip. And he felt his upper back get wet as her tears fell on his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um A-Arachne I must leave soon so I can't stay long...Arachne?\" Felix told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#1: Arachne did not hear him and she cries herself to sleep clutching Felix tight and when he gets out the next day, Felix is given a brutal beating for missing his other chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#2 Arachne heard him and let him go and when he was cleaning in the throne room, he heard Lord William telling one of his men that he did not want to wait and to prepare the beast for the control spell in the morning.</span></div></div>",

Arachne looked at the human in her hands and apologized for hugging him so long, \"Sorry, Felix. It's just that this was my first hug. You're the first creature that let me hug you and I enjoyed it very much. I really needed that hug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Felix assured Arachne, \"I remember how I felt when I first got here. This place can make you feel terrible things. This was my first hug and I enjoyed it too. Unfortunately, I have more duties to attend to before I can come back to feed you diner. So, could you put me down please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, sorry,\" Arachne apologized seeing that she still was holding Felix even though he needed to do his duties. Felix noticed that Arachne's purple skin around her cheeks turned bluish. Felix assumed that she was blushing and her blush was a different color since she had a different color skin. Arachne was still lying on her spider body so she just had to bend her back a little and lower her hands to set Felix on the ground. When Felix's feet touched the ground and Arachne took her hands away from his body, she asked, \"So, you liked the hug too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did like your hug,\" Felix answered truthfully, \"I've never had such contact before. I've been here for five years and never found anyone who cares about me. That hug, at least for that moment, gave me hope that there is good in this world and that I might just find a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, we are alike more than I realized,\" Arachne replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but let's save our past for a different conversation, like for tonight when I have more time to speak with you. But, I have one more request before I leave,\" Felix informed Arachne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time you decide to pick me up, could you warn me your doing so or ask for my permission? I know you won't hurt me and you only being friendly, but it's kind of scary when I'm suddenly being picked up by something as large and powerful as you are,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I understand. I won't pick you up so quickly and I will ask and warn you first from now on,\" Arachne promised, \"As long as it helps you see me as a friend. I've never had a friend before and I think I would really like you to be my first friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will like you as my friend as well,\" Felix admitted to the twenty-five foot five year old dridder before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be back for dinner, right?\" Arachne questioned just as Felix turned to push the cart once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'm responsible of feeding you. So, I'll see you three times a day,\" Felix informed her. He turned to see that it was slightly saddening Arachne that he was leaving the cell, but his words seemed to have cheered her up and she gave a slight smile back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will be waiting for you to come back and I will be glad to see you again,\" Arachne stated, still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you at dinner,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Felix could leave, Arachne questioned, \"Wait, you never told me what sort of creature you are.\" Arachne had heard of many creature, though she hadn't seen all of them. She was hoping she would know Felix's species though she hadn't seen his kind yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a human,\" Felix informed Arachne just before he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the doors shut, Arachne's face turned pale and she whispered, \"F-Felix is... a... a h-human?\" Arachne had never seen a human until now, but she had heard many stories about humans. The one thing that she heard most often was that humans were delicious and a delicacy. She had heard from other Felaryans that any creature that comes across a human and lets them go is a fool. She had heard that humans needed to be eaten and they were too good to pass up. Humans are just a snack and nothing more. Arachne backed up back into her corner to think about what she should do next. She had to think carefully on the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had eaten dinner with the rest of the slaves and was now doing his final duty before he had to feed Arachne. Dinner had been like any other dinner: the food was tasteless and bland and the whole dinner was impersonal. There was no talking, no conversation. There was only other slaves keeping to themselves and only caring about themselves and keeping themselves behaved so that they weren't punished or tortured. Felix hated meals, but it wasn't like it was any different from the rest of his day. It's not like there was some other slave he had befriended. <i>\"It's sad when the only friend I have is a giant spider-like creature that supposedly eats humans and other small creatures without remorse,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"Though, Arachne seems like a nice girl and it doesn't seem like she would be able to bring herself to eat me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was scrubbing the floors as he thought about the Felaryan dridder. Lord William had told him that Felaryans were terrible monsters that ate anything that was smaller than them without remorse and it didn't matter to them whether the small creature had intelligence or not. Yet, Arachne was different. She couldn't bring herself to eat Felix when he pleaded and she was willing to become friends with him. <i>\"I wonder how this could be. Could it be because she's only a child and she's had to take care of herself? She said she's never had a hug before, maybe she didn't have parents that took care of her,\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"She also might not have been taught to eat small creatures no matter what since she was alone. Then again, it could be due to the fact that's she's so lonely and desperate and would befriend any creature to be happy. Or it could be all those reasons.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix decided not to think about it anymore for the time being. <i>\"Maybe I could find the answer when I talk with her when I feed her dinner,\"</i> Felix said to himself. Just as Felix stopped thinking about Arachne and why she was different from what Lord William had described her to be, Felix overheard Lord William speaking to another man in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my Lord, you may not have to use that spell,\" the man argued with Lord William trying his best to persuade Lord William from doing something, \"You haven't even given us a chance to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This creature is a dangerous beast,\" Lord William informed the man coldly, \"It's not some simple horse that can be tamed. It's a Felaryan monster. I have a feeling that this creature will needed to be controlled by magical means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know how badly that spell weakens you and that's when you are forced to control strong willed humans. This beast is large. How much life will it drain from you,\" the man pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William hesitated. The man had brought up a good enough point. \"Perhaps I should reconsider a bit,\" Lord William muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must think of your health, my lord,\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want the ceremony to be prepared for tomorrow night, though,\" Lord William commanded, \"You will start training that creature between its meals. If there is a slight improvement and you can show me that you can have it tamed in time, then I will not have to use the spell. However, if you can't show any progress what so ever, then I will just use the spell tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should give use a week for improvement,\" the man suggested, \"Even wild horses could take a few days to show improvement in being tamed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will think about it,\" Lord William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lord William and the man dispersed, Felix knew that he had to warn Arachne about Lord William's plans.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't the easiest thing to live alone in Felarya, especially since she was human sized when she was first born. This is why dridders have a large amount of children; so that one of the hundred could beat the odds of surviving in Felarya. Once Arachne grew big enough, it was easier to live in Felarya. However, Arachne still had a few more growth spurts needed before she could grow to her normal size as a giant dridder of five years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause she was alone, she never had parents that cared for her. No one to look after her and no Felaryan to trust since all the Felaryans she had seen were giants. Normally, this lack of care and nurture probably should have messed her mind up and should have filled her personality with mistrust and empathy. However, Arachne was a different case. Instead, it just increased her longing for a friend, someone to care about her. However, in Felarya, the only intelligent lifeforms Arachne had come across were the giant Felaryans she couldn't trust and were afraid of. So, she was very lonely in Felarya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she had ended up in another realm far away from her cozy cave and captured by terrible humans that treated her like she was a monster. Then they forced her in a dark and dank cell, which she wouldn't mind if it weren't for her being chained up. Then Arachne found met Felix and he seemed to actually care about her. He could end up being her friend, her first actually friend. The only problem was that he was a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Those other Felaryans. I've overheard them so many times and they always talk about catching and eating humans. All some of them talk about is how scrumptious and irresistible humans are,\"</i> Arachne thought to herself. by the way the Felaryans talked, Arachne had decided from then on that she would find a human and try eating it, but she had never come across one and never knew what it looked like, until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But, they never said anything about humans being intelligent,\"</i> Arachne continued to argue with herself, <i>\"I can't eat a person. That would just make me a monster. But, all that talk about how taste humans are. I so badly want to try one.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But what about Felix?\"</i> Arachne wondered, <i>\"He's a human, and he's the only person I've come across that actually cares about me. He's the only friend I have. I can't eat him, and even if I eat another human instead, what would Felix think?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do?\" Arachne whispered. Before she could think of anything else, the door opened and Felix entered the room with the cart of food and water. \"Felix!\" Arachne gasped both happy and sad to see him enter the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, I have to tell you something,\" Felix started. Felix was pushing the cart forward unaware of Arachne's conflict within herself. Arachne was trying to fight back the craving she had for Felix, but she feared she might not win, which would mean that Felix was in danger. Felix was assuming Arachne was safe to be around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Felix! I have to tell you something,\" Arachne told him, hoping he would listen so that she could warn him in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, what I have is very important, I have to tell you what Lord William is planing,\" Felix interrupted, much closer to the line now and with no sign of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, don't come near me!\" Arachne cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was confused by the dridders command  and stopped before he could reach the line. Arachne began to tear up. \"Wh-What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a human. You're not safe with me,\" Arachne cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I not safe with you anymore?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are other giant people in Felarya, and I overhear them talking once and a while,\" Arachne started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by overhear them and what do you overhear?\" Felix interrogated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was younger and more human sized, Felaryans tried to eat me, just because I was little. It didn't matter to them that I was only a child and a person. Even though I'm 25 feet tall now, I still stay away from them. I overhear them talk about humans. They never say what they look like. So, I didn't know what a human was. They only talked about how tasty humans were. They talked about how they liked to swallow them whole and let them squirm in their mouth and use their tongue to play with the creatures before swallowing. They talk about how they like it when they moved around in their stomach and how scrumptious they tasted. It made me want to try a human, though I had no idea humans were intelligent beings,\" Arachne answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, it sounds like you don't want to eat me. Why am I not safe?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though I don't want to hurt you because you both a person and my friend, I'm still curious and I still have the craving for eating a human. The way the taste was described makes the taste sound so... so...\" Arachne explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irresistible?\" Felix finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I fear that I might not be able to control myself. I don't want to eat you, Felix. You're the only friend I have. You're safer if you're not within my reach,\" Arachne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, the fact that you're worried about my well-being and the fact that you don't want to hurt me is what's keeping me safe. Your worry will keep you from hurting me since you see me as a friend. I'm safe with you,\" Felix informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be so sure?\" Arachne questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, other giant Felaryans have tried to eat you just because you were smaller, right?\" Felix asked..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I don't understand where this is going,\" Arachne replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it. Do you remember how it felt when those giants didn't view you as a person and only thought you were a taste little snack?\" Felix continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was terrible,\" Arachne admitted, \"Those giants are just monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to become one of them and eat a human just because you heard they were tasty. Do you want to view people as little snacks and put them through the fear and sadness you went through?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I would never want to put people through what I went through. I don't want to become a monster,\" Arachne informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you keep that in mind, you will never become a monster and I will be safe with you and I will always be your friend,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we can be friends?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stepped over the line and was within Arachne's reach. Felix looked up at the large five year old as she towered over him with her long spider legs giving her much height. \"As long as you don't eat me, I will be your friend,\" Felix told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Arachne holds back her craving and doesn't try to eat Felix. Instead, she brings him into another hug, after his permission of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Arachne is controlled by her craving for a bit, but is able to stop herself before she can wrap Felix up completely and before she can bite him. Arachne is very sorry and feels terrible for trying to eat Felix.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arachne noticed that Felix had stepped over the line and was within her reach. She could snatch him up right then and there. She could finally find out what those Felaryans were talking about and how tasty a human really was. Well, not quite since she was still not large enough to swallow Felix whole and wouldn't get the same experience the Felaryans do. However, the craving and curiosity was still strong inside Arachne and it didn't help with Felix being within her reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne bent her spider legs to lower her spider body on the ground, though she was still much taller than Felix. Arachne then moved her hands towards Felix. Her hands were reaching out to grab Felix's torso and carry him with her hands under his arms. Arachne's mouth created saliva at the very thought of finally eating a tasty human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Arachne's hands stopped before they could grab Felix. She stared at the cringing Felix whose muscles were tensed up and whose eyes were shut tightly. Felix was afraid of her. Arachne remembered back to when Felix had pleaded to her, when he had got caught in her web and begged for his life. <i>\"Humans can speak and they have feelings,\"</i> Arachne told herself, <i>\"Though their upper body is the only thing that similar to me physically, Humans are very much like me on the inside. They're people. How can other Felaryans eat people?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Those other Felaryans are monsters, that's what they are,\"</i> Arachne continued, <i>\"Eating a person is killing a person and that makes one a monster for doing so. If I eat Felix, I'd become a monster, just like the other giants. I have put Felix through the very same fears I went through when I was small.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne's mouth was no longer filling up with saliva, but her eyes were dispersing tears as she realized what was happening. <i>\"Humans are not food. They may be tasty and they may be small, but they are people and eating one makes a person a monster. I cannot eat Felix. I don't want to be a monster,\"</i> Arachne decided, <i>\"And, Felix is my friend. He's the only person I've found that's kind enough to care for me. He's so nice and kind to me. He doesn't want to eat me and doesn't think I'm a monster. He may be the only friend I'd find. If I eat him, it would all be over. I would never become his friend and may never find another person willing to be my friend. I'd be alone forever. I can't eat Felix. He means too much for me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne became saddened as she realized that she scared Felix with her reaching. She reached with one hand and placed the palm of it on Felix's shoulder, though the large hand took up a lot more than just Felix's shoulder. \"F-Felix,\" Arachne spoke. Felix opened his eyes and looked up at the giant five year old face with tear soaked cheeks. \"I... I'm not going to eat you. I don't want to be a monster, and you're my friend. I... I don't want to lose you,\" Arachne informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix visibly relaxed when he heard Arachne's words. He was safe with the giant Felaryan dridder who saw him as a friend. \"Thank you for telling me why I can't eat you,\" Arachne continued, \"If you wouldn't have said those words, I might have... I might of...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne began to cry again, and Felix placed a hand on the back of the large hand on his shoulder. He was amazed at how big the twenty-five foot spider's hand was compared to his own. \"It's alright Arachne. I forgive you. You didn't know any better,\" Felix assured her, \"Now that I know you're not going to eat me, I know that I am safe with you, Arachne, and I think we can easily be friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne smiled and tears of joy began coming out instead of tears filled with apology. \"F-Felix, c-can I... h-hug you, again?\" Arachne asked. Felix nodded and told Arachne it was alright to pick him up and hug him. Arachne was gladdened by this and she placed her hands under his arms, picking him up and pressing him against her chest. Felix knew that his arms had no chance of wrapping around Arachne. So, he just laid his head down on Arachne's soft and smooth skin. Felix was very comfortable, even if he was being held by a giant spider child. Felix could hear Arachne's heart with thumped against the back of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug was far longer than the last hug, but neither of them cared. Both of them enjoyed the hug very much. Eventually, Arachne stopped the hug and set Felix back on the ground once more. \"Thank you, Felix. You're a great friend. I don't know what I'd do without you,\" Arachne said, \"Now that I know what it's like to have a friend, I don't ever want to go back to the life without a friend. I promise that I will keep you safe and you will never be in danger when I'm around you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Arachne,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix walked over to the cart and pushed it over the line. That way, Arachne could just pick the deer up from the cart without Felix having to drag it to her. As Arachne stood up to wrap the new deer up in her web, Felix filled Arachne's water bowl. \"Um, Felix?\" Arachne questioned as she put the deer on her web, \"Weren't you going to tell me something important before I interrupted you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix soon realized that he had been so busy helping Arachne see him as a person, he didn't tell her about Lord William's plans. \"It's about Lord William, the one that's keeping you here as a prisoner,\" Felix informed the giant dridder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne paused what she was doing and turned to look at Felix. \"Wh-what about him?\" Arachne asked. She had heard from Felix how terrible her capture was and she didn't want to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how I said he had some sort of ritual he could do to control people like puppets?\" Felix asked. Arachne nodded her head and Felix continued, \"Well, if the tamers don't show any improvement in 'taming' you, he's going to do the ritual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's... he's going to force me to do what he wants, and I won't be able to stop it?\" Arachne quivered. Felix had told her about the ritual and how Lord William would control her body, making her do whatever he wanted. \"I... I don't want that to happen. What do we do?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either we find a way out of this place soon, or you have to pretend that those men are taming you,\" Felix informed Arachne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to get out of this place, but do you have a way of doing that?\" Arachne questioned.</span></div></div>",

If I tried, I would be killed.\"  Archane looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there's no hope for me?\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Archane, I couldn't do it alone, but with your help, I could think of a plan,\" Felix replied firmly.  The dridder looked back at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help, in anyway I can,\" Archane answered.  Felix smiled at Archane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get going before the guards begin to suspect something.  I'll be back in the morning,\" Felix assured her.  Archane nodded and watched Felix exit through the door.  Tears came to her eyes.  She was used to being alone, back in her home cave.  But then, she had no one to call friend.  She had to fend for herself and could trust no one.  But now she was friends with Felix.  And she knew she would never harm Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I hope Felix can think of something</i>\" Archane thought before taking her meal and started sucking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took ya?\" the guard asked when Felix left the room.  Felix didn't look at the guard as he pushed the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slipped on some fluid,\" Felix said.  The guard laughed at Felix's \"misfortune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish you could be with the wenches washing clothes?\" the guard taunted.  Felix said nothing, thinking about the women slaves whose duty was to was clothes for the guards and Lord William.  As he walked away, he slowed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The wenches, they complain about using the underground river that passes under the castle  The rapids down stream are filled with rocks that have killed those who tried to swim.  Maybe we could escape upriver?</i>\" Felix realized.  He had stopped fully.  His mind drew out the sole memory of going to the river, taking a pair of pants a soldier wanted cleaned right away, but the cleaners didn't believe him.  He was whipped badly for his failure.   As he thought about the place, it was large enough for Archane to swim  or climb the walls about.  But as his mind came back to the now, he wanted to turn around and rush back to Archane, but he had no reason.  He couldn't say he forgot something or he'd be beaten.  Slowly, he began walking again, hating the fact he couldn't get to Archane.  He remembered the first night he spent in this hell hole.  He had no doubt Archane would have an equally bad night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the cart in the kitchen before going back where the slaves sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'll just have to rush there first thing with her food to tell her about this,</i>\" Felix decided.  He laid down and fell into a light sleep, hoping he would wake before the tamer and his men reached Archane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was early morning when Felix was woken by someone moving over him.  It was a woman, probably just sent back from a soldier's room.  He stayed still for a moment, wondering if he should try getting to Archane now.   He could see small rays of sunlight coming from the window high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go,\" Felix whispered to himself.  Slowly, he rose up and looked around.  The one who woke him was laying down with her back to him.  Felix smiled with a small hope he would be out of this place soon and ran for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knocked and waited.  A burly man appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want slave?\" the assistant cook demanded, rubbing some sleep from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came for the carcass for the dridder,\" Felix said.  The man glared at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One moment,\" the cook ordered.  A few minutes later, the man returned with the carcass of a buck and a bowl of water.  Felix thanked the man and went on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed as he walked the path to Archane's cell.  A new guard was in front of it.</span></div></div>",

His head was also stooped downwards. However, when Felix got closer to the guard, the man's head looked up and turned towards the noisy cart coming down the dungeon hall. The man glared at Felix and growled, \"What are you doing here so early, slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't sleep. So, I thought that I might as well feed the creature and get its breakfast over and done with,\" Felix made up a lie to convince the guard, \"Plus, the dridder might still be asleep and I won't have to worry about it eating me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that the guard wasn't a morning person and he hated being here on the most boring of duties early in the morning. The creature was heavy chained up after all and there was no way for it to escape. What could possibly happen for it to escape? No one would be dumb enough to free it. The guard groaned and turned himself towards the human sized door. Now he had to keep awake for the slave boy and open the door for him when he needed to enter and leave when all the guard wanted to do was sleep. <i>\"Why did I take Eric's shift? If I would have known that it was such an early shift before I told him I'd do it, I would have never agreed to it. He owes me big time,\"</i> the guard thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard fumbled with the key chain full of many keys, trying to find the right key to open the door. Felix noticed that some of them were very large and different from the others. Eventually, the guard found the right one and unlocked the door for Felix. Once the door was open, the guard moved out of the way. The grumpy guard grumbled, \"Get going!\" Felix began to push the cart and the guard added, \"Move your ass, slave. Feed the monster quickly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Felix was through the doorway, the guard closed the door behind. Felix looked around the dark room, trying to have his eyes adjust to the darkness. Felix looked around for Arachne, but couldn't see her. Somehow, Arachne blended in with the dark quite well, despite her size being so large and her human half having purplish skin. Felix continued to push the cart in Arachne's half of the cell, avoiding the sticky strands of webbing. \"Arachne,\" Felix called out as quietly as he could as he looked around at her web which was much larger than he had last seen it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two large ruby colored eyes appeared in the darkness. Felix knew that they were Arachne's eyes and once he saw them, he could just barely see the outline of the rest of her body. Arachne had laid her spider body on the ground and laid the rest of her body down as well. She was in a strange web that resembled a tent. Her giant body laid in that \"tent\" without the worry of sticking to the web since none of her body could. The ruby eyes looked tired as if just waking up, but when they feel upon Felix, the eyes widened and lit up with excitement and joy. \"Felix!\" The giant Felaryan dridder called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Felix could blink, Arachne was no longer in the web tent, but in front of him towering over him as she stood at her full height. It was clear that Arachne was happy to see him again She was so excited to see her only friend again, that she forgot to ask for his consent as she bent her human body and picked Felix up. Arachne brought him against her chest again and firmly hugged his doll-sized body, well doll-sized to her. \"Oh Felix, I missed you. Last night was horrible. It was so scary without you. I'm so glad you're back. I really am,\" Arachne informed him as she continued her embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell, because you sort of forgot to ask me before picking me up again,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne brought Felix out of her hug and put her arms straight out with a hand under each of Felix's arms again. \"I'm so sorry,\" Arachne apologized, \"I forgot. Please don't be mad at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I understand,\" Felix assured her, \"I remember my first night in this castle, and I was about your same age when it happened. I understand how scary it is. I'm not mad at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Felix. Um, Felix, can I continue the hug?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Felix answered and as soon as that single word departed from his mouth, Arachne brought him into a firm hug once again. The hug was long, but it was eventually ended and Arachne set Felix on the ground and laid her spider body down on the ground. \"Hey, did you get any bigger?\" Felix questioned as he noticed that Arachne seemed a little bit bigger than yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne looked at herself and then compared her size with Felix. \"I think you're right,\" Arachne agreed, \"I did get bigger, but by how much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say you grew about ten more feet,\" Felix said as he stared up at Arachne in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been having a lot of growth spurts lately,\" Arachne informed Felix, \"I think I'm growing to my natural height with each spurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big are you supposed to get?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but something in my mind is telling me that the normal height for a giant dridder like me is about 75 feet,\" Arachne said. Arachne looked down and saw that Felix was nervous around her again. Arachne recognized that this was because he was worried about her being so big. \"Please don't be scared, Felix. I promise that no matter how big I get, you'll always be my friend and I will never hurt you,\" Arachne tried to assure him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix seemed to be calmed by that statement and Arachne grabbed the cart. She took the deer out and began her wrapping. \"Arachne, I think I may have found a way out,\" Felix informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne stopped wrapping the deer right away and bent down closer to Felix till her large face was almost level with Felix. \"R-Really? A way out of here? Can we leave now?\" Arachne asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a problem with that. I'm not sure how to get those chains off you,\" Felix pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne's hopes seemed to dash away as she replied sadly, \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, can I get a closer look at one of them?\" Felix asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne lowered one of her hands to Felix and he looked at the cuff around her wrist. He found the keyhole to it and saw how large it was. <i>\"It would need a huge key to unlock this. Wait, the guard had some unusually large keys on that chain. Could one of those keys unlock these chains?\"</i> Felix wondered. \"I might know a way to get these chains off you,\" Felix told her, \"There is a guard outside that has some large keys. They could be the keys needed to unlock the cuffs around your wrists and waist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we get these chains off, can we leave this morning?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's highly possible,\" Felix stated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the cell, the guard tried his hardest to stay awake. He rubbed his eyes once more, hoping to keep his eye lids from drifting downwards. \"What is taking that boy so long?\" the guard muttered, \"Does it really take that long to feed a monster? You'd think he'd want to spend the least amount of time possible in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard yawned and sleepiness was much stronger in his mind now, ready to place a blanket of dreams on his brain. <i>\"If I fall asleep now, the slave will be trapped in the cell with that monster, and if he needs help, I won't be able to save him,\"</i> the guard realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Screw it,\"</i> the guard decided quickly, <i>\"If the slave is trapped in the cell or he dies from that beast, it's his own damn fault for taking so long and coming so early. Besides, what's another dead slave.\"</i> The guard let his eye lids cover his eyes as he leaned against the wall once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix walked to the door quietly and peeked through the iron bars the door was made of. The guard was asleep, just as Felix had hoped. Felix's eyes locked onto his target, the key chain on the guard's belt. Felix put his hand through the bars and realized that his whole arm could fit through as well. Felix pushed his arm through the bars and reached for the keys slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix's fingertips touched the cold metal of the keys causing them to clang against each other. Felix froze and the guard stirred, but never opened his eyes. Felix stood frozen at the door with one arm still sticking thought the bars of the door stretched to the keys around the guard\u2019s belt. Felix's heart hammered beneath his chest and he perspired from the event, but he didn't wipe his forehead. He didn't dare move an inch, fearing it would wake up the guard and his plans would be foiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong moments passed and the guard was still fast asleep. <i>\"He's still asleep, Felix. Get a grip,\"</i> Felix thought, trying to encourage himself, <i>\"You can do this. All you have to do is reach out and take the keys.\"</i> Felix reached out again, but much slower and gentler. Felix grabbed the keys themselves and gently pressed them together so they wouldn\u2019t jangle as he brought them to the door. Felix pulled the keys off the guard's belt and pulled them through the bars without alerting the guard of anything unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix turned around to see Arachne waiting as close as she could with the restricting chains around her. She was clearly waiting in hopes that Felix obtained the keying. Upon seeing Felix approaching her with the keys in hand, Arachne nearly yelped with joy, but luckily she stopped herself in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix eventually reached the giant five year old dridder that was gitty with excitement. \"I hope this works,\" Felix said, \"Could you lower a wrist for me?\" Arachne complied with Felix's request, and Felix found the keyhole for the cuff. Felix studied it and then the keys. He picked a key that seemed to be the right size. The key fit and turned. The cuff on Arachne's right wrist split and fell away onto the ground which luckily wasn't too high up and didn't make too loud of a sound. Arachne lifted her right hand and stared at her free wrist in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, I need to see your other wrist,\" Felix informed her. Arachne snapped out of her trance and lowered her left wrist. Felix unlocked that cuff as well. \"It looks like the only one left is around your waist,\" Felix pointed out, \"I'm going to need a lift to unlock it.\" Arachne agreed and picked up Felix so that he could unlock the cuff around her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this was done, there were no longer any chains restricting Arachne. Arachne was so happy that she pulled Felix into a hug again and whispered, \"Thank you, Felix. I'm free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not out of this yet,\" Felix replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix soon found himself at the door once again. He had already told Arachne his plan. She was a little hesitant about the idea, but Felix assured her that it was what they needed to do. Felix unlocked the door by putting his arm through the bars. The guard didn't even budge from his position leaning against the wall by the door. <i>\"He's tired and a heavy sleeper. For once, luck is on my side today,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix opened the door and walked to the larger door that Arachne could fit through. Felix found the right key and unlocked it. Arachne could hear the unlocking from the other side and waited a bit before trying to push the door open. Arachne did it as slow as she could. When it was opened enough for her to get through, she squeezed through. She looked down at Felix below her who pointed at the guard. This was the part of the plan Arachne didn't want to do, but Felix had convinced her earlier it was for the best. Arachne shot out a stream of webbing which covered the guard as he tried to wake up. His mouth was covered and the rest of his body was encased in a cocoon. His nose on up were free from the cocoon so that he would live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne picked up the guard and placed him in the cell before closing the big doors. \"I should probably carry you so that we get there faster,\" Arachne suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Felix agreed before she picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me the way,\" Arachne commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix pointed Arachne the way to the underground river and they were able to use the underground dungeons to get there. Luckily, they didn't run into anymore people. Arachne walked through a large, cavernous archway and they were on the rocky platform in front of the underground river. Felix smiled, thinking they had finally made it. Felix looked up at Arachne and saw a very worried and frightened face staring at the water. \"Arachne, what's wrong?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't say anything about water,\" Arachne whispered, \"I... I can't swim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't swim?\" Felix asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm afraid. I can't do this,\" Arachne panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, listen to me,\" Felix demanded, trying to calm her down, \"You not going to have to get in the water. You can climb the walls easily, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I...\" Arachne worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, every thing's going to be alright. You're not going to fall in the water. Trust me,\" Felix interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne took many deep breaths and replied, \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I think you should crawl on the walls and go upstream. If they realize we used the underground river, they might think we went downstream. They wouldn't think we'd go up river,\" Felix suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Arachne agreed and started climbing the walls while pressing Felix's body close to hers. They continued up river for a long time and they were far from the platform, but something bad happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix blinked a few times as he felt Arachane's body undulate behind him.  Darkness was all around him.  He could not see his hand three feet from his face.  Only his senses of hearing and touch helped him.  The air was heavy with water and dankness he had known from his years as a slave.  He felt Arachane's grip tighten every once in a while.  He had no idea how long they had been going, but given the feel of wind on his face, he knew it was a good pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hearing told him things as well.  First, Arachane was taking deep breaths frequently and whimpering every once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Probably worried about falling in,\"</i> Felix thought as he turned to the river.  While he could not see the black water racing below, his ears told him the river was running quickly.  He finally chanced speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachane,\" Felix called out.  He felt a sudden stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix?  Is everything all right?\" she asked, breathing deeply as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all right.  I was just going to ask you how you were doing,\" Felix replied.  What Felix did not see was his worry made Arachane smile for the first time since they began moving into the tunnel.  She was happy she had him with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If it wasn't for Felix, I know I wouldn't be here .. . trying to escape over . . . a river,\"</i> Arachane thought as her breathing quickened even more from remembering the fast moving waters beneath her.  Her vision allowed her to see very clearly in the darkness and her legs were sticking well against the stone.  She just had to keep looking forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Felix, but I don't want to talk to much, not with the . . .\" she replied.  Felix felt the chest rise once more and injected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.  Let's get moving,\" Felix said.  He felt Arachane's breathing slow down and soon she was moving again.  But in her haste, Arachane did not see the small crevice in the lower part of the wall as she approached.  She did not see the water coming from it.  She just kept moving and soon found her back foot landing in the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH!\" Arachane screamed as she lurched forward.  She felt her hands fly open and watched in slow motion as Felix fell into the river.  Her eyes narrowed with fear.  Felix wasn't coming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix felt the lurch and before he could scream from being airborne, he hit the cold mountain water.  A new darkness surrounded him and he panicked and tried to swim to the surface.  Finally, he broke the surface in time to hit a rock.  It was wet and so slippery.  The water was draining all warmth from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARACHANE!\" Felix screamed as he was pressed against the rock,  trying to climb on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachane turned about and looked down the river when she heard the scream.  \"FELIX!\" she cried out.  He was a hundred feet behind her, in the middle of the river clinging to a rock for dear life.  She moved quickly towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the roaring of the water at his ears, Felix just barely heard his friend's call.  \"Ara*<i>cough</i>*Chane!\" he responded, looking blindly around, until he saw them, two large red eyes looking down at him.  Relief filled his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachane reached to her friend from her place on the side, but could not reach him.  She was short by ten feet.  Tears came to her eyes as she wanted so badly to save her friend.  She saw his grip loosening.  Biting her lips, she knew what she had to do.  Swim or not, Felix was going to die if she kept doing nothing.  So, she jumped and quickly grabbed Felix with her hand.  But she fell short of the other bank and pushed Felix above her head as she hit the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix saw the eyes approach him quickly and a familiar hand grab him, then quickly push him upward when Arachane began to fall.  He heard the large splash Arachane made, but nothing else.  Arachane was where she landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young dridder quickly got to her feet and realized the water did not even come to her knees.  She began to laugh and moved to the bank, clutching Felix to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, are you all right?\" Arachane asked looking down at her friend.  Something seemed off, but his safety was all that mattered at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be all right,\" Felix said as he felt the cold air chill his wet skin, \"Thank you for jumping in for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't let you die,\" Arachane replied, bringing Felix into her breast for another warming hug.  As she did, she lifted her hind legs and pulled out some webbing.  With a free hand, she grabbed it.  \"Felix,\" she said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I wrap you in some webbing?  That way I won't worry about dropping you again,\" Arachane inquired.  Felix smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds wise,\" he answered before finding his lower regions wrapped in his friend's webbing.  It did wonders to warm his cold body.  It went as far as his neck and felt himself pulled up to  Arachane's neck.  He recalled seeing a lady visitor dressed up with some jewel around her neck.  He imagined he looked similar on Arachane.  \"Ready?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" his friend responded before starting once more.  But what they did not realize, from Felix being too cold and Arachane being too worried, was Felix's rags he called clothes, if you could consider them clothes at all, were all but destroyed by the river, leaving him very nearly naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed, with warmth fighting out the cold that filled his bones, and Arachane soon came upon a new place</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arachne came upon a fork in the path. One path continued upstream against the underground river. The other path started as a rocky shore for the river and continued into a large tunnel big enough for Arachne. Also, Arachne and Felix could see a light coming from around the corner as the dry tunnel turned. Given that Arachne was frightened of water and that the dry path seemed to lead to a way out, it was an easy choice for Arachne as she took the dry tunnel. She was glad she was on the right side of the wall to go to the tunnel, otherwise, she would have had to go on the ceiling and go upside down to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was on the dry tunnel, Arachne got off the wall and placed all eight legs on the floor. Arache let out and exasperated sigh of relief. Felix looked up at what he could of Arachne as he dangled from her neck. \"You did it, Arachne,\" Felix congratulated the forty-five foot tall five year old dridder that was is only friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne looked down at her little human friend so that he was about to see her pretty and youthful face.\"I did, and it's thanks to you, Felix. I couldn't have done it without you,\" Arachne told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was glad to hear this. Despite Arachne being a giant that made Felix look like he was a little more than seven inches tall to her, she still saw him as a person. Arachne still saw him as an equal and a friend that had helped her find the courage to overcome one of her greatest fears. He was truly safe with the giant dridder, and Felix no longer feared her. He trusted her with his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Arachne smiled and giggled as she stared at Felix. Confused by this reaction, Felix questioned, \"What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so funny and cute as my necklace,\" Arachne laughed. She poked Felix's side to make in swing for an added effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Felix hollered. He wasn't mad at Arachne. In fact, he thought it was quite funny as well, he was just playing with Arachne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Felix,\" Arachne replied, still giggling, \"I couldn't help myself. Do you want down and out of those webs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, your webbing is very warm. I'm fine with staying in this till we find a place to stay,\" Felix informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Arachne replied, \"Well, if you like being my necklace, then I guess I'll let you be that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Arachne began walking again. When she came to the turn, she turned and had to cover her eyes with her arm for a moment. Felix had to close his eyes till he was a little more used to it. When their eyes adjusted, they found themselves in a huge cavern. It was perfect for a giant dridder that was still growing, such as Arachne. Arachne was amazed by the cave. It reminded her so much of her home in Felarya. The light was coming from the entrance of the cave, but it didn't engulf the entire cave. There were still dark places that pleased Arachne. Arachne looked down at Felix and with excited eyes she pleaded, \"Can this be our home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had no problems with the cave. He could also see a dense woods outside the entrance. So, they might not have troubles getting food. \"Sure, we can stay here,\" Felix agreed, \"This should be a safe place to stay. Even if Lord William figures out we went up stream and find where the river reaches the surface. This cave is on a different path from the river. We can stay here,\" Felix informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne smiled and replied, \"Good, this looks just like my old home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Felix heard a deep growl beneath him from the dark abysses of Arachne's stomach. \"Looks like you're hungry,\" Felix laughed nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't eat the breakfast you gave me, and it's lunchtime. Are you hungry too?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to wait here, and I'll catch the food?\" Arachne suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Felix agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne made a very quick and small web and placed Felix in it. \"I'll be right back,\" Arachne told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have to worry about being par of your meal, right?\" Felix asked as he was suspended in her web.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be in my web right now, but I will never eat you, Felix,\" Arachne assured Felix, \"You're my only friend. I need you too much to just eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that assurance, Arachne left the cave to catch some food. After lunch, she would make her web in the cave and make a few trap webs for the animals of the woods. They animals won't know what hit them.    </span></div></div>",

But despite being larger, they were still no where near as large as the ones in her old home.  This made her guess hunting would be similar to there..  Of course, she realized as she moved through the trees, she was now the largest predator and could take out any thing she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No</i>,\" she thought, stopping for a moment, \"<i>Not everything.  Humans are not prey.  I can't eat humans.</i>\"  She nodded as this fact.  If she ate a human, she would risk becoming a monster and Felix would never be safe around her ever again.  \"<i>I can't lose Felix!  I won't lose him!</i>\"  She paused her thinking when she heard a noise in the area.  She moved into the shadows and saw a large buck in a clearing.  She wondered how she would entrap the creature when she heard another noise and looked around.  Out of no where, an arrow flew and struck the buck in the legs, causing it to fall to the ground.  A human appeared from the trees and walked over to the buck.  It looked different from the other humans Archane had seen in the castle.  The hunter removed its hat revealing long red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good size,\" Archane heard the hunter say.  She turned to the edge.  \"Emily, bring the rope so we can take this home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming mother,\" came a young voice.  A young girl, no older than Felix came running out with rope and handed the rope to her mother.  Her mother, a hunter named Beth, smiled and took the rope before instructing her daughter on how to tie up the buck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I hope they leave soon,</i>\" Archane thought as they tied up the buck.  She was hungry and really wanted to find some food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they pair moved away and dragged the deer off in one direction.  Archane made a note of it, not wanting to run into that woman.  She moved back and headed off in a different direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Archane a while to find some more deer.  She saw two sitting at the edge of a river.  Carefully, she produced some webbing and laid it between some trees.  Then, she moved to the other side and made a loud noise.  She watched the deer come to attention and rush off into the brush, but they did not make it far.  She smiled a little as she went over and encased her two prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be enough for now,\" Archane said to herself.  She didn't want to leave Felix alone for too long a time.  While she felt he was safe, she didn't want to chance that hunter coming to the cave and finding Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Archane returned to her new home.  She would wait until night to set up her traps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering, she saw Felix dosing off in his web cocoon.  Archane smiled and moved close to the web.  She placed the two deer on before picking Felix off.  He still did not wake.  She smiled down at her little friend.</span></div></div>",

He looked so peaceful in his sleep and so cute at his size. He must have been exhausted, but Arachne knew she had to wake him so they could have their late lunch. \"Felix,\" Arachne whispered, but Felix didn't wake from her voice. As Felix laid in Arachne's palm, she nudged him with a finger from her other hand as she whispered his name again. This time, Felix began to stir. \"Felix,\" Arachne said a little louder while continuing to poke him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix opened his eyes to see the giant youthful face of Arachne staring down at him with a caring smile. Normally, waking up to such a sight would be frightening, but he knew that Arachne would never harm him and he was safe with her. \"Are you hungry?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, did you catch anything?\" Felix replied while yawning a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two deer,\" Arachne answered proudly before asking, \"How do you humans eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix answered, \"We don't eat like you, if that's what you're asking. We cook our food and chew it. We don't digest them from the outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That\u2019s a bit odd,\" Arachne commented, \"But then again, dridders eat small enough prey by just swallowing them whole. Is one deer enough for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One is more than enough,\" Felix informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll give you the smaller one, if that's alright,\" Arachne said before setting Felix on the ground and obtaining the smaller sized deer from her web. She started the digestion process on the bigger deer first, before unwrapping the smaller one for Felix. Arachne then broke the smaller deer's neck so that it would never wake up. She set it on the ground and then picked up Felix. \"Looks like it's time to unwrap you,\" Arachne told Felix before she started working on the unwrapping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she pulled the webbing away from Felix, she noticed something different about him. Felix felt a little colder than usual, but that wasn't the reason he felt odd. With the webbing no longer covering him, he felt like there was something missing. Felix sat up and looked down. \"My Clothes! They're gone!\" Felix gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's why you look so different. You were wearing clothes before,\" Arachne realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they get stuck to the web and rip off me when Arachne freed me?\" Felix wondered aloud. Felix stood up and looked in the webbing for any shred of his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felix did this, Arachne examined Felix in her hand. His upper half looked a lot like hers being that Arachne was five years old and still flat chested. Arachne's eyes lowered down to Felix's lower half which was very different. Human legs looked alien to her and Felix's feet looked funny looking to Arachne. However, it was something else on Felix's body that Arachne thought was the strangest thing she had ever seen. She had no idea what it could be and for all she knew it could have been some strange creature attached to Felix. \"Felix, what's that?\" Arachne questioned as she pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix slowly looked down at what Arachne was pointing at. His eyes widened at she realized that all his clothes were gone. Felix rapidly covered that spot up with his hands. Arachne thought that this action was odd and quickly asked, \"Felix, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm naked!\" Felix exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the river must have destroyed your clothes,\" Arachne replied as if nothing were wrong. Of course being nude was no big deal to her. She had always been naked and didn't see the problem with it. \"What is it you're covering?\" Arachne redirected her questioning to the strange object she had briefly seen earlier, \"Has something attached to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Felix answered, blushing from the embarrassment of being naked in front of his giant five year old friend, \"What you saw is a part of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, can I see it?\" Arachne continued to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you can't,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Arachne questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a private matter,\" Felix tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it only made the giant five year old dridder more curious. She brought her pointer finger closer to the area and pleaded in her innocent child voice, \"Come on, Felix. Let me see, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the giant finger to touch Felix's hands, Felix took one of his hands off the area and slapped her approaching finger. Arachne pulled her hand away quickly and became teary eyed. Felix's slap didn't hurt her; she was just saddened that Felix was angry with her. He had never been angry with her before. Felix realized he had scared Arachne and sighed, \"I'm sorry, Arachne, but you can't see it. It's not something humans show people in public. Humans aren't supposed to be naked around other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Arachne questioned, \"I'm naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans are different than dridders. We wear clothing not just to keep warm, but to cover ourselves from others,\" Felix continued to try and explain to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are humans shy of being nudity?\" Arachne asked, trying to understand humans' strange behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're shy,\" Felix agreed with Arachne so he wouldn't have to explain to her in a more complicated reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to be nervous, Felix. I'm naked,\" Arachne tried to assure her friend, \"I know you humans have a different body, but I promise I won't make fun of it or anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd still prefer clothes,\" Felix informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can make clothes for you with my webbing,\" Arachne suggested, \"But I think we should eat first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix sighed. He knew he couldn't continue to cover himself and eat. Felix removed his hands and his face became brighter as he closed his eyes. Arachne had a spider body where her hips should be. Dridders' reproductive organs were in her spider body. So, Felix's whole pelvic region was strange for Arachne. \"So, do all humans have that?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just guys. Girls have a different part,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it's purpose?\" Arachne wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pee with it,\" Felix told her, \"And when I'm older, it will be used for something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Arachne replied. It was clear to her that Felix didn't want to talk about it and was uncomfortable about doing so. Arachne dropped the subject and asked, \"Ready to eat?\" Felix nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Arachne had learned how to make fire, somehow. She needed it on cold night sometimes. So, Arachne had no problems making a fire to cook Felix's food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Both of them no very little about making fires and it is difficult to do so in order to cook Felix's food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So how do you cook the food?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to make a fire,\" Felix said, as his voice dropped low.  He looked up at Arachne.  \"Do you know how to make fire?\"  Arachne shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I never learned.  It was too dangerous,\" Arachne answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too dangerous?\" Felix replied.  Arachne nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I sometimes found fires in Felarya, but when I got close, I saw they were empty and some giant had just been there,\" Arachne replied, \"They used the fires to find prey, so I never made one, even on the cold nights.\"  She shuddered, recalling the horrible life she had lived there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Felix said, sighing.  He had little experience as well starting fires, mainly because he was never in the kitchen making them or when he had to light candles, he used matches.  He had never had to make one from scratch.  Depression filled his face and as Arachne saw this, she too became sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Felix,\" Arachne said, \"I made a mistake.\"  Felix turned quickly to his one friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, you didn't make a mistake,\" Felix said firmly, \"You did what you had to to survive.  I know to make them we need wood.\"  She dried her tears and listened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like branches and stuff?\" Arachne asked,  Felix nodded, pressing his mind for anything he heard of fires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Dry, dead wood is better than fresh wood,\" Felix said, glancing at the wrapped deer.  \"Do you think we have time to go collect some wood before your food is ready?\"  Arachne nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and it will be ready to eat anytime after that,\" Arachne affirmed.  Felix glanced to the exit of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least there's no one around, so I can go outside nude,\" Felix said, blushing about being nude for even longer.  He heard Arachne take in a breath and looked up to see her eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are humans around,\" Arachne said, \"I just remembered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just remembered?\" Felix asked.  Arachne nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was going to tell you, but I forgot when you realized you were naked,\" Arachne answered, \"I'm sorry.\"  Felix sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right.  Would you mind making me something quick to wear?\" Felix asked.  Arachne nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she said, looking at her own hand.  She knew how big a hole she had to make in her fist to hold him and remembered that size.  Slowly, she began working out some webbing and shaped it into a cap.  She took it from her back and poked two holes in it before handing it to Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this is for my lower part, right?\" Felix asked.  Arachne nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was just thinking you wanted that covered first,\" she replied.  Felix nodded and turned around, so his butt faced Archane and pulled up the \"shorts\" up.  It was a snug fit and they held well, both warming his body and comfy, not like the old clothes he used to wear.  when he turned around, Arachne handed him something for his upper body.  It was far looser there and no sleeves to it, but it would do for the time.  \"Do you like them?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're really nice,\" Felix replied as Arachane lowered her hand.  Felix stepped on and the two were out the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a slow process, finding dry wood.  They had some logs Arachne had no trouble carrying, but the smaller stuff Felix had seen used to start the fire was harder to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what sort of humans did you see?\" Felix asked as he moved on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two humans,\" Arachne replied, \"well, I think they were.  Their bodies were like yours, except one had bumps on the chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would probably be a woman,\" Felix said.  Archane nodded as he pressed through some bushes, he saw what he was pushing away.  \"Blackberries,\" he said, smiling.  Arachne looked over his shoulder to the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" she asked.  Felix shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is a fruit I can eat,\" Felix said, taking a few berries in his hand and eating them.  They did well to sate his growing hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I try some?\" Arachne asked, seeing the smile on Felix's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, open your mouth,\" Felix said.  Arachne smiled and opened her large mouth.  Her pincers were visible, but Felix ignored them, looking at her tongue.He grabbed some more berries and put them on the protruding tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know these.  I had something similar when I couldn't catch smaller prey,\" Arachne said, before freezing up.  She looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Arachne?\" Felix asked.  But she said nothing before grabbing Felix and moving back into the shadows of some trees.  There was movement coming near them.  And remebering the hunter she had seen before, she did not want them found now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix now heard someone coming as well.  He strained his ears to figure out who it was.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix was surprised when Arachne had suddenly grabbed him. It was a bit scary when Arachne picked him up without warning, even if he knew that Arachne would never harm him. It was especially scary when she did it so quickly. The fact that she could just pick him up as easily as a child picking up a toy was still an intimidating thing. Felix didn't even have time to react from his surprise. One moment he was on the ground, the next moment he was in Arachne's fist from his shoulders down pressed up against her chest. It all happened so fast. He didn't have times to lift his arm so that they wouldn't be trapped between his sides and the skin of Arachne's hand. All he saw was the world blur around him. Felix had to keep his eyes closed to try and stop the dizzying effect. Once Felix adjusted his eyes, he looked around and noticed that the canopy of the forest was much closer now. It was hard to tell, since most of Felix's 180 degree vision from left to right was made up of Arachne's body, but Felix could tell that Arachne had climbed up to the canopy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Arachne, the trees were still larger than her, but nowhere near the height of the trees of her world. It was possible that once Arachne grows to her full height, she might become the same size as the trees, maybe even bigger. For now, she was glad that the trees were still decently larger than her. Felix looked directly up at Arachne, but could only see under her chin. Arachne was looking directly down at the ground, but could not see Felix because she wasn't standing straight up in the canopy. Instead her body was at an angle, or at least her human body was, and it was positioned so that it was looking directly to the ground. Arachne's spider legs were attached to the tree trunks around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, what's wrong?\" Felix asked her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne turned her gaze to Felix in her hand and said in a hushed voice, \"Someone's coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix saw a lot of fear in Arachne's eyes. This might seem strange, because Arachne was probably the largest thing in the forest, unless there was a dragon or some other giant monster living in the forest However, she was still a child and she had met many nasty humans. Also, her time in Felarya had programmed her mind to be cautious and stay in the shadows. In Felarya, terrible monsters could eat her at any moment and have no regrets doing so, despite Arachne being a child and a person. In fact, Felix was the only person she had met that has been kind to her. He\u2019s the only person she has met that she could trust. Because Felix is the only she's found trust in, meeting other people would still make Arachne nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, turn me around,\" Felix whispered. He wanted to be able to see what was going on. Arachne put her other hand under the hand with Felix and carefully deposited him in her other hand. Felix rolled onto his stomach and edged to the end of Arachne's hand. Felix put both arms over the side of Arachne's hand so that when she wrapped her fingers around him, his arms would be free. Arachne closed her hand and raised it against her chest again. Both Felix and Arachne looked down at the ground and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both saw a woman enter the area. The woman was dressed like a hunter would and had long red hair. She looked like she was a strong willed woman. Felix guessed that she might have had to take care of herself without a husband seeing as though she had to do the hunting and he guessed taking care of herself has made her strong and independent. She was very beautiful as well and looked nothing like the slave women Felix had met. Felix knew that this must have been the woman Arachne probably saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman walked over to the berry bushes a with a basket. A bow and arrows were still strapped to her. She was humming a song as she walked. It was a lovely melody and Felix started thinking that he had heard it before. He knew he couldn't have because there were no humming people in Lord William's castle. Yet, something about this woman's humming tune sounded very familiar. It seemed to entrance Felix as he continued to wonder where he had heard it from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne kept as still and quiet as possible. Sure she was larger than the human, but she didn't want a confrontation. She knew that she wouldn't be able to bring herself to harm the human if the human attacked, especially if the human only did so because it was afraid that Arachne would hurt it. Plus, Arachne didn't want to see if the human was friendly or not in fears that the human would be evil like most of the other humans she had met. No, Arachne knew it was best to keep hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunter, Beth, did not see Arachne. Now, that may be hard to believe, but Arachne was in the canopy and Beth was only looking straight ahead at ground level. Even if she did look up, it might still be hard to spot Arachne. Sure Arachne's human skin was purple and her spider body was huge and black, but if Arachne stayed in the cluster of trees and didn't move, she might be able to pull off being unnoticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth picked the berries she needed and stopped humming. Beth was about to leave, but she stopped. It was then that Beth noticed that it was way too quiet around this part. It was as if something had scared all the animals away. Sure it was possible that it was her, but she didn't even hear birds. It was like something large had scared everything around. Beth had heard stories of some giant monsters living in the forest, but luckily she had never encountered one before. Beth set her basket of berries down slowly and pulled out an arrow. Beth turned around slowly, looking around the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne held her breath and hoped the human wouldn't find them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beth did a full turn, slowly looking for anything off in the woods.  Then she found it.  A small branch twenty feet up was half broken, but the break looked like something was going up, rather than weight making it fall.  (This was in fact accurate as one of Arachane's legs knocked it in her rush to get up into the canopy.)  So slowly she followed the sign and looked up into the canopy.  The shadows of the canopy did well to hide Arachane's human part, blending well with the various shades of darkness.  But what was not hidden was a pink head and arms.  Beth's eyes adjusted as she stepped back and realized there was a giant dridder above her, holding some human in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Not good,</i>\" Beth thought, holding her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachane trembled a little when she saw the hunter look up and see her.  But the hunter did not fire her weapon, not yet anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Keep calm Beth and think.  Your life will depend on your next move.  If I fire, I could miss or hit an ineffective spot and it comes down to me reloading faster than it can attack.  If I hit a good spot, the dridder might drop the person, killing him.  Then that leaves me prey for the dridder.  If I run, I could be caught.  Hell, there could be webs around waiting for me to step into and be caught.  So what are you going to do?!</i>\"  Beth blinked and realized her one chance.  Bluffing the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release the human, Dridder!\" Beth ordered, \"Or I will open fire.  Do you want to be blind in one eye?\"  Beth was happy this dridder only had two eyes.  If it had eight, that threat might not mean as much.  She saw the dridder shake her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Arachane said weakly, \"I won't!\"  Instinctively, she pulled Felix closer to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Arachane is really scared.  Is she worried about me being hurt or hurting the woman?</i>\" Felix wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said release the human!\" Beth yelled again.  She pulled back a little more on her string.  Again the dridder shook her head.  Beth truly did not want to see if she could reload faster than the dridder's counter.  But when a new voice came from above, she released the arrow on accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She isn't going to hurt me!\" Felix shouted, shocking Arachane as well as the arrow flew past her cheek and landed in the trunk behind her.  Beth stared for a moment in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she answered back, grabbing an arrow, in case this was a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachane is not going to hurt me!\" Felix called again, \"She is my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you expect me to believe she won't hurt me?\" Beth shouted.  Arachane nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't hurt you.  Please don't hurt me,\" Arachane answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release him and I'll consider not hitting your eye,\" Beth countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, we mean you no harm!  We're escaped slaves,\" Felix shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slaves?\" Beth repeated, for a second wondering who in their right mind would try to make a dridder a slave.  Her eyes narrowed when she realized only one man who was never in the right mind would be insane enough to try.  The same man who would buy children for slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, from Lord Willaim's castle,\" Felix continued.  Beth released an angry growl as her guess was affirmed.  But that did not mean the dridder was safe around her or her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still doesn't mean I should trust a man-eating monster,\" Beth spat back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't eat humans!\" Arachane replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lie,\" Beth countered, \"You could easily wrap a human in webbing and eat them like how other spiders eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never,\" Arachane replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to-\" Beth began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's telling the truth!  She's only a child and just becoming large enough to think of a human as prey!\" Felix ejaculated, \"But she realizes to see a person as prey because of their size is wrong.  She won't harm you!  I swear!\"  The boy was adamant about his belief in the dridder, Beth knew that.  But still, she could not risk her daughter's life with a possible monster in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you escape then?  If she wouldn't harm a human, how did you escape?\" Beth replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tied up a guard, but left it so he wouldn't die,\" Arachane said, \"We came up through the mountains.\"  She shuddered as she remembered the long cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through?\" Beth responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there is an underground river we came by.  The sides were steep and the water was fast, so no human could follow us,\" Felix added, \"Are we far from Lord William's domain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this land is on the other side of the mountains.  It's over a two month journey to reach here from that bastard's place,\" Beth replied, \"Lord Anthony is who I send tithes to.\"  Felix smiled, recalling hearing Lord William usually decry Lord Anthony as a weak willed man.  If he could anger Lord William that much, Felix knew he had to be a good man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad.  But will you please lower your weapon?\" Felix asked.  Beth held her breath for a moment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beth wanted to believe the giant dridder's story, but she also didn't want to be made a fool. She had lived alone for so long and had been able to protect herself and her daughter without the terrible man that had once called himself her husband. She needed to be strong. It was important to her to be able to protect her family from all monsters. \"I can't trust you, yet. You're going to have to explain things more to me before I can consider believing you. Now, I'm going to back up to allow you to come down from the trees so that I can get a better look at you, dridder, but you are not to come down till I tell you to. Understand?\" Beth barked her orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Arachne replied. Despite the size difference, Arachne was fearful of the woman. Arachne saw the human as an equal and knew she couldn't bring herself to fight back. She thought about running, but feared loosing an eye. Plus, if she pleaded her case to the woman, the woman might become friendlier if she discovers Arachne is not a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth backed away slowly. She kept her aim on the dridder while hesitantly stepping backwards. She didn't want to step into a trap the dridder might have set for her. Once Beth felt she was far enough from the dridder's reach and still in the clearing, Beth called up, \"Come down.\" The giant dridder came down, but it did it very slowly. Arachne did this, hoping that she wouldn't encourage the woman to attack and release that arrow. Eventually the giant dridder had all eight legs on the grassy ground and simply waited for more orders from Beth. Beth took this time to examine Arachne. It was indeed a child of about five years old, but it was so large. It had to have been about thirty-five feet tall and its spider body was enormous. The dridder's upper body was that of a human girl in structure. However, her skin was a shade of purple, she had pointed ears like an elf; she had pure white hair, and ruby red eyes. Besides those details, the upper body looked exactly like a cute child without the sexual organs of a female where the spider body and the human body met in that V shape and breasts that weren't developed yet. Beth looked at the large face of the creature. She didn't expect the dridder to look like this. She thought it would be more monstrous. Also, this one's face was full of fear. <i>\"Is she really afraid of me?\"</i> Beth wondered in her mind, <i>\"Or is she trying to put me in a false sense of security?\"</i> Beth held strong with her arrow as she ordered, \"Now, put the boy down and let him come to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne reacted quickly to this order by bringing her free hand up to Felix and covered the rest of his boy from the front that wasn't in her other fist like a wall. Arachne brought Felix closer to her body. At first, Beth took this as a sign of the dridder not wanting to give up a meal, but there was something else. The dridder clearly didn't want to give up the boy, but there was a sadness and desperation in the dridder's eyes, as if she needed the boy more than just a meal. \"Listen, I might trust you more if you show me that you're willing to let this human go,\" Beth informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne,\" Felix whispered up to her causing her to look down at him. Felix couldn't turn his body around in her fist and had to just look up at her. \"It will be alright,\" Felix tried to assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Arachne started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, she's not going to hurt me or take me away from you. She just wants to make sure you don't see me as your meal. If you're unwilling to let me go, she'll think you're keeping me captive, \"Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just promise me you'll come back, alright?\" Arachne demanded with sad eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I'd never leave you. You're my first and only friend,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are mine as well,\" Arachne replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth could not hear the conversation they were having and feared the dridder wasn't going to let the boy go. Suddenly, Arachne lowered her hands that were cupped together with their palms facing up and Felix sitting on top of them. Arachne only bent her upper body and outstretched her arms till the backs of her hands reached the ground. Before Felix left the palms he patted them and told her it would be alright. Beth was surprised by this action, but never loosened her grip. Felix approached Beth and Beth questioned, \"Tell me. Is this dridder really your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she is,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth examined the boy who seemed to be familiar, yet she had never seen him before. She saw the webbing on him, and believed that the dridder just didn't have enough time to cocoon him yet. \"Tell me the truth. The dridder can't hear us,\" Beth whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am telling you the truth. Arachne is my first and only friend. I'm not her captive and she would never think of eating me or any other human for that matter,\" Felix tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the webbing,\" Beth pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She made these clothes for me, because my original ones were torn off when I fell into the river,\" Felix informed her. There was silence, but it was broken when Felix asked, \"Could I go back to Arachne? She's very scared and worried at the moment and her holding me seems to be the only thing that comforts her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth studied the dridder. It truly looked scared and looked like it needed her friend. <i>\"The dridder really sees this boy as a friend,\"</i> Beth thought, <i>\"What could have happened to this creature to make it so desperate to find human friendship? It's so attached to this boy.\"</i> Beth nodded to Felix to let him join his dridder friend again. Felix ran back to Arachne and she quickly and happily scooped him up into a hug. \"Tell me your story, dridder,\" Beth demanded, \"Everything.\"</span></div></div>",

Is that why she looks so different from the dridders of our world?\"</i> Beth wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne continued her story, \"It's a land made for giants where humans are one of the smallest creatures. These giants are all intelligent like me, but they eat human sized creatures. They don't care that humans are people. If they are small enough to eat, they are considered prey and not people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth didn't like the sound of this world. She trusted the dridder even less now if it came from this world. <i>\"Why is it telling me this? Doesn't it realize that it's making her seem more like a monster? If this dridder is like the other giants of her world, then it won't think twice about eating a human when it grows bigger. Maybe it wants to eat humans now,\"</i> Beth thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I hatched, I was all alone. No parents cared for me. I was human sized when I hatched. I searched Felarya for someone to care for me or at least be my friend. The giants didn't care if I was a person. They would try to eat me every time I encountered one. They didn't care that I was just a child. I was food to them, and nothing else,\" Arachne informed the woman with the bow. Arachne had to pause as tears filled her ruby eyes upon recalling the memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth was mortified by Arachne's story. She couldn't believe that something with a sentient mind would actually be willing to eat a child. She was also having troubles imagining this dridder as human-sized. But if the dridder the size of a human once and it was hunted by these giants, then it must have been terrible. Beth began to feel sorry for the giant dridder. She couldn't imagine being a small child all alone, needing comfort and care, only to be nearly eaten by giants that only saw her as a delicious snack. It must have been terrible. <i>\"Could this be the reason the dridder sees humans as friends, because she knows what it's like to be the small person and at the mercy of bigger creatures?\"</i> Beth questioned, <i>\"Maybe even that loneliness and the desperate attempt to find a person the cares about her has helped her see humans as people as well.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lived in Felarya for five years and just started having my growth spurts. In another week, I will be about 75 feet tall,\" Arachne told her, \"I woke up one day in another world and humans captured me and brought me to Lord William. I met Felix and he was good to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first I was scared of Arachne, but I quickly realized that even though she was a giant dridder from a different world, she was still just a sad and lonely child that just wanted a friend. We became friends quicker than you would think. Trust me, once you get to know Arachne, she's a wonderful and gentle child,\" Felix interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a bump in our friendship, though,\" Arachne admitted, \"When I found out Felix was a human, I wanted to eat him. When in Felarya, I had never met a human, but I had overheard other giants talking about them and how delicious they are. They would say that if someone were to encounter a human, they would be a fool not to eat it. It made me want to find and eat a human, but I had no idea they were intelligent. I told Felix to stay away from me and that he was safer out of my reach. I didn't want to eat Felix, because he was my friend, but I was worried my instincts would take over.\" Arachne shivered at the memory and Felix did his best to try and comfort her as he sat in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne looked down at Felix and smiled. As she used the pointer finger of her free hand to pet the back of Felix's head and back Arachne said, \"Luckily, Felix reminded me of how I felt when I was in Felarya and human sized. It was terrible and I don't want to put anyone through what I went through and I never want to become a monster like those other giants. I will protect the people smaller than me from other giant monsters and I will treat them as people, not food. Besides, I know that I could not go on without Felix. If I would have eaten him, I would have lost the only friend I have ever had. I would be alone again, and I never want to be alone again.\"</span></div></div>",

Arachane smiled from these words.  She pulled Felix close for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Arachane,\" Felix corrected Beth, once the hug was over.  Beth said nothing for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you in these woods?\" Beth asked, looking at the unusual couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need fire wood,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire wood?\" Beth repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I caught Felix some food, but when I came back to him, he told me he couldn't eat it raw and needed to cook it,\" Arachane answered.  Now that she saw Arachane was not a threat, their actual ages came to Beth's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And does either one of you know how to make a fire?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was never allowed to make one from scratch.  I would gather wood from storage some days, but I never made one myself,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if one made fires in Felarya, they would giving away their position really quickly.  I would sometimes find a fire burning, but no one would be left alive,\" Arachane added.  Beth stared at Arachane's large eyes of innocence.  They were in many ways similar to her eight year old girl's.  They dug into Beth's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like my help teaching you how to make a fire?\" Beth asked.  She saw surprise appear on both the boy and Arachane's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be really nice,\" Felix responded, looking to the ground where Arachane dropped some logs they found.  \"Is this stuff good?\" Felix asked.  Beth took a glance at Arachane before coming closer.  She saw several large logs on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they'll do once you have the fire going.  Do you know what sort of kindling to gather?\" Beth asked.  She looked at the young boy.  Once more his familiarity came to mind, but she knew she did not know him.  Felix shook his head.  Arachane picked up the now affirmed good logs and put them on her spider-part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Felix replied, \"I was really just guessing.\"  Beth nodded and before giving Arachane one more glance, she turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me, I know of a tree that fell down two weeks ago.  It should be dry now,\" Beth said, before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me,\" Arachane said, \"May I carry you?\"  Beth froze and turned to see a large hand inviting her to walk onto.  The boy was already getting on there.  Beth thought quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This girl doesn't see me as a threat anymore.  She must not be worried about me harming her or the boy.  If she meant me ill will, I would be dead by now,</i> she reasoned.  \"All right, but no grabbing me around the waist.  Open hand only.\"  Arachane nodded and Beth walked to the large hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You best sit down,\" Felix advised.  Beth took no further advice and sat next to Felix before Arachane picked them up.  She stayed still, not moving forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going straight,\" Beth said, realizing Arachane was waiting for directions.  She glanced at Felix.  \"What's your name boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix,\" he replied.  Beth's heart skipped a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It couldn't be, it's not the same name, .... but it is a name <b>he</b> would have picked</i>,\" she thought.  \"How did you come to be a slave?\"  <i>I have to be sure.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I just remember waking up and finding myself there about five years ago,\" Felix replied.  \"None of the drudges or other slaves claimed me as their own, so I don't know who my parents are.\"  Beth nodded slowly, her face keeping in her emotions of hope.  After a moment of silence.  \"So, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Beth,\" Beth answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's your daughter's name?\" Felix asked.  Beth's heart skipped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know about her?\" Beth asked. before hearing a quiet voice behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was hunting, I saw you and her taking down a deer,\" Arachane answered.  Beth paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Emily.  She's eight years old,\" Beth answered, looking back at the familiar Felix.  She had one sure way to find out, but did not want to press her luck.  It might have been removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a husband around?\" Felix asked.  Beth froze for a moment once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Husband?\" Arachane mouthed quietly.  Felix looked back, missing a glare of rage on Beth's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, like a mate,\" Felix answered his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Beth said, her voice cold, \"He is no longer in our lives.\"  And if she ever saw him again, she would kill him.  He was as evil as Lord William in Beth's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry if I asked something I shouldn't have,\" Felix responded, recognizing Beth's tone.  Beth shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you did not know,\" Beth replied, \"I feel better telling people sometimes.  Rupert was a good man, when I first met him.  And together we had two children.  Emily was our second child.  Our first was a boy named Andrew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-\" Felix began before Beth asked a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, were there any other young slaves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some girls who were assigned to the drudges, a boy two years younger than me and one who is three years older than me,\" Felix replied, recalling the sleeping mates he had.  Beth nodded slowly.  \"Does this have something to do with Andrew?  Because neither of them were named that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  One day Rupert came home to tell me we needed to pay off a new tax Lord William had instilled.  A price per head in the family,\" Beth began, \"We did not have much money and so he came up with an idea.  He left one day with Andrew.  He didn't return with Andrew.  When I demanded, he told me he sold Andrew to Lord William to cover the tax.  He told me we couldn't bet him back anyway as the Alchemist would feed him a drink to forget us.  He would never remember us.\"  Beth paused and looked at Felix's blurry face.  She hadn't realized be was now crying.  She always did when she thought of her little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachane had come to a stop, listening to this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That . . . That's monstrous!\" Felix yelled out after what felt like an eon of silence.  \"I'm sorry I brought up the subject.\"  Beth shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right,\" Beth replied, \"When you told me who you escaped from, it helped me trust you.\"  She paused and took a deep breath.  Now would be the final evidence she could think of in proving if Felix was her boy.  \"Felix, do you have a birthmark on your inner thigh?\"  Felix looked at Beth.</span></div></div>",

Of course, it's most likely a coincidence, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"  Felix asked, bringing her back to the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Felix turned his head towards her, and she nearly gasped.  She hadn't looked at him clearly before, and had just noticed his eyes, those of her very son's!  There was no doubt about it now that he was her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was just curious, as I've meet a lot of people who told me that they have a birthmark there as well, but it's nothing,\" Beth rapidly said.  I can't let him know, if I did, he could try to come with me, leaving the dridder behind, and it could turn on us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, let's get going.  You were telling us how to make a fire?\"  Archane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, right.  Well, there are many ways to do it, but I have found a very easy method,\" Beth explained, \"First, we need a large batch of dry kindling.  We will also need a flint stone.  I'll get one from my house when we're near it.  Then, we need small sticks to get the spark going.  After the fire strengthens, we'll add larger and larger pieces of wood to add to it, and eventually we will have a cooking fire.  I'll tell you the rest once we get the supplies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took them most of the day to get the supplies, and after Beth explained how to get the fire going, she returned home.  Archane and Felix went back to the cave, where Felix began to cook his dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix?\"  Archane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did Beth help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, and I hope that she continues to help us.\"  Felix thought about what she had asked as the fire finally roared alive, and he started to feed it.  She had asked him about his birthmark, and although they hadn't talked much during the time they had spent gathering fire wood, Beth had been lost in thought, and occasionally gazed unintentionally at him, and it had made him suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he had the fire ready, and began to cook his food.  He had been forced to work in the kitchen enough to know the basics of cooking, and found that the cooked deer he ate to be satisfactory.  Throughout his meal, he and Archane chatted, and while it was mainly just the average chatter about their days, and how they had thought of the events that had happened, they were lost in that conversation, as it was the first true conversation either one of them had had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Felix was tired, as well as Archane.  After all, she was just a child.  As they drifted off to sleep, he began to think about what life ahead of him would be like, and he hoped it was for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Archane did the same, but was preparing for her growth that night, and although it was often painful for her, she could bear the pain, as she had been through worse in Felaryia.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix didn't answer right away, because he was baffled by the question Beth had asked. It was pretty much a personal question talking about one's inner thigh and the question just seemed sudden and out of context. Who asks about one's inner thigh in normal conversations? Then again, this wasn't a normal conversation between this mother and an escaped slave or a normal situation as they talked in the hands of a giant five year old dridder, but even that question still seemed strange and out of the ordinary in spite those two facts that made the situation they were in odd. Eventually, Felix said, \"No, I have a scar in that area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's hopes dropped sharply when she heard Felix's answer. She had hoped that the child before her was her son, and all the facts except for the scar were there. Felix was the right age and he became a slave around the time Andrew would have become one. He didn't have the same name of her son, but Lord William could have changed Andrew's name, from what her ex husband had said, Lord William had already erased Andrew's memory of his past life. Also, Felix didn't remember anything of his first five years of life. The only thing that didn't match was that Felix had a scar instead of a birthmark and... Beth suddenly interrupted her own thoughts and thought about something else. What if Lord William could take away people's birthmarks and certain distinguishing features? It is known that Lord William steals children, but he must due something other than erase their memory that would keep parents from recognizing them. Beth's hope grasped upon that final thought, it was her last hope in finding her son. \"This scar, is it on your left thigh, about right here?\" Beth asked touching her own left thigh in the spot Andrew's birthmark would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Felix was surprised that Beth continued the subject of what was on his inner thigh. The personal matter of the subject wasn't the only thing that unnerved Felix though, there was also the Beth knew, or seemed to know, exactly where Felix's scar was. It was quite creepy that she knew where his scar was, and Felix just nodded a little hesitantly to answer Beth's question. How could she have known, and why was she talking about what's on Felix's inner thighs? One minute she was talking about her lost son and her father, and then the next thing she decides to talk about is what's on Felix's inner thighs. Suddenly, Realization hit Felix like one of Lord William's slaps when he slapped with his right hand wearing the heavy ring of his. Could Andrew have a birthmark in that exact place? Did Beth think Felix could be Andrew? \"Did Andrew have a birthmark in that same place?\" Felix asked. However, Felix didn't need her to answer for him to figure out the answer. Hope was among the watery irises of Beth's eyes; hope that Felix was her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Beth didn't need to say it, she answered anyway, \"Yes, Andrew had a birthmark in the same place your scar is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing where this conversation was going, Arachne stopped and looked down at the humans in her hands, which were cupped together to give them space with, eyes wide with amazement. Arachne asked, \"Do you think Felix is Andrew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I think it is possible,\" Beth stated without bring her eyes away from Felix. Beth stared at the escaped slave boy in the giant hands of the dridder along with her. As she studied his face, she saw parts of herself and parts of the father mixed in Felix's face. Beth though back to the boy she had and the last time she saw him five years ago. He had a face she would never forget. There were resemblances in Felix, but he was older which made some differences. Also, some of the father's features were no longer there. Maybe Lord William was able to change and shape Felix's face to erase some of his father's likeness so that he wouldn't be recognized. However, Lord William must not had known what Beth looked like and the likenesses Andrew had with her, because all those features were still in Felix's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was shocked by the revelation. Could he truly be this woman's long lost son Andrew or was it a big coincidence? \"But, could I really be Andrew?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's a lot of evidence that fits that conclusion,\" Beth said, \"You're the right age as my son, you were a slave to Lord William, and you also become a slave around the same time as my son with no other children around your age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't remember anything for the first five years of my life,\" Felix argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My husband said Lord William would erase my son's memory with some sort of potion,\" Beth informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the scar?\" Felix asked, \"You said your son has a birthmark there. I have a scar there instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Lord William was able to remove it,\" Beth suggested.</span></div></div>",

That led to the horror of what his own father had done to him.  But surely even magic couldn't erase someone as important as a mother from his mind.  He knew the Alchemist was also the healer for the castle and he had seen his potions help tend to soldiers Lord William deemed worthy to live.  If they could heal broken bones in a week, he guessed it was possible there would be a potion to remove birthmarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth said nothing.  She had rarely felt this strongly before about something.  The last time was when she chose to leave Rupert behind and start a new life.  Of course, then she had knocked him out with some tainted wine.  Now all she had was fragments of hope that she was not mistaken.  She did not know what she would do if she was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But I'm not wrong.  I know he's my Andrew . . ..  He has to be!</i>\" Beth thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix slowly took breaths in and out.  There had to be some way to solve the matter.  He looked into Beth's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you singing before when you arrived at the berries?\" Felix asked.  Beth's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember that song?\" she asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just rarely heard singing in Lord William's castle,\" Felix lied.  He didn't want to admit how entranced he was by it, far more than on the rare times he did hear music.  Beth looked rejected and her head slumped slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a song my mother sang to me when I was a child,\" Beth answered, \"And I sang it to my children.\"  She paused.  \"Andrew really loved it when he had hard times sleeping.\"  Felix said nothing for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind, would you hum it again?\" Felix asked.  Beth gave a slow nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind.  It helps cheer me up when I'm low,\" Beth replied, before taking in a deep breath.  She closed her eyes and began to hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachane listened closely to the tune Beth was making.  She too had little experience with music.  She watched a faint smile form on Felix's face, but it didn't seem he was noticing it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's familiar . . . . </i>\" Felix thought as he was entranced once more.  He slowly opened his mouth.  \"Come, come again home, rest your weary head. /  Think nothing of your trouble.  Rest here in your bed. / Your mother's here to guard you, rest until the next day.\"  He stopped when he realized Beth had stopped humming.  What he didn't know was Beth had stopped soon after he began singing.  She was staring at him with shock and hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You . . . you know the words,\" Beth answered the unsaid question.  \"No one outside my family knows this song.\"  Felix said nothing for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just know the song, nothing else,\" he replied, \"It's. . . It's not enough to prove . . . .\" His skepticism ceased as he looked into the hurt eyes of Beth.  She so badly wanted him to be her son and how strongly he was refuting any evidence she pointed out.  \"I'm sorry,\" he finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry as well, but with everything I know, I just know you are my son,\" Beth said.  She didn't plan what she did next.  Felix didn't expect it either.  Arachane was unsure what to do when Beth suddenly jumped forward and hugged Felix tightly against her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had been hugged by Arachane, but this felt different.  It felt as though Beth was trying to remove any of his worries or fear with this kind, sympathetic hug.  Her smell washed over his and caused his eyes to droop.</span></div></div>",

The touch of her hand seemed to match the concern and worry for his well being in her eyes as it rested on his shoulder. He knew that she now believed with all her heart that he was her son. Even though Felix still had his doubts, deep inside himself he believed she was his mother as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix turned his head to look up at Arachne. She had stopped her walking and she too was staring down at him with concern in those ruby red, watery eyes of hers. They had been through a lot together and he was her friend. It was no surprise that she'd worry about his well being. Despite her size and strength, she only had the ability to protect him from physical treats of other beings, not the invisible threats that might be within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just have a headache,\" Felix informed both of them while turning his gaze back to Beth, \"It's been with me most of the day, but becoming more painful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When is the last time you've eaten?\" Beth asked. She remembered that Arachne had told her she had caught lunch for them, but didn't tell her when they had eaten last. She suspected that the headache Felix was suffering from could be caused by his hunger. She knew from experience that hunger could cause many different symptoms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't ate anything all day,\" Arachne informed Beth while Felix was still rubbing his head from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just what I thought,\"</i> Beth confirmed in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne's eyes never left from Felix and she asked, her tone drenched in worry, \"Is Felix going to be alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he'll be fine once he eats something. Felix has a headache because he hasn't eaten anything yet today. Food and water will cure his head,\" Beth assured the giant concerned dridder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... feel... weak,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just lie down and rest, there's enough room for you on your friend's hands. Just keep saving your strength and you'll be fine. People can go days without food, though with side effects of course. We're almost to the fallen tree,\" Beth tried to assure Felix as she helped him lie down slowly on his back. Arachne's two hands gave Felix enough room for him to do this, but he still had to sleep diagonally on the hands. Arachne was big, but she was still five years old and she was not her adult height of about 120 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix enjoyed the soft purplish skin of Arachne's hands and closed his eyes to rest. Arachne's smooth, soft, and comfortable skin as well as the warmth that radiated from her always made the perfect ingredients for sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth examined Felix's body. He was very skinny for his age. Who knew what Lord William considered enough food for a slave. He probably only gave them enough food to survive and that was all. <i>\"Felix's situation could be more life threatening than I thought,\"</i> Beth realized. However, she didn't want Felix and Arachne to be as worried as her. She didn't want the kids to panic, because it would be harder to achieve the task. While keeping a calm voice, Beth said, \"Arachne, could you keep moving? We're almost to the fallen tree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, which way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually made it to the fallen log and Arachne had to set her human passengers on the ground so that she could deal with the dead wood. Arachne wrapped the entire log in webbing, like she had done with the other branches and twigs she and Felix obtained that were now stuck to the top of her spider body. Arachne attached a long and strong string of webbing at the end of the log and attached it to her spider body so that she could drag it along. Arachne was then able to carry Felix and Beth in her hands once again as she walked to the cave Arachne and Felix had dubbed home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Arachne walked to her new home, she studied Beth's actions. Beth tended to the resting Felix in a nurturing and loving way that only a mother could achieve. Since Arachne had been alone all her life, she still didn't fully understand motherly concern and care all that well. However, that didn't ever stop her from wanting it from others. It was unfortunate that she had to go through life all on her own until now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a terrible worry that was festering deep within her caused by Beth's actions towards Felix. <i>\"Beth really thinks that Felix is her lost child. What if she wants him to come live with her? What if she wants to take him away from me? I'd be all alone again. No, Felix wouldn't let that happen, he wouldn't abandon me. Unless... unless Felix really is her lost son and he wants to go with her and leave me.\"</i> Worries and questions continued to pester Arachne's mind. So much so that she didn't even know how she felt about the whole situation. She had no idea what to say or do. Her entire body was just filled with worry and concern that Felix might be taken away from her and that she'd be all alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA conflict was also raging in Beth's mind. Here she was with an escaped slave that she knew with unwavering belief was her son. However, he didn't remember her and possibly still didn't believe she was his mother. Beth wanted him to come back home where they could be a family once again, but she was worried that Felix, as he calls himself, won't accept her as his true mother. There was also the concern of what Arachne might do. Her lost son had escaped Lord William's castle with a giant dridder of all things, and surprisingly, the dridder saw humans as people! From what Arachne had told Beth, it was clear to Beth that Arachne was a very lonely child. Beth could understand that Arachne might be clingy to Felix and might not want to let him go. <i>\"What am I going to do? If I separate them, bad things could happen. Maybe, I could bring them both in, but could a giant dridder really accept a human as a mother? I could let them live together, but then I'd be separated from my lost son and... I just don't know what to do.\"</i>  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beth watched Felix slowly breath as he entered a near-sleep state.  She did not notice Arachne's slowing pace as the turmoil in the dridder reached new heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to take Felix to your home?\" Arachne asked suddenly.  Beth turned quickly to the large, innocent face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>How do I answer such a question?  He's my son, of course I want him to be with me!  But would you allow that?  Would you allow him to leave you?\"</i>  Beth took a breath, containing her retort.  Instead, she said the more tactful, \"I want what's best for him.\"  She glanced at the boy.  \"Whatever that may be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wouldn't take him away from me?\" Arachne asked.  Again, Beth a breath to sort out her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You obviously care for him,\" Beth replied, \"I do not think I could force either of you to do something you do not wish.\"  She glanced around, realizing they had stopped moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want him to leave me,\" Arachne said.  Beth nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, so would you please continue on to your home?\" Beth asked.  Arachne's widened when she realized she had stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Arachne said, as she started moving once more, \"I just ....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arachne, if there is one thing I understand, it is the pain of losing someone you care about,\" Beth injected.  She bit her lip.  \"<i>If I ask her to live near me, would she end up seeing me as a parent?\"</i>  Nothing else was said as they approached the cavern.  Beth knew of this cave, having rested here during a storm one time when hunting.  She saw the web-home Arachne had made and the bundle lying on the ground in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArachne lowered her body and Beth nudged Felix awake.  He groaned from pain as he woke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's get the fire started,\" Beth said helping Felix off the hand.  Once they were off, Arachne pulled off the webbing of wood.  \"First, we need to get the fire going.  Let's get some of the smaller branches in a pile,\" Beth directed, walking over to the pile.  She pulled hard on the branches, but none gave way.  \"Um, Arachne?\" Beth asked.  Arachne nodded, understanding the request.  She leaned over and ripped apart the webbing, leaving much of the wood exposed.  Beth gathered the dry kindling and moved towards Felix.  \"So, first we put this smaller branches near each other,\" Beth started, putting the branches and grass into a bundle.  She pulled out two stones from her pouch and struck them together, making sparks.  \"You should be able to find more of these near here,\" Beth noted as she got some of the small wood a lit.  With the caution she once held her children with, she blew on the small fire until it started going strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Arachne asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we let it build up to cooking strength,\" Beth replied, glancing at the bundle.  \"We should start cleaning the deer while this grows in strength.\"  Arachne nodded and opened up the cocoon and removed the deer.  Beth examined the corpse.   \"Good body,\" she muttered, \"This will have some good meat on it.\"  She turned and saw Felix tending the fire, adding some larger wood to it.  He turned to Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we just cook part of it, like just a leg?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would be smart,\" Beth agreed, as she pulled out a knife and began cutting through the meat on one leg.  She placed the thin slab of meat on the ground.  She removed a few more slices before moving back near Felix.  \"You said those are your only clothes?\" Beth asked, glancing at his bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but Arachne can make me others,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" Beth replied, \"We'll soon be entering winter and it comes very quickly here.  If she doesn't improve her work, you will probably freeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will get better,\" Arachne said hotly.  She didn't want to be the cause of Felix's suffering.  Even suggesting that was offensive to the dridder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you like cold?\" Beth asked, looking up at Arachne.  \"Have you ever seen snow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snow?\" Arachne replied.  \"No, I never went to the colder regions of Felarya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then both of you might need something to wear,\" Beth replied.  \"I make clothes for my daughter and I to wear.  I could make some for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this webbing is really comfortable,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would assume so.  But maybe I could add the skins to it, adding more layers and protection,\" Beth noted, glancing at Arachne, \"After all, if this webbing can keep food preserved for weeks, it should easily make a good inner layer for clothing.\"  Arachne smiled at the compliment.  Beth took a stick and pierced the meat and put it over the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be able to find your way home once this is done?\" Felix asked.  He wanted time to sort this out and knew it would be difficult with Beth sitting in the same room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, quite easily,\" Beth replied, \"Would you like to come to my home to visit?\"  She stared at the look of shock on Felix's face.  A similar one was on Arachne.  She hadn't meant to say those words, they just popped out.  \"I would like you to meet my daughter,\" she added quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she remember Andrew at all?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she was far to young to remember her brother,\" Beth replied.  She looked at the meat and pulled it out.  She touched it in several places before handing it to Felix.  \"It's ready to eat,\" she said.  Felix took the stick and blew on the hot meat.  His pallet was watering.  Warm, no.  Hot food.  To a boy who was used to cold food and dried meat, fresh juicy hot off the fire meat was a delicacy.  He carefully bit into the meat and sighed at the flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, is something wrong?\" Arachne asked, seeing the queer look on Felix's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing's wrong.  It's just a good meal,\" Felix replied, before taking another bite.  Beth smiled and stuck another slab on another stick.  She guessed Felix would be hungry for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how about after you both eat, we go visit my daughter?  That way you know where I live if you need anything,\" Beth said.  Arachne looked at Felix, who after a minute, conceded that it would be wise to know that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fairies- Felaryan fairies are widely feared by adventurers and considered top predators in the same way that nagas are: they can fly, they live in packs, and are often efficient spell casters. One of their most feared abilities is size-shifting: fairies can change their size at will, from 3 inches to 100 feet (although this range varies a bit from one fairy to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost all fairies also have the innate ability to temporarily alter the size of another creature, though it depends a lot on the original size of the target and its magic resistance. For example, if the target is too big to start with the fairy will be unable to change its size at all. Felaryan fairies are voracious and love to snack on adventurers, usually after shrinking them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fairy's power is stored in their wings, meaning that if their wings are hurt their magic is decreased dramatically, to the point of preventing them from using even their most basic of abilities. For example, fairies with damaged wings are unable to size-shift, and are stuck at their current size until their wings have healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairies are usually playful and mischievous beings who love to have fun more than anything else. The way they view good and evil is rather special and different from the way humans view it. However, contrary to popular belief, not all fairies are light hearted. In their population you can find a wide range of attitudes that vary from the usual fun loving and carefree pranksters to solemn watchmen, serious scholars, mystic sages and even dark brooding warriors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\na harpy- Harpies are half women half bird creatures that have wings instead of arms and claws instead of feet. Some of them have feathers on parts of their body as well, though this varies a lot from one species to another. Felaryan harpies are usually about 80 feet tall but shorter races also exist. Harpies are all female, mating with males from other species to reproduce. A harpy baby inherits a small amount of genetic material from her father, which goes into trait and features that don't alter her physiology as a member of her mother's species. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarpies are voracious and one of the top predators in the skies of Felarya. Preferring to fly over mountains and plains, they have excellent vision and hearing, and can spot prey from extremely far away. They have been know to be a bit cruel towards their prey when hunting in groups, often playing games with their food involving dropping and catching. Being without hands, harpies are extremely agile with their mouth and tongue. Unlike when in a group, a lone harpy is cautious. When confronted with a large group of humans, she will usually just swoop down on them with a wide open mouth, snatch one or two, and then fly off to find a quiet place to digest her meal. </span></div></div>",

You'll be seeing to that won't you slave?\" he looked at Felix and grinned. Felix bowed and backed away, careful to avoid eye contact, the last boy to make eye contact was now buried halfway down the midden heap. Not even a grave for a slave. Rounding the corner Felix turned and ran to the kitchens. Trying to get away from that awful grin, the last person to be fixed with that wished for the midden, and repeated so every night before he fell into a fitful sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Reaching the kitchens Felix pushed open the gnarled wooden door that was the servants entrance. Though Felix knew of only five paid servants in the entire castle, though the pittance would not even afford them transport to another place to work so they were trapped as much as Felix, just allowed more freedom inside of the cage. The cook of course was one of them and he lorded it over the slaves. Felix moved straight to the barrels of raw salted beef. Grabbing an old cloth he wrapped several handfuls of the meat in it tied it with a cord of twine and hefted it onto his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPilfering the meat again slave,\u201d It was the cook with his ladle raised ready to bring it down onto Felix's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain? I've never stolen meat.\u201d Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf all are punished for the crime of one then the crime must belong to all as well.\u201d The cook replied making a swipe at Felix with the ladle. Felix ducked and it hit his shoulder, definitely a bruise for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix yelled back at the cook, \u201cI'm on orders from the Lord William. Shove off and let me get it to his new pet or I'll tell him you hindered me in his task!\u201d He then ducked under the chef's arm and ran out the door, knowing the chef wouldn't follow past there. Still the next time Felix returned to the kitchens there would be trouble. The Lord wouldn't take the word of a slave over a freeman and would probably punish them both just for disturbing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix made his way past the guards in the halls with the packet of meat on his back. The guards themselves were slaves, but all were children of former guards and none had known another life, born here like most of the other slaves, thoughts of escape were not present at all in their mind. Except to prevent others from doing so, mostly those who had known other lives. Almost sub-human in their actions, they were loyal without question and totally efficient, and also clockwork. The only negative about them was their predictability, if you had reason to avoid them and knew their schedule there was always a way around them. Not past the walls though, they guarded all ways in and out of the keep and adjoining village like hawks, without the wings of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning one last corner to the cells Felix heard a crash and immediately broke into a run, probably unwisely considering that he knew there was a monster in the next room. A guard was blundering up the hallway, running into walls, hangings ornaments and other hallway decorations that were going to either need sweeping up, rehanging, or burning. The guard turned the corner and Felix heard him call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir I've been blinded, I don't know how, the door was locked and it doesn't hurt, detail another man to guard the door.\u201d Another guard ran around the corner, sword in hand, keys in the other and assumed a place at the door, eying Felix warily. Felix approached the guard and told him that he was here to feed the creature. The guard turned and unlocked the door without a word and then returned to his vigil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix entered the room and stopped with a shock, not a monster but a girl, maybe three, maybe four years older than Felix, but not acting like it, she was rattling the chains and skipping in a circle singing in a language Felix didn't know that had the definite sound of a child's nonsense rhyme, the sort a three year old might sing or one a mother might sing to such a child. The girls voice as well was childish. As she completed a third circuit of the chains full length Felix noticed two large lumps above her shoulders. Lifting the back of her dress so that it looked as if she had a hump. On the fourth revolution she stopped and giggled and said \u201cTee hee, now he can't see.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix halted and said \u201cWait, you did that, how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned to look at Felix, obviously unaware of his presence up until now she turned and squealed, then said \u201cHumans bad, cut wings. Get away, mommy said stay away humans till I am bigger.\u201d Obviously this puzzled Felix, as much as how this girl was supposed to be a fearsome monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix decided it was probably better to give her the food and get out. He took a step towards her. She squealed again and backed off \u201cIt won't last, it's not a long spell without wings, please get away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix says to her, \u201cIt's only food.\u201d Stepping forward again the girl's demeanor changed suddenly to a snarl, \u201cBack human!\u201d then started to speak in that other language, again it sounded like a child's rhyme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was quite sure that the words were different this time. Suddenly Felix fell forward, a wrenching pain in his gut. The worst stomach cramp he had ever had. He curled up groaning on the floor. She darted forward so quickly that Felix barely saw it and grabbed the meat and retreated to the back of the room. Showing pointed white teeth as she began to eat. The moment she started eating and stopped singing the cramps went away and Felix fled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day Felix was going about his duties as normal, avoiding the kitchen as much as possible, and all the while he thought of the girl in the cell. She had called him human, and those lumps and the teeth of course, maybe she was a monster after all. Still she didn't seem to be the powerful beast Lord William was touting. Still had she made that guard blind, and was it her who caused the stomach cramps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly at the end of the day did anything unusual happen. Felix was lying on his lone blanket in the slave quarters, ready to rest and both fearful and curious towards the day ahead. Sleep didn't come easily to Felix and he lay there for a long while watching the men and women laying down to rest, his friend Ted who lay next to him turned to him and said \u201cWhat's that your muttering Felix.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was about to reply when Ted began to pull his legs up to his chest, Felix then saw that almost everyone was now on the floor, clutching at their stomachs or curled into a ball. Felix shut his mouth straight away as he saw more of his friends curled up and Lenny, another close friend who slept to his other side was clutching at her stomach and had tears rolling down her cheek. Within a few minutes most people had subsided and were lying on their beds, some still only half clothed, unable to find the strength to cover themselves. Felix knew to look away from those ones, he had seen some of the older boys hit or punished for looking, though Felix didn't know why, or even why they wanted to. After an hour or so everybody seemed to have fully recovered, Ted turned to Felix and Lenny and said \u201cThe oats must have been bad, it's funny though they didn't taste off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few hours Felix lay awake, finding it harder than ever to drift off to sleep. He had remembered what he had been muttering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEthna Hepalu Calum\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe words the girl had been chanting</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It began as a normal day for Felix, because he was only expected to feed the girl and he only had to feed her twice a day. Once for lunch and once for dinner. He also had to start giving her a drink as well so that she wouldn't dehydrate. If the girl were to die because of an action from Felix, Lord William would have no hesitation in ordering Felix to death. Felix still had to do all his other usual tasks as well and he was finishing the last task he would have to do before feeding the girl in the cell. Felix was scrubbing the floors with other slaves and Ted was near him doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you were given another task,\" Ted whispered, \"What did he give you this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to feed the Lord's new pet, give it water, and clean up after it,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think he'd get his beast master to do it,\" Ted commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think they're seeing eye to eye lately,\" Felix stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is it a vicious beast like the dragon Lord William tried to tame and failed to? No doubt he's trying to tame this one,\" Ted stated. Ted was always fascinated by magical creatures and the monsters of the country. So, it was no surprise Ted was going to ask many questions about the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is trying to tame it, but it's odd,\" Felix replied, \"It's supposed to be very dangerous, but it doesn't seem like it. The 'pet' looks like a normal girl around our own age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some silence as they continued their duties in scrubbing the throne room. However, Ted eventually broke the silence, \"You know what my father used to do, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix remembered Ted's story all too well. Unlike Felix who couldn't remember his parents, Ted did remember his parents. Ted was ten when he was sold into slavery and he was thirteen at the moment, three years older than Felix. Ted's father had studied magical creatures and monsters from many lands to learn about them and make records. Ted's father had passed most of his knowledge to Ted. Although, Ted didn't have the hard copies, only the memories of his teachings. Once Ted's father died, Ted's evil mother sold him into slavery for the money. \"Your father studied magical beasts,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but don't call them beasts. Many of the magical creatures such as dragons, griffins, and fairies have the same intelligence as humans and they wouldn't harm humans unless provoked,\" Ted informed Felix, \"He taught nearly everything he knew and I know creatures that have or can take human form. I can help you figure out what she is if you can tell me if there were any strange things about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she had sharp teeth and could use magic by speaking,\" Felix told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a siren so far. Anything else?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seemed very childish for her age and she had two swollen spots on her shoulder blades. The only reason I was able to see it was because her dress doesn't have any fabric around there,\" Felix added. The girl's dress strapped around her neck and her back above her midsection wasn't covered by the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where their cuts on those swollen parts?\" Ted questioned, \"As if there used to be something there like wings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did say something about humans cutting her wings and her not being able to use as powerful of spells,\" Felix added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, her magic comes from her wings. She's a fairy! They're going to have to keep cutting the wings, because if the base wasn't taken out, the wings will keep growing back. . I'm sure they didn't take out the base so they could use her powers if she's tamed, but there is something strange,\" Ted said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's strange?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was this fairy our size?\" Ted questioned. Once Felix nodded Ted continued, \"Fairies are usually around three inches. So, that means this fairy must have size changing capabilities. However, fairies of this country, or this world actually, can't change their size. The only explanation is that this is a Felaryan fairy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felaryan,\" Felix asked. Felix had never heard that word before and was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed didn't answer right away as a guard walked past. Ted and Felix had to stay quiet as the guard passed, because slaves weren't allowed to talk while working. Lord William didn't like slaves conversing with each other, because he had always feared a revolt. Once the guard was past, Ted answered, \"Felarya is another world or another dimension. People can only get there through random portals and dimensional gates. My father went there for a year and found it to be a chaotic place. Everything is gigantic there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like our country?\" Felix interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although the country we live in has many giant creatures in our world that are larger than most countries, but Felaryan creatures are much bigger. Even elves in Felarya are close to a hundred feet tall, when their only slightly taller than humans here. There are even bugs there that can eat people! Humans are at the bottom of the food chain and a treasured snack in that world,\" Ted explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a terrible place for humans,\" Felix commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not even the most demented part,\" Ted added, \"The large predators there, have the same intelligence as humans. They can think, reason, feel emotions, and everything else humans can do with their mind. They are human in mind yet different and more gigantic species. These top predators eat humans and only see humans delicious snack. They see humans as candy, not people. They're savages. Would you eat a fairy of this world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" Felix replied in disgust, \"Eating another intelligent life form is like murder and cannibalism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Ted replied, \"Yet, Felaryan creatures have no remorse eating humans. Even creatures like angels, fairies, centaurs, mermaids, and elves are giants that eat people. Even large nekros eat human sized versions or their own race, and elves do the same.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was horrified by this fact. He couldn't imagine eating something that could speak and think, let alone a miniature version of his own species. \"Felarya is a savage world and Lord William must not realize what he has. Felaryan fairies love eating humans as well. He won't be able to tame it. As soon as he lets it grow back its wings, it will just eat everyone. How can you tame something like that. Hell, how can you even befriend something that has no remorse that sees humans as snacks?\" Ted commented, \"I may not see most of the magical creatures of this world as monsters, but Felaryan creatures truly are monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of magic can she still use?\" Felix questioned worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very minor spells, especially if she has to resort to using the magical language due to her missing wings. However, she still might be able to shrink humans for a short period of time,\" Ted answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a short period of time?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple of minutes or so. Just enough to shrink someone, grab them, and swallow them whole. Once you're in a fairies stomach, there's no way out. The stomach impervious to magic and you wont grow back to your normal height while in her stomach,\" Ted warned, \"Stay as far as possible from that monster. She might shrink and eat you if you're in her reach.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Felix told Ted about the magic spell he was able to do. Ted told Felix only those with magic in their blood could make the magic language work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Felix didn't tell Ted about the magic he was able to use, and Felix left to feed the fairy once he finished scrubbing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix contemplated whether he should tell Ted about him being able to use magic or not. <i>\"He's my friend and he's told me so much already. But if I can use magic what does that mean?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"Does it mean I'm something more than human? I'm a some kind of monster? I'm going to have to ask him more about magic then I can decided whether to tell him the truth or not, depending on the answers.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce another guard past by, Felix asked, \"Could you tell me more about magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a few things about magic. What do you want to know?\" Ted asked staying quieter now that magic was the subject of their conversation. If one of the guards were to over hear, it wouldn't be good for either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does one use magic?\" Felix questioned, \"Do they need to say the words for a spell to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, those are only basic and starter magic. The magical language is meant to get people to get a feel for magic so that they can discover their greater powers within. The fact that this fairy is using such magic is either because she's too weak to do otherwise or she is a beginner. Either way, size change is natural to Felaryan fairies and they can do it at either age. It's just has a longer duration for older fairies and there are limits, but they are far too complicated to get into,\" Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think I should know to protect myself?\" Felix pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, magic gets stronger the more a person uses and practices it as well as the older they get. However, magic still zaps power so theirs a limit to how much can be used at one time,\" Ted explained, \"Now, all magical creatures have special and natural spells they are born with, such as a dragon's fire or a Felaryan Fairy's size change. These abilities are strong to begin with, but still need to be train to become more powerful. The weaker the fairy is with size changing, its age is a factor as well, the less damage it can do. The duration of the spell would be shorter, very large creatures wouldn't be able to shrink, the fairy wouldn't be able to grow itself as large as an expert, and other limits such as that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hopefully, the fairy is a novice,\" Felix muttered. Felix then asked Ted, \"Can magic be used by use saying a spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, magic has to be within a person's blood to do so. Plus, in order to do certain spells only a specific creature can do, one must have some of its blood in his or her blood,\" Ted informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can humans use magic?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it doesn't come natural. Long ago, people mated with magical creatures. This gave the child the use of magic. Even if that child were to marry a human and all the children after that were to marry humans, the magic would still be passed on in their blood, along with specific species magic. That family bloodline would continue to have magic blood till the bloodline stopped,\" Ted explained, \"There are other means of gain magic but those are less common.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I might not be human,\" Felix whispered a little louder in a panicked and horrified voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ted asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I used magic! I might not be human,\" Felix said in the same tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep quiet about something like that,\" Ted tried to calm his friend down, \"Even if that's how your bloodline gained magic, it could have been centuries ago, making you human. Besides, you don't even know if that's how you obtained magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Felix calmed down a little, but he was still a little shaky as he scrubbed the floors. \"How do you know you can use magic?\" Ted questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I repeated a spell that the fairy used and it worked,\" Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it wasn't the oats after all. It was the words you muttered,\" Ted realized, remembering Felix was the only one not affected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a specific spell?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not,\" Ted replied, \"Do you realize that if you learn to hone your magic we could...escape?\" Ted said the last word extremely quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I learn?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can make friends with the fairy? Maybe she'll help,\" Ted suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said she was dangerous and only saw humans as food,\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe she's too young to have had a human yet. Besides, she's intelligent, she might be able to reason that you're her only hope of escaping,\" Ted said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I should promise her a way to escape, but not let her escape with us when the time is, right?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's too dangerous to be trusted. She could easily turn on us once her wings grow back if we help her escape. She is a Felaryan after all. If you truly befriend her then maybe its possible, but she could fake that as well,\" Ted explained. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix was in the kitchen once more. Before he started taking things, he looked around the room and walked around quietly. The chef was not around and all his cooks weren't either. This was because Felix came to the kitchen after lunch and everyone had already finished their fill. Felix rushed up to the well in the kitchen that led to an underground river underneath the castle. Felix used it to fill five canteens that wouldn't be missed and put them on a cart. Then Felix took the unused meat packets and placed them on the cart as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he thought he had enough, he turned the cart to the doorway only to find the chef in his way with his arms crossed. \"You're back, eh?\" the Chef questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you this food isn't for me. It's for Master's pet. I've been instructed to keep it alive while Lord William tries to tame it,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found it odd Lord William would have you feed the new beast. So, I had a chat with him, and it seems as though you speak the truth, slave,\" the Chef, \"And now that I think of it, it is better for a slave to be the creature's keeper. Not only would you have to clean after it, but also if the creature should decide to devour you instead of the meat, Lord William could just get another slave to do your work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you let me through?\" Felix said, begging slightly, \"I have other tasks to do after I feed the creature and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot of canteens you have there,\" the chef interrupted, \"Does the creature really need five canteens of water? Or are you planning to escape and...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not escaping. The creature hadn't had water all day yesterday and it will need water,\" Felix quickly explained, \"Besides, when it empties some canteens it would have others as I refill the empty ones. I saw how neglected this canteens were and I didn't think anyone would mind if I use them for the creature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you aren't planning on leaving?\" the chef interrogated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Felix sighed, \"A slave's work my be shitty, but it is the only work and life I know. Even if I were to escape, I wouldn't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This slave life is the only life for a filthy bottom feeder like you,\" the chef added, \"Remember that, slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the chef stepped out of the way, Felix hurried out of the kitchen and towards the direction in which the dungeons were. Felix could never forget the comments like the last sentence the chef had said to him. Felix had heard so many phrases and words such as, \"Slave scum\", \"Slave\", \"What could can a slave do?\", \"You can't expect a slave to understand.\", and many more more demeaning things were said to Felix daily. Being exposed to such discrimination for five long years and made Felix numb.  For the most part, he couldn't feel the sting of such hurtful words anymore. In actuality, the words burrowed deep inside his soul making his numbness and depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlavery was all he knew, and he couldn't escape. Sadly, he wouldn't be able to make it on his own. he knew nothing of the outside world and nothing about freedom, just was the word meant. If he was going to escape, he would have to do it with a slave like Ted that was once free, otherwise, it was pointless. As harsh as it might seem, Felix believed it was better to live as a slave than die free from an inevitable and pointless death. Ted might think differently, but Felix was used to being a slave, it was his whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix arrived at the cell, but the guard stopped him. \"You aren't aloud in there yet, Felix. Lord William is trying to tame the beast now and he won't want to be bothered. It's best you stay out here till he's done,\" Randolph told Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was glad Randolph would be one of the guards guarding the cell and that he was the only guard at the moment. Randolph was unlike most of the guards, because he wasn't a mindless drone. He had started serving as a guard before William came into power thirteen years ago. Randolph was now thirty-four years old and had only served three years under the kind and noble lord before William, a lord Felix never was able to meet. It was said that the first lord, whose name was never aloud to be spoken in the presence of Lord William, died of a sickness and since William was the lord's adviser, William become lord. Many suspected Lord William had a hand in the death, but there was no prof. Some said Lord William had black magic that killed the lord, but that was a rumor. Randolph was a noble guard and pure in heart, but he did Lord William's bidding only because he was one of the view nice guards. Randolph was one of the few that didn't treat the slaves as some subspecies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix waited only for a minute before Lord William burst out of the cell with his personal guards. \"Damn creature,\" Lord William growled to himself, \"It deserves the punishment I gave it for using such trickery magic on me. It will learn soon enough not to use magic against me, or it will suffer much greater than I already give to it. It doesn't even have the slightest clue of what true torture, pain, and misery are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William stopped talking to himself and looked at Felix. \"You are not to feed the creature yet,\" Lord William ordered, \"It must think on its sins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long must I wait?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An hour should give it time to sink in,\" Lord William stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I have tasks after this,\" Felix argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William took the back of his hand and smacked it against Felix's face before saying, \"You will do as you're told. It will just take you longer to finish your chores.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William walked away with his royal guards and Felix looked at to Randolph. \"Randolph, could you please let me in,\" Felix pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord William told you to wait an hour. What if he finds you doing your other tasks before the hour past?\" Randolph questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never see Lord William until during the evening tasks,\" Felix explained, \"Even if I do run into him, I'll tell him I decided to do some tasks while I wait for the hour to pass. Then I'd have to pretend to come back down here to feed the fairy and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The creature is a fairy?\" Randolph questioned, finding it hard to imagine imprisoning a fairy, making it a \"pet\", and calling it a beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't know it was a fairy?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never looked in the cell,\" Randolph informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a Felaryan fairy, or Ted thinks so. Those are more monstrous and they eat humans by either shrinking humans or becoming giants. Ted said they have no remorse about eating humans,\" Felix explained, \"Now, can I go in, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Randolph gave up after a long hesitation, \"But you mustn't let Lord William see you before the hour mark and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I am found out that I went in the cell early, I'll tell him that he didn't order you to keep me out just ordered me to stay out. His anger will all be on me,\" Felix assured Randolph before pushing the cart in the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Felix was back in the cell with the fairy, the fairy wasn't skipping around and dancing like the last time. Instead, the fairy was on its knees with her face buried deep in her hands, crying. He crying was like nothing Felix had ever heard before. It was a sob poisoned with sorrow, misery, pain, and loneliness that Felix never thought was possible. <i>\"What did Lord William do to her?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"She looks so scared and helpless.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix began forgetting that she was a dangerous creature that couldn't be trusted, because in all honesty, she was a trickster fairy that probably enjoyed eating humans. She was a Felaryan after all and even though humans have the same level of intelligences as the Felaryan top predators, Felaryan top predators knew humans were a different species and that helped them see humans as food. It also helped them see humans as food when humans were usually much smaller than Felaryan top predators, too small to be considered equals or anything more than food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix forgot what Ted had warned and started seeing the fairy as just a normal girl who was emotionally injured. She was crying uncontrollably which made Felix feel extremely sorry for her. <i>\"I can't let her just cry like this,\"</i> Felix told himself, <i>\"I remember my first few months when no one was around to out of the depression. It made me feel worthless and alone. I can't let the same thing happen to her. Also, if I help comfort her, she might become my true friend and help Ted and I escape by teaching me magic. That way, I can help her escape to and not worry about her turning on me and eating me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like a good plan, but he had no idea that Felaryan creatures had a much different logic than the humans of his world. There were times when Felaryan top predators would make friends with humans, but even when that happened, it didn't necessarily mean the human was safe. Even if the Felaryan was friends with the human, it still might have the urge to eat the human because the Felaryan might either be addicted to human flesh or the Felaryan top predator mindset that humans weren't good for anything but food could be drilled deep in the Felaryan's mind. Still, becoming friends with a Felaryan was a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix slowly approached the fairy with the cart so that it didn't make too much noise. The fairy's cries drowned out what little noise the cart made while going slowly. Once the cart was near her, Felix approached closer to the fairy till he was within inches. Felix then knelt down beside her and touched her shoulder in order to try and comfort her, but before Felix could say any words of comfort, the fairy quickly turned her head and faced him with glowing eyes. The next thing Felix knew was he was shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the evil man who called himself master of her left, the fairy began crying uncontrollably. <i>\"Humans are dangerous to you right now, Fakira,\"</i> the fairy, Fakira, could hear her mother saying, <i>\"You mustn't confront humans till your magic is much stronger and not until you're an adult. It's true that humans are just food we can eat, but they are still dangerous in numbers against a fairy who hasn't developed all her magical powers yet.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Fakira hadn't listened to her mother and was captured by humans before she could defend herself. Now, she was stuck in a dark cell without wings and being tortured by a man who wanted her to be his slave. <i>\"Evil, nasty, terrible humans. If I escape and my wings grow back, I'll show those humans whose the better predator. I'll show them what their meant to be. They're nothing more than snack that deserve to go in my stomach. All humans are just evil, nasty creatures,\"</i> Fakira thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't encountered humans before that day when she was captured. From what her mother had taught her, humans seemed as though they were just mindless animals that could be snacks for her. Her mother never told her that humans matched the same type of intelligence as her. When Fakira encountered many humans, she learned they were intelligent creatures that could actually speak. This shocked Fakira long enough for the humans to capture her. Since the only humans she saw were nasty and evil creatures that tortured and discriminated her, she thought all humans were like that making her understand why humans should know their place and be food to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Fakira felt a hand on her shoulder and she quickly thought it was the evil man wanting to harm her again. She knew she could still shrink a human to about three inches, the size of a normal fairy, for two minutes. It was long enough to capture the human next to her and eat it, because once its in her stomach, it didn't grow back to normal size. Thinking it was the evil man that deserved to die, Fakira turned and used the spell to shrink the human. The human shrunk, with his clothes, to about three inches. However, Fakira realized it was the human who brought the food the other night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's not the evil man,\"</i> Fakira thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But it's still an evil human,\"</i> Fakira could almost hear her mother saying, <i>\"You can't let a human go to waste, my child.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira smiled and reached down to pick up and devour the human.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Please wait!\" Felix called as the large hand four times his new size came downwards aiming at him, \"I don't want to hurt you!\"  Fakira heard him but ignored his plea. The fairy kept reaching downwards at the same pace. Felix could do nothing to prevent it. He just raised his arms outward to the oncoming hand, but what good would it have done now that he was much smaller and weaker than the fairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira wrapped her fingers around the Felix's body and lifted him in the air. Felix panicked when his feet left the ground. He knew he had to think fast or he'd be eaten by the fairy, because the fairy wasn't going to hesitate. It was going to eat him without any remorse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evil humans are liars, deceivers, and most of all food,\" Fakira said, pulling Felix to her face quickly and smiling with all her teeth showing.  Felix might have said her teeth were very pretty, though sharp and her smile beautiful, but there was a evil almost wickedness to the smile as it knew of his doom. The fairy licked her lips and opened her mouth wide and as Felix saw himself approaching the dark abyss before him, panic flew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Please!\" Felix screamed. The fairy noted his panic and fear. So, Fakira slowed her hand's approach to her mouth so she could torment the human longer.  Felix suddenly recalled the fairy's spell when he was slowly getting closer to the gaping mouth. \"Efno Helpu Calcium!\" he stumbled, \"Ethan Heaplu Culam!  Wait!  Ethna Hepalu Calum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy was laughing inwardly as the tiny human tried using her magic against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Stupid human,\"</i> she thought as Felix shouted the actual spell inches away from being eaten.  Having not expected magic, Fakira didn't have a chance to protect herself from the magic.  And given Felix's proximity to her and how much emotion he put into it, Fakira quickly let go of Felix and grabbed her stomach in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy's fingers let go of Felix and her hand fell down to her stomach almost before Felix even started falling. Felix fell the length of Fakira's torso until landing on her lap. Felix then began sliding against the fabric of her dress that only went down to her knees and down the slanted incline of the lap. Felix eventually was able to grab hold of the fabric and stopped himself. Looking up, he saw the fairy already leaning forward with her hands clutching her stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix rolled off her lap and onto the rocky ground. The fall should have hurt him more, but it didn't seem to harm his shrunken body and he ran away from the legs, hoping he was far enough away from the fairy and hoping the fairy's spell would wear off soon. The pain was brief as he saw the fairy straighten up and look at him with an angry glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the evil man now sent you to use magic against me?\" Fakira growled.  One hand continued massaging her stomach, while the other reached for the tiny human.  She glared at Felix viewing him now more than an evil human but a traitor to fairies, helping the evil man hurt her.  \"Traitor,\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No please, I'm not evil!  I didn't know I could use magic until I met you!\" Felix shouted, moving away.

I'm not even supposed to be in here!  He told me to wait to feed you but I defied his orders to come in here!\" Felix said.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fakira knew that if she wanted to eat the human, she would have to do it at that time. The human would only be able to be shrunk for a certain amount of time and she wouldn't be able to shrink another human for a few hours. So, she had to grab the human right then and eat him so he wouldn't grow, but the fairy hesitated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira thought about the human's claim and studied the now tiny human just within reach if she were to reach for it. <i>\"This human is much younger than the others. He's been in her before, but he didn't hurt me,\"</i> Fakira thought, <i>\"Besides, this human can use magic. What does that mean?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not here to torture me, then what are you here for? And be quick or I shall eat you anyway,\" Fakira demanded, \"I don't have troubles eating humans, and I really do want to try it. You humans are supposed to be very delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I meant no harm to you,\" Felix replied quickly knowing the fairy might not hesitate for too long, \"My master just wants me to feed you, give you water, keep you alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you just set the food and water down? Why did you touch my shoulder?\" Fakira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you crying,\" Felix explained, \"You looked so sad. I couldn't just let you cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" Fakira asked. She couldn't understand why a human would be concerned with her feelings. Not only did she see humans as evil, now, but also, humans were a different species. She was a Felaryan and Felaryans saw the meaning of a person differently. For them, just because someone has intelligence, it didn't mean it was a person. For something to be a person to a Felaryan, it had to either be the same species or a race that is the size of a top predator and/or a species their species is friends with. Humans, however, saw a person as something with the same or greater intelligence which made Felix see the fairy as a human instead of a monster. Fakira didn't understand this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you were crying and you remind me of myself and others that are my friends,\" Felix replied. He didn't understand why it would be a hard concept to the fairy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know you're not lying to me right now?\" Fakira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you truly don't believe me and you have no doubts that I'm lying, then go a head and eat me,\" Felix told the fairy, \"I approached you because you were sad and I wanted to comfort you. I knew you could shrink me and eat me, but I thought you would understand that I only meant to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix closed his eyes tightly and tensed up as he waited for the fairy to respond. He thought he would feel her fingers wrapping around him again. Yet, nothing happened. Felix opened his eyes and saw the fairy just continuing to stare at him with suspicion. Fakira still didn't trust the human and she still didn't see it as a person, but Fakira knew it could use magic. <i>\"If it can use magic when I can't, it might be a way out. I might be able to convince it to help me escape. It might mean having to pretend to be its friend, but it could be an escape plan,\"</i> Fakira concocted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Fakira could imagine her mother agreeing, <i>\"Then you can eat the human once your wings grow back. Or maybe if you should accidentally get a little attached to it, it could always be a pet or a 'slave' which he says he is.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Felix and all his clothes with him grew back to his normal size. \"How much magic can you use?\" Fakira questioned once Felix was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know any spells other than the one I used on you. I only did it to save my life not to purposely give you harm,\" Felix tried explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you really know nothing about magic,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so interested all of the sudden?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen human,\" Fakira said, \"I'm going to teach you some magic. Just enough for you to free me from these chains and some other spells needed to defend yourself. Then, you are going to help me out of here and we're going to escape together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a second option?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I eat you,\" Fakira replied with another evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, if you do that, you don't have magic,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to eat you now, human?\" Fakira questioned evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. I agree to your terms,\" Felix quickly replied. it was just what he wanted and just what he planned with Ted. <i>\"She's going to teach me magic and then Ted and I will be able to escape. I have to be careful how I go about this though. She'll have suspicions that I might not help her escape,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you feeding me or what?\" Fakira asked.</span></div></div>",

My name is Felix.\"  He saw Fakira smile an evil smile as he handed over the meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix,\" she replied, \"Don't ask me stupid questions worm.\"  She flashed her sharp teeth before tearing into the meat.  Felix, shaking a little, returned to the cart and put down the canteens of water near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Felix said, \"But would you do something for me?\" Felix tried to sound as little imposing with his question, otherwise it could land him in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira scowled at Felix. \"What did I just say?\" she asked darkly.  Felix rose his hands quickly, shaking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait please.  Remember I said I wasn't meant to feed you just yet?  If they find out I did, we'll both be punished,\" Felix explained quickly.  Fakira said nothing except take another bite of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" she asked arrogantly, while inwardly listening to the human.  She didn't want to get beaten like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Continue crying for a bit and hide the canteens of water,\" Felix said, \"That way if Lord William comes by. He won't realize you ate.\"  Fakira thought on Felix's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's to my benefit as much as his.  If I want to get out of here, focusing my energy to heal wounds takes away from healing my wings,\"</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" she said, before draining at least to of the canteens of their water and focused her eyes on all the canteens.  Felix was amazed to see all five shrink before him.  \"Inanimate objects stay small longer, even without wings,\" Fakira explained. However, the last bit was more of a growl as if she blamed Felix for the loss of her wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way Felix was right to fell Fakira was blaming him, because she blamed all humans. Because of everything her mother taught her about humans, Fakira felt as though all humans were the same. Humans were evil and insignificant beings that are too small to be much of anything except food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll be back later,\" Felix said heading to the cart.

All she could find herself thinking about was how different the human feeder, Felix, had acted towards her. <i>\"That human was very strange,\"</i> Fakira thought to herself, <i>\"Not only could he use magic, but he seemed to be kind to me.

It's still a human. It's a different species and a prey species to predators like me. It can't possibly be my friend.

I shouldn't have troubles eating it when it's time, but just in case, I mustn't let myself get to close to him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait!\"</i> Fakira realized, <i>\"There might be a different reason it's acting kindly to me. Either it's stupid and thinks it can win me over so that I don't eat him, or it's pretending to be kind to me to show him how to use magic.

I have to do something to make sure it doesn't leave me behind, but what?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Fakira decided to only teach Felix a certain amount of magic so that he would still need her for the escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Fakira pretends to be friends with Felix so that he thinks she wouldn't harm him if he helped her escape.</span></div></div>",

It had to appear natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not eating me, hiding the canteens, teaching me magic,\" Felix replied, \"Lord William is a monster I just want to get away from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many humans are monsters,\" Fakira said darkly.  \"You, I'm not so sure about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you for that as well,\" Felix said, taking it as a compliment.  \"Do you mind if I ask you what your home was like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  You'd be an insect there,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because all I've known is this castle.

I should have known the memory would make you sad,\" Felix apologized, \"To show you how sorry I am, I'll let you punish me for my stupidity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira was shocked by what the human would 'let' her do. It was one thing for a human to be sorry to another species (Fakira still couldn't grasp the concept on what humans view as a person), but it was another thing for a human to suggest a punishment for himself as an apology to another species. Fakira couldn't hold in her shock as she asked, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Lord William punishes me for my stupidity and failures and it makes him feel better doing so. Maybe it will make you feel better punishing me,\" Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Seems logical, but what is his angle? What could he possibly gain by letting me punish him? There has to be an angle. No one could be that apologetic to another species,\"</i> Fakira wondered, <i>\"Maybe he's willing to let me punish him because he knows I can't risk killing him. Maybe it's his way of showing me he's in control. he might realize I need him to escape!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira didn't realize it, but there were actually two reasons Felix was willing to be punished. One was that Felix was just too used to being punished after his failures and stupidity. Felix had been punished by Lord William for every failure and Felix felt he should be punished after every failure. It wasn't that he liked being punished, but he just saw it as a fact of life since it happened every time. He thought it was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second reason was that he felt that the fairy might actually feel better. Felix wanted the fairy to feel better so that she might actually become nicer and possibly become a friend. By putting his life in her hands, quite literally, maybe she would see how sincere he was at trying to be her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Felix had no idea what he was up against. He was up against everything the fairy was brought up to be. The way the fairy saw humans was considered a way of life and a fact to all the Felaryan fairies. All Felaryan top predators defined a person as something of their species or something their size. It didn't matter to a Felaryan top predator if something had intelligence and had feelings and emotions. They had to be the same size or the same species, preferably both since Felaryan Elves, which are close to 100 feet as well, have no problem eating regular elves. In fact, elves are even tastier that humans and humans were slightly tastier than nekos. Since Felix wasn't the same species and wasn't the same size as Fakira, (Fakira believed herself to be eighty feet tall. In actuality, she was three inches, but she and her clan were giant all the time and she was usually eighty feet tall. So, Fakira, even if she's human sized now, still saw Felix as a small creature.) Fakira didn't see Felix as a person and only saw him as a weak little prey that deserved to be in her stomach once she had her wings back. Unfortunately, Felix might not have a chance of breaking through to Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of punishment do you have in mind?\" Fakira questioned while showing off her sharp teeth in a wicked grin. <i>\"This human will know his place once I punish him. After that I can gradually pretending to be kinder to him. But for now, I will show him that I'm not afraid of getting rid of him, and show him I'm only using him because I feel like it, not because he;s my only hope,\"</i> Fakira thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you can shrink me again,\" Felix suggested meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrink you?\" Fakira replied, her tone in a very disturbing tease, \"You want me to shrink you and do what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you want,\" Felix informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize you humans are supposed to be the second tastiest creatures that can be eaten. It might be hard to resist myself from eating you upon having a second chance,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care too much,\" Felix replied, \"If you deem death as a fair punishment, then I will respect your decision and I won't resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Felix continued once he tensed up and closed his eyes, \"Go a head and shrink me now and do what you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I'd like to start right away with your punishment,\" Fakira told Felix, \"I still don't have the energy to shrink you. However, I'll be able to shrink you in a few hours when you come back down to feed me dinner. When you come to feed me, I'll shrink you then and do whatever I want with your shrunken body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you planning to do with me?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for me to know and you to find out,\" Fakira teased, \"But I can tell you that it will be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix gulped when he heard her say it would be fun. He knew all too well her fun would most likely be his misery. Felix suddenly heard three knocks on the cell door and he told the fairy, \"I have to go now, but I'll be back for your dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll be waiting here to punish you,\" Fakira added with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix left the cell with the cart and Randolph shut the door behind Felix immediately after Felix was out of the cell. \"you'll have to be careful when feeding the fairy tonight,\" Randolph warned, \"I'll be replaced soon and the one replacing me will be one of the mindless guards that can't think for themselves. They only follow the orders of Lord William and will only help you if they're ordered to do so by Lord William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, I'll be careful,\" Felix replied. Inwardly, Felix was slightly happy. he could spend more time in the cell with the fairy without the guard suspecting something. Felix might even be able to start learning magic after the punishment. He might even be able to spend the night in the cell without the guard suspecting something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix met Ted again during tasks and during dinner, but they decided it wasn't the best time to talk about the plan or the fairy. They decided it was too dangerous to talk during those times and that it would be better to talk that night when all the other slaves were asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner and after his remaining tasks, Felix went back to the kitchen. he filled the three canteens and obtained a meat package and placed them on the cart before pushing it to the dungeons. Randolph had been right. The guard by the sell was one of the \"loyals\". The loyals didn't have free will of their own and did only what Lord William told them to do. Lord William had only told the guard to keep everyone out except of his Lordship and the slave feeding the creature. Lord William didn't tell the guard how long Felix should be and Felix could be in there as long as he wanted without the guard suspecting. This also meant that if Felix were to be in trouble, the guard wouldn't help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard opened the door for Felix and Felix pushed the cart through the doorway. The fairy was waiting in the same spot as usual, and Felix pushed the cart in arms length of the fairy. Once he did this, Felix felt a familiar shrinking feeling and he was once again three inches tall. Felix looked up at the fairy that appeared to be massive to him when she was still only sitting on her ankles! The fairy smiled once more as she reached down to him. Felix didn't resist and \"let\" the fingers wrap around his punny body and lift him up to her enormous face. The fairy's face was cute, beautiful, and terrifying at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo, what should I do with you, little human?\" Fakira questioned while elongating her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Fakira pretended she was going to eat him and put him in her mouth to play with him. It was only to show her dominance over him and not to eat him, despite how good he tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Fakira finds another way to humiliate him. (Nothing sexual, please!) </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fakira's stomach growled and she stared down at Felix while licking her lips slowly. Felix looked deep in her eyes and knew what she was planning. She was hungry and he was now snack sized to her. She was going to eat him as his punishment. Human flesh was now on the menu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to eat me, are you?\" Felix questioned, even though there was no doubt in his mind she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am hungry and human flesh is a delicacy,\" Fakira informed Felix, \"Fairies should never pass up eating a human when they have the chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a deal though,\" Felix argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave me the choice to do whatever punishment I see fit,\" Fakira replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix sighed, \"If you deem death is the best punishment, then so be it. I won't resist you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're smart, for a little snack,\" Fakira said as she tilted her clutched hand so that Felix would be facing her mouth head first. She then proceeded to open her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked forward and saw the wet prison that awaited him. The entrance had rows of sharp white teeth above and blow and her lips were parted so well that Felix could even see the gums holding the teeth in her jaws. The walls of the the moist prison were the pink insides of her cheeks and the thick, moist, pink tongue awaiting to taste his delicious flesh. Beyond that was the back of her throat where the uvula dangled over a dark abyss Felix felt he would soon go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felix watched in horror, Fakira pulled him in closer. Once Felix's shoulders were in the mouth and between her lips, the fairy closed her mouth and engulfed him with her lips. The fairy then slurped him till his whole body was lying on top of her tongue and he was encased in complete darkness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix's mind panicked and he quickly rose to his hands and knees which helped him back up from the throat. Felix turned his body and faced the only safe way out of the mouth. He could see the outlining of the white teeth, but that was it! He thought about running to the teeth to pound on them and plead. However, Felix was used to getting punished for his mistakes and this was no different. It was just a punishment that he would have to accept. he still didn't want to die and didn't like it one bit, but he let the fairy choose the punishment and he respected her decision. Felix sighed deeply and sat on his ankles like the fairy had done. He lifted his slobber covered hands from the soft moist tongue that acted as the floor beneath him and he placed them on his laps. Felix closed his eyes and waited for the end to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Felix felt the tongue rise beneath him and he lost his balance. Felix fell face first on the tongue and was forced upwards. Soon, Felix as sandwiched between the soft and saliva filled tongue and the hard roof of the fairy's mouth. The thick tongue pressed Felix against the roof firmly as it rubbed against his front. The soft surface of the tongue was slightly rough due to the taste buds rubbing against him. (Now that he was three inches tall, her taste buds were larger too him and he could feel their roughness.) The rough scraping didn't last long didn't last too long, because the saliva from the fairy's glands continued to squirt in her mouth. Soon the saliva acted like a lubricant between Felix and the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She likes my taste,\"</i> Felix realized when the constant saliva began to hit him, <i>\"She likes my taste and she's not going to let me out. She's going to eat me and there's nothing I can do about it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix began to cry as he waited for his doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira waited a while before she started tasting him. She had been told by her mother that it was just as fun tormenting the humans as their taste. She had been told that humans would panic, plead, and try to fight her once in her mouth. Fakira's mother would find it funny and pathetic that her prey would do anything and everything to escape an inevitable doom. <i>\"The humans will try anything to escape because they know what awaits them,\"</i> Fakira remembered her mother saying to her one day, <i>\"Once they realize they aren't even a match for your tongue, they'll try to plead for you to show them mercy. However, you won't give it. It is just the way life is. Predator and prey. A predator needs to eat and a prey is to be eaten.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira felt the human get on his hands and knees and she thought he would soon start fighting her and trying to open her mouth. However, the human didn't nothing of the sort. Instead, it just sat there on her tongue and waited. <i>\"What's wrong with it?\"</i> Fakira wondered, <i>\"Why doesn't it fight like mother said it would? Maybe I have to give him a reason to fight.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira moved her tongue and forced him to the roof of her mouth while finally tasting human flesh for the first time. The taste overtook her and she couldn't think of anything other than the taste. <i>\"Mother is right!\"</i> Fakira thought, <i>\"Human flesh is like ecstasy! I can only imagine what an elf taste like. Ooooh, this human is sooooo good! It's so hard to resist eating him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Fakira knew she needed the human alive, at least long enough to free her. She had to stop her instincts and began thinking about something else other than the human's taste, even though it was extremely hard to do so. <i>\"How come he's not resisting? I can taste tears and he mustn't want to be eaten. Yet, he doesn't fight me like the humans mother talks about. Does he know I'm bluffing? What could he gain from not fighting me?\"</i> Fakira just couldn't figure it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira opened her mouth and stuck out her tongue with Felix lying flat against it. She then tilted her tongue to her open hand and Felix rolled onto her palm. Felix rose to his hands and knees, drenched in saliva. \"Now you know whose in control human,\" Fakira's voice boomed over Felix's small body, \"I have total power over you and I could have easily swallowed you. I would have loved having a little human trapped in my stomach. Mother says that a little human pounding at the lining of your stomach feels just as good as all the other experiences of eating a human. Lucky of you, stupidity isn't a high enough crime to die for and I didn't eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix feel back on his butt and looked up at the fairy, still shaking with fear. \"My saliva has a substance in it that keeps you whatever size you are now. So, you will be three inches until you are completely dried off,\" Fakira informed the human in her palm, \"Which means we might be able to do something else that's fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Fakira decides to play with Felix some more while he's still little. She begins playing with him as if he was a little doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Fakira can't think of anything at the moment and just puts Felix on her lap while she eats dinner.</span></div></div>",

His tone was filled with acceptance of the facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why does this human not fight back?\"</i> she wondered, <i>\"How can he accept such punishments with no open complaint?  I guess if I don't get out of here, this might be my fate.\"</i>  Fakira growled at that thought and it was followed by another growl from her body.  Fakira looked to her stomach and rose with Felix in her hand.  She walked over to the cart happy she shrunk him after it was in her range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky human,\" Fakira said, \"I decided not to punish you until I've eaten.\"  She grabbed the meat and canteens with her free  hand and walked back to her spot.  She sat down and placed Felix on her long green dress so he sat on her lap. With that hand free, she lifted up the meat and began feasting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of disappointment etched on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Humans taste better.  But I can't eat him, not yet.  Who knows, maybe I won't have to befriend him, just make him look to me as his mistress?\"</i> Fakira thought as she dripped very little of the meat's juices onto herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix, for his part, was in awe at watching how Fakira was very cute.  While he knew she could kill him with little remorse right now, he had never seen a girl who was even close to his age before.  Mostly he saw the tramps who lived in the castle pleasuring the loyal guards and sometimes Lord William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Fakira a small amount of time to finish her meat before she looked down at Felix.  As she looked at the door, she recalled a strange event earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human, why did that one guard let you out?\" Fakira asked, as she licked her hands clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Randolph isn't like many of the guards here.  He doesn't follow Lord William's orders absolutely,\" Felix said, \"That's how I was able to feed you before Lord William said for me to.\"  Fakira nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he the one outside now?\" Fakira asked, wondering if their playtime would be forced to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, one of the loyals is out there.  They follow orders to the letter,\" Felix replied, \"So the only person we have to worry about finding us is Lord William himself.\"  Fakira shuddered slightly from both anger and fear.  While it was small, to someone of Felix's size, it was noticable.  \"Do you hate lord William more than any other human?\" Felix asked.  Fakira glared down at the tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He hurts me, cuts my wings, and he  . . .\"  Fakira seethed, obvioulsy enraged by the meer idea of Lord William.  \"You hate him as well, don't you?\"</span></div></div>",

When I was first put into slavery, I knew I hated him,\" Felix told the fairy without looking at her and continuing to look down at her green dress, \"I was five years old when I was put into slavery. I don't remember my parents or how I got here. I just remember being here and being forced to do things I didn't want to do. If I resisted, I was punished and Lord William or the guards would whip me and cause much pain. I remember crying myself to sleep many nights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no friends then, no one to care about me. I've been a slave for five years now,\" Felix continued, \"And now I don't know what I should feel like anymore. Most of my emotions had been torn out of me, and I don't even mind the tasks and the constant beatings anymore. I've just learned to accept being a slave, as bad as that may seem. He's got me trained so well, I even fear escaping without someone who knows what it's like outside the walls.. I've said before to myself that it's better living as a slave than dying out there for no other reason than being free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix sighed, \"That's why I don't know if I hate Lord William since he's gotten me used to slavery and I've learned to accept it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira hesitated for the longest time as she stared down at the sad looking human on her lap. In that long hesitation, Fakira forgot about him being another species and a small speck. She now heard a brief story of his past and it saddened her, because it could be her if she lived as Lord William's pet for as long as the human. Fakira shivered at the thought of growing to her normal size and still obeying Lord William without hesitation. She imagined herself graveling at his feet so that he wouldn't punish her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My fate could be the same as this humans,\"</i> Fakira thought sadly. because of this thought, she felt a slight connection with the human that she never thought possible. It was this connection that made her forget he was a small prey creature only meant for a snack. During that long hesitation, she forgot her mother's teachings. She actually felt sorry for the human on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The poor thing,\"</i> Fakira thought as she actually stroked his back with a finger, <i>\"He's had such a terrible life and its turned him into a shell of a person.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I tried to comfort you when you were tortured by Lord William,\" Felix said while finally looked up at the fairy's face, \"You reminded me of myself during my first months and I didn't want you to end up like me. I wanted to help you. To be your friend if you wanted one.\" As Felix looked up at the fairy's face, he knew that he was getting to her somehow. He knew that if he could genuinely make her a friend, he wouldn't have to leave her when he and Ted escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Fakira snapped back out of her trance and glared at the human before saying, \"I'm not like you. I'm not a little worthless prey. I'm a predator and I don't need your help. What could you possibly help me with besides being my meal?\" Fakira questioned before looking away from the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can't let him get to me. He's prey and can do nothing for me other than being prey. A small creature like him can't be a friend. it just can't. I can't allow myself to gain feeling for this pathetic creature, because it might be harder for me to eat him after my wings grow back and I've escaped,\"</i> Fakira thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am helping you escape this place, am I not?\" Felix questioned, \"Isn't that something other than feeding you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira sighed, \"I suppose we do have a deal that I will teach you magic and you'll help me escape. However, this is not because I need you. I could find a way to escape without you. I just choose to have you help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the fairy was still looking away, Felix looked at himself and he was still very much drenched in the saliva. He was going to stay three inches for a long time. <i>\"At least I started getting to her,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"She had looked at me with pity in her eyes for a long moment and actually rubbed my back while I told my story. It's a good start to developing friendship.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Felix broke the silence, \"What do you want to do with me now?\"</span></div></div>",

I couldn't believe the pain.\"  Felix nodded, not saying anything right away to it didn't sound like he pitied her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, if we were to cast spells together, would they be more powerful?\" Felix asked.  Fakira nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much stronger, depending on how much magic is in you, little human,\" Fakira said. Felix suddenly smiled.  \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if you teach me the shrink spell?\" Felix asked.  \"And then when the time comes we can use it on Lord William together if your wings aren't back.\"  Fakira glared at Felix for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly,\" Fakira said, not liking the idea of needing a human to shrink another one.  But part of her knew it might be the case, especially if the evil Lord kept her wings from growing back.  <i>\"Growing back . . .\"</i> Fakira thought, smiling a toothy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could also teach you a healing spell that we could do together to help heal my wings.

If she gained her wings, she'd be able to use all her powers and she would also be able to shrink humans or enlarge herself for however long she wanted and wouldn't have to worry about a time limit. She would become powerful, and Felix knew he couldn't trust her yet. Although he was getting to her, because she did pity him when he told her his story, but she was a friend yet and she still was trying to see him as a bug instead of a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think it would be better for me to learn some offensive spells so I can help you when we escape?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The shrinking spell is more complicated than healing,\" Fakira stated, \"Besides, you might not even be able to use that spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only Felaryan fairies can use the shrinking and growing spells,\" Fakira informed Felix, \"You have to have fairy blood in you foe it to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since fairies of my world can't use shrinking and growing spells, I'd have to have Felaryan fairy blood in me,\" Felix added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairies here can't use shrinking and growing spells?\" Fakira asked in genuine surprise and shock. Even the youngest of Felaryan Fairy could do the simplest growing and shrinking spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can't do those kind of spells,\" Felix told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how big are they?\" Fakira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adults are about three inches tall,\" Felix answered, remembering what Ted told Felix about normal fairies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira was a little confused. She thought it was normal for fairies to be eighty feet or taller because she had stayed a giant like her clan for as long as she could remember. So here that fairies here were about three inches tall, (the normal size for a Felaryan fairy that didn't use growing magic, but Fakira didn't know that because her and her clan make themselves giant. She thinks her normal size is a giant.) <i>\"These fairies must be inferior fairies or a different species of fairy to be so small. Hmmm, I wonder if they taste better than humans or elves,\"</i> Fakira thought. That remembered Fakira of something. \"Are there little elves here like on my world or are they all giants,\" Fakira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all human-sized in this world,\" Felix answered, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, elves are supposedly the only things that are tastier than humans,\" Fakira explained, \"I'll have to find one and try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You getting us off of subject. So, you think I woun't be able to preform shrinking and growing spells?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless a Felaryan fairy came to this planet and had sex with one of your ancestors, but all that his highly unlikely. For one, why would a Felaryan fairy come here. It's a dreadful place,\" Fakira stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted, a friend of mine who used to be free, tells me the world outside these castle walls is beautiful and full of adventure,\" Felix informed Fakira, \"Also, it would make sense for a Felaryan fairy to come here if everything here is smaller. That fairy would have a smorgasbord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your may be right about that, human slave,\" Fakira replied, \"This place is full of smaller creatures that I can fit in my stomach. If I can't get home, staying here will benefit me. I can see a Felaryan fairy coming here. However, a Felaryan fairy getting to together with a human and feeling for it is just absurd. Humans aren't people. They're just prey because they're so small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knew it wasn't impossible for a fairy to feel for a human. The fairy had felt pity for him and even tried to comfort him not to long ago. However, Felix knew it wasn't best to remind the fairy of this and he just pretended to agree.\"So, you believe it is impossible for me to have fairy blood,\" Felix stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you might not have even gained your magic from ancestors getting together with magical creatures. There are many different ways for humans to gain magic,\" Fakira replied, \"The only way to tell if you have a magical creature's blood in you is that if you're able to do a spell only they can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, healing isn't a specific spell only a specific species can do?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Healing powers can be used by many and almost every magical creature,\" Fakira informed Felix, \"So, even you could do it human. As long as you practice enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it better for me to do magic in my normal size?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spells are stronger when you're not small,\" Fakira informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then should we wait till I dry off?\" Felix asked.  </span></div></div>",

Want to eat other humans?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, so we can get you free sooner,\" Felix said, \"If I shrink you, your bonds should fall off of you and we could escape.\"  Fakira glared at Felix and didn't like that plan.  It wasn't the teaching him the spell that really bugged her. It was if she was shrunk, she'd have to put her life in his hands.  And to her, he was only food, possibly a pet.  So to put that much trust in him was beyond stupid to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Fakira could respond, Felix suddenly grew tall once more.  He smiled at being his normal height once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, so what are the healing spells?\" Felix asked, changing the subject quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inamo Medicamo Ingwaloo,\" Fakira said, \"But before you try that, you need to focus magic into your hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.  Why though?  I did that cramp spell with no problems,\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a curse and hurt many but caster.  No focus needed unless only targeting one being,\" Fakira said, \"Now to call on magic, close your eyes and feel something awaken inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded and closed his eyes.  He searched inside himself for a few minutes.  Then he found it.  It felt warm and empowering at the same moment.  He knew it was something that was his, for the first time in his life, it was something that was his and couldn't be taken from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I found it,\" Felix said.  Fakira nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now force magic to hands and chant the words,\" Fakira said, moving her back to his outstretched hands.  Felix nodded and willed the energy to move energy from where it was to his hands.  With a calming breath, he spoke the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inamo Medicamo Ingwaloo,\" Felix said firmly.  Fakira felt the magic affect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Felix do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1:  Nothing happened. Growing back Fakira's wings were far too advanced for Felix at that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2:  Because he's still thinking of that shrinking plan, Fakira shrunks a few inches instead. This proves Felix has fairy magic and that he could shrink Fakira much smaller if he trains himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fakira could feel the magic Felix was emitting and she thought it was going to work. She thought that she would finally have her wings healed and the she would be able to be rid of the terrible place and lord. However, almost as soon as she felt the magic, it abruptly ended and Fakira could feel nothing. \"What's wrong now?\" Fakira growled as she turned around to see what the human slave was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira soon saw that the human was on his knees with he his looking to the ground. The human looked exasperated and he was breathing heavily. Fakira didn't understand what the problem was, at first, but then she soon realized what was wrong. <i>\"The spell is too much for him. He may be old enough to do the spell, but he hasn't used magic till now. There is years of magic built in him and he should be able to do simi-powerful magic, but since he hasn't used that magic his whole life, he needs to learn to control and tame that magic first. This means, I'll have to teach him from scratch and teach him more minor spells first,\"</i> Fakira came to the conclusion, <i>\"I hope he's a fast learner like I was, but then again, it's not natural for humans to do magic. He'll probably be a slow learner.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira growled in anger upon letting that last thought slip into her mind. She was going to be stuck in the cell much longer than she had planed. She might even have her wings cut off again before escaping. It took about two weeks in Felarya to grow wings back to normal, but since she was in a less magical place, there is still magic but not as much as Felarya, it will take about four weeks for her wings to reform!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...What... was that?\" Felix gasped as he tried to recover from such a weakened state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the magic channeling into your life force. Some beings aren't as luck to have magical wings,\" Fakira explained, \"Fairies' wings extract and store magic in the air. Grant it, we can only store a certain amount of magic at a time. Humans don't have wings and have to channel into their physical strength and life force. If you use too much magic, you could end up killing yourself. I should have realized healing my wings would be too much for you, human slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is... it so hard?\" Felix asked. He wanted to know how to figure out his limits and what kind of spells he could use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Growing living things out of thin air takes much magic power and that include growing a part of a living creature. You are creating a living material by doing so, something organic. Trying to grow my wings is the same thing, but it is even harder, because it is my source of magic,\" Fakira informed the human, \"Such a healing power is too complicated for you. But, there are other healing spells you could possibly do, such as healing cuts, bruises, and some sicknesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira sighed, \"It looks like healing my wings, if possible for you human, will take many weeks to accomplish maybe many months. We'll have to think of another way out of here. And don't think about shrinking, that is an even more complicated spell to master, and that will only work if you have Felaryan fairy blood in your veins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we going to do?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will have to start from scratch to teach you magic,\" Fakira informed him, \"I will have to start you with simple spells like levitation and simple healing spells. I will have to see if you have enough concentration to use magic without saying the words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can use spells without using the words?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can shrink you without saying anything, can't I?\" Fakira replied, \"The words are only for those who don't have the concentration to direct a spell in a certain direction. The saying of spells just makes sure the intended outcome occurs. Otherwise, something completely different could happen if one doesn't have the right concentration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we start now?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The healing spell has weakened you. You have to sleep and rest before your strength and life force replenishes,\" Fakira stated. There was an indifference in her voice that sounded like she didn't care whether Felix died or not. However, she didn't want him to die, because he was her way of escaping despite being a small snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will leave and you can teach me more in the afternoon,\" Felix replied. Felix handed her the three full canteens. Fakira set two empty ones near Felix and Felix took them and placed them on the cart to leave, but then he stopped and looked at the chains. \"Is there a way to break the chains?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a cutting spell,\" Fakira stated, \"It's one of the simple spells, but it takes more energy depending on what is cut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will I be able to cut the chains?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might take some time for you to train with that spell enough to be able to do that,\" Fakira answered, \"But the chains are rusty and the spell is easy to master. You might be able to break the chains in a matter of a week or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do it?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do certain spells with my wings gone,\" Fakira stated before looking away as if embarrassed by that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix didn't say anything more and pushed the cart to the door. The guard let him out and Felix pushed the cart back to the kitchen before heading to bed. </span></div></div>",

He sighed when he saw the guards near where he and Ted sleep were two loyalists who were extremely strict on enforcing Lord William's commands.  He recalled watching them stab another slaves tongue for whispering during this time.  Not wanting to risk either of them getting into trouble, Felix said nothing to his friend and laid down and slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Felix was awoken by a sharp kick from one of the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on slave.  You just got drafted for stable duty,\" the guard grumbled.  Felix shook his head and saw the sun wasn't even up yet.  But Felix knew going back to sleep would mean certain death, so with heavy eyes, he rose and went to the foul smelling stable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed as he and only a handful of others had to clean the large stables.  Breakfast and lunch came and went and Felix was denied both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now, weary from the hard work and no food, Felix walked to the kitchen to collect the food for the fairy.  The chef glared at him and his foul stench but said noting as he filled the canteens and collected the meat.  He pushed the cart out of the kitchen and down to the prison where another loyalist was guarding the door.  Felix walked past him and entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira had had a bad morning.  The men with whips came back and struck her, aiming mainly for her back where her wings were trying to regrow.  The pain was great from them hitting such sensitive areas and she knew it would be even longer to heal her wings now.  When she heard the door open, she glared and saw her human feeder.  Once the door was closed, she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stink,\" she said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to clean out the stables,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stables?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are a place humans keep animals we ride on since we can't fly,\" Felix replied.  Fakira nodded, recalling when she was captured Lord William's men were on strange animals.  She guessed it was for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you still stink,\" Fakira said as Felix handed her the food.  She heard a strange noice come from the slave's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.  I haven't eaten yet today.  They didn't give me a chance to eat,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also go the morning without food,\" Fakira replied coldly, but then saw how tired Felix was.  She knew from experience trying to do magic when one is tired could cause problems, especially when one is inexperienced.  Being hungry at the same time was just asking for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What should I do?  I could show him how to cook some meat so he can eat that.  Or I could show him the cutting spell regardless of his state,\"</i> Fakira thought.  She looked closely at the weary eyed slave  Compassion wasn't something she wanted to show him but she knew she'd need to if she wanted out of there.  In the end, she opted to . . .</span></div></div>",

She couldn't use any powerful magic, other than her shrinking powers, because he wings had been torn off. Even if she could use the cutting spell, it wasn't powerful enough to break the chains thanks to her wingless back. She needed the little snack and if that meant sharing her food with him at that moment, then so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's not a sign of compassion for the little prey,\"</i> Fakira told herself, <i>\"This action is only to save myself and escape faster. Without energy or concentration for his magic, he could end up killing himself. Then I wouldn't be able to escape. I'm not sharing my food because I want to and have feeling for the pathetic creature, it's so I can get out of this hellhole faster.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira sighed, \"You're too tired to do magic, human. You don't have the right energy at the moment and could kill yourself if we train hard enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't train too much now. It's still the afternoon and I still have more work to do,\" Felix informed the fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so, it still takes a lot of energy for those who aren't as experienced with magic,\" Fakira stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do we have to wait till the evening to...\" Felix began to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will still start this afternoon,\" Fakira interrupted, \"I can probably escape this place myself, given enough time, but I don't wish to wait that long. With you training magic, I can escape sooner and the sooner you start training the sooner we escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do we do if I'm too tired?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will have to share my food with you,\" Fakira sighed with slight disgust, \"But realize this, human. It is not because I want to or feel pity for you. It is because I wish to escape this place as soon as possible and if that means sharing my food with you this afternoon then I will have to. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Felix answered not wanting to anger the fairy any more than she was already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira placed the meat in the floor and then looked up at Felix. \"I thought of something. There is a way that both of us will have our fill,\" Fakira informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Felix questioned. He knew the fairy could eat the enter slice of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can shrink you and the us my saliva to keep you shrunken so that you can finish off a small piece that would seem big enough for a meal to you,\" Fakira explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix could tell that the fairy was about to shrink him right then and there, but Felix yelled, \"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? Don't you like my solution?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that, because it seems logical, but what about cooking the meat. Humans can't eat raw meat,\" Felix quickly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm...\" Fakira wondered out loud, \"Then I shall teach you how to control fire and you can cook the whole slab of meat. I haven't had cooked meat in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that be too difficult for me?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you use already existing fire,\" Fakira replied while looking at a lit torch, \"We shouldn't test how well you concentration is. yet. So, you will use the words for now. I will teach a spell that gives you the will to move fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like levitation?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely. Now, you must concentrate on your powers again, and force it to your hands again. Then aim your hands at the fire on the nearest torch and say Letavzoo Blazlium\" Fekira informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix did as the fairy told him and once more searched inside himself to bring the magic to his hands. He lifted his hands and aimed them at the nearest torch and he said, \"Letavzoo Blazium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt magic leave his hand but nothing seemed to happen. Felix was about to question why it wasn't working, but when he moved his hand, the fire rose off of the torch and was in the air. \"Now, move your hand and bring it to the meat to cook it,\" Fakira ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix moved his hands slowly, and the fire copied the movements till it was on the meat. Felix kept the meat on there until it was cooked enough. Felix lifted the fire off the meat and asked Fakira what he had to do. This was a spell that had no specific end and wouldn't stop unless Felix told it to stop. \"Let go of the magic and the flame will disappear,\" Fakira told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while to figure out how to do it at first, but Felix eventually let go, and the flame disappeared. Felix could smell the delicious cooked meat. It was better than anything he had ever gotten as a slave and his mouth watered for the aroma. Felix closed his eyes to smell the meat better and soon the smell became much stronger. When Felix opened his eyes, he was three inches tall and the large meat was right before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy grabbed him before he even got a chance to look up at her and she opened her hand so Felix was siting on her palm. Everything was going fast and the fairy wasn't doing it as slowly as she did when she tormented him the other two times. Instead, the fairy was more along the lines of, let's get this over and done with. As soon as Felix had time to look up at the face, his vision was blocked by a massive pink tongue that licked him and pushed him to the soft skin of the fairy's palm. The fairy licked him front and back till she thought it was enough and then lowered her hand to the floor. She slanted her hand so that he rolled off it onto the rocky ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell bad, but you still taste good, human. I want might to do this everyday,\" the fairy teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira pointed at the slab of meat and then moved the finger every so slightly. She had used her concentration to preform the cutting spell and a very small piece slid off. Felix grabbed it and it seemed as big as the slab of meat was when he was normal sized. Yet the piece he had was probably not as big as the fairy's pupil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat and regain your energy,\" Fakira ordered, \"Then I shall dry you off and well do a few spell before you have to leave.\"</span></div></div>",

Others are more noticeable.  I wonder how roasted human is?\" However, Fakira really did want to try roasted human. it was supposedly to fun to swallow humans whole and let them squirm in ones stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix noted what the fairy said, but he ignored it and just laid back against Fakira's lap.  The softness of her dress and skin beneath it were amazingly comfortable,  and, while it was only for a short few minutes, the rest was just what Felix needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was woken by some rubbing over him he quickly realized it was the fairy's cloth.  Soon she was done and placed him off her and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better human?\" Fakira asked.  Felix smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you,\" Felix said, \"That rest was really nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a bed,\" she growled.  Felix put his hands up defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean it like that.  I just meant being able to rest at all was nice,\" Felix said.  Fakira's glare didn't end but she didn't say any more as Felix shot upright.  He now looked down at Fakira, as she was still sitting on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.  Now the cutting spell.  Since you have rest and food, let's try without words,\" Fakira said, \"This requires one hand.  You move your whole hand for a large cut and a finger for one like a knife.\"  Her eyes looked at the chains.  \"It would be best to use your whole hand in this case.  When you focus the energy into your hand, think of the air as your knife and make it cut the metal as you move your hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded and grabbed part of the rusty chain.  He focused his magic into his right hand and moved his hand  He saw the metal break before him.  One side of the link had a clean, barely noticable cut in it.  He was about to cut the next link, when he paused..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?  Tired?  Why haven't you cut it yet?\" Fakira said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I cut it, it would be easy to see.  Meaning they might put better chains on you and make it harder to cut later.  Also, they might beat you even harder for trying to escape,\" Felix said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't plan on doing anything?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was thinking tonight we should plan a bit more on the escape, because just getting you out of the cell doesn't mean we're free,\" Felix said.  Fakira glared at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you expect me to deal with at least another day's torture?\" Fakira asked darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you rather suffer one more day or be recaptured and tortured for who knows how long?\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Fakira said, not looking at Felix now, \"Just make sure we escape in a few days or I will eat you.\"  Felix nodded and went to the door.  The guard let Felix out and Felix walked back to the kitchen.  The cook was gone and Felix picked up one of the scrap bones.  He put his hand to it and practiced his cutting magic.

He had heard the door close and the person who walked into the kitchen had seen the entire thing. He had seen Felix cut the bone with nothing but air. The man was a guard, but luckily, it was Randolph and not of the loyals. Randolph was standing in front of the shut door with has eyes wide and his mouth agape in pure shock and disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandolph had come in the kitchen because he just wanted some water from the well. Since Felix was at the other end of the room in view of the doorway, Randolph had seen Felix right away and he was going to say hello. However, he eyes witnessed Felix cutting a bone in half without any knives. Felix had nothing but air and he had to have used magic. Randolph stayed silent for the longest time while Felix stared back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter close to a minute past, Felix broke the silence by saying, \"Randolph... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Randolph began speaking at the same time and interrupted what Felix was about to say by saying, \"Felix... Y-you...\" However, Randolph was too shocked to be able to form his sentence properly. He had never seen magic, let alone a slave of Lord William do magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can use magic,\" Felix sighed. He knew it was best to not lie to Randolph now. Randolph had seen the whole thing and Felix couldn't pretend that Randolph had seen things. Besides, Randolph wasn't like most guards. Randolph was someone that looked out for Felix and Ted and Randolph was a kind person who hated Lord William and only followed his orders because he was lord at the moment. Felix felt he could trust Randolph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So, it's true. He can use magic ans I wasn't seeing things. But if he can use magic, doesn't that mean he could always use magic? I thought you had to be born with magic in your blood to be able to use it, but then again, I'm not an expert on the matter. Still, if that's true, Felix would have been able to use magic this whole time. Yet, he's still here and still a slave to Lord William. What's stopped him from escaping all this time?\"</i> Randolph wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Randolph thought to himself, Felix had become nervous about Randolph's intentions. Felix wanted to trust Randolph, but it was scaring Felix that Randolph was staying silent for so long. <i>\"Is he planning on turning me in?\"</i> Felix questioned, <i>\"No, he can't be. He's my friend. He's a good guard, but... what if it was all an act. What if it was a cover to try and get close to slaves and find ones trying to escape? I can't be turned in. Not when I'm so close to escaping.\"</i> Felix called upon his magic and brought it to his hands. He was ready, in case Randolph turned out to be an evil man in disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Randolph, don't rat me out,\" Felix pleaded so that he could get Randolph's answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to turn you in, Felix,\" Randolph finally stated. Felix was relieved to know that Randolph was still a good guy and Felix released the magic from his hands and let it go back inside him. \"Felix, how do you know how to preform magic?\" Randolph asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, I've had it my entire life,\" Felix answered, \"But I'm not sure how I gained magic in my blood. Ted has told me there are many ways to gain magic and one doesn't have to be born with magic to obtain it. I didn't even know I could use magic until I muttered of the fairy's curses and it worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you didn't know you could use magic until the fairy arrived. That would explain why you're still here and why you still haven't escaped,\" Randolph said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Randolph, can I trust you?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you're planning to escape soon,\" Randolph figured out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I trust you?\" Felix repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can trust me, Felix. You know how much I hate Lord William and distaste his slavery views,\" Randolph replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will tell you that Ted and I are planning to escape this place with the fairy but...\" Felix started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that monster!?\" Randolph exclaimed, \"Are you out of your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a deal with her. She's teaching me magic so that Ted and I can escape with her. I must truly be her only hope at escaping and she won't harm me if I help her. It will be alright,\" Felix told Randolph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you can trust that beast?\" Randolph questioned, \"It's a creature that enjoys eating humans. She'll probably grow herself back to her original height when she regrows her wings. Then you and Ted would be unable to stop her from eating you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be alright,\" Felix tried to assure Randolph, \"She's not a mindless monster. She has human intelligence and reasoning. If I help her, she will be grateful and she wouldn't hurt us. Besides, She's shrunk me three times and she didn't eat me either of those times. I think we can trust her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't think you should...\" Randolph started to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Felix soon interrupted, \"I promised her I'd help her escape and that's what I'm going to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but do you even know how you're going to escape?\" Randolph questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can use the cutting spell to free the fairy's chains, but beyond that, I have no plan,\" Felix admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you have no means of escaping the castle,\" Randolph said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, do you?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have a way out, but it's risky and I'd have to escape with you. If Lord William were to find out I helped you escape, he'd kill me,\" Randolph informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will escape with us, but how do we escape?\" Felix asked once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandolph looked at the well in the kitchen and began telling Felix a story, \"One day, Lord William punished a slave by using the well. He put the slave in the basket and kept dunking the slave. Eventually, the slave was caught by the current of the waters below and he was taken away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandolph stared at the well for a long time as if in a trance. Felix was about to tell Randolph to go on, but Randolph soon continued, \"Months later, one of Lord William's soldiers was sent to a village to collect taxes. In that village, he found the slave that had got carried by the current. The soldier brought the escaped slave back to the castle and the slave was forced to explain what had happened. Apparently, there is a maze of waterways beneath the castle and when he followed the current, he eventually came upon a river that surfaced to the land level. That is how we must escape, because it is still unknown to William where that river is and where it leads to. The only question now is when we should leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix answered...</span></div></div>",

I won't be expected to be guarding anything tonight so I can help you and Ted escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what is the plan?\" Felix questioned, \"Somehow, you're going to have to meet me and the fairy at the cell with Ted, but how will you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will just go to the slave quarters and tell one of the guards that Lord William needs a slave to do a night task,\" Randolph explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though it's your night off and you don't have a paper to prove Lord William wants it done?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure the guards will believe Lord William would make me do things on my night off. He is the kind of person that would do that,\" Randolph replied, \"Besides, a loyal guard only needs the word of Lord William to believe what is said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the guard that will be guarding the cell?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll figure something out. You just worry about freeing the fairy from the chains after you feed her and telling Ted about the plan if you can,\" Randolph replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight?\" Ted asked as Felix and Ted scrubbed the hallways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want to get out of this place or not?\" Felix whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, more than anything in the world,\" Ted replied, \"But isn't tonight too sudden. Do you even have a plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Randolph will help us by getting use to the well in the kitchen. But, Randolph will have to come with as well because if Lord William were to find out...\" Felix started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ted was quick and understood what Felix was going to say. \"He'd kill Randolph,\" Ted finished, \"I understand, but how will he get us there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Randolph will talk to the guards and tell them Lord William needs you to do some night chores. Then, you and Randolph will meet me at the fairy's cell and...\" Felix began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why at the cell?\" Ted questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're escaping with her,\" Felix told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?!\" Ted hissed, \"Felaryans are monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be alright. i think I can befriend her,\" Felix tried to assure Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Befriend a Felaryan predator? That will be the day,\" Ted commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I befriend her?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felaryan predators have different views than humans,\" Ted explained, \"Humans see anything and anyone that has the same intelligence as a person. That's why dragons, griffins, and other intelligent creatures have rights in other humans cities, because humans see them as people. However, Felaryans are different. They only view creatures of the same species and the same size as people. Felaryan fairies don't even view regular fairies as people. What makes you think she'll view you as a person? You're only a snack to her or at the very most a pet. She sees humans and other 'small' creatures the same way humans view mindless animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I think I can get her to see us as people,\" Felix argued, \"I've already made progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What progress could you have possibly made in three days?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When she shrunk me one time, I told her a little about my past. She felt sorry for me and in that brief moment, she actually stroked my back with her finger to try and comfort me. It will be four weeks till she can grow her wings and grow back to her normal size and I think we can get her to see us as people,\" Felix assured his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize she might have just seen you as a pet, right?\" Ted pointed out, \"or she was just pretending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was no lies in her eyes,\" Felix informed Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix did their tasks as usual and ate dinner without any complaints. It may not have looked like it, but they were excited and joyous to know their freedom would soon come. Felix couldn't stop thinking about what the outside would look like. Ted had told Felix about the outside world, but it was too hard of Felix to understand and grasp the beauty of the outside world and freedom. Felix truly had to fight himself to hold all the excitement in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix pushed the cart past a loyal guard and into the fairy's cell. When he was in the cell, he could hold his joy no longer and gave a big smile. The first smile that had ever come across his face ever since he was a slave. \"Why so happy, human?\" Fakira questioned in slight jealousy. <i>\"How dare he be happy when my life is miserable.\"</i> Fakira thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix handed the fairy the meat and canteens and she set the meat on her lap. \"We're going to escape tonight,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira's heart was overwhelmed with joy when she heard the human's words. She asked in disbelief, \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's all planed out,\" Felix told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira's overwhelmed joy suddenly overcome Fakira's actions and thoughts. For another brief moment, she forgot that Felix was prey and she stood up, letting the meat slide down her lap. Fakira suddenly embraced Felix. Felix was shocked by the tight embrace of joy, and didn't return the hug, because he didn't want to harm her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug lasted for five seconds, but it proved to Felix that she was starting to either forget the Felaryan definition of a person, or she was just simply seeing Felix as a person or pet because he's different from the other humans she's met. Either way, Felix felt it was good for him, because there was a bigger chance that she wouldn't eat him when she grew her wings back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira snapped out of her enchantment and she pushed out of her hug. Fakira backed up and sat on her knees again and looked up at the human in confusion. <i>\"Did I... did I just... hug this human?\"</i> Fakira questioned herself, <i>\"But how? He's prey. Why did I do that? How can this be happening? I'm supposed to eat humans, not hug them. This is wrong.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knelt down in front of the fairy and asked, \"Is something wrong? You look as though you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing... Nothing's wrong,\" Fakira quickly interrupted, \"It's just that you've proved you can take orders well and it's quite possible that I can make you my pet. I can be very kind to my pets as long as they stay loyal to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix sighed, \"Well, I guess being a pet isn't as bad as being swallowed whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you'll only be my pet if I decide it to be so. I haven't decided just yet,\" Fakira informed him, \"So, when are we leaving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the others come to get us,\" Felix answered, \"But they're not coming till most of the castle is asleep and I'll stay with you till they arrive. You have time to eat your meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira soon remembered about the meat and picked it up once more to rip into it. \"This had better be my last meal in this dreadful place, or you can kiss being my pet goodbye,\" Fakira growled upon taking a bite out of the meat, \"Now, who are these others you speak of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There will be two others. Another slave named Ted who is my friend and a guard named Randolph who wishes to help us escape,\" Felix informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you trust this guard?\" Fakira questioned. She had never had any good experiences with the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my life,\" Felix replied, \"Is it alright they come along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, maybe they can prove to be loyal pets too,\" Fakira replied. However, Fakira was thinking something else in her mind, <i>\"The more humans, the bigger the meal is once my wings grow back.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed walked into the slave quarters when he was done with all his chores and he laid down on his \"bed\". As he pretended to fall asleep, Ted thought, <i>\"This is the last day I'll have to suffer this horrible place. Soon, I will be free again.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn about an hour when most slaves were asleep, Randolph entered the slave quarters and walked up to one of the guards. \"Randolph, I thought you had the night off tonight?\" the guard questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet, Lord William still puts me on duty,\" Randolph replied acting angry and annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your business here?\" the guard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm to bring a slave to do night duty. Lord William needs one of slave for night chores,\" Randolph lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wasn't I informed?\" the guard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Lord William just decided to use another slave,\" Randolph explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To you have papers of proof of this?\" the guard continued to interrogate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord William is very tired at the moment,\" Randolph told the guard, \"But if you want me to go back up there and tell him you need proof...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just take a slave,\" the guard quickly interrupted, not wanting to anger Lord William. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandolph looked around the room as if trying to decide which slave he would choose. Eventually, he walked up to Ted who was still pretending to be asleep. \"Wake up, slave!\" Randolph growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed opened his eyes and acted like he was tired and groggy. Randolph also kicked Ted to make it believable and forced Ted on his feet and nearly dragged him out of the room and to the dungeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ted and Randolph entered the dungeon hall where the fairy's cell was, the guard noticed them right away and growled, \"State your business here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm been ordered by Lord William to bring this slave to the cell,\" Randolph informed the guard, \"He is supposed to help the other slave with whatever he needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't informed about this. Do you have any proof?\" the guard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here,\" Randolph said as he reached the back of his belt and wrapped his fingers around the hilt of a knife. Randolph pulled the knife out swiftly and sliced the guards neck. The guard coked up blood and fell to the ground. Randolph soon knelt down and continued to stab the guard until he moved no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ted and Randolph entered the cell, the fairy had finished her food and Felix had cut the rusted chains. Felix had started cutting when he heard the commotion outside the cell and he had to chop with his hand like a sword so that the blows of the spell were more powerful. When the two entered, Felix told the fairy who was who, but Fakira stated, \"There's no need and no time for introductions. Let's just get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandolph led the way to the kitchen and helped the group avoid the guards since Randolph knew the rounds the guards made. The came to the kitchen and shut the door behind them. \"Where is the way out?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down the well,\" Felix informed her as they all walked to the well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The well?\" Fakira questioned with obvious fear in her voice as she looked down at the water. Fakira forced herself to look away from the well and yelled at Felix, \"I thought you were going to get me out of here. This isn't a way out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a way out,\" Felix argued, \"All we have to do is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't swim,\" Fakira replied, \"I... This isn't a way out for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be alright,\" Felix tried to assure her while placing a hand on her shoulder, \"Ted and I will help you swim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better start climbing down,\" Randolph suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed was the first to start climbing down the rope followed by Fakira and then Felix. Before Felix could get his head below the well, the door slammed open and a shadow like ball, darker than the blackness around them, shot out and hit Randolph in the chest. Randolph twirled to the well and caught himself so that he was leaning on the edge. Felix saw that it was Lord William at the doorway who had preformed dark magic and was no aiming at Felix. Randolph still had a few seconds of life and with those seconds, Randolph cut the rope of the well which caused Ted, Fakira, and Felix down into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I couldn't think of choices.

First to surface was Ted, followed by Fakira , who was partially wrapped up in the rope, flailing for her life.  Felix came up afterwords as the three were swept down the rushing waters.  They were lucky to be holding the rope as it made sure they would come out at the same place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira suddenly stopped flailing, Felix and Ted noticed.  Then there was a sudden pull downward from something between them.  Realizing it was Fakira sinking, Ted, reluctantly, and Felix, passionately, pulled the rope, bringing Fakira up and them closer to her.  As they grew closer, the fairy reached out and grabbed the two humans, keeping them under her arms so she stayed afloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, the darkness vanished and the three were in the middle of a huge forest, though not as huge as Fakira's home.  They were still on the same plane Lord William was on.  With Fakira still flailing slightly, the two humans pushed to shore and  when her feet could touch earth, Fakira bolted from the river, shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer speed would had been greater had she not been slowed by Ted and Felix, still tangled in the rope with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three were breathing heavily from their escape.  Finally, Ted looked at Felix and saw Randolph was not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?  Why did we drop?  Where's Randolph?\" Ted asked.  Ted watched as sadness formed in Felix's eyes.  He had seen it once before, when another one of their friends who was a slave was murdered by Lord William for accidentally breaking a vase.  All slaves watched it as a warning of what came from stupid mistakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, why did we suddenly drop?\" Fakira asked acidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord William . . . he broke the kitchen door and attacked Randolph, then aimed to kill me.  Randolph . . . he cut the rope with the last of his strength, saving us from capture,\" Felix said as he began to cry for his friend.  Ted bowed his head in sorrow, while Fakira was mostly indifferent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So one less snack,\"</i> she thought.  Ted saw her indifference and glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could at least pretend to be sorry,\" Ted growled at Fakira.  Fakira glared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  I didn't know him.  So he died.  I don't care,\" Fakira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He died giving us a chance to let you go, you stupid monster!\" Ted yelled, \"If it wasn't for you, he might be alive right now and we'd be free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it wasn't for me teaching this one magic, you wouldn't have had the courage to escape,\" Fakira replied, \"Otherwise you would have attempted to before this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, calm down you two,\" Felix said, moving between them, \"We can't fight right now.\"  Ted looked from Felix to Fakirra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix is right,\" Ted said, \"Lord William will probably send men in the river after us.  We need to get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully this forest will connect to my home so I can get healed quickly,\" Fakira mumbled as she used the weak cutting spell to cut the rope binding her to the others.  Felix and Ted simply pulled the rope off.  After a few seconds of silence, Ted smiled, looking at Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  You want to go home right now?\" Ted sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Fakira asked, \"Of course I want to go home.\"  Ted laughed darkly at her desire.  \"What are you laughing at human?\"</span></div></div>",

However, the fairy still didn't see what Ted saw and she kept demanding an explanation, which only caused Ted to laugh more. \"Tell me what is so funny, human, or I'll shrink you and eat you now!\" Fakira warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you two stop it! We have to get as far away as possible, now!\" Felix interrupted, \"Ted, do you know what forest we are in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father made a map of many lands and I memorized them all,\" Ted informed Felix, \"I know what forest we are in, what kind of creatures live in the forest, and the nearest villages, towns, and cities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we need to go then?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get of of the country and out of Lord William's reach and rule before we can do anything else,\" Ted answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long would that take?\" Fakira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least two weeks depending one which way we go and which country we go to,\" Ted answered, \"The closest country is the realm of the elves. They are kind to humans, especially if we're run away slaves. They can't stand slavery and see it as a terrible evil. That's at least two weeks walk. There will be many dangers on the way though and we won't be able to use the roads too often and we'd only be able to visit villages that are absolutely safe and big cities where it would be hard to find us. Once we're somewhere where Lord William can't get us, we can do whatever we think is best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elves? Help humans?\" Fakira smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their not giants like Felaryan Elves,\" Ted explained, \"And even if they were, they wouldn't be as cruel as you Felaryans. They'd realize humans are people and wouldn't devour us senselessly like you monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not monsters?\" Fakira hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Felaryans are...\" Ted started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" Felix yelled, \"This is not the time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't take me to the elves. You will take me to Felarya,\" Fakira told them, \"Where is Felarya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is in another dimension. You have to go through a dimensional portal to get there,\" Ted explained, \"And you'd have to have someone who knows how to use dimensional magic like a wizard or a Silver Dragon to work it. However, there are few wizards that know how to use that magic and there is only one Silver Dragon per dimension. There hasn't been a Silver dragon on Earth for the past few hundred years and when they arrive, they'd be a new born and bond with the first creature that sees them hatch. You'll have better luck with a wizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the nearest dimensional gate?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the way, but it's still in Lord William's realm about a week and a half away, near the fairy forest,\" Ted informed her, \"But you're not going to want to go there and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to take me to the nearest gate and find me a way home!\" Fakira demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix could see Ted was about to argue, but then he thought better and just muttered, \"Fine, have it your way, but you'll regret it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira didn't hear the last part and Ted led the way in the right direction. They group trudged through the forest for a a few hours. Ted felt that Lord William wouldn't send people out till morning and might not send them through the well. They might try to search every river, stream, and lake around the castle and might not even find the right river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was about to stop when they came across small cabin in the woods. \"You two stay here,\" Ted ordered, \"I'm going to take a look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed bent low and approached the cabin. Ted looked through the window and then after a long moment, motioned for Felix and the fairy to come over. Fakira and Felix approached as Ted opened the door. They all walked in and found the place abandoned. Well, not quite, because there was a dead body and the place was a mess. \"Bandits raided this place,\" Ted explained, \"But, it looks like it was months ago. There could still be clothes here. Bandits usually go for riches and not clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would clothes matter?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we continue to wear our rags, people will notice easily. You have to change to, fairy.\" Ted explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to where human clothing!\" Fakira hissed, \"It's degrading to wear the clothes of prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dress you're wearing is very different from human clothes and it will be spotted easily,\" Ted informed her, \"Besides it shows your wounds and wings when they start growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my wings?\" Fakira questioned, \"Human clothes don't have a place for wings to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can cut slits,\" Ted explained, \"And you can where a jacket if we go into a village or city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, my mother made me this dress,\" Fakira replied, \"I'm not taking it off to wear human clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can shrink your dress,\" Felix suggested, \"Can't you shrink non living things with an unlimited time? Just shrink it and keep it in the human pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira was reluctant, but she sighed and nodded her head. \"Fine, but only till we get to the gate,\" Fakira told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed and Felix dressed in a different room from Fakira, but they all met each other in the same room when they were done and they set up beds to sleep on for the night. Ted looked at Fakira who would look human if it weren't for her slightly pointed ears and sharp teeth. \"I hope there's a wizard there at the gate so we can send you home as soon as we get there,\" Ted stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you are starting to see things my way, human. Maybe you can prove to be a loyal pet, like the other human is becoming,\" Fakira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that. It's because it will be a sure death for you if you go there when we get to the gate,\" Ted stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explan yourself, human,\" Fakira ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, it's Ted. Our names are Felix and Ted, not human. The only reason we're calling you fairy is because we don't know your name. Why don't you tell me your name and you can start calling us by ours,\" Ted suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not worthy to know my name,\" Fakira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, I'm going to tell you the reason anyway. You're going to die, because you look like a human. Without your wings, you'll be stuck human sized and Felaryans will eat you. Even ones of your own clan might eat you,\" Ted explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wouldn't,\" Fakira argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is a person, too you?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Creatures of the same size and species,\" Fakira answered, \"Humans aren't people. They're too little to be much of anything other than a pet or food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be the same size when you arrive home without wings,\" Ted stated, \"You won't be a person in people's eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true. I can explain me situation, and...\" Fakira started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed interrupted, \"Even if you do get the chance to explain, would they believe you? You don't think anything human sized is a person. If someone my sized told you they were a fairy, would you believe them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira didn't answer. She wouldn't have even given them a chance to speak unless she was in the mood for teasing and playing with her victim. \"You own mother might even eat you,\" Ted added, \"Do you still believe you're not a monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira turned away and didn't reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People are creatures that have intelligence and emotions. Humans, fairies, elves, dragons, and nagas are all people! It doesn't matter what size or species a person is, just as long as they have the same intelligence. You don't see humans eating regular fairies just because they're small. I hope you go home as your human size, just so that you can truly know what its like being a human in your world,\" Ted stated before turning away from Fakira and falling asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night...</span></div></div>",

Though she was prey size, she wore her green dress, calling for her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother!  I'm back mother!\" Fakira called as she walked into the Fairy domain.  Her eyes darted around, searching for any movement.  A soft laugh came to her ears as something grabbed her from behind.  Darkness enveloped her as she rose into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh no, what grabbed me?  Is it my mother?\"</i> Fakira wondered in worry as the huge hand opened.  Before Fakira was one of the most beautiful females she had ever known, her mother.  A smile came upon Fakira's face when she saw her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, yes prey, I am beautiful,\" the giantess fairy said, smiling.  A look of horror came to Fakira's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mother, I'm not prey!\"  Fakira shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're smaller than me, so you are prey,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's me!  Fakira!\" Fakira shouted.  Her mother shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you do look like you have some fairy in you prey.  Your ears and teeth, yes.  But you can't be my daughter.  You're not a person,\" her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mother this dress!  You made it for me for my last birthday!\" Fakira shouted.  The giant Fairy looked close at the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my daughter,\" Fakira's mother realized, pulling her hand away from her face, smiling.  \"It's good to see you one last time.\"  A joyous smile that was on Fakira's face turned to fear and panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'one last time'?\" Fakira yelled, scared she knew what was meant by those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daughter or not, if you can't become my size, you are prey,\" her mother said, \"And prey is meant to be eaten.  Not loved.  Didn't I teach you anything you silly girl?\"  A soft chuckle came from her mother's lips as Fakira was raised to meet them.  Fakira was too scared, too shocked, too destroyed to even scream as the darkness of the huge mouth came closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix woke to a noise besides him.  He looked to see Fakira rolling on her side in obvious distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She looks like she did right before the first time she shrunk me,\"</i> Felix thought, his gaze turned to Ted, who was sound asleep.  <i>\"I wonder if Ted's words are causing her nightmares?\"</i>  Unable to stand there and do nothing, Felix moved closer to Fakira and put his hand on her arm gently.  In Fakira's dream<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira's eyes were set on the dark abyss that was getting closer.  Her mother was focused on enjoying this prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always wondered what Felaryan fairies tasted like,\" her mother said, before screaming in pain.  This scream caused Fakira to wake from her stupor and joined her mother in looking for the cause.  A deep gash was on the side of her arm.  Her mother looked to see a small human glaring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let Fakira go,\" Felix yelled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Fakira's mother said.  Felix  sighed and held his arm curved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll make you,\" Felix said before chopping his arm, creating a powerful blade.  Fakira's mother was unfazed, knowing she could live if it hit her, but then she saw the magic curve and aim for her back . . her wings!  She pushed  forward to try and dodge but to no avail.  The magic cut much of her wings, making the 100 foot tall fairy shrink to a ten foot one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shock of it, Fakira was dropped and Felix, using other magic, caught her in midair and ran out with her as she held him close, crying at what might have been.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fakira woke up from her dream. She shot upwards into a sitting position and looked around frantically as if another Felaryan top predator was going to reach in the room, grab her, and swallow her whole. It was a terrible feeling that she had never experienced before and she didn't like it. She didn't like feeling that she was prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dream really depressed her as she realized it was her mother who was about to eat her. Her own mother didn't even see her as a person even when she realized it was Fakira in her hand. Her mother was willing to eat her own flesh and blood. Fakira began to cry uncontrollably. She calmed down slightly when she felt a hand stroking her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira turned her head to see it was human one, the one that had feed her while she was in that horrid cell. Normally, Fakira would have suddenly sucked up her fear and tears and then push the human away and tell the prey nothing was wrong. However, Fakira was overwhelmed with a different feeling, a feeling of depression, vulnerability, and thinking herself as a prey. Fakira didn't know how she should act and instead of what she would normally do, Fakira hugged the human again and cried on his shoulder as they where kneeling beside her makeshift bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix embraced her back and tried to calm her down while rubbing her back, careful not to touch the wounds. he noticed that the fairy is in much worse of a condition she was when she was in the cell and being tortured by Lord William. \"What's wrong? What happened?\" Felix questioned. Felix didn't expect the fairy to answer him. She never seemed to tell him her feelings because he was \"prey\". However, he knew that it was better to tell at least someone about what's wrong. In one told people of their feelings, it normally made that person feel better about him/herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Felix's surprise, the fairy actually answered him, because she was still being controlled by the strange new feelings inside of her. \"It was my mother,\" the fairy cried, \"She... she tried to eat me.\" Fakira cried harder once she said this and she had to talk between her sobs. \"I... I told her.... that I was.... her daughter... but... she didn't... listen,\" Fakira sobbed in Felix's arms, \"She... recognized... me, but... she still saw me.... as a prey! She was... going to eat... her own... daughter. She was going... to eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. I won't let that happen,\" Felix whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Fakira said, calming down, \"You're the one that saved me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix still didn't know how to reply and she just continued to do what he was doing. Soon, the fairy fell asleep again and Felix lowered her to her bed. Felix looked over to his bed and noticed Ted was awake in his bed. When Ted saw Felix notice him, he turned around to not face him and pretended to fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felix fell asleep, many things began to run through Ted head. <i>\"Why is Felix willingly comforting that wicked fairy?\"</i> was the first question that came to Ted's mind, <i>\"She's been treating us like insignificant creatures the entire time and... Maybe, Felix misses being a slave. He's gotten used to slavery and he did tell me once that he felt it was better living as a slave then die trying to be free. What if he wants to be the fairies slave, no, her pet? He's loyal to her and becoming her goddamn pet. He might not realize it, but those are probably one of the reasons, deep inside himself, he's sucking up to the fairy.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The other reason that he knows about is that he wants to make her see people as a human. If he doesn't accomplish this, being her pet would be the next best thing for Felix. However, it might be possible that he can get her to see humans as people,\"</i> Ted continued, <i>\"I thought it was impossible to change the mind of a Felaryan top predator, but I have heard rumors that it has been done before, especially when some people found and infant one and raised it as a human child. Now, it seems possible because she's realizing that she'll be prey if she enters her world. She is beginning to realized what it's like being a human in her world and how awful her and her clan's way of thinking is. Plus, she is subconsciously thinking Felix as a person, a savior, in her dreams. Maybe, we can change her mind by the time she grows her wings back.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that last hopeful thought, Ted fell asleep like everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came and everyone woke up. Fakira was very silent that morning after she realized everything that had happened last night. Eventually she sighed and said, \"We shall still head for the dimensional gate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? I though you would realize it's useless after you had your dream,\" Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was only a nightmare,\" Fakira explained, \"it wouldn't really happen like that. My mother wouldn't truly try to eat me, even if I'm human sized. It couldn't possibly happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if it does?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk about my mother, human!\" Fakira growled, \"You don't know her. Besides, my wings will heal by the time we get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you figure that?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a week and a half to make it to the gate and it will take about four weeks to heal my wings. However, you said there was a fairy forest near the gate,\" Fakira started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct, but what...\" Ted stopped himself, because he realized what she was planing, \"Fairy wings heal better when they're surrounded by magic. You plan on staying at the fairy forest till they're healed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Presisely,\" Fakira replied, \"How long does it take to walk to the forest?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A week to get to that forest,\" Ted informed her, \"And then four days to get out of the forest and to the dimensional gate. Four days if the fairy's help us escape the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, in that week of travel to the forest, my wings will heal as much is it takes three and a half days time in Felarya,\" Fakira figured out. If the fairy forest is as full of magic as my world, I'd have to stay in the forest a week and a half before leaving the forest to the gate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Ted agreed. He began to worry now they had less time to get the fairy to see them as human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's a plan,\" Felix stated, \"Shall head out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Felix, Ted, and Fakira have a normal travel through the first woods. They don't run into any danger and it takes two days to get out of the woods. They don't have troubles hunting food either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: A problem occurs. On the second day in the forest, they run into bandits!</span></div></div>",

Ted led the group and Fakira walked a little ways behind him, looking at the trees of the world.  Felix was near her, wanting to ask to learn some more magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are poor trees,\" Fakira finally said.  Felix looked at her with a confused expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't very large or strong compared to home's trees.  They also don't have many branches to lay on and relax,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well these trees are cleared out so we have paths through the woods,\" Ted called back, \"There are probably others who are stronger in the woods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know a lot of this world, how so human?\" Fakira asked, looking at Ted.  Ted stopped and looked back at Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ted.  His name is Felix.  It'd be nice for you to at least call us by our names,\" Ted replied with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Fakira replied, \"You're prey.\"  Ted gritted his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so are you, that's what your mother would think anyway,\" Ted replied coldly.  Fakira growled, showing her teeth off to Ted.  Thankfully for both, Felix spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why don't we stop for some food?\" Felix asked.  Both looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have any,\" Ted noted, making Fakira the one to laugh at him this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in the woods.  There's plenty of food if you can hunt,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and how do you expect to hunt without weapons?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic,\" Fakira said.  She looked at Felix.  \"You, follow me,\" she ordered.  Felix glanced at Ted before he followed Fakira and Ted followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly they came on an open field where a large buck stood tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be a good meal,\" Fakira said, her mouth watering, \"Though not as good as humans.\"  She looked at Felix.  \"When I shrink it, you stop it by levitating it.  Remember what it felt like when you levitated the fire.  It's like that,\" she said before looking at the buck.  She focused her magic and Ted watched the large buck shrink down to the ground.  Felix pointed his hand at where the buck was and focused his thoughts, willing his magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe proud buck was watching for any hunters when it started to shrink.  Fear overcame it and it tried to run but then it started flying into the air and towards some bushes.  The buck found itself in Felix's hand when something reached down and broke its neck.  Felix watched the buck dye in his hands and bowed his head. Fakira said something but he didn't hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it down now,\" she said once more.  Felix gently put the buck down and watched it grow large once more.  Fakira took a leg and bit into the raw meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is there a way Felix could conjure fire so we can cook some?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and I could shrink you so there's more to eat,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the spell would be fine.  If you shrink me, I'll start heading in the wrong direction,\" Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me,\"  Ted replied, \"Besides, with injured wings, you can only shrink living creatures once every few hours.\" Fakira growled, and showed her bloody teeth.  She eventually looked at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she said, \"Knock it out.  You get to learn more magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Felix asked, looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will teach you some magic to make fire,\" Fakira replied, before explaining this would be calling on the heat inside him to make an external flame.  It took some tries for Felix to get this mid level magic, but eventually he and Ted had a cooking fire and ate some of the buck as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira shrunk the buck's carcass once they were done and finished it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could have been dinner later,\" Ted said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't have lasted long enough,\" Fakira said, \"Besides, the more I eat the faster I heal.\"  She had a smug look on her face as she walked back to the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed slowly as they walked deeper into the woods.  Dinner passed in a similar fashion for them and sleep came easily from a long day of walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no dreams or nightmares for Fakira, which she was happy about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so as the morning sun rose on their small campsite, the three departed down the road once more until a large net fell on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?!\" Fakira yelled, being pushed to the ground by a net that could capture a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bandits,\" Ted realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, cut the rope,\" Fakira said, looking at Felix. He nodded and raised a hand when Ted grabbed his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, let's see if we can get out of this without magic.  If they know you can do magic, they may not let us go,\" Ted said.  Felix looked between Ted and Fakira, deciding to follow</span></div></div>",

His robe was now gone and he was wearing The man was holding a type of blue stone in his hand and was smiling at Fakira, while at the same time casting questioning glances at Felix. After a few short moments the man said, \u201cNow allow me to introduce my self, I am the great sage of the Wingly race, Lloyd Springfield.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed stared in shock of what he had just heard, \u201cWi\u2026Wingly!\u201d \u2018No way!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked at his friend and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s a Wingly?\u201d Fakira just looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, Lloyd, answered, \u201cWe are a type of fairy, we just happen to be human sized.\u201d Lloyd\u2019s attention now fully placed on Felix, \u201cNow young sir if I may ask, what type of creature are you?

Lloyd\u2019s blue eyes looked at Ted for a moment before turning back to Felix and his eyes began to glow as he replied, \u201cWith the amount of magic I see in him, he is either from a very powerful monster race, such as a Winglies or High elves\u2026\u201d Lloyd\u2019s head turned towards, Fakira, \u201cOr some Top-level creature of Felarya.\u201d Lloyd turns his head back to Ted, \u201cFor all I know he could even be a cross-breed of many different types of creatures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was looking down at the ground, his mind was going a 100 miles a second, \u2018I\u2019m not human\u2026but there was never anything special about me.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed was about to say something but Lloyd began to continue, \u201cMore over you seem to be under many different spells, I can see that one is a glamour, or a disguise spell if you will, that is tapping into your magic, which could explain why it lasted so long, and why you have so much magic power\u2026and why it was never discovered, by that damnable Lord William.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three jumped up in shock at the Lord\u2019s name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT!?\u201d Ted screamed, getting ready to either fight or run\u2026and considering that this Lloyd could kill them all in seconds running sounded like a better plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd just smiled and replied, \u201cI\u2019ve seen the wanted posters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them, \u201c\u2026Ooo\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a wanted poster?\u201d Fakira asked with a child like cuteness. Fakira understood that this man was powerful, and a type of fairy, so he should be able to help her out with her wings. She was about to ask, when Felix began to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould\u2026Would you be able to tell me what I am?\u201d Felix asked, his body shaking at the news of this revelation. Looking at Lloyd with both worry and hope in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd raised his right hand and snapped his fingers; the three once again found themselves falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time they found themselves in front of a great machine. The machine was easily three meters tall and made out of a greenish metal. The machine had three \u201chorns\u201d on the top in a triangle pattern, and had a large flouting, gold ring slowly spinning around the horns. On the ground level there seemed to be a large screen of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Felix, Lloyd says, \u201cCome boy.\u201d And begins to walk up a set of hidden steps on the right of the machine. Just then Lloyd stops and says, \u201cO\u2026and only the boy.\u201d With that he continued his climb. As he walked Lloyd began to think, \u2018Who is that boy, he seems familiar\u2026his aura is like that woman\u2019s\u2019 At that Lloyd\u2019s eyes go wide, \u2018Can it be\u2026no the child was kidnapped over six years ago, and he looks nothing like her or myself\u2026then again there is a glamour spell on him\u2026high level too, it\u2019s locking away nearly everything from his race as a creature, the amount of magic he can use and even\u2026\u2019 Lloyd gained a smile as he thought, \u2018His very gender\u2026The kid better pray that he really is a guy or I have a feeling he will be locking him/herself in a room for many, many months\u2026I wonder what she would think?\u2019 With his last thought, Lloyd began thinking of the fairy he had a one-night stand with when he was visiting Felarya. \u2018Nemyra\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Nemyra= the queen of all Felaryan fairies, the only fairy that could become 1000 feet tall. She is considered one of the strongest beings in Felarya, and is one of the guardians)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Felix and Ted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix and Ted were looking at it each other, while Fakira just continued to stare in shock of the Wingly, \u2018So fast!\u2019. She had heard of them from her mom, after all there weren\u2019t many human sized creatures that could be considered a Top-Level threat in Felarya, but still\u2026 she met a Wingly! Her friends were going to be jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWish me luck guys.\u201d Felix said suddenly, as he began to follow the wingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOUR GOING!?\u201d Ted asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTed, you can remember your parents, even if you dislike your mother you still have memories of her\u2026I\u2026I don\u2019t even know if I am human\u2026I\u2026I can\u2019t let this chance just slip bye.\u201d With that Felix starts to run after the man named Lloyd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho do you wish to stay with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd and Felix<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira and Ted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Picture of Lloyd + a Wiki\u2014Hope it works\u2026Lloyd is from the \u201cLegend Of Dragoon\u201d game)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://legendofdragoon.wikia.com/wiki/Lloyd\" target=\"_blank\">http://legendofdragoon.wikia.com/wiki/Ll...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.quizilla.com/user_images/1033649083_turesLloyd.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.quizilla.com/user_images/1033...</a>    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nList of Wingly Magic, (Comes from Negima) can make up others if you wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://negima.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Spells#Beginner.27s_Incantation\" target=\"_blank\">http://negima.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Spe...</a><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix didn't know what to do. He wanted to stay on Fakira's good side, because of two major reasons. One was that if he stayed on her good side, he realized she might start seeing him as a friend. If not, at least she will she him as an obedient pet, and to Felix, being a pet was better than being swallowed whole after being subjected to a long and tormenting mouth play and then slowly digesting in a fairy's stomach. Yeah, being a pet is a much better option. Besides, even if being a fairy's would be degrading, nothing could compare to being Lord William's slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second reason that he didn't entirely realize was that he subconsciously missed slave. He had been a slave as far back as he could remember. Slavery was normal for him. He was used to having a master to order him around. That's why being a possible pet to a fairy did seem degrading to him. He was starting to see the fairy as his new master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those two reasons in mind, Felix was having troubles resisting Fakira's order. <i>\"But what if Ted is right?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"He knows this place better than Fakira. Plus, she's not used to being human sized and she might be listening to her instincts as if she is still a giant fairy and that the bandits have no threat to us, when in fact they pose more threat than she thinks. What should I do?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was taking too long to decide and Fakira believed the human had taken the other human's side. <i>\"That terrible and miserable human,\"</i> Fakira thought to herself, <i>\"If I didn't need the two of them, I'd eat them now for disobeying my orders. How dare those ungrateful little pets.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed took the moments of silence to look around. The bandits were starting to surround the net, but there weren't as many bandits as he originally thought. He only saw about six men. He noticed they didn't have the best of gear and the way most of them were yelling and \"dancing\" around the net either meant they were extremely crazy or they weren't the brightest bandits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Felarya isn't common knowledge,\"</i> Ted realized, <i>\"They've never seen a Felaryan fairy and wouldn't know what it could do. What if the fairy shrinks the leader? They might not know that she can't do it again for another few hours. They might think she'd do it to all of them and they might run away. Magic might be a way out of this, and it will keep the fairy from shrinking us for a while.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea,\" Ted whispered, \"But it involves shrinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said we should try without magic,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe we shouldn't use too much magic, but one spell might be good enough,\" Ted replied, \"These guys probably never heard of Felarya and shrinking spells can only be used by creatures from that place. They won't understand the rules of shrinking magic when it comes to an injured fairy. If we can shrink the leader, the other's might run away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's one problem,\" Fakira whispered with a hiss, \"He'll only stay shrunk for two minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you coat him with saliva, right?\" Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the others?\" Fakira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll shrink the leader, but not his equipment. Felix and I can take whatever weapons he has than try to defend you if they attack. Meanwhile do what it is you do with shrunken people. The others should be frightened and run. These don't look like the type of people that will sacrifice themselves for their leader,\" Ted explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is it that Felaryans do to shrunken people?\" Fakira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torture them, play with them in their mouth, and savior the taste before they swallow them whole and let them squirm around in their stomach while their victim slowly digests and...\" Ted started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you're information, we don't do that to people, only prey,\" Fakira growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if you were to shrink someone who was a person to you? What that automatically make them prey to you even if that person used to be you're friend and...\" Ted started up once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you, stop!\" Felix interrupted trying to keep the group together, \"There's no time for this! I'll be ready to cut the nets. Just shrink the leader once Ted gives you the signal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what will be the signal?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tap your lap. No one will be able to see me to it,\" Ted informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Fakira could say that she didn't want his hands on her, a large and buff man walked to the net and looked down at the three captured humans, or so he thought, who we forced to their hands and knees because of the nets. \"So what do we have here? A little too young to be wanders, are yah?\" the leader questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We mean you no trouble. We don't have anything to give you, honest?\" Ted pleaded. He still wanted to try and get out of the situation without using magic, but he knew Fakira would have to use her magic if all else failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg to differ,\" the leader replied, \"You're all strapping young lads that can still work hard. We can sell you has slaves. You mustn't have family ties if you're all alone out here in the woods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed realized these were bandits that would risk everything. <i>\"Let see what happens when they meet a Felaryan monster,\"</i> Ted thought as he tapped the fairy's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira shrunk the leader without a moments notice and Felix quickly cut the net. With fast reflexes, Ted picked up the bandit's bow and arrows and Felix took the sword. The remaining five were confused when they saw their leader disappear and the children take the weapons. \"What sort of tricky is this?\" \"He's gone!\" the bandits exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader couldn't believe it. One moment he was standing above three children, and the next moment, he was three inches tall and the ten year old girl bent down and picked him up by the back of his shirt. The man became dizzy and the suddenly attitude change forced him to shut his eyes. When he opened them once more, all he could see was a massive wet tongue cover his entire front. <i>\"Are these cannibals?\"</i> the man wondered worriedly. He wanted to curl up right then and there, but he was dangling from the girl's two fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so big and tough now, are you human?\" Fakira laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She shrunk our captain!\" a bandit cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do any of you want to join him?\" Fakira asked the bandits, \"I need the food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandits didn't even have to watch the torture and teasing Fakira was about to preform. They all ran away, not wanting to join their \"leader\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're loyal friends left you,\" Fakira smiled, \"All the better for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Fakira tastes and tortures the man in her mouth for a while before finally swallowing her first human. It felt good and overcame the little guilt she felt. (She didn't feel as much guilt because the man was going to enslave her and was evil.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Fakira starts playing with the tiny human, but then she remembered how she felt when she dreamed about her mother trying to eat her. She couldn't bring herself to eat him. However, she doesn't show her weakness and says that she'll just keep him as a slave. Of course, she'll have to keep him coated in saliva till she grows her wings.This could mean scheduled licking and him sleeping in her mouth when they slept. </span></div></div>",

Please no!\" cried the once strong man as she dangled by an arm over Fakira's mouth.  The giantess's dark laugh resonating from her mouth made him realize there was no coming back if he went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in Fakira's mind, the man's words struck an uneasy chord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He sounds like me in my dream,\"</i> Fakira thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But he's not a person.  I should eat him,\"</i> another part replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But he... he sounds like me...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Eat him and I'll be healed faster!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But...\"</i> Fakira thought, her hand shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully the bandit and others watching thought the shaking hand was more torment.  Suddenly Fakira pushed the man in her mouth.  He had a slightly different flavor than Felix, more potent and meaty. Once she savored his taste for a while and swished him around her mouth, her mouth then opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man she's going to swallow him with her mouth open,\" Ted mumbled to Felix.  Felix watched intently as Fakira's hand went in to her mouth and she pulled the bandit out.  Not that the bandit really noticed, he was flailing around in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sparred him?\" Ted yelled in shock.  Fakira turn her eyes to Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for the stupid reason you think human,\" Fakira said, \"As I was about to swallow, I realized how you were partially right about the buck.  It would be good to have a food source with us.  So I'll use him as a living one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ted asked, confused, the bandit had calmed down enough to understand Fakira and start freaking out once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple, I will keep him shrunk.  When I'm hungry, I will knock him out, dry him off and let him grow.  Then I'll eat part of his legs or arms and shrink him and that one will use some healing magic to least stop the bleeding,\" Fakira explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious?!\" Ted yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes... he's prey... If I can eat part of him... I can eventually eat all of him...</i>\" Fakira thought as she held her little slave, who was dripping with saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I have an idea then,\" Felix said, walking back to the net and cutting a rope from it.  He handed it to Fakira, \"Now you can tie him up and keep him around your neck, so you don't lose him and can coat him in saliva easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea human,\" Fakira said, accepting the rope.  Her eyes flashed with the memory of how Felix helped her in her dream but she dismissed it.</span></div></div>",

She easily tied the rope around him and then tied the rope around her neck. the man dangled from her neck like he was some fancy jeweled necklace. Fakira giggled as the man dangled from the makeshift necklace. \"You're probably the most irresistible piece of jewelry I own now,\" Fakira commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stared up at her with a confused look and Fakira explained, \"By irresistible, I mean that it's hard not just untying you and eating you right now.\" Fakira gave him a wicked smile and added, \"Don't worry, I'll eat you over and over again until I get bored of you, and during that time, you shall be my slave. Serves you right for trying to enslave me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira gave the dangling figure a little tap with her finger which caused him to swing around without any control. \"You should be happy this human has suggested to make you a piece of jewelry,\" Fakira said, \"If I ever decide to wear my mother's dress one day, you'll have a nice view of the valley below.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed looked away from the fairy. He knew that Felaryans teased their victims till they were bored and he heard rumors of some of the terrible things they did to humans before they swallowed them whole, and he knew that fairies were the worst. Like normal fairies, they had a playful and curious characteristic. They liked to tease and play jokes on people. However, since Felaryan fairies didn't see small people as people, they were capable of some of the worse forms of torture just by their teasing alone. Ted knew that it would only be worse for the bandit and although he didn't like the guy, Ted believed that no one but Lord William deserved such torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better keep going,\" Ted informed them, \"There's no telling how close Lord William's troops are. If you want to get to the Fairy forest, then we should go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira and Felix agreed and they continued through the forest. It took another day or two to make it through the forest. Luckily, they didn't run into anymore trouble. One evening at dinner time, the group set up camp for the night, and Felix and Ted were eating a deer that Fakira had captured easily. Fakira on the other hand was waiting for them to be done so she could have another meal out of her little captive, still hanging around her neck. The bandits of the forest didn't want to go near the three travelers, not even to save their miniscule former leader. \"Hopefully, the bandits won't tell others of the event,\" Felix prayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we won't have to worry about that. Those bandits are fugitives. The only way they would tell is if they are captured and know that giving information about a Felaryan fairy can save their lives,\" Ted explained, \"It would be the only reason they'd need to tell people and quite frankly, they don't know what a Felaryan fairy is, otherwise, they might have attacked use that day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you humans don't know too much about Felarya,\" Fakilra stated, \"It will make it that much easier if I should decide to come back her and hunt with my clan. We'll have an abundant source of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed and Felix had learned to ignore such comments as they continued to eat the cooked deer. Fakira sliced a small piece from the deer meat and placed it between her thumb and pointer finger. She then was able to untie the rope with one hand and the man down on the top of her breasts and slid down the front. Fakira was wearing her human peasant clothes, so the shirt didn't so cleavage. The man rolled down the breasts and fell towards the lap. The man fell on Fakira's lap and rolled off to try and make a run for it through the grass. However, Fakira simply set her hand in front of the bandit and teased, \"I don't think so little prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira slowly pushed her hand to him and the man tried to hit the hand as it grasped around him. Fakira lifted the man to her face and whimpered with a fake expression, \"I was only trying to feed you little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need you're damn food, witch!\" the bandit shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will die if you don't,\" Fakira showed fake concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather die than be your slave and food source,\" the bandit screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll just have to stuff you. You should have thought about your actions before you tried to enslave me,\" Fakira growled as she shoved much of the food in his mouth. The bandit chewed and swallowed, it was hard for him to commit suicide and choke on the meat, even if he wanted to. Ted and Felix continued to look away from the torture Fakira was doing with the man they knew little about. Fakira had done many things to the man and she played with him in her mouth frequently to keep him shrunk. She did it to show her dominance over the little human to show that he couldn't even fight against a \"little girl's\" tongue. it was terrible for the little man and Felix and Ted couldn't answer his pleas. It was a surprise the man didn't break yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira noticed the man would grow soon and she smiled as she stated, \"I won't let you have the pleasure of being knocked out this time. This time, you'll see the whole thing.\" Fakira lifted the man up high and let him fall to the ground on his legs. The legs snapped as he hit the ground and he tried crawling away while screaming in agony. Every time the man screamed and pleaded, Fakira was reminded of her dream, but she continued to try her best to dismiss it and hide her doubts. The man soon grow to full height, but he couldn't fight back with his legs broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall teach you a new level of healing,\" Fakira informed Felix. Felix had had to heal the man's wounds before and was getting very good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will I be taught?\" Felix asked sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will learn how to grow limbs. You're still too weak to do it at full scale, but you will be able to heal him when he's shrunken,\" Fakira stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira used her magic to cut the man's arms off and the man screamed in pure agony as blood squirted out onto the dirt. Fakira automatically shrunk the man as she took both arms to eat. Felix knew what to do and was about to heal the man's broken legs and missing arms, but Fakira hissed, \"Wait! Wait till he has learned his leason.\" Fakira licked him while he was on the ground to make sure he'd stay small. Long minutes passed till Fakira let Felix heal him. Felix was able to heal the man, only because the man was small and the man curled in a ball for a long time, crying in fear and sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to think next time before you defy me, slave,\" Fakira growled as she ate the arms. The man watched in horror when he saw what used to be his arms being eaten by the fairy. When, the fairy was done, the man crawled on his hands and knees to the fairy's leg and bowed. There was nothing left of the man. He was broken. Fakira only smiled, picked up the man and tied him back to the neckless. With that, she placed him in her mouth with the rope still tied and fell asleep for the night.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days later, Ted and the group had long departed from the forest. Fakira a little surprised when a few days had past since the forest and they had found no other forest since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are no trees!\" she shouted.  Ted and Felix looked back to the once bandit, now slave, and Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.  We don't have massive forests all over this world,\" Ted said, \"We need to cross this plain to get to the fairy forest.\"  Ted's eyes glanced down at the bandit slave, who Fakira renamed Mini-slave.  He was back to repeating the same words he always did now, after Fakira ate part of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am nothing but the food for Master.  I have no other purpose,\" Mini-slave repeated over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.  Let's get going,\" Fakira said, smiling.  Ted glared for a second, thinking no progress had been made before starting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix sighed as he moved on with the others.  Because of Fakira's slave, he had become very good at the healing spell as well as other magics that were needed for him and Ted to survive.  as he looked at Fakira, he believed there was a change in her, it was just slight.  When she talked to Ted and him, her tone wasn't as harsh as it was to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours passed and their stomachs growled.  Ted had been keen to watch for any animal tracks so Felix could kill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Capture it.  Felix hasn't directly killed any of our meals,\"</i> Ted thought.  Fakira saw the dilemma on Ted's face, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could always take a bite of Mimi-slave if you're hungry,\" Fakira said darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If prey eats like-prey, then I am not prey, just small a person,\"</i> Fakira thought, hoping to see Ted and Felix become her pets as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No than-\" Ted replied when he stopped as Fakira let out a scream.  Both Felix and Ted looked down to see  a snake slither away as Fakira grabbed her lower leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress must have disturbed snake's lair,\" Mini-slave noted, \"That snake was poisonous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing,\" Fakira said, letting go of the wound.  There was not blood but the wound was very red.  \"Let's keep moving until we find something for Mini-slave to eat,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we should get that checked out,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Human, we keep going.  Fairies have strong defenses against poisons,\" Fakira said.  Of course what she didn't know was those defenses are very limited when her wings are cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later . . .</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three travelers and the mini slave around Fakira's neck walked for a few hours and as they walked, Felix and Ted noticed Fakira's odd behavior. She was walking a little slower than usual and she was walking very oddly. Fakira's skin was warm and she was sweating. Sure the sun was high and since the field had no shade, the grasslands was like a desert itself. Felix questioned what might be wrong with the fairy, because he had herd her say that fairies had a strong immunity to the poisons. Ted glanced at the fairy and stared at her wings. Her wing had been healing for six days. It was supposed to take a week to get to the fairy forest. The wings on her back were nearly one fourth of the way heal, but it made her weak enough to be affected by the poison. <i>\"Once we reach the fairy forest tomorrow night, she will only need to stay there for a week and a half to heal fully her wings instead of three weeks. It also takes four days to get out of the Fairy forest if the fairies help us and guide us through, but that Felaryan will want to stay those eleven day in the forest so she can heal and eat us. I hope Felix is right about her changing.\"</i> Ted thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted, what's wrong with her?\" Felix whispered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed snapped out of his thought and once again looked at the fairy and thought about her predicament instead of how long she had left to grow. \"The poison is affecting her,\" Ted answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? She has immunity, doesn't she?\" Felix question in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worried tone truly scared Ted. He realized for the longest time that Felix might be attached to the fairy because Felix was used to slavery and saw the Felaryan as his new master. it was true that Felix still didn't understand the concept of freedom, but he didn't even realize how loyal he was becoming to the fairy. He thought that it was just because he felt sorry for her and he wanted to be her friend and help her. However, the truth deep inside himself was that he saw her as a new master and didn't even know it himself. Ted looked at the bandit around the fairy's neck. <i>\"At least that outlaw sort of deserves what he got, though I don't know if anyone truly deserves to be a slave and constant meal for a Felaryan, but Felix doesn't deserve such a fate at all. Felix is a nice boy and my best friend. The Felaryan is a monster and...\"</i> Ted started getting off track once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted, why is this happening?\" Felix reminded Ted of the question. Ted had been distracted for a couple of days now because he was looking forward to try and figure out what should be the right thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are two possible reasons,\" Ted whispered, \"Either he weak wings are making her easier to get poisoned, or her kind don't have an immunity built up for the snakes of our world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what will happen to the fairy if we don't...?\" Felix began to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Fakira stopped in her tracks and began to titter. Felix and Ted turned around just in time to see Fakira tip over to the side and collapse completely. Both Felix and \"Mini-Slave\" became overwhelmed with fear. (Mini-Slave was more fearful since he had fallen with Fakira. If Fakira wouldn't have turned to her back on the last second, Mini-Slave would have swung with the necklace and would have felt the full impact of the fall onto the ground instead of falling on Fakira's chest.) Felix rushed over to Fakira's side and knelt beside her. Fakira's eyes were rolling into her head and she was shaking terribly. Felix felt her forehead and she was burning up with sweat drenching her skin. Felix turned to Ted who was still standing where he had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted, what do we do?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should keep going,\" Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, the fairy... we can't leave her,\" Felix argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not, Felix?\" Ted questioned, \"So she'll heal and grow to her giant size. Then she could eat us or make us her pets. You want to be her pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't do that, she's just saying that to keep an act,\" Felix tried to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fairy is stubborn and still fighting to make sure we're just prey to her. She's looking for any reason to prove we're not people to her,\" Ted explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if she has to fight to see this, then she's starting to crack. She might see us as people soon,\" Felix argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have a point, but should we risk it. This fairy is part of one of the extreme Felaryan clan, the extremes only see people as something of their own species and/or their own size,\" Ted informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix thought carefully about what Ted had said and realized something. \"There are others than extremes aren't there?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was strange put, Ted understood what Felix meant to say. \"There are Felaryan clans that have the same views as humans on what a person is, and it is true that those clans have been befriended by humans, but even those clans still eat humans from time to time just because their bigger. No one has befriended an extreme case,\" Ted informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a first for everything. Think about it, she became a slave like us. You and I have much in common with the fairy because of this slavery. You and her want nothing more than to be free and her and I have shared the same sort of sadness in being a slave. Then, we freed her and we've been traveling. You informed her about how she'd be a prey in her world. She dreamed about being a prey and she know how much it feels to be in our predicament. She won't eat us. Even when she tortures the bandit, I see conflict in her eyes,\" Felix told Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But should we risk it?\" Ted questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help the master!\" Mini-Slave demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see what you can become, Felix?\" Ted pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may think you're just trying to befriend this fairy, but it might be because you wish to her her slave now,\" Ted accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been a slave your whole life. You told me you'd rather live your life as a slave than die free, because you've been a slave all your memorable life and you're too used to it. This fairy is showing dominance over and because you're so used to being a slave, you're starting to see her as a master,\" Ted explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true!\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such deep inside yourself before you deny it,\" Ted ordered, \"Why else would you be so loyal to her? Why else are you always sucking up to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix searched inside himself foe a long time and Ted added, \"That slave could be you in a few weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't leave her for dead,\" Felix informed Ted, \"I can still change her in the twelve more days we have. Can you heal her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what bite her, I know the antidote, and the ingredients are all around us,\" Ted told his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then give me a chance to change her. She's not lost cause. You know this to be true,\" Felix pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed sighed, \"Fine, but this is very risky. Hopefully, she'll understand we had a choice on whether to save her or not. We had the free will to leave her, but we chose to save her. Hopefully this will help our cause an she'll be at least a little but grateful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She may not show it, but she will be very grateful,\" Felix told Ted as he left for the ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Ted finds the ingredients quickly and makes the cure. Thanks to Fakira's partial immunity, she recovers quickly after the cure is administered and she is in time to lick Mini-Slave again to keep him small. They eat lunch soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Ted takes a while, but gets the ingredients. Fakira is unable to recover in time and Mini-Slave grows once again. The bandit sees the opportunity and tries to kill Fakira. Ted and Felix, still having the weapons, are able to kill the bandit. Fakira becomes even more grateful!  </span></div></div>",

It's for her health,\"</i> Felix thought as he pulled her weak body onto the softer surface. He also tried covering her in the shade of some tall grass to buy her some more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time passed and Ted had all but one ingredient left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.  Where is it?\" Ted murmured, looking under every rock for a bit off moss that could draw out poison, either by applying to the wound or ingestion.  He knew this was the key ingredient to saving Fakira.  He paused to breath when a thought came to him.  \"Mini-Slave,\" he whispered as his eyes went wide, realizing the small bandit might still have a spark of rebellion in him.  If he grew before Fakira could lick him it would be big trouble for them.  With this fear driving him more than Felix's pleas to help Fakira to change her, Ted looked on much quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was fanning the feverish Fakira.  Mini-slave was standing next to Fakira, still attached to the necklace.  The small bandit stood in the direct sunlight watching Felix attend to his mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No!  She isn't my mistress.  If things go well I can escape from my torment with her,</i> the bandit thought playing with the knot around him.  He could never have tried this if the other boys were still around as they would keep him small for their own safety.  The bandit smiled as he undid the knot, even at two inches, he was great at knots.  Unknown to Felix, the bandit slipped off into some taller-than-him grass and hid, waiting to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix!\" came a voice from a far, \"Get the bandit wet with saliva!\"  Felix recognized the voice as Ted's and looked and saw no slave present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's gone!\" Felix cried as Ted arrived.  He bit his lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, we should go,\" Ted said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we can't leave Fakira to die,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a monster!\" Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You keep saying she's a monster but why haven't you left or tried killing her yourself?\" Felix replied coldly.  Ted looked away.  \"You're just as uncomfortable about leaving her alone as I am.  Part of you can't let her die because she is a person who has suffered like we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFine, here is the antidote,\" Ted said, kneeling down and putting some in her mouth.  He pushed some moss on her leg.  The affect was almost instant.  Her fever went down and her eyes opened slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha . . .?  What happened . . .\"  Fakira breathed out, still worn from the poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't as immune as expected,\" Ted said coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted found the antidote to heal the snake bite,\" Felix said as he, Fakira and Ted felt a large shadow cast over their kneeling bodies.  Ted and Felix looked behind to see the large, nude, furious bandit glaring sadistically at the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will make you pay for what you did to me,\" the bandit growled, holding a large rock and was about to throw it down upon them when Felix reacted without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quickly wave of his hand, though missing because of the panic he felt, Felix missed the rock but did sever the man's hand, still protecting them from his assault.  As the man gripped the stump that was his hand, Ted pulled some arrows and jabbed one into the man's throat. The bandit struck Ted back with his stump but the damage was already done and he collapsed on the ground, dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You . . .saved me . . .\" Fakira said, looking at her former slave and meal plan, then to Ted, who had blood on his shirt.  Ted looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, while you're a monster to torment him like you did, you were a defenseless person just the same,\" Ted said.  Fakira looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What is this I'm feeling?  Thanks?  Gratefulness?  Respect?  But why?  How?  They're slaves!  They're prey!  Not people!  But . . . they could have left me . . . even at the castle . . . that one guard died letting us go  . .  .WHAT DOES THIS MEAN!!!!\"</i>  Fakira grabbed her head tightly from her inner turmoil.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fakira was very conflicted in her head. She had never been more conflicted with such a subject. On one hand, she had been taught that humans were prey and could never be people. Her mother and the rest of her clan told her that only creatures of her size could be considered a a person, but now she had been introduced to another form of thinking which suggested that a person was defined as creatures as similar intelligence. The humans of this new world even saw miniature fairies as people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Fakira saw this way of thinking as extremely odd. To find out that humans would eat something smaller than them was just too strange for Fakira to comprehend. She thought she could never pass up such an opportunity. However, the more she spent time with the humans, the more she understood their way of thinking. She began realizing that creatures of the same intelligence have the same feelings, fears, and emotions. Though the humans were little, their minds were very similar to the mind of a fairy. not only did she realize that, but she found out first hand what a small human would feel like if they were about to be eaten. Though it was only a dream, the emotions and fears were real. She thought she was really going to be swallowed whole by her own mother which not only made her understand what goes in the mind of a Felaryan prey, but also see how flawed her way of thinking was. She could be a person one day and a prey the next if she decided to shrink and get her wings cut off. No, she was realizing the humans beliefs were the only logical truths. A person is defined by their mind and the ability to feel, not just because of their physical structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira had slowly learned this fact and she tried hard to tell herself that the humans' way of thinking was a weakness. It should be the right of large creatures to do what they wanted to do with little beings. Though bigger creatures had the power, Fakira began to comprehend that even if large creatures had the power to eat small people, it didn't make it any less wrong. They had the power, but it was wicked to use it in such a way. It's not right, it's not fair. This was what caused Fakira to have trouble torturing the miniature bandit so much. She thought it would bring her her normal beliefs, but it only caused her to think worse of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only were those beliefs being realized, but Fakira grown to like the two humans she was with. She was starting to see Felix as a loyal companion and Ted as an ethical teacher showing her the right direction. They had both helped her, despite her being wicked to them and seeing them as prey. They had saved her from slavery, helped her against the bandits, lead her a way home, saved her from being poisoned, and protected her from an evil bandit she thought she had under control. They did all this even when she threatened to eat them or make them her pets. They know of the risks and possible consequences of helping her, but they still helped her. Fakira didn't know of anyone that would do such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairy?\" Felix questioned as he placed a hand on Fakira's shoulder. She was sitting up now and just thinking deeply within herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get some food,\" Ted informed them. Ted left and Fakira and Felix were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you save me human?\" Fakira questioned, \"Why would prey sacrifice so much to save a predator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's different in our world. There are only people and animals. All sentient beings are people. Sentient beings don't harm other sentient beings unless they are either cruel or have no choice. Sometimes, even the most vicious looking of sentient beings will help another sentient being despite the species. Our world still isn't immune to prejudice and racism, but no world is immune to such. There are still humans that are too ignorant and stubborn to dragons, or other animal looking creatures as people just because they're animals,\" Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In our world, Nagas and Dridders hate each other. They hate each other even more than succubi and angels of our world,\" Fakira replied, \"Just because their different species. Fairies and Chilotaurs are the only predators that can truly be friends with any other top predator. Chilotaurs even find friends in humans, disgusting.\" Fakira didn't want the humans to know she was broken. She didn't even want to believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand why Ted and I saved you?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two don't see me as a predator, but as a person,\" Fakira answered, \"Even the other human saw this and couldn't let me die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand that what you originally thought was wrong?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira know what the human meant by his words, but Fakira didn't want to give him a hint of her broken state. She shoved his hand off her shoulder and growled, \"Just keep your hands of my, prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed came back shortly with two rabbits. \"They rabbits were about getting close to mating. It was the only way I could get two with one arrow,\" Ted stated, \"Luckily arrows can be used more than once. I only have ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira looked at the rabbits and questioned, \"No deer? nothing bigger than this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is only small animals in the grasslands. We'll only have another day of this. We should arrive at the town next to the Fairy Forest by nightfall tomorrow. Unless, you're still weak to keep going after lunch,\" Ted stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't stop till nightfall,\" Fakira barked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To back there isn't much to eat,\" Felix replied, as he began a fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the rabbit grew to the size of a dogs. Felix and Ted looked at the fairy. \"I can't grow myself yet, but I can grow this rabbits larger. They'll stay large enough to eat,\" Fakira informed the humans before they began to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow's nightfall...</span></div></div>",

She and Felix followed him to a table and sat as the bartender left a platter of bread and cheese, along with some water in a pitcher.  Once he left, Fakira looked at Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No meat?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't ask what I would get.  Besides,\" Ted said grabbing the warm bread, \"I've had enough meat for a while.\"  Felix watched Ted break into the bread and was so excited at having fresh baked bread and good cheese.  When they were slaves, they had bread but it was usually stale by the time slaves were allowed to eat it.  But after a bite of the warm bread and cheese, Felix realized why Ted was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira ate in silence, finding the bread and cheese filling, if lacking the raw meat she enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their bellies filled, the three were taken by a maid to room 5, where they would be sleeping.  Ted smiled at the three separate beds, each raised off the floor and promptly laid down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with him?\" Fakira finally asked after the maid left, \"Why was he so weird when we got to this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack remembered what life was like outside being a slave before he was sold,\" Felix replied, taking a bed for himself, \"Being free and being able to eat food he could only remember on distant dreams was probably something he had been wanting to do since we got out of the castle.\"  Felix looked at Fakira.  \"I'm guessing there are some fruits you're interested in eating once your home.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your point,\" Fakira said as another pang of guilt came for demeaning these two who had saved and protected her.  She sat on the third bed and laid on the soft surface.  It felt nice on her recovering wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mary,\" Felix called to her, \"What is your real name?\"   Fakira looked at Felix for a moment, wondering should she tell or not.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fakira hesitated for a few moments and listened to the two sides within her. One side know that she had been broken from her original state. She was a knew fairy inside and it knew she was a better person because of it. She wasn't the monster that ate small people just because they were small anymore. She was fever changed. That part of her saw Ted and Felix as dear friends and it wished to tell them her name and start calling them by their name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her other side, her prideful side, thought differently. He prideful side was still hoping to she could revert back to her normal self, despite it being wrong and a terrible thing to do so. It didn't want the humans to realize how she had changed because of their actions and it felt that if she told them, they would become aware of her she had changed. Her pride wished to cover everything up and act like everything was alright and the humans were still insignificant creatures beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince both her sides were in the opposite extremes, Fakira made a compromise. She decided she would tell them her name, but her prideful side would makeup a reason that would seem like she hadn't changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can tell you my name,\" Fakira replied, \"You two have become very loyal and I have no doubts both of you will make fine pets I can care for and act kindly towards. You might as well know my name. My name is Fakira.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you, Fakira,\" Felix greeted with a friendly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed smiled as well before he fell asleep. He knew that they were getting to Fakira and that she would someday be their friend he knew the Felaryan will finally be going down the right path and away from the path her mother started her on. Ted fell asleep first and was followed by Felix soon after. Fakira stayed awake a few minutes. She was thinking about her two sides and she couldn't stop thinking about them. <i>\"We will be staying in the fairy forest for a week and a half. When my wings grow and I grow myself to my normal height, what will I do with the humans?\"</i> For the first time in the entire trip, Fakira didn't know what she would do. She had no idea and no predictions of what her actions might be in the future. Deep down inside, she hoped she would make the right discussion and befriend the humans and not harm them. However, there was doubt and she feared that she still might eat them or make them her pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira sighed and she fell asleep and waited for tomorrow to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the three of them woke up and Fakira was very quiet. She didn't say a word while they prepared to set of. She just put her jacket on, to cover her partially healed wings, and waited on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were all ready, they headed outside and the bartender greeted them farewell before they left the place. They walked down the fairly empty street to the gate near the fairy forest. Not many people were around that gate and many other travelers stayed clear of it. So, when the guard saw what appeared to be two ten year olds and a thirteen year old who wished to exit the gate and go through the fairy forest, the guard thought he was seeing things. However, the kids still approached the gate. \"Do the three of you wish to go into the fairy's domain?\" the guard questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do,\" Ted answered, \"On the other side of the forest is were we need to go. What's the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most travelers go around the forest, not through it. If grown men don't normally go through, what makes three kids so special?\" the guard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have enough supplies to go around the forest. We can only go through it. Is the forest dangerous?\" Ted questioned, pretending to be just a dumb kid that didn't know about the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fairies live in the forest and they like to play tricks on the travelers. They can use their magic to manipulate the environment or cast spells and hexes on you,\" the guard explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are the fairies dangerous?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't usually kill travelers, if that's what you mean, but... well...\" the guard started to explain, but he couldn't think of a very good reason to stay out other than what he had already said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we just go?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard opened the gate and the three travelers walked into the forest.</span></div></div>",

She sounded serious about this.  \"Now what do you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see trees and glowing spots in them and,\" Felix said, looking at Ted, \"Ted is glowing a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ted asked, looking at himself.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ted, Felix, and Fakira walked into the forest to find that there was no path whatsoever. \"There's no path!\" Felix pointed out, \"Is that because the fairies made it invisible or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fairy magic,\" Ted informed Felix, \"There's no path because humans don't go through the forest. Once they discovered fairies living in the forest, they realized the fairies would just make them lost in the forest from illusions. Humans didn't bother making the paths. They only made the path that goes around the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed and Felix started moving, but they found that Fakira wasn't following. Felix and Ted stopped and looked back. Fakira was looking around the forest in awe. \"Something wrong Fakira?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira didn't hear his questioning. She was too mesmerized by the forest. Everything was old and overgrown. Everything about the forest reminded Fakira of home. The forests of her home world were old and tall because humans didn't dare try to make settlements in a Felaryan forest, and the forest she was in had no human development because of the trickster fairies. So, this forest was exactly like Fakira's. Even the magic was coming from everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira,\" Felix called. Fakira finally snapped out of her trance and looked at Felix. \"Is something the matter?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Fakira shook her head, \"Everything here is just like my home forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes sense for it to look alike,\" Ted replied, \"This is an old growth forest. It takes many decades for a forest to become this. Forests that aren't tampered by humans become like this. Humans in your world don't go into forests unless they have to because of all the things that will eat them, let alone go in to chop wood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira understood Ted's logic and agreed. The group continued and Felix brought up an important matter. \"If there is no path, how are we to get out?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not leaving till my wings heal fully,\" Fakira stated, \"That will possibly take another week and a half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when Fakira's wings heal, we'll have to find fairies and convince them to help us. Or, Fakira will grow and fly us out of the forest,\" Ted stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira didn't know how to react to that statement. At first she was angry to think that she'd be a form of transportation to them. However, the other side of her, the part that didn't mind her new change of mind, reasoned that it would just be helping her friends out. It wasn't like they would think of her as a beast of burden. It would be her decision to helping them and carrying them out. So, Fakira didn't say anything and kept walking for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira soon noticed the silence and she questioned, \"Why is it so silent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back in my world when humans enter the forest, my clan likes to go in the trees and tease them. They'd whisper and giggle aloud so the travelers can hear their inevitable doom. They also make illusions and do many things to torture them as they walk through the forest till they finally decide to eat the traveler. I know your fairies can't eat human travelers, but I'd think they'd still like to tease them,\" Fakira explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Ted replied, \"Yet, they aren't doing so now. It's almost like their staying away from us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they do that?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their forest is close to the dimensional gate. if Lord William used that gate to obtain Fakira, then the fairies must know there's a Felaryan fairy in our country. They probably know about Felaryan fairies and realize Fakira is the Felaryan. They must want to stay away from Fakira because... She'd...\" Ted started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat them?\" Fakira finished Ted's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you Felaryans do, isn't it?\" Ted questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Fakira sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira's mind was divided. She knew that part of her knew that eating little people was wrong. She realized that judging people by their intelligence instead of their size made more since and was fair to though who just weren't as large as Felaryan predators. The part didn't even think she'd be able to eat a human, especially the two accompanying her who were becoming her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Who cares if you eat things littler than you,\"</i> the other part of her thought, <i>\"You're bigger than them and have the right.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But they're people,\"</i> Fakira's new part argued, <i>\"They have the same intelligence, feelings, emotions, and...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"They're still littler,\"</i> her old self commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That shouldn't matter,\"</i> Fakira's new self stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the argument could continue, Felix and Ted looked behind themselves to see Fakira. \"Fakira!\" Felix yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira had been so engrossed in her mind that she wasn't watching were she was going. She stepped on uneven ground and when she snapped out of her trance, it was too late to undo her mistake. Her balance was lost and her weight tipped over. Fakira fell and rolled down the hill towards a grove of strange flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed realized what the flowers were. They were the most powerful healing flowers and they were concentrated with so much healing magic that just touching one could heal an individual. Fakira was heading right for the grove and Ted knew that her wings would heal and she'd be able to grow. She was at a critical point between her old self and her new self which understood Ted and Felix's way of thinking. The problem was that Ted didn't know which one she was leaning more towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed watched in horror as Felix ran down the hill after Fakira. \"Felix, wait!\" Ted ordered, but Felix wouldn't listen. Ted readied his bow and arrow in case things turned for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira finally stopped rolling when she reached the middle of the grove of flowers she had never seen before. She could feel more magic than usual and her partial wings became numb. Fakira just lied on her back and Felix was the first to reach her. Felix knelt beside Fakira and questioned worriedly, \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira slowly sat up as she answered, \"I think so.\" Fakira faced Felix only to see him staring at her back with wide eyes. \"Is something wrong?\" Fakira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wings,\" Felix pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wings weren't numb anymore and she felt them. She could feel them whole again. Fakira turned her head to the side and could see her wings were normal again. She could grow once again. Fakira wasted no time and she willed herself to grew to eighty feet tall. Fakira stood on her feet and twirled around a few times in joy. She was her normal height once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira,\" Fakira heard a familiar voice below her. Fakira looked down and saw a small Felix looking up at her. Fakira's old self took over and she smiled evilly at the human below her. Fakira bent down and clutched the small boy in her hand and lifted him to her face. The human was petrified with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I can finally eat you,\" Fakira stated showing all her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira, you don't want to do that,\" Felix informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I'm bigger than you. I can do whatever I want with you. You're not even a person,\" Fakira stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira! Put Felix down!\" Ted demanded from the hill. He had an arrow aimed at Fakira. Fakira just smiled and made a flicking motion with her free hand. Ted was pushed to a tree and he was hit hard. He dropped his bow and arrow and stayed on his hands and knees to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira turned her attention back to Felix and said, \"Now, back to you and your voyage to my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Fakira. You don't want to do this,\" Felix told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea what I want to do, human!\" Fakira hissed and she used her other hand to pinch the back of Felix's shirt. She dangled him and opened her mouth as wide as she could. Felix grabbed the top teeth and straddled her thick tongue when he was placed on top of it. Fakira could easily push Felix in, but she teased by using as little force as she could with her fingers first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira, please,\" Felix pleaded, \"I thought you changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only pretended,\" Fakira informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didn't!\" Felix argued, \"We saved your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only used you,\" Fakira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true,\" Felix continued to argue, \"I'm a person Fakira.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your prey,\" Fakira argued as she bent her tongue and pushed his back with the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People are judged by their intelligence, Fakira, remember?\" Felix cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira's new self began to take hold as she listened to Felix's words. \"Don't you remember everything we went through. All three of us were slaves to Lord William. We all suffered the same punishments, we all shared the same feelings. We escaped together and Ted and I saved you from the poison and the bandit. Don't you remember the nightmare you had Fakira?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira remembered the nightmare very well and started to understand Felix was in her position when she was in the nightmare. Felix was going through the same emotions she had had. \"You mother in that dream was going to eat you because she believed you were prey. She was going to eat her own daughter just because you were little. You don't believe you were a prey, right. You were just a little person, just like Ted and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears fell down Fakira's eyes as she realized what she was doing. She was eating a person. She was become the monster from her dreams. \"Fakira, I'm your friend. I could have left you and Ted and I could have escaped alone, but I couldn't let that happen. I like you Fakira and I couldn't leave you alone in that cell. Are you going to eat a friend Fakira?\" </span></div></div>",

Her name was Solita and she was the only fairy in the squad close to Dalil maturity. However, she was always very quiet. This could be understandable since her parents were both killed by humans. Solita had seen the whole thing. Somehow, some bratty human kids came into the woods and... Solita couldn't even make herself think about what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your distrust for humans Solita, but not all are like the boys who...\" Dalil started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why has every human we met either tried to bring harm to the forest or our village?\" Solita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because usually, only the evil ones are the ones brave enough to enter,\" Dalil stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If these humans are brave enough to enter then...\" Solita started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalil quickly interrupted, \"These humans seemed to befriend a fairy, a giant fairy I might add. You've heard the tales of Felaryan fairies from the elders. If the humans can befriends such a monster who just eats anything smaller than her, then either this fairy is more like us or the humans are just that kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita still didn't like the idea and the others were uncomfortable with the serious conversation. \"Are we going to lead them to the fairy or not?\" a fairy questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a fairy scout returned and announced, \"The giant fairy went to the meadow. She's stilling down and crying to herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there might be a way we can lead these humans to the giant fairy,\" Dalil informed them, \"We still should stay hidden and study them for a while longer to see what their intentions are. We can lead them to her without showing ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" a fairy questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll make a chain and increase the sound of the giant's crying. It will lead the humans to her,\" Dalil explained. The fairies understood the concept and making a sound louder than it should be was easy magic. The six fairies spread out in a long chain and used their magic to increase the noise of the giant fairy. The fairies had used a similar method when they tried to make humans lost by making the sounds come from an opposite direction. Only this time, they were making it lead in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get to her,\" Felix said, \"She needs us more than ever. She's in a major conflict with her old and new self. Her old self wants to eat us because we're small and her new self must realize we're people and friends. She's in the middle between those conflicting views and at a critical point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that Felix,\" Ted replied, \"But how are we going to find her? She's her giant height and could easily have traveled too far for us to reach her. She could still be on the move for all we know. We'll never catch up. We don't even know the direction she left to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but...\" Felix began to argue, but he cut himself off when her heard a crying voice. Ted heard it too and looked for the source, but couldn't find it. \"That's Fakira!\" Felix exclaimed, \"We have to follow it and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Ted ordered as he grabbed Felix's wrist, \"It could be a trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Felix questioned, \"You think that Fakira...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said it might be Fakira's trap,\" Ted explained, \"But it could be the fairies living in this forest. They could be mimicking Fakira's voice and leading us into a trap. These fairies ever every right to want to drive out humans and distrust us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old growth forest is the best kind of wood for fuel,\" Ted informed Felix, \"These trees are highly valuable. I won't be surprised if every nearby human village has tried to make a profit out of the wood, especially when it takes hundreds upon hundreds of years to make an old growth forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we have to try, it's the only lead we have,\" Felix pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed thought carefully and decided to follow the voice with Felix. He only hoped that the fairies weren't playing a trick on them. </span></div></div>",

As a new noise came to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a monster,\" came Fakira's voice.  Hearing his friend in distress, Felix pushed harder to get there.  Ted, not wanting to lose sight of Felix if this was a trap, kept pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the pair of boys found themselves in a large meadow and against some very old trees, Fakira was leaning against them.  Her knees were to her chest and head smothered into them.  Tears soaked her legs and pants. She was still wearing the human clothing she had got from the cabin because she was in too much distress to change into her dress given to her by her mother. Both Ted and Felix were relieved to find her, Felix for finding his friend and Ted for knowing this isn't a trick by the fairies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a monster . . . .  I can't go home or I would be a monster,\" Fakira sobbed, not noticing her visitors as they approached her giant frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira!\" Felix called out, \"You aren't a monster!\"  Slowly Fakira's head rose and looked at her companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix . . .Ted. . . .\" she whispered, wondering how they could have found her so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not a monster,\" Felix repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I . . . .

My old self is still within me and I'm too dangerous to be around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you didn't eat us, Fakira. You took control and stopped yourself from doing it,\" Felix informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I lose control of myself again?\" Fakira questioned. Fakira began to remember how Felix tasted. Felix was one of the greatest things she had ever tasted and Fakira was worried she'd try to eat him again because of that. \"I don't wish to harm either of you. You're the only true friends I have in this world,\" Fakira cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you will stay in control and not harm us,\" Ted pointed out, \"You're worried about hurting us. You don't want anything to happen to us because you see us as friends and people. You'll do anything to keep us safe, including keeping control of yourself. You're not dangerous for us to be around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira was shocked by Ted's confidence in her and she asked, \"You don't see me as a monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the same fairy I first met. I know you know realize that even little beings can be people. I know now that you won't eat 'little' people,\" Ted told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira was overwhelmed with joy. The little humans were really her friends and they had confidence in her control. They risked their lives to be with her. She could have been controlled by her old self and they could have been eaten, but they came to find her anyway and comfort her. <i>\"They are really my friends. I can't let anything bad happen to them. I will protect them and keep them safe,\"</i> Fakira promised to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira reached down and grabbed Felix and Ted in different hands. She was still not completely used to them being people, since they were so small, and she didn't ask if she could pick them up. She just reached down, wrapped a set of fingers around each one, and picked them up without any consent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis scared Felix and Ted slightly. (It scared Ted a little more since he had never been picked up by a giantess, let alone a Felaryan.) Fakira moved her legs away from her chest, but still kept them bent up. Fakira moved each hand to her stomach and pressed both humans against her stomach. Fakira them moved her legs closer in and bent down to give them a firm, without crushing them, hug. Felix and Ted quickly realized what Fakira was only hugging them and they calmed down and hugged as much of her as they could back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug continued for a very long time and it seemed like it would never end. But eventually, Fakira sat straight up and set her legs down in a crossed position. Fakira them lifted Felix and Ted off her stomach and set one on each lap. Fakira stared down at them much calmer and happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was a different and very rewarding experience,\" Ted commented and Felix agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you liked it... Ted and Felix,\" Fakira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, could you warn us before you just pick us up?\" Ted questioned, \"It's kind of scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira quickly realized what Ted meant and she replied, \"You're right, I wouldn't have licked being suddenly picked up without any warning or giving consent to do so, no matter how nice the giant might be. I understand your request and I will try to remember to ask you two before I pick you up again. I'm just used to picking up humans without consent because I always thought they weren't... well... you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's understandable,\" Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still wish to go to your home world?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I want to anymore,\" Fakira answered, \"You two are great friends. I don't want to leave either of you and I'd have to bring you if I went home, but it's too dangerous for both of you. My clan wouldn't see you as people. Plus, I don't want my old self to come back. It might be better is I stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a few moments of silence and Felix and Ted just sat on the giantess's comfortable lap. Ted suddenly said, \"I'm sorry for calling you a monster so many times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" Fakira assured him, \"I was a monster. Everything you told me helped me realize how much of a monster I really was. I should be thanking you for that and I'm the one who should be sorry. I treated you and Felix as if you weren't people. Even when I treated you two so terribly, you both were kind enough to me and you both saved my life many times. I'm sorry for not realizing this sooner and I'm sorry for treating you so terribly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted,\" Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We forgive you,\" Felix added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira smiled happily down at the two kind humans on her lap. She knew she had picked two great humans that would be her friends till the day they died. She couldn't have picked two better humans. Fakira reached down to pick both of them up again and hug them. She noticed both cringed when her hands were about a foot away from them. Fakira stopped her hands and asked, \"May I pick the two of you up? I want to hug both of you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix and Ted nodded. Fakira happily picked them up and brought them into another warm embrace. After the hug, Fakira placed the two humans on the ground and stood up. \"I think I should get dressed into my mother's dress,\" Fakira informed them, \"It's more comfortable than these human clothes.\" Fakira took the human sized dress out of her pocket and grew it to it's natural size. The dress was pretty clean since Fakira always washed it when they got the chance. \"I can trust that the two of you won't peek, right?\" Fakira questioned teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix and Ted turned their backs to Fakira and Fakira turned around as well, just in case.

The taller human knew we might be leading them into a trap.  If he finds us watching them, it could be troublesome.  Especially if the Felaryan finds out you watched her change,\" Dalil hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They really befriended her,\" Solita murmured in awe of the giant fairy hugging the humans, \"Could they have made her their friend from force?\"  Dalil looked at Solita.  Considering her past, it was obvious she was looking for some reason to not trust the human boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are we going to show ourselves to them?\" one fairy asked Dalil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In good time.  They probably guess we're watching, so let's not come out at such a tender moment,\" Dalil said, \"Maybe after they eat lunch.\"  The others nodded while Solita didn't take her eyes off the anomalies for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira knelt down to make talking easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if  you want to stay with us, we should probably continue through the woods to escape Lord William's domain,\" Ted said.

Some of my friends don't get along, but they all understand I have other friends too, and they respect my decision, but I don't know what they'd do if they see that two of my friends are humans. No fairy has ever come back to the clan with a human as a friend. None have even brought a human back as a pet. I don't know what the clans reactions will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard stories of humans befriending Felaryan top predators. There have been stories of nagas and giant neckos that had been abandoned by their parents and raised by humans. Those Felaryans become friends with other top predators as well as humans,\" Ted informed Fakira, \"Though the top predator friends still eat humans, they respect the top predator who had been raised by humans and don't harm their human friends. They've even been known to see the humans as friends as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope my clan would be like that, but I'm still unsure,\" Fakira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you mother?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's usually stubborn with her beliefs. I fear she might eat you or shove you down my throat to prove her point,\" Fakira cried at the thought of her mother doing so to her friends, \"I want you be with you two, but going to my world will be extremely dangerous to you. What if we can't go back through the portal to get back here? I might not be able to protect both of you all the time and the thought of one of you or both of you being eaten by a Felaryan would make me feel guilty for taking you there. I can't bear losing either of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed and Felix heard the sincerity in Fakira's voice when she said the last sentence. Fakira looked down at her lap while trying to erase the images of Ted and Felix being eaten by fairies of her clan or neighboring nagas that Fakira had befriended. <i>\"I would die if Felix and Ted were eaten by one of my Felaryan friends,\"</i> Fakira thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sincerity of Fakira's voice and the sadness in her eyes when she imagined Ted and Felix being eaten, any remaining doubt in Felix or Ted's minds about Fakira's friendship was shattered right then and there. It was clear that Fakira saw them as her friends and people. Once one as a friend to a Felaryan fairy, they were always a friend of that fairy. Felaryan fairies were extremely loyal like Nagas and once you were just a slight friend of a fairy, you are automatically deemed a close friend, kind of like a best friend in human culture. It was obvious that Fakira would never harm them now, and she would do everything in her power to protect them from harm. She had come a very long way since they had first met her in her cell at Lord William's castle. Fakira was a changed person, no longer the monster that only viewed people her size as people. Now, she knew that creatures with intelligence were people and it didn't matter what their size was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix approached one of Fakira's knees. It was very easy to reach since she was sitting on the back of her ankles with her shins on the ground. Felix touched the bare knee, (her dress only came down just above the knee), and Felix then stroked it. Fakira stopped and looked at Felix. A few weeks ago, Fakira would have swatted the human like a bug, but now was different. Felix was her friend and it was obvious he was only trying to comfort her. Soon, the strokes began calming Fakira down and returned the favor by rubbing Felix's back with her pointer finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll at least think about it, right?\" Felix asked, \"If your mother really loves you, you need to at least say goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but what if...\" Fakira worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do whatever it takes to protect us though, wouldn't you?\" Ted questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira strongly answered, \"I would use all my power to protect you two if I have to. You two saved me from so many things, including myself. If I wouldn't have met you, I'd still be in Lord William's cell and I would be a monster, still eating humans and not realizing they're people. I need to keep you safe after everything you've done for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you shouldn't have to worry about protecting us, because with that determination, I'm sure you'll keep us plenty safe,\" Ted assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira paused and thought about the truth in Ted's words. After a long pause, Fakira sighed, \"I still have to think long and hard on the matter before making a final decision.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a growl as deep and loud as a dragon's growl permeated the air around them. Felix and Ted knew right away were it had come from and they looked up at Fakira who looked down and away while blushing. \"Are either of you hungry too?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth humans nodded and the giantess fairy looked around while still sitting. Her eyes eventually found something trying to bolt away. Fakira caught the creature with her telekinesis and levitated it to her. The creature was a large boar. Fakira grabbed the boar when it was close enough and easily twisted its neck. Once the beast was dead. She laid it on the ground and grew it till it was large enough for her to eat a meal from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had already started a fire by making it with a spell and the flame was levitating in the air, waiting for the meat to cook. Fakira smiled and commented, \"You're fire skills seem to be coming to you naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far, it's the only spell that seems natural to me,\" Felix replied, \"You think one of my ancestors was a creature that could control fire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't even know if you bloodline gained magic that way,\" Ted said, \"Your ancestors could have gained magic a different way other than mating with a magical creature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet somehow, that explanation seems right to me. What creatures were natural fire casters?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many creatures can cast fire. It's one of the most common powers between magical creatures.\" Ted explained, \"However, the creatures best at it would be dragons, elementals, kitsunes, phoenix, and a few others that seemed to have slipped my mind. I know way too many creatures to remember them all at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira cut a piece of meat big enough for both Felix and Ted to eat and levitated it down to Felix. Felix caught it with his telekinesis and cooked it over the levitating flames. Once it was finished cooking, Felix cut it in half and gave one half to Ted. Felix and Ted ate as Fakira ripped into the boar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix watched Fakira eat the boar she had grown and it gave Felix an idea. \"Fakira, you can grow things, could you turn us into giants if we go to Felarya? Will that keep us safe?\" Felix suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira paused and thought about it for a while. There were such things as giants in Felarya and she could grow both of them large enough for people to believe their giants. However, there was a small problem with the suggestion. \"Probably not,\" Fakira answered, \"There are better magic wielders than me and they could detect spells. They would realize you're only giants because of a spell and they would shrink you back down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, if we're their size with the spell wouldn't they see us as people?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My clan judges you as a person by your original size. If you're originally smaller than us, despite having a current giant size, they would see you as prey,\" Fakira stated, \"But that's wrong. You can't help it if you're smaller than us, you can't change your species or original height. Your size shouldn't make you any less of a person than you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if your clan judges on your original height, your nightmare would have never come true,\" Felix pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but I'm glad I did have that nightmare,\" Fakira replied as she recalled the nightmare where her mother tried to eat her, \"If I wouldn't have had that nightmare, I would have never experienced what it is like to be a person, but large people only see you as a snack, just because you're smaller. I would have never realized what it was like to be a human in my world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Felix spots some fruit in a nearby tree and asks Fakira to pick a few for the three of them. Fakira does so, but the fairies are hiding in that tree and Fakira spots them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: As the humans and giant fair eat. Dalil decides to send a scout to fetch an elder or two that way they could start negotiating with the humans and the giant fairy.</span></div></div>",

Why?\" Aloia asked, turning her head from the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because there is no way we can deal with a mage and a Felaryan,\" Dalil said, \"If you were listening, they plan on heading to the gate or elsewhere.   They are don't want to be caught by that dark mage who rules the lands outside of these woods.  If we help them, they may help us with the problem in the south.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we really trust them?\" Solita asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why I want an Elder here.  They know more about that breed of fairy than anyone here,\" Dalil said, \"Now go!\"  The pair glared at Dalil, but soon followed his orders.  \"And don't cause any fun either!\"  Calip turned around and stuck his tongue out at Dalil.  Dalil ignored it and looked back to the humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Fakira,\" Ted said as he wiped his hands on the ground, \"Would you shrink your old clothes?\"  Fakira looked at the disguise clothes she had worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.  But why?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you are going to be living with us and we need to hide, you can't stay at this current height,\" Ted said.  Fakira nodded, understanding where he's going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And even then, my wings are a give away, right?\" Fakira said plainly.  Ted nodded.  Fakira looked at her old clothes and watched them shrink until they could fit into a bag easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, should we head to the gate anyway?\" Felix asked.  Fakira bit her lip as she looked away, unsure how to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be a good idea,\" Ted said, \"We can always change our path midway and the forest is at its widest between where we entered and the gate, so Lord William's men would have to go the farthest to  catch up with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't they be on those . . horses?\" Fakira asked, after recalling the correct word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but it would still take longer to go around the woods, rather than through,\" Ted said, \"That is, assuming the local faries don't turn you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of them,\" Felix said, \"I wonder why they helped us?\"  Fakira blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They helped you?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  You ran off so quickly, we couldn't keep up.  The suddenly we heard you crying like you were over there and we followed it for a while until we came to you,\" Ted said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is very strange,\" Fakira said, \"Perhaps they feared me and wanted you to get me out of the forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or they expected you to eat us,\" Ted noted.

Felix and Ted watched with interest, whens uddenly they heard a call from right behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such actions will not be needed young humans,\" came a female voice.  Ted and Felix turned around and saw a two fairies.  One was male and in a loincloth.  The other was female and she wore a pink dress.  The female had blood red hair and seemed looked like a young adult.  \"Would you have your Felaryan friend come down to a smaller size so you don't have to yell?\"  Ted and Felix glanced at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira!\" Felix called up to her.  Fakira looked down with minor annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to see if there are any fairies in the area,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some appeared all ready,\" Ted said.  Fakira focused on the small bugs next to her friends and saw tiny people.  Fakira was worried once more, for this peculiar behavior from the fairies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they want?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, so we don't have to continue yelling, would you shink to our size?\" Felix replied.  Fakira thought for a minute and shunk to just above Felix and Ted in height.  She figured if she was to protect them, she would still need to be bigger than them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Elder Telim said, \"I am Elder Telim and this is Dahil.\"  Dahil nodded at his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why did you help my friends find me?\" Fakira asked, looking at the small fairies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you three are different from any other traveler,\" Dahil said, \"We've never had a Ferlayan enter our home with human company and spare their lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wanted to see if it was a fluke she didn't eat us?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Dahil said, \"And if you were actually good humans, it is good to be on your good side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so Dahil informs me you might be heading to the great gate?\" Telim asked, noticing Fakira biting her lip.  \"Or are you worried about your clan's reaction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you know about Ferlayians?\" Felix asked.  Telim smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other elder fairies and I protect out home forest whenever a Frelayian should enter the woods with a desire to eat us,\" Telim said, \"I've met many and befriended some of those we defeated.  They told me about thier lives and world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we will help you cross the forest quickly and provide you with some enchantments,\" Dahil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of enchantments?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One that would make it so your quiver never runs out of arrows,\" Dahil replied, \"But . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's always a 'but',\" Ted noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that evil human lord is also our enemy.  And he is having many men attack the southern part of the woods to claim some trees there,\" Dahil said gravely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything special about them?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are the first trees that would become these woods.  They are over a thousand years old, filled with magical power concentrated beyond the levels of the flowers she fell into,\" Dahil said, pointing at Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's . . .not . . .good,\" Ted murmured, realizing how even a small staff made from a tree there would augment  Lord Williams' power greatly.  Fakira was grolwing, thinking of the disresepct the humans were showing to such old trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we ask you, will you help us defend our home?\" Telim asked firmly.  The three friends looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we will,\" Ted said, as none of them could bare to think what might happen if that evil man was successful.  Telim smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way, I will escort you,\" Dahil said, flying off in one direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will it take to get there?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDahil thought for a moment, \"We should reach there</span></div></div>",

She saw that if she were to try walking through in her eighty foot form, she might be caught up by some trees growing close together.  Her eyes went up to the canopy that was letting some light in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't I just fly everyone to the southern part of the forest?\" Fakira asked.  Telim shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she said, \"We elders watch sections of the woods to insure they are well protected.  The south is under Elder Luto's jurisdiction and he has made many enchantments to prevent any unwanted entry.  Only by his permission can you enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's a way to prevent even fairies of that area who might be captured from granting Lord William's men entry?\" Ted said.  Telim nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very smart human,\" Telim said, looking at Ted with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um so should we get going so we can help you?\" Felix suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that would be wise,\" Dalil said, \"Please follow me.\"  Dalil rose slightly and his body began to glow a little as he flew ahead of the the group, who was made to walk at a quick step to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group traveled late into the night, following the bright fairy until he stopped. Ted and Felix were thankful for this for they were tired from the constant running for most of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You run fast humans,\" Telim said, \"Most impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May we . . . May we rest for the night?\" Felix breathed out between heavy breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get there quickly,\" Dalil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it won't do you any good if we are too tired to help you,\" Ted noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let them rest,\" Telim said, \"I will go on ahead and get Luto's permission for them to enter.\"  Dahil nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will find you something to eat,\" Dalil said, flying into the woods.  Fakira looked around the small grove they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, mind moving back?\" she asked.  Ted and Felix looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Felix asked, exhaustion causing him and Ted to not think clearly at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to return to my normal height,\" Fakira said.  Ted and Felix nodded and moved away as Fakira rose to eighty feet.  She sat down on her butt as another boar ran through the area.  Quickly, she captured it and enlarged it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate it like their meal earlier that day.  And with their bellies filled, the boys fell asleep.  Fakira gently picked the boys up and held them against her belly before laying out on the ground as she too slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalil stayed awake and alert to prevent any other fairies from playing with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon was lowering itself to rest for the day when Dalil woke the sleeping Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ted asked, yawning.  He spotted the brightly lit fairy in front of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get ready to move,\" Dalil said.  Ted grumbled a little.  After a few nights of waking when he wanted to, being forced to wake was momentary reminder of Lord William's castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Ted said, before nudging Felix, who took a few minutes to wake as well.  Once he was awake, they set upon waking Fakira.  They freed themselves from the hands and walked towards her giant head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira!\" Felix called, causing the giantess to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix . . .\" Fakira mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira, Dalil wants us moving again,\" Ted chimed in.  The giantess fairy did not want to wake.  The smell of the ancient wood and sleeping peacefully reminded of her home and let her sleep peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\" Fakira asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Felix said.  He heard Fakira sigh as she rose upright and looked down at her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May we get some breakfast first?\" she asked, yawning still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already captured a beast for you,\" Dalil said to Ted, \"It's by her foot.\"  Ted pointed the bound boar out to Fakira and she grew it like before and Felix cooked the meat for himself and Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has Telim returned?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but by the time we reach Luto's domain, the barrier should let you in,\" Dalil said.  Ted nodded and finished his meat as Fakira shrunk to a height still taller than her friends.  Dahil smiled and they set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the southern part of the forest dark mages and soldiers continued to try and penetrate the barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!  Why won't this barrier break?\" one soldier asked, breathing deeply from his failed attempt at entry by one of the mages using a magic shield to try and get him in.  It failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the fairies are tapping into the power of the woods and making a barrier we never thought they'd make,\" one mage replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why I came to this place a head of schedule,\" came a voice from behind the two.  Both froze with fear and turned to see Lord William behind them.  And behind him, in the camp a ways behind them, several dead bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My-My lord,\" the mage started, \"We tried everything.\"  Lord William looked at him with uncaring dark eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everything.  I told you to break the barrier at any cost,\" Lord William said darkly, before shooting a small orb of darkness at the guard.  \"Get the bodies arranged over here in the form for the Darkill Ritual,\" Lord William commanded.  His mage servant nodded and rand, fearing he would be added to the ritual as this powerful rite could be used to penetrate even the strongest defense, provided enough bodies were used.  But unlike most magic, this rite was best done in darkness and he wondered if Lord William would wait that long.</span></div></div>",

I might need the spell's full strength to bring this wall down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lord William waited for nightfall, but he prepared all the things needed for the spell so they could preform it the second the sun was gone and the moon shone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalil lead the two humans and giant fairy to the village. It was around noontime now and they were close to the barrier. \"We're very close the the village,\" Dalil commented, \"You three are faster than I thought. We made excellent time.\" It was hard to keep up with a fairy. They zipped around much faster than a small bug. In all honesty, fairies were probably the fastest fliers around relative to the speed and size. Because of their small size, larger fliers could easily catch up, but if a fairy were their size, they could never be caught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dalil, why are there other fairies surrounding us?\" Fakira questioned. Dalil stopped and flew in midair, his wings beating like a hummingbird, while turning around to look at the three travelers. \"Dalil, I can sense other fairies in the trees ever since we started heading for your village,\" Fakira stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are my squad and we found the three of you together. They just following as a precaution,\" Dalil explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still worried that I would eat you,\" Fakira muttered, \"I understand, not too long ago I was just like my clan members. Eating people just because of their size difference. However, I am not like that anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalil flew over to Fakira and hovered in front of her face. \"I know you are not like that anymore, Fakira,\" Dalil assured her, \"I see how friendly you are to Felix and Ted and a can tell you're a good person. I know you wouldn't try eating us, it's only a precaution that something bad might happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalil then started fly off ahead of them. \"At least they can stop hiding. I know they're there,\" Fakira stated. With that statement, there were a few giggles form the tree and some fairies darted in front of the three new travelers, but then went back to hiding in the trees. They were too fast for Ted and Felix to see, like bugs zipping and buzzing around them. It was as if they had made a game out of it like they were trying to zip past them without being noticed or caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least they're not putting spells on us,\" Ted whispered to Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Dalil flew past the barrier, but Ted and Felix ran into it and were met by an invisible wall. They hit it hard enough to step back and fall on their butts. Fakira quickly crouched next to them and asked, \"You alright?\" They nodded and Fakira yelled, \"Why is the barrier still up? Surely she's told your elder about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Elder Telim is having troubles convincing Elder Luto,\" Dalil suggested as he flew back to Fakira, Ted, and Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you do now?\" Fakira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can only wait,\" Dalil told them, \"We're close to the village now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira sat down between Felix and Ted while Dalil landed on a large flower and sat a top of it. \"You fairies must be very light,\" Felix commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to worry about fat at least,\" Dalil replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix noticed the fairies that had followed them still stayed in the trees. \"They aren't going to come down, are they?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're still a little worried. Especially Solita,\" Dalil explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose Solita?\" Fakira asked, \"And why would she be more worried than the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say she has good reason to distrust humans,\" Dalil replied, not wanting to reveal her secret to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the Felaryan,\" they heard a voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all looked to the barrier and just behind it, hovering, were Elder Telim and Elder Luto. Luto actually looked like an old man with a full length white beard. Since fairies aged like elves, Luto must have been ancient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Fakira,\" Fakira introduced, \"And this is Felix and Ted, my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends, eh? Don't you mean supplies or pets or slaves?\" Elder Luto questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you have reason to distrust me because I'm a Felaryan and there was a time I used to see the definition of a person differently,\" Fakira replied, \"But I am like that no longer. I see the error of my definition. The size of a person can't be the only thing determining if the a person is a person or not. It should be what's on the inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They really are her friends,\" Elder Telim stood up for Fakira, \"Even when she's a giant, she treats them as equals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or it could all be an act and they're her slaves,\" Elder Luto suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could never make Felix and Ted my slaves, not when I was one myself,\" Fakira informed the elders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are very few cultures in Felarya that have slavery. How did you...?\" Elder Luto began to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord William captured me and tried to make me his slave. It was terrible, but I was only a slave for a few weeks. Felix and Ted were slaves for years,\" Fakira stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why you three are determined to help us and stop Lord William,\" Dalil interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is a terribly evil man and I would like nothing better than to see him stopped,\" Fakira growled, \"I can't let anyone else suffer like I had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you used to be like the other Felaryans, what changed you?\" Luto questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix and Ted did,\" Fakira answered, putting an arm on each of their shoulders, \"Ted taught me the real definition of a human and explained why size shouldn't be the determining factor. Felix was the kindest to me and never stopped being nice and helping me despite my wickedness towards him before. Both of them saved my life and helped me despite me possibly eating them if I grew. There were more reasons, but they are the main ones. They showed me the truth and I'm glad I met them, otherwise I'd still be the monster I was before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuto was examining Fakira closely, trying to find any lies, but there was on truth. Luto began to believe and said, \"I believe you, Fakira, and you may enter our village and help us rid us of the evil.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Fakira, Felix, and Ted were granted permission and was suddenly able to pass through the spell wall. They all headed towards the village. How would it react?</span></div></div>",

In a small grove where light once stood, twelve trees encircled it.  And on each tree were homes placed on them and strange glowing fungi, as there seemed to be no sunlight.

The Elders placed their hands on them and the objects glowed.  \"When you protect nature, it protects you.  In these woods, your string will not break and your quiver will never run empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Ted said, as the elders looked at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What magics do you know, young mage?\" Elder Telim asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a cutting spell and and how to conjure fire and levitate it from already existing source,\" Ted said, \"I seem to have an affinity with fire and cutting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wind and fire based,\" Elder Luto said, \"Impressive.  Not many have those anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will teach you some more spells that should suit you,\" Elder Telim said, \"This way.\"  Felix was hesitant for a second, then followed the Elder away from his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as for you Fakira,\" Elder Luto said, \"For your helping us, we give you . .  .\"</span></div></div>",

As Elder Luto hovered in mid air, he offered his own staff to Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira shook her head and said, \"I can't possibly accept that. It's that yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, child,\" Elder Luto, \"I have more of these at home. Take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira put her hand out with her palm facing upward right beneath Elder Luto. Elder Luto dropped the staff in Fakira's palm which looked littler than a twig to her. Soon, Fakira grew the staff so that it was the right size for a staff for her. Instantly, she felt the magic in the staff increase and inpower her. She had never felt so strong with magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The staff can act as a reserve and hold magic for you. So when you're low on magic, you can draw the magic from the staff to replenish your energy,\" Elder Luto explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if the staff reserves magic, how does the magic get stored in it. There got to be a way to put more magic in it when she uses some from it, right?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can put some of her own magic in the staff or she can just go in an ancient forest. If this staff is in an ancient forest that contain trees like the Twelve Trees, then magic from that forest will go in the staff till the staff is full,\" Elder Luto answered, \"Plus that staff increases Fakira's magical abilities and makes her stronger when she wields it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the reserves and the magical increase in my will grow as well if I grow the staff with me?\" Fakira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The magic and the magic it can store will increase in proportion to its size,\" Elder Luto informed Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I can use it to aim my spells by sending the spell through the staff. In case some spells need to be more accurate, I'd be able to aim with my staff,\" Fakira commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to know a lot about magical weapons,\" Elder Luto commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My grandfather uses a magical staff, because he's not as powerful as he used to be and needs the reserves of magic in the staff for most spells,\" Fakira explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How powerful did that staff make you?\" Ted asked Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel as though I'm as strong as my mother now with this staff,\" Fakira informed Ted, \"That's a big difference from what my magical powers used to be. If I become my giant size, I don't think even Lord William can defeat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must really trust her to give her such power,\" Ted said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen many Felaryan Fairies in my time, and none were like Fakira. She is very different from the others. I know I can trust her,\" Elder Luto explained. Ted and Fakira were still shocked that Elder Luto would give Fakira such power without even knowing her and Elder Luto continued to explain, \"I can look into people's hearts and find out their true intentions. I sense no evil plans coming from Fakira. I can tell that, despite our size difference, she sees everyone here as equals. I know I can trust her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once Elder Telim is done teaching Felix the spells, we we have to start formulating a plan to stop this invasion,\" Elder Luto informed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, night fell and Lord William preformed his dark magic. There was a pile of about fifteen men, no big deal when he had more than enough soldiers to attack some little fairies. Lord William stood in front of the pile and began the incantation. After many minutes, blood squirted out of the bodies and solidified into long red tentacles. The men behind Lord William were scared of the tentacles which only made Lord William laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tentacles morphed together to make two very large tentacles. Then, Lord William lifted both of his arms, having full control of the two blood tentacles. Lord William stared at the spell wall made by the fairies and slammed both his hands downwards. The tentacles repeated Lord William's actions and shattered the fairy wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon, I will be the strongest sorcerer in the land, and there is no one that can stop me,\" Lord William muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Lord William go in the forest with his troops?</span></div></div>",

He chuckled as he entered, feeling the power radiating from inside the forest.  He knew each platoon of men had a mage to help lead them to the desired location.  He moved in with an arrogant stride, embracing the darkness around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind him, a bright full moon began its rise that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers and mages moved carefully into the woods.  They had not seen any fairies as of yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think we scared them off?\" one soldier asked, grinning.  But before the mage could respond, they had come upon a large pack of wolves.  On some wolves stood fairies, who were smiling.  They spoke in some strange tongue the humans could not understand and the wolves attacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So other creatures of the forest are aiding you as well?\" Ted asked as Dalil led the three friends to fight.  Dalil's platoon of fairies were following them from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Dalil said, \"We normally try and avoid the wolves or bears as they try to kill us but even they understand what would happen if the evil man succeeds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And our mission is to take on Lord William himself?\" Felix asked, fear evident in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three are the most capable next to the elders to face such a monster,\" Dalil said, looking at Felix, \"The protection spells Talim told you are strong and will help you protect yourself and your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with this staff, I will be more than able to fight against him,\" Fakira said, smiling.  Felix looked at Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.  Let's get going,\" Felix said with more confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William walked over the corpses of his fallen men when he heard growling come around him.  He saw bears appear with small fairies near them.  Before the bears could react, Lord William short a dark energy, killing the lead bear, enraging the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such pathetic creatures,\" Lord William muttered as the bears swarmed around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look humans!\" one soldier called, seeing Felix, Ted, and Fakira.  The three moved to hide behind some trees as arrows flew at them.  Dalil seethed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those arrows are hurting the trees,\" he seethed.  He rose to go attack, wen Fakira put her hand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make them small enough to even the fight,\" Fakira said, coming out from behind the tree.  She focused on her shrinking spell and pushed it through her staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix and Ted watched as the soldiers grew smaller and smaller, and at the same time, sadistic chuckles and giggles came from their fairy guards before they flew off to torment the human soldiers before killing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you could shrink Lord William?\" Ted asked Fakira when she returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is powerful but I'm sure of it,\" Fakira said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fakira peeked around the tree and could see Lord William, but he was on the other side of the clearing and many soldiers and fairies were in between Lord William and the squad ordered to defeat Lord William. Fakira could also see Lord William mercilessly killing anyone and any creature that tried to attack him. None of the small fairies of the animals could withstand the evil magic coursing through Lord William's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odd thing that Fakira noticed while she stared was that Lord William wasn't getting tired from his magic. In fact, he even had enough strength to fight with his sword as well as his magic. This worried Fakira a little, because it almost seemed as though Lord William's magic was endless, he wasn't loosing as much energy as he should have from the terribly powerful spells he was casting. <i>\"Where is he getting his energy from?\"</i> Fakira wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira got her magic from her wings which absorb magic from the air, and since the rate of magic that flowed into her wings varied depending on if she was in a magical place or not, made it so that the magic in her wings were not endless. There always had to be a limit to the amount of magic one could do, otherwise, if their wasn't, that magic user would be a god. Focusing back on the task at hand, Fakira examined Lord William and what he was wearing. Fakira couldn't see or sense any magical charm on him which meant Lord William must have been drawing magic like all other magic humans. This meant that he should be drawing magic from his life force. Many magical creatures had to do that, but it was much more dangerous for a human to have to do that. Humans were weaker creatures and had the tendency to not know what spells would be to demanding and end up being drained of life from a spell. Humans weren't meant to use magic, but sometimes, something unnatural does occur granting a human magical blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lord William wasn't getting tired from drawing from his life force and strength. <i>\"He's just either a strong human or just has a large inner magical storage,\"</i> Fakira tried to assure herself, <i>\"He still won't be a match for me. I'm a Felaryan Fairy and he's only a small human.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the plan?\" Felix openly asked the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix's question caused Fakira to snap out of her deep thoughts and replied, \"We fight our way to him and kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it? That's your plan?\" Ted questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can take him,\" Fakira tried to assure Ted, \"We have seven fairies in Dalil's squad, a mage, an archer, and a Felaryan Fairy. We're more than enough to defeat him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know what he's capable of. We shouldn't be underestimating him,\" Ted said, \"It's best we sneak up to him and catch him by surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The longer we take, the more fairies and animals will die,\" Fakira argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalil flew between Fakira and Ted and interrupted, \"I understand both of your points, but Fakira, are you completely positive you can defeat Lord William?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I'm more powerful than, and even if he is more powerful than I think he is, I can always grow myself to my giant height. My magic's intensity increases at the same rate as my body. Things much smaller than me will be far weaker than me, even Lord William,\" Fakira assured the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes sense that you'd be more powerful than him as a giant fairy. if we can't defeat him when you're human sized, we'll surely be able to when you're a giantess,\" Dalil agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It still might be better for us to sneak up on Lord William, just in case,\" Ted suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your concern, Ted, but I think we can do this. Look, there is a gap in the fighting over there and the soldiers are too engrossed in the battle,\" Fakira pointed out, \"We can get through that quickly and get to Lord William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed only sighed and replied, \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira lead the group with Felix and then Ted behind her. The fairies in Dalil's squad flew all around Fakira, Felix, and Ted and stayed close. The only one that didn't stay as close was Solita who still didn't trust the humans, even though she learned that the humans and the Felarian had been slaves to Lord William and had every intention of helping the fairies and killing Lord William once and for all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group rushed through the widest gap in the battle. Fakira was right about the soldiers being too engrossed in battle. The fairies they were fighting were tricky beings and flew around the soldiers while annoying them and hexing them. Most soldiers were to busy swinging wildly in the air to try and hit the darting fairies, but very few could achieve that task and most hit one of their own men. Many of the fairies found this amusing, especially Solita who hated the humans for trying to destroy their home. Solita even stopped to watch the human soldiers die, she was too engrossed that she didn't see a human behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solita!\" one of the fairies from Dalil's squad cried out, causing the other fairies of the squad and the three humans sized beings to stop and turn around. Solita snapped out of her trance and turned to see a sword swinging at her. Solita tried to dodge, but the sword got a head start on her. She dodged it mostly, but part of one of her wings was chipped off, making it much harder to fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed, being the closest to Solita at that moment, fired an arrow at the man, making direct contact with his neck. Instead of drawing another arrow, Ted rushed forward to Solita. She was barely able to hover in the air and would soon plummet to the ground. Luckily, just as she started falling, Ted made it to her and caught her in the palm of his hand. Solita was truly and utterly surprised by the human's action. She had thought she was going to die, but a human, of all creatures, saved her life. Solita was in too much shock and disbelief that she couldn't think of anything to say. She just sat in the human's hand and stared up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Is your wing hurt?\" Ted questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita only nodded as she stared up at the giant. Ted quickly made it back to the group with Solita in his hand. Dalil quickly landed in Ted's hand as well and examined Solita. \"Solita, what were you thinking?\" Dalil demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita didn't answer Dalil's question but only muttered, \"The human... saved me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalil could tell that she was shocked by the fact a human had saved her. She had lost her parents to bratty human teens that attacked the fairy village just because the fairies were smaller than them. Solita had never seen human kindness and was young when she saw her parents die such a brutal death. The teenagers had captured Solita and her parents, ripped their wings off and squished her parents before her eyes. Then they forced Solita to lead them to the fairy village. It was a horrible experience and easily traumatized her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalil examined Solita's wing and called up to Felix, \"Can you heal her wing?\" Felix nodded and healed her wing without much any troubles. Dalil took to the air and Solita was hesitant in doing so, but eventually did and stayed closer to the group, especially the human that saved her life, Ted.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the group pushed on, the distance between them and the dark lord was decreasing.  But suddenly a large wolf fell in their path.  Or better to say part of a large wolf, as the lifeless head looked at the humans and fairies.  Fakira let out a growl and saw a human with a bloody sword near the wolf's body.  The man saw the group and glared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" Fakira breathed out, her body shaking with anger.  Ted and Felix easily saw her contained rage.  Fakira did not blink as she stared at the man, memories of her capture threatened to over take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira looked at the strange world around her.  She had never seen it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must have gone through a portal,\" Fakira muttered, smiling knowing she'd find some fun prey in this world. Fakira decided to look around to new world to find the prey and she shrunk down to human sized. Her mother had told Fakira how fun it was to shrink down and trick humans who didn't know of a Felaryan fairy's ability to shrink things. The humans who didn't know would willingly go up to her mother only to be shrunken or her mother would grow and they would fall victim. Fakira's mother had told Fakira in great detail how fun it was to play with prey before swallowing them whole and letting them die a slow and painful death by the stomach acids while they tickled the inside of her stomach with their useless pounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Fakira shrank down to a human child size to be able to sneak around and find prey easier since they would just run if they saw a eighty foot tall fairy walking around, but as she began walking, she felt something strike her wings.  Turning around, she saw her wings were mostly cut from her.  \"What the?!  Who did this to me!?\" Fakira bellowed.  Her eyes darted around but failed to see a net fly at her from behind her, forcing her to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira was starting to get scared and she had reason to do so. her wings were injured, meaning she couldn't use her size changing magic on herself. Whenever a Felaryan fairy's wings were injured, they were stuck that size till it was healed. The creatures that attacked her must have known this and waited for her to shrink so they could keep her at a manageable size. They must have known that just simply harming her wings wouldn't make her shrink. They knew what a Felaryan fairy was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is one impressive beast,\" came a voice.  Fakira turned her head just enough to see the man. It was a human. Humans had captured her. Fakira was furious for letting such weak beings capture her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful it still has wings,\" came another, unseen voice, \"You better remove them.\"  General Ethan chuckled darkly and kicked Fakira in the gut several times before reaching into the net and cutting off the rest of her wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastard!\" Fakira screamed, trying to rise, only to be slammed into the ground by General Ethan's boot, knocking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you did survive,\" the General Ethan said, stepping over the wolf's carcass.  \"That's a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that man?\" Dahil asked Ted as he saw a mage join this man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"General Ethan,\" Ted said, recalling it was he who brought Fakira into Lord William's castle and the newcomer was probably the second most powerful mage in the castle as well.  \"And the other man is Damien.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think they mean to kill us,\" the mage Damien said darkly, raising a staff and pointing at the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The slaves are mine, you handle the fairy,\" Ethan said walking slowly towards the group.  But as he approached, he saw Felix move his hand like trying to cut him.  He almost laughed it off when he saw his armor was deeply cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He knows magic?\" Damien muttered, just barely defending from an arrow aiming for his head.  \"Impressive to cut enchanted armor so easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Ethan said, backing away slightly, rethinking how to attack.  His eyes darted to Fakira, who had not moved, except to continue trembling with rage.  \"Let's work together.\"  Damien nodded, deflecting another arrow easily.  He focused his magic on Ethan's sword.  The evil general slashed his sword at the group releasing a torrent of lighting.  But before it could strike, Felix used his own protection spell to block it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That boy knows some strong magic,\" Damien murmured, not liking the fact a slave in a short time could block one of his strongest attacks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>General Ethan and Damien had most of their focus on Felix. They could not believe that a former slave actually learned how to use magic efficiently enough. It was a shock to both of them and because Fakira wasn't attacking at that moment, they forgot about her and focused on the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien casted a spell on General Ethan's sword. The spell caused a strange glow around the blade. Felix figured that the glow made the blade stronger and more deadly. Felix placed a protective spell on his short blade and was able to lift his sword up horizontally just in time to block General Ethan's downward swing. The blow was strong and it caused Felix to fall on one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, it would have caused Felix to fall on the ground completely since General Ethan was a grown man and Felix was only a ten year old boy. Plus, Felix's sword might have more than likely broken since he had a short blade and General Ethan had a claymore. However, Felix had a protective magic on his sword and he was lucky to have the elements of fire and wind. Mages could only have two elements and there were many different combinations that could be had. Not only does the elements tell what spells a mages can use when it came to conjuring and certain ability spells dealing with those elements, but it also changed some of the spells that could be cast with any combination of elements. For example, protective spells could be used no matter what element, but those elements change the effects. Since Felix had a fire and wind combination. The protective spell also made the blade stronger and faster which meant it increased Felix's abilities of speed and strength. This gave Felix a chance to fight General Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Damien was a much more experienced mage and had a stronger spell which was making General Ethan's spell stronger. Felix's protection spell wasn't going to last as long if the sword was going to be constantly bombarded. Ted quickly realized this and decided to make the match more even. Ted fired an arrow at the mage which caused the mage to put up a shield, blocking him from the arrow. Ted kept shooting arrows, causing Damien to have to use two spells, the one for General Ethan and the one for himself. Because he had to focus on two spells, General Ethan's spell became weaker and he was more even with Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the spells were more equal, General Ethan was a much more experienced sword fighter. General Ethan knew more moves and knew how to predict the enemy, while Felix didn't know any of those things and had to focus on blocking. The only thing that was helping him was his faster speed. Fakira noticed that Felix was having troubles fending off General Ethan, and if she didn't do anything, Felix was more than likely going to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Ethan and Felix's swords collided and each tried to push the other away. Ethan noticed that Felix's strength was about the same because of the spell, but General Ethan thought of a plan. General Ethan kicked Felix's legs out from under him. Felix fell on his back on the ground and just had enough time to block Ethan's sword as he was on the ground. General Ethan put all his weight on his attack. Felix's sword wasn't budging, but General Ethan kicked Felix's side and the sword pushed down closer to Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore General Ethan could cut Felix, he noticed that Felix seemed to be getting bigger. General Ethan was confused and looked around. Everything was getting bigger... no, he was shrinking. General Ethan remembered the blasted Felaryan fairy. General Ethan panicked and charged at Fakira. This only caused Fakira to focus on her magic more and he shrunk to three inches tall before he could reach her ankle. Fakira smiled down at the tiny man wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien focused all his energy to try and protect General Ethan, but Dalil and his squad swooped down and buzzed around him. Damien tried to swat the pestering fairies and while he was distracted, Ted was able to shoot an arrow in Damien's chest, killing the mage. Meanwhile, Fakira bent down to pick up the little man. General Ethan became scared and panicked. He slashed at the large approaching fingers, but Fakira was still able to grab General Ethan. Fakira licked her lips and thought about eating General Ethan. The stomach acids of a Felaryan Fairy could digest any magical object and even if General Ethan were to be a mage, which he wasn't, no spell could harm the inside of a Felaryan Fairy's stomach. The lining was impenetrable to magic. Even though the human would be delicious and the man was evil enough to deserve it. She didn't think Ted or Felix would mind her eating him since she would only eat evil beings. However, Fakira still felt as though it was wrong to eat a person despite them being evil... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a strange moment  when the whole world  around a person was chaotic but to that person and her friends, life was still as a stone on the earth.  This was what Fakira felt as she held General Eathen's body in her hands.  He was going to die by her actions.  This she knew and desired so much.  Part of her mouth was watering from just recalling what a nice taste humans had.  Part of her was even wondering if this one would taste better than the boss thief.  But as she brought the small body to her, her hand began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If I eat him, I would be a monster. . . .  But he's evil! He deserves it. . . .  But Ted thinks it is evil to eat people.  If I eat him, I'd be evil as well . . .You're just taking revenge!  There is nothing worse than devouring him!  Making him know what he'd become to you! . .  .  But that doesn't make it right.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira bit her lip and with her free hand, she grabbed the human's head and pulled it off.  Some of the fairies, not Dalil or Solita, laughed at how she killed them.  Ted moved close to Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't eat him,\" Ted said, his tone not one of surprise or relief, more like stating the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I . . . couldn't . . . . If I did, I'd be like him . . .\" Fakira mumbled, \"I couldn't be that monster and still be with you and Felix.\"  Ted gave Fakira a comforting shoulder rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was breathing hard, regaining his strength from his fight with the now dead general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix,\" Dalil said, flying to him, \"Open your mouth.\"    Felix opened and Dahil's small hand threw some petals into Felix and he felt revived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Petals of the type of flower that healed Fakira's wings,\" Dalil said, \"They have revived you and will give you a boost of magical energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank y . . .\" Felix said as he saw a dark shadow flying at the shaken Fakira.  Feeling the new surge of energy, Felix swung his sword at the energy releasing a wave that the attack would bounce off of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ted looked up, he saw a strange black mass coming towards Fakira, he tried to pull her away but then saw a slash of white strike the darkness and both flew off in different directions.  Ted looked to where the black mass came from and saw Lord William.  His eyes were shifting between  where Felix was and where they stood planted.  As Ted looked at Felix, he saw the young boy filled with a deep rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You killed one of my best friends!\" Felix shouted, \"You won't live to see dawn <i>Lord</i> William.\"  Lord William, however just growled, quickly contemplating who to strike next.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fakira opened her eyes and saw that she was lying on the ground on her stomach. Fakira slowly pushed off the ground till she was on her hands and knees. Fakira felt dizzy when she did this and rubbed her forehead with her fingers while shaking her head slowly and gently. She could still hear the battle around her raging on and when she felt that her head was ready, she looked up and looked around the large clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked around, she remembered that Lord William had casted the death spell towards her, but Ted pushed her out of the way. Fakira expected to see Ted beside her, but there was no sign of him. Not seeing him worried her. He should have been lying by her, but he was no where to be found. (She had no idea that he was forced in the opposite direction as her.) A terrible thought emerged in her brain. <i>\"Wh-what if the blast hit Ted? What if he pushed me out of the way, but died instead?\"</i> Fakira thought, <i>\"He... he saved my life and, he died for it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira was beginning to shed tears, but she quickly shook her head and thought, <i>\"Get a hold of yourself, Fakira. You don't know what happened to Ted. He might have not got hit by the spell and he could still be alive. Don't loose hope.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira heard Lord William's voice and she hissed his name as she turned to look at him. Her eyes came upon Felix and Lord William. Felix had tried to fight Lord William by himself, and now, Felix was in much trouble. Fakira made no hesitations. She had to save her friends. Her friends were the only ones keeping her happy, the one helping her so she didn't become the monster she once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was overpowered with rage and wasn't thinking clearly. His rage and desire to kill Lord William controlled his actions. Felix was slashing wildly with his sword which was creating cutting spells directed at Lord William. However, Lord William just continued to back step as he conjured defensive spells. Felix's cutting spells were just being deflected. Lord William smiled as the slave was overpowered with anger and becoming more predictable by the second. Felix wasn't going to stand a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William timed Felix's attacks since they were at a constant rate. Lord William was able to perfectly time the amount of time between the attacks and lifted his hand in between Felix's attacks. Felix's arms were lifted to attack, but when he tried moving his hands forward, his arms stopped in mid attack. Felix tried using all his strength, but his arms wouldn't budge. \"Stupid slave, how dare you defy me,\" Lord William growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your slave anymore!\" Felix yelled defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William placed his other arm where the first was positioned and them pulled them apart from each other. This caused Felix's arms to move without his control. The went to Felix's sides like the shape of a cross. \"You're right, you're no longer my slave,\" Lord William stated coldly, \"I have no use for dead slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William twisted one of his hands and one of the bones of Felix's left air snapped and emerged from under his skin. Felix screamed in shear pain. Lord William only laughed as Felix wreathed in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Lord William sensed something wrong and looked in a direction. Fakira was standing and aiming her staff at Lord William, ready to shrink him. Lord William whipped his arms around causing Felix to fly in between Lord William and Fakira. Instead of hitting Lord William with the spell, Felix was hit and he shrank down to a mear three inches and continued to fly through the air. \"Felix!\" Fakira cried out, rushing to catch him before he could fall to his death. However, Lord William swiped his hand and Fakira was tossed backwards into a tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira was surprised by the blow and when she hit the tree, she lost sight of Felix. Fakira frantically looked around, but Felix was so small now and the battle was too large to see something as small as Felix who would be the size as one of the small fairies now. \"No!\" Fakira panicked. For the second time in the battle, she believed she had lost a dear friend. She thought that both of her friends were now dead. She felt just as miserable as she did when she was a prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William laughed at Fakira's misery. Fakira glared at the puny human who was laughing at her. <i>\"How dare that little human laugh at me. He's only a miserable bug compared to me. He's the insignificant one. I will crush him,\"</i> Fakira hissed as her old self came back to her in the anger and anguish she felt inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira aimed her staff to shrink Lord William down to the size he deserved to be. \"He won't seem so powerful and in charge now,\" Fakira thought as she casted the spell, <i>\"he will finally feel they way his slave do. He will now know what its like to feel helpless and be at the mercy of everyone else.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William held out his hand with his palm facing her. Fakira's shrinking spell was an invisible spell that was impossible to block, not because it was invisible, but because it was a strong and natural ability of the Felaryan Fairies and with her wings, the shrink was was as instant as the snap of ones finger. However, something strange happened. A black shield formed around Lord William and Fakira's spell turned white and ricocheted off the shield. \"Wh-what?\" Fakira gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found a stronger source of magic after you escaped. I don't need you anymore,\" Lord William informed Fakira, \"I've become even more powerful than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't!\" Fakira hissed, \"No human can be as powerful as me. I'm larger than any human!\" Fakira slowly grew and the battle became dead silence as Fakira did this. Everyone backed away making sure Fakira had enough room to grow without squishing them in the process of her growth. \"I'm the one larger than you. You are just a bug to compared to me. You should the the slave. I might just make you my slave and you will finally understand the feelings of all those you stepped on and diminished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira was ninety feet tall and she was pissed out of her mind. Her magic had now increased relative to her growth and there was no way something as small as a human had the power to stop her now. Yet, Lord William still smiled confidently. Fakira growled and slammed her foot on the ground shaking the Earth around the clearing, causing many to fall on their asses. But Lord William still stayed motionless and fearless. Fakira approached Lord William, making sure to slam her foot with each footfall. Soon, She was close enough to Lord William that he was only a few feet from her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira crouched down sitting on her heels while her feet were still planted on the ground. \"Not so powerful now, are you little bug?\" Fakira smiled wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William only smiled back and pushed his heads outward. Fakira suddenly felt a strong force push against her chest and she was sent backward against one of the large trees, bending the tree and nearly causing it to snap inwards where it would have hit her head. Fakira was in utter shock and dismay. Lord William still seemed normal as if it didn't take much of his energy at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira finally became frightened. \"What's the matter?\" Lord William asked, \"Not so high and mighty now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Fakira felt herself shrinking and her power draining from her. She soon realized that Lord William was taking her energy, but it still didn't explain the shrinking. <i>\"Is he a power taker?\"</i> Fakira wondered. However, Lord William didn't seem like that type of wizard and she didn't feel her powers being taken or borrowed, just her energy. This meant he had the ability to size change without her help, or at least the power to change others. <i>\"Is this the new power he talked about obtaining after I left? But how can this be? The only beings that can shrink and grew themselves or others are Felaryan and even those are limited to fairies, succubi and incubi, very few humans that keep their size as giants because it's the only way to be safe, and possibly angels and some nekos. Lord William is not a Felaryan. He doesn't look like one,\"</i> Fakira thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Fakira could think of an answer, she was human sized again and Lord William used the cutting spell to chop off her wings in order to keep her that size till the wings healed. \"That's what's wrong with you Felaryans,\" Lord William stated, <i>\"You judge things by their size and nothing else.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William was about to fire his death spell when an arrow hit his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed had been trying to fire an arrow at Lord William ever since Felix was in trouble. However, before he could save Felix's arm from breaking with a well placed arrow, Ted noticed movement to his right and heard a stick snap. Ted turned his head around just in time to see a sword swinging at his head. Ted ducked and aimed the arrow at the man's stomach as he ducked. Felix fired the arrow and the soldier stumbled backwards, but continued to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed didn't have enough time to put another arrow in his bow, and just used to bow to block the sword. Ted was glad the bow didn't break. Ted belted the soldier in  the side of the head while blocking the sword. The soldier's helmet fell off and the man growled in anger. The soldier tripped Ted and Ted fell on his back. A sword soon followed. Ted rolled out of the way and the sword went into the ground. Ted pulled out the knife the fairies gave him strapped to his leg. Ted stabbed the soldier where the knee cap connected with the soldier's thigh bone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldier screamed and fell backwards. Ted picked up his bow and aimed an arrow at Lord William who had now thrown a human sized Fakira to a tree. Ted was tackled and the arrow flew in a different direction. The soldier began choking Ted Ted wasn't strong enough to loosen the soldier's grip and he tried reaching for an arrow in his quiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Earth shook and the soldier and Ted saw Fakira as a giantess. The soldier was shocked by the huge and intimidating giant Felaryan Fairy who was hissing and growling at Lord William. Ted was able to get an arrow out and stab the soldier in the neck. When he removed the arrow, blood squirted on Ted before the soldier grasped his neck, fell on the ground, and choked on his blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed aimed an arrow at Lord William after seeing Fakira pushed against a tree, shrunk, and became wingless. Ted fired an arrow in Lord William's back. Lord William took a step forward from the impact of the arrow, but he didn't fall or looked all that hurt. Lord William took out the arrow and only looked at it. Lord William turned to Ted and an arrow collided into Lord William's black heart. Lord William looked down at the arrow in his heart. He slowly took it out and laughed. The demented man actually laughed and wasn't injured by the two arrows at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as though nothing would stop Lord William. Suddenly, Lord William put his hands on his head and screamed. Black smoke began to surround his body along with all his men. Him and his soldiers were screaming. Black fire engulfed them as well and they all burst into flames. There were no ashes and no remains. They were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the fairies cheered, thinking they had just defeated Lord William, but Ted and Fakira weren't too sure about William being dead. Ted rushed over to Fakira who was crying. Ted knelt beside Fakira and questioned, \"Fakira, are you hurt what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see where Felix went?\" Fakira cried, fearing the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what happened?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to shrink Lord William, but that evil man used Felix as a shield and threw him. I lost him. If he ended up hitting the ground then he would have...\" Fakira began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry we'll find him and...\" Ted tried to assure Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, Ted,\" Dalil congratulated as he flew towards him, \"Did you use poison arrows to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't. My arrows had no effect on him,\" Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did he...?\" Dalil began to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dalil, where is Felix?\" Fakira questioned desperately.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Dalil had seen where Felix was thrown and was able to catch him. Felix was in a tree branch with Solita watching over him at the moment. Fakira wanted to see Felix right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Dalil didn't see what happened to Felix and Fakira started frantically looking for her injured and shrunken friend.</span></div></div>",

Dalil pointed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he was so small and unable to fly, we put him far above the battle,\" Dalil said, \"Solita is watching him to make sure he doesn't roll off the branch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he badly hurt?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, his body is drained from his enraged attack on that man,\" Dalil said as another member of his squad went up to retrieve Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think Felix could get that angry,\" Fakira murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We lost some friends to that man during our time enslaved by that man,\" Ted replied, \"Felix kept everything inside of him and when he saw William once more, he knew he wasn't a weak slave and let his anger out.\"  Fakira nodded.  Nothing else was said until Felix was brought back down.  Gently Solita and another fairy placed the little Felix in Fakira's hands.  Slowly tears came to Fakira's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Felix, for shrinking you,\" Fakira said, \"I could have hurt you so badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Felix said, looking up at Fakira, \"It was a good thing you did.  I was out of control and needed to calm down.\"  Fakira smiled weakly.  \"So what happened with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Fakira replied, \"One moment he was draining my magic and then he threw me away.  Next thing I know he was destroyed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw him throw Fakira away and after killing one of his men with an arrow, I fired it into his back and then he turned and I got his heart with another arrow.

She nodded and looked to Luto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what caused it?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that man was a power absorber, and he was giving some of the energy to his men, then when he was hit with the arrows,\" Luto said,</span></div></div>",

He seemed to be very capable in choosing whose life force and magic he wanted to absorb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are times with one loses control of the magic inside whether its due to emotions, like Felix has demonstrated or due to a great injury,\" Elder Luto explained, \"Ted had hit Lord William in the heart. His body must of reacted and activated the magic to take energy, but the body cause Lord William to absorb himself and his soldiers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic isn't natural for humans,\" Fakira added, \"It is easier for humans to lose control of the magic inside them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though doesn't it seem too convenient that he absorbed himself and his men?\" Ted questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good fortune,\" Elder Luto replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For some reason, I can't feel easy about this. There is something fishy about what had just happened. When he turned around and looked at me, he laughed and seemed confident. Shooting him in the heart didn't seem to affect him,\" Ted informed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand Ted's uneasiness,\" Fakira spoke up, \"I too feel uneasy about what Lord William could do. He was able to shrink me with magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord William seemed to be an absorber. Could it be possible that he just took your power and used it to shrink you?\" Elder Telim tried to assure Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When an absorber attacks me, I can usually tell whether they were taking my power or just my magic energy and life force. I didn't feel him sharing my power. I only felt him taking my energy and life force,\" Fakira informed them, \"It seemed like he had that shrinking power already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't size changing magic strictly a Felaryan power?\" Elder Telim question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what concerns me. Only Felaryans can size change and that ability only comes natural to fairies, demons, and angels. Some humans can gain that power and we call them giants since they stay giant sized to survive the hostility towards smaller being in that realm. Size changing is a rare gift for a human,\" Fakira explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though there is no need to worry about that man any more. He's dead as well as his army. The forest is safe from him,\" Elder Luto stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're right,\" Ted muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you going to grow me back to normal?\" Felix asked up at the giantess whose cupped hands he was in. Felix sat up, but hissed a little from the pain in his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Fakira asked in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my arm's healed, but it still hurts and will still hurt for a while,\" Felix explained, \"So, could you grow me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think it would be best that Felix stays that size and that you and Ted shrink, Fakira. Our village must celebrate this victory and we shall feast and celebrate through most of the remainder of the night. The three of you should partake. The celebration is mostly for the three of you for stopping that evil lord,\" Elder Luto <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The celebration is for us?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You three are heroes. Of course the celebration is for you. Even more so because you are two humans and a Felaryan fairy, two creatures that are usually destroying and killing us,\" Elder Telim replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I am to shrink Ted and I down, I need to get my wings healed first,\" Fakira stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it because you can't change your size without your wings?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and if I were to shrink Ted down now, it would only be temporary,\" Fakira told Felix, \"With my wings, size changing is permanent until another size changing spell happens. Without my wings, I don't have enough magic to make the change permanent and it becomes temporary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's way you don't shrink if your wings get cut off, even if you're a giant,\" Felix pointed out, \"That's why Lord William had to shrink you down first and just draining your energy wouldn't have shrunk you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira nodded and asked the hovering fairies, \"Where's another grove of those flowers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William's throne room was empty. The large room was vast and silent and none of the patrols were in the room at that moment. Suddenly, a flame emerged on the throne room floor about the same size as a candle flame. The flame was on a large rug that stretched down the length of the throne room, but it didn't cause the rug to burn. Then more candle sized flames emerged in the room, some on the long rug and some on the stone tiled floor. The flames then increased in size while still retaining the same shape of a candle flame. The first flame that had appeared grew to the size of a human and stopped growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man was thrown head first out of the flame. The man was flipped in the air and landed on his back. The man's face was covered by his long black hair and he stayed on the ground, catching his breath and trying to recover from the shear pain he had experienced. The man slowly sat up, brushing his hair away from his eyes. The man could hear other men falling onto the ground. Some making a clang when their metal armor hit the stone tiled part of the floor. The black haired man stood up and brushed the ash away from his black clothing. None of him was burnt, but ashes were on his clothing. He watched as his flame disappeared and watched soldiers being thrown out of their flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne soldier came up to the black haired man. The soldier was clutching his stomach and was breathing heavily. The soldier asked, \"My Lord, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were taken from the battle,\" Lord William informed his soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you teleport us out?\" the soldier questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't me who brought us out of battle,\" Lord William stated as the soldier fell to his knees, still clutching his stomach. Lord William had brought only a fraction of his army; only about a hundred of his men. Now, there were only about fifty men left. These men haded been teleported before and their body wasn't accustomed to the effects. <i>\"These men will probably be sick for few weeks. Luckily, I still have an entire army under my control,\"</i> Lord William thought, <i>\"But before I can do anything else, I must find out why she tore us away from the battlefield.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William left the throne room and walked to his room. Lord William closed the door of his room with a sign on the outside of it to dissuade anyone from barging in. Lord William even latched the door for good measure. Though the men he ruled didn't know what Lord William did in his room when he was alone and they didn't know about her, they knew that disturbing Lord William would be a grave mistake. Lord William approached his bed, the only way to contact her was to fall asleep and let her enter his dreams. It may seem to be a risk letting someone in his dreams since they could make his dream happen in reality as well, meaning if he was killed in the dream, he'd die in real life. However, Lord William knew that he was safe with her and that she wouldn't kill him. She was the only person he really trusted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William cleared his mind of all his thoughts to fall asleep faster. Before long, he was dreaming. It was clear to him that she wanted to talk to him after she pulled a stunt like pulling him and his men out of battle Lord William thought he was winning. Lord William found himself in the same place she usually took him in when their dreams were connected. Lord William was in the middle of a vast and thick amazon like jungle, but the jungle trees taller than any tree Lord William had ever seen and he knew why they were, he was in a Felaryan jungle. Lord William sat on the fallen log as usual and waited for her to arrive. She usually waited a bit before appearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Lord William heard a familiar voice call out, \"William, I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William turned around and saw her. Her name was Sanya and she was the most beautiful woman Lord William had ever seen. Sanya's body was slim and could be considered perfect through many people's eyes. She had long and amazing legs, a flat stomach, and large but not dramatically large breasts that were just right for her build. Her face was young and sexy with ruby colored eyes, a petite nose, and luscious red lips. Her hair was black and shoulder length with many dark red strand of hair scattered throughout. Sanya, as always, was naked letting Lord William see her extraordinary body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanya also wasn't a human. In fact, she was a Felaryan demoness, a succubus to be exact, and with being a demoness, she had two bat-like wings coming from her shoulder blades that were folded up at the moment, two horns upon her head, and a long black tail with the traditional triangle-like tip at the end. She was also the size of a human. Even with all these things, Sanya was still a very beautiful creature to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you must be angry with me but...\" Sanya started to say to try and calm William down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Lord William stood from the log and interrupted, \"You teleported me and my men out of a battle for no reason at all. We were winning and you pulled us out. Why wouldn't I be angry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"William, I...\" Sanya tried to say in a calm voice, but her emotions were starting to get the better of her, a mixture of anger, worry, and sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill approaching the succubus, Lord William continued, \"Why did you do this? You ruined my plan to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it because you nearly died!\" Sanya cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William fell silent when he heard her words. She had pulled him out because she was worried about him. Lord William willed himself to calm down as he noticed Sanya's eyes were slightly watery. In a more calm and assuring voice, Lord William told Sanya, \"I was fine Sanya. That arrow missed my heart. All I had to do was heal myself with the energy around me. With the absorbing power you gave me, I am nearly unstoppable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The key word is nearly,\" Sanya growled in an upset, but not angry voice, \"If that arrow would have hit your heart, you wouldn't have enough time to heal yourself. You can still be killed if something pierces a vital organ. You wouldn't have time to use magic then. I was worried about you William. You could have died and I would... I don't know what I would do without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand your worry,\" Lord William admitted, \"I shouldn't stay mad at you for looking out for my well being. Come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanya embraced William and William returned the favor. Sanya placed her head upon Lord William's chest while her arms wrapped around his waist. William placed his hands on her back avoiding the folded wings. \"I don't know what I would do without you either,\" Lord William informed her, \"So I know why you worry. The magical bond between us really did bind our minds, bodies, and souls. Honestly, I never thought I'd be able to fall in love, until I met you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you in the forest anyway?\" Sanya questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to take the magic from the old trees,\" Lord William informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep looking for more magical power?\" Sanya questioned while looking up at him, \"You gained my powers from the bond. That alone makes you stronger than any human out there and could even keep some Felaryans at bay. Why do you have the need to become stronger? I'm all you need. Once we figure out the right portal needed to bring me to your world. I can help you conquer and protect you for all eternity. I'm all the power you'll ever need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I want to have more magic. It's just that I want to find a way to grow myself,\" Lord William explained, \"We both know this isn't your normal height and the only way you can shrink is in dreams. You showed me how large you really are and when I was around your gigantic form, I felt so insignificant compared to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you shouldn't feel that way. We are bond magically. We are equals and I see you as such. It doesn't matter how much bigger I am compared to you. I love you, William, and I'd love you for all eternity,\" Sanya assured him, \"When I enter your world, I will help you conquer the world, because no army could possibly stand against my wrath and nothing will stand in the way of my love's desires for I will make my love's desires true. Your world will see me as their goddess and be forced to worship me, and you will be my husband and be considered their god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or they'll see you as a goddess and me as some high priest instead of a god,\" Lord William sighed, \"Our size is very different from each other and it makes me feel as though I have no right to be your equal and only a miserable worshiper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And would would be wrong with you being a worshiper and me a Goddess?\" Sanya stated, \"You'd be the exception from the other worshipers and from you, all I'd ask for is your love. As long as you love me, I will be a compassionate and caring goddess towards you, William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William actually smiled a little at the thought and kissed the succubus in his arms. When the kiss ended, Sanya said, \"Now, please don't do anything that reckless again.\"</span></div></div>",

Ted was walking near her, watching the small Felix sit on Fakira's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" came a voice in his ear.  Ted looked to see Solita flying near his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just this has been a really long week.  Not too long ago I was a slave to that monster who attacked this forest,\" Ted said, \"Now I'm free and have befriended fairies, both of this world and a Felaryan.  It's just something I never thought I'd do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you earned both friendships,\" Solita said, \"You put your lives at risk for us and you helped Fakira see what it means to be a person.\"  She held her breath for a moment.  \"Ted, do you mind if I sit on your shoulder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Ted said, \"Are you still tired from the attack on you earlier?\"  Solita blushed a little from Ted's concern and shook her head before landing on Ted's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed quickly when the heroes returned to the village.

She then looked to Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, ready to be small?\" she asked Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I trust you,\" Ted said, as Solita flew off his shoulder and landed near his feet, ready to help him around.  Fakira raised her hands and Ted quickly shrunk in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Ted said, looking at the truly gigantic forest now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is very pretty, isn't?\" Solita said from behind him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Ted turned around to see Solita, he was surprised to see that she was actually a head taller than him as that moment. Well, it did make sense, Ted was only thirteen and Solita had the body of a seventeen year old girl. Though Solita was most likely much older than seventeen since fairies aged like elves. The only difference between elf and fairy aging is that Elves stop aging like a human when they're about eighteen and fairies stop aging like a human when they reach ten years old. Elves and fairies age as humans do in their first years of life so it doesn't take a century or so to bring them into adulthood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny way, Solita was a head taller than Ted. This was because Fakira didn't shrink Ted down to three inches, but shrank him down where a three inch fairy (an adult fairy) would seem as tall as an adult to Ted. So basically, Ted about as tall as a fairy with the body of a thirteen year old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing that surprised Ted was what Solita looked like. Solita had been small the other times Ted looked at her and he was unable to get that good off a look in order to see Solita's look. No that he was fairy sized, Ted could see Solita well like he would any other human. Solita was a beautiful girl, like nearly every fairy out there, Solita had a normal body for the age her body represented. She wasn't too skinny or fat, but a she had a slim body that was slightly thicker relative to Fakira. Solita had long legs that were only covered by a skirt made from nature. The only other clothing her and the other female fairies was a bra which covered decent sized breasts. Solita had black hair that reached only her shoulders and her bangs, if not put back, cover her eyes. Solita had her bangs away from her face which was beautiful like the faces an elf should have. Solita's eyes were also a jade colored green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita noticed Ted surprised and was worried about Ted surprise. Actually, Solita was worried about her looks. Though Solita was prettier than any human, she wasn't by far one of the prettiest of the fairy. Solita was teased a lot when she was younger by her looks as well as her desire to be a loner. Ever since her parents death, this human, Ted, was the only one she wanted to be close to. Solita was even having a hard time fathoming it. Solita's parents had been killed by humans and Ted was a human. Now, Solita was finding herself trusting these two humans and the Felaryan. She also wanted to get closer to Ted, probably because he had saved her life. She couldn't believe this was actually happening to her, just the other day, she hated humans and thought she would never find a trustworthy one, but she couldn't help herself with wanting to get to know the kind human that had saved her life without wanting repayment. Since she wanted to get closer to Ted, she was worried about her looks, since she was teased long ago, and she thought he gasped because he thought of her as ugly. \"Is something wrong?\" Solita questioned with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed was surprised to hear such worry in Solita's voice. Ted remembered how surprised he was when he first laid eyes on her after being shrunken, and Ted could only imagine what Solita could possibly think of reasons why he would be so surprised when seeing her. In order to assure Solita that nothing was wrong, Ted informed her, \"When I was human sized, it's harder for me to see you fairies close enough and I can't see the finer details. Now that I'm small and smaller than you, in fact, I can see the details I never imagined you were so beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita blushed slightly at the complement and Ted couldn't believe he was flirting with a fairy, but he was telling the truth to Solita, at least. Ted couldn't help but feel attracted to this particular fairy. Solita also couldn't believe that the first complement given to her in years actually came from a human, the species she used to hate and distrust with a passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita and Ted were saved from any awkwardness that they might have felt from the conversation when Felix walked over to Ted's side and asked, \"So, what's it like being small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed turned his head to see Felix beside him. Ted saw that Fakira had shrunk Felix enough to seem like he was the same height he was usually compared to Ted. \"This shrinking definitely puts the world in a very different perspective,\" Ted answered as he looked around again in awe. The giant world around looked different and alien to Ted now that he was a different size. <i>\"Who would have thought that changing my size would seem to drastically change the world around me,\"</i> Ted thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was scared too when Fakira shrunk me for the first time,\" Felix admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that I'm scared,\" Ted replied defensively, \"I just said this size change brings a much different perspective to this world. I admit that having everything around me gigantic does make me seem helpless and but a extremely small part of this world, but I'm among friends that I am safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that was so when I was first shrunk. When I was first shrunk I had to convince Fakira from eating me,\" Felix stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix and Ted turned to see Fakira shrink down. They thought that Fakira would shrink down but keep herself larger than the fairy adult to make sure she could help Ted and Felix if trouble should arise. However, Fakira shrank down till she was about the size of a ten year old fairy which actually made her about an inch or two smaller than Felix. \"She actually made herself smaller than us,\" Felix gasped slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must finally be trusting people. She's come a long way,\" Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all have,\" Felix added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira began approaching the small group on the ground and as she approached she looked around the forest with both amazement and fear in her expression. \"So, this is what it feels like to be small. This is what the world looks like for a tiny,\" Fakira said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tiny? Is that what you call us?\" Felix questioned. He didn't really take offense by Fakira's comment, but decided to tease her about it. They had become close friends and Felix had nothing to worry about with Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira blushed a little realizing that her comment had been said aloud instead of in her head. Before Fakira could explain that tinies were something else entirely, Ted explained, \"Tinies are a species in Felarya. They are creatures that are about three inches tall as an adult and consist of miniature humans, elves, and nekos. Because they are the littlest of creatures in Felarya, they are the most vulnerable, because even though humans are treated like food to the top predators, some humans, elves, and nekos also eat tinies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, even Felaryan humans can be monsters,\" Felix remarked in disgust, \"You would think that they would see the wrongness of eating people since they have to worry about being eaten themselves. Instead, they too eat smaller beings just because their smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felarya is a much different world than ours where people are judged by size. There are tinies in our world, but they are rare since they are eaten by animals. Fairies of our world are hunted by animals too, but tinies are rarely able to use magic,\" Ted informed the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalil, Elder Telim, and Elder Luto all landed on the ground near the group. \"Where is this celebration being held?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where all our ceremonies are held in the center tree,\" Elder Luto informed them. All the fairies lived in the eldest trees of the forest. Those trees circled around the largest and oldest tree in the forest. The fairies homes carved into the trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how are we going to...\" Ted began to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is an entrance at the bottom of the center tree,\" Elder Telim told them, \"Sometimes when there are birds flying around, its safer to use the entrances at the base of the trees rather than flying. Now come with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seven of them walked to the center tree and entered through a hole at the base of the tree. The tree was gigantic by human standards and now that the travelers were shrunken, the tree looked impossibly huge. \"It reminds me of the Giant Tree I've heard stories about where that blonde naga tends to hang around,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Crisis?\" Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know of her?\" Fakira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father once traveled to Felarya once, never wanted to go back there again,\" Ted answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I ever want to go back there either,\" Fakira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the group was in a large room with many tables that could fit in all the fairies of the village. The tree and all the other old trees had been carved out and made into buildings on the inside with floors, stairs, and rooms. Yet, the trees were somehow still alive. Before anyone could ask why the trees could possibly be alive, many fairies swarmed over to the group. All of them wanted to greet Felix, Ted, and Fakira and thank them for their help. Neither of the three ever had so much attention on them and it was strange for them to be greeted and thanked by so many people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please step back,\" Elder Luto ordered the crowd, \"Don't crowd them. He'll have a chance to meet them later. Just sit back down in your seats.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd dispersed and began sitting back down in the large tables. Elder Telim turned to Felix, Ted and Fakira and told them, \"The tree of you may sit with Dalil and his squad. Help yourselves to whatever food you wish to have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix, Ted, and Fakira sat with Dalil and his squad and they all ate and talked. Occasionally, other fairies came to introduce themselves to the newcomers. Once dinner was done, Elder Luto stood up and silence came upon the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElder Luto spoke, \"For centuries, we have been protecting this forest from those who wish to destroy it and we have dealt with such intruders who wished to cut down the forest and replace it with a town. It is our home and the magic that resides in this forest needs to be kept preserved. It was only recently that a new evil emerged and came to this forest to actually came for these trees and take the magic from it. We have been battling his men for a long time and lost fairies in the struggle. But today, we were given three heroes who have defeated the evil man for good. Tonight, this celebration is dedicated to these three heroes and all those who have fought and died for the downfall of the evil man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that small speech, there was many cheers and clapping. The tables disappeared and music began to play, causing the fairies to start dancing and celebrating the downfall of Lord William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Sometime during the celebration, Solita wishes to speak to Ted alone and they go somewhere quite to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: After the celebrations, they show the heroes to their rooms where they can spend the night.</span></div></div>",

There was only one bowl on the table and they were served right after the other.  \"I don't taste any mint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, what do you think is in it?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An apple-type fruit,\" Felix replied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't taste any apples in it,\" Ted replied \"Switch?\"   Felix nodded and both took a sip from the other's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't taste any apples in yours Felix,\" Ted said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there was no mint in yours,\" Felix replied.  Solita and Fakira, who had been silent while watching the two drink both giggled at their confussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sould we tell them?\" Fakira asked.  Solita grinned and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a magical drink,\" Solita said, \"It can alter its flavor to what the drinker likes best.\"  Ted's mouth opened in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, my parents told me about this sort of drink, but I never thought I would have some,\" Ted said, taking another sip.  \"Really amazing stuff.\"  Solita smiled and was about to speak when the music changed to a high energy sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, may I have this dance?\" Fakira asked, looking at her friend.  Felix blushed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to dance,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on,\" Solita said, \"Half the fairies are just moving in tune with the music.  That's what we see as dancing.\"  Felix bit his lip and finally nodded.  He took Fakira's hand and they went to the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to dance Solita?\" Ted asked, looking up at her.  Her face went flush and looked a little bit aways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was hoping to speak with you in a more quite local,\" Solita admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good,\" Ted said, \"Lead the way.\"  Solita smiled and took Ted by the hand and lead him out of the great hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other end of the room sitting above the others, Elders Telim and Luto sat watching the festivites and the three heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I received word the other elders wish to meet the humans and Fakira for what they did,\" Telim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't surprise me,\" Elder Luto answered, \"It's also interesting to see what's going on with those two pairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Fakira and Felix, that is really no surprise,\" Elder Telim said, \"But to see Solita so close to Ted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is truly is amazing,\" Elder Luto said, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a branch above the hall, Ted and Solita sat, enjoying the night air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Ted said, after taking some time to enjoy the view, \"What did you want to ask me?\"  Solita's face was still red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a home you're heading to?\" Solita asked softly.  Out of the corner of her eye, she watched Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my parents are dead. Felix and I were just taking Fakira to the gate, or at least that was our original plan before she saw us as people,\" Ted said.  Solita nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know, after what you did for us, you'd be more than welcome to stay in the forest, or at least travel through it without trouble,\" Solita said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this forest is really beyond imagination,\" Ted said, taking a breath in, \"From any size at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you choose to stay, I can show you a lot of the fun places,\" Solita said, scooting close to Ted.  This caused Ted to look up at a higher angle to keep eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking me to stay here and live with you?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not necessarily with me, but in the village I live in,\" Solita said, \"I don't want my first human friend to leave so quickly.\"  Ted nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that,\" Ted said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Solita asked, blushing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calling me your friend.  For a long time, I had so few friends,\" Ted said, before his face darkened, \"And most were killed by that man.  So, thanks for calling me your friend.\"  Solita looked deep into Ted's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted, you saved my life and showed me that not all humans are monsters,\" Solita said, softly, \"Of course you're my friend.\"  Ted's face softened and broke into a smile, before yawning from fatigue.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Tired?\" Solita asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little. It's pretty late now,\" Ted admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a spare bed in my home, and it's near here. Much closer than the room they might put you in. You could come with me to my home and sleep in my spare bed,\" Solita suggested. Solita didn't mean to say it. It was something that just somehow slipped out of her mouth. It wasn't that she didn't want him to sleep closer to her. It's just that she was a fairy and he was a human. He was still young and she was much, much older than she looked. She shouldn't be having intimate feelings for the human because they were different species, far apart in age difference, and barely knew each other. Solita turned her head away, believing fearing rejection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed was surprised by what the fairy had suggested. <i>\"Is she implying what I think she is? Does she like me more than a friend?\"</i> Ted wondered, <i>\"She's very pretty and seems nice, but I hardly know her. Plus, I have no idea how old she is. I'm almost fourteen and she looks like she's seventeen, but she's a fairy and is definitely much older than that. Why would she even be attracted to me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed saw how she turned her head away, fearing he'd say no. Ted sighed in his mind, <i>\"This fairy seemed to have gone through more troubles than the rest. I can't hurt her feelings, not after just becoming friends,\"</i> \"I wouldn't mind, and I accept your offer,\" Ted replied. Ted thought quietly to himself, <i>\"As long as she doesn't make any more advances.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita's face lite up with excitement and joy as she turned to look back down at Ted. \"R-really?\" Solita asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm pretty tired and if your home is closer, I don't mind sleeping at a friend's house,\" Ted informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita smiled warmly down at Ted as she got up to her feet. Solita held her hand out to Ted and said, \"Come, it's this way.\" Ted took Solita's hand and she lead him across the branch to the trunk of the tree. Ted was glad that Solita had prefect balance on the branch and that she was holding his hand. They may have been small and the branch pretty large, but it was still no where near a flat surface. Solita lead Ted to her room, which was on the same floor as they were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached it fairly quickly and Solita opened the door and invited Ted in. Ted walked in and found that her home looked like any other home, except all the furniture was wooden, with cushions on them of course, and looked like they had been carved from the floor. Ted approached the nearest furniture, which was a chair, and examined it. The chair was anchored into the floor and it looked like the entire home was carved out to include the furniture. \"It must have taken much craftsmanship to be able to make this home,\" Ted commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only negative thing about it is that you can't ever move the furniture if you want it somewhere else,\" Solita replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right about that,\" Ted chuckled a little, \"But it is still a very nice home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my parents' home,\" Solita informed Ted, \"After they died, I just stayed here.\" Solita sat down on a bench with cushions like a couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about your parents,\" Ted apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to apologize. It wasn't you that killed them. It was some nasty, demented, brats that called themselves humans,\" Solita growled starting with the word nasty. Then taking a sadder tone, Solita recalled, \"My parents were in the forest alone. They were celebrating their anniversary together. Some young nasty humans found them and cornered them. My parents tried to make peace with them, but the humans only saw them as bugs they could mess with. They tore my parents apart, piece by piece, like when a person torments a bug they've caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awful,\" Ted gasped at the horror, \"No one deserves such a death.\" He was having troubles picturing a human being able to do that. He knew that he could never do something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw the whole thing,\" Solita admitted, \"I followed them and wanted to surprise them, but the humans caught them. I couldn't help even if I wanted to or else I would have died to. But I watched the whole thing. After that point, I thought all humans were cruel, heartless, sadistic monsters that couldn't be trusted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Ted sat down next to Solita on the couch. \"That was until I met you and Felix,\" Solita said with tears in her eyes as she turned to face Ted, \"After what you and Felix did for us and after you saved my life, I realized that not all humans are evil. I was just unfortunate to encounter some of the evil ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed couldn't let himself watch the fairy be so sad. Ted placed his hand on her bare shoulder (Fairies only wore enough clothing to cover up their private areas including the breasts for females, but it's still only a bra that strapped around the neck, due to the wings, and a skirt.) Ted tried to comfort her by rubbing her shoulder. \"I'm glad I met you, Ted,\" Solita said before she turned and warped her arms around Ted. As she embraced him, she cried on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed was slow to react at first, he was kind of shocked that such a beautiful person was hugging him. Ted soon placed his hands on her lower back since it was the only way to avoid her wings and he patted and caressed her back till she was clam. Once Solita was calm, Solita stopped the hug and said, \"Thanks, Ted, for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" Ted replied. Solita told Ted to follow her and she showed him to her parents room. \"Are you sure you're okay with me sleeping here?\" Ted questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Who better to be the first to sleep in this bed than my first human friend who has saved my life?\" Solita asked back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ted got into the bed, he noticed that there was a bow and arrows hung on the wall. Solita followed his gaze and informed him, \"That was my father's. He was a great hunter. He even once took down a bear with poisonous arrows. The fairies were able to preserve the meat and we ate for about a month. You could have that if you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't possibly...\" Ted started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bow you have isn't that good. I was told that you obtained that bow from bandits, right? An archer like you needs a better bow,\" Solita insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much, Solita. it will be an honor to carry such a bow,\" Ted replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad, good night, Ted,\" Solita said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Solita,\" Ted replied. Solita closed his door and slept in her own room while Ted slept in her parents' bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira, next time we dance, let's not fly while dancing. It was bad enough I didn't know how to dance, I also can't fly,\" Felix told Fakira as they were led to their room by Elder Telim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the other fairies were dancing in the air at that point, I thought it might be fun,\" Fakira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was scary was what it was,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is you're room,\" Elder Telim pointed, \"Each room has two beds and we were going to put Ted and Felix in one room and Fakira in the other, but since Ted is with Solita at the moment, you two can sleep in the same room, unless you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind,\" Felix told Telim and Fakira said at the exact same moment as Felix, \"I would like share a room with Felix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you two can share a room, and don't worry about Ted too much. Solita's a nice girl. I'm sure he'll be fine,\" Elder Telim assured them before she left. Fakira and Felix entered the room which was just like the room of an inn, but everything was carved out to include the furniture, like Solita's. The room was only one room and there were two beds. Felix approached one bed and Fakira approached a window and looked out it. \"I still can't believe how little I allowed myself to be. The world looks so beautiful and yet so dangerous as well,\" Fakira stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are talking about going to see my mother to at least say good bye to her and tell her I'll be safe,\" Fakira said, \"Then I will go see her. You and Ted may come along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what?\" Felix asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll come back to this world if we can since that world will be dangerous for you and Ted, but I'd have to bring you two along because if I weren't able to come back here, I wouldn't be able to live without you two,\" Fakira informed Felix, \"We might as well stay in this forest. We don't have to stay with the fairies, but we could stay in these woods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a pretty good plan,\" Felix told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also,\" Fakira continued, \"I think that after I see my mother and come back here, I will make my self the size I am now for a while and have you and Ted normal sized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be willing to be small around us?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that in order to never have eating a person ever cross my mind, I must make myself the size of a tiny to be able to see through their eyes and see what it's like in their world. That way if the thought of eating a person ever crosses my mind, I'd remember what it was like being small and how my fate was in the hands of others,\" Fakira informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is what you want to do, than that is what we'll do,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think right now we should get some sleep,\" Fakira said as she got in her bed, \"Good night, Felix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Fakira,\" Felix replied. </span></div></div>",

As the sun's rays touched upon the canopy of trees, those in the village woke slowly.In their guest room, Felix and Fakira heard a soft ringing noise and woke to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Felix asked, looking to see what had been a lamp the previous night was now ringing gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice wake up,\" Fakira said, smiling, looking at Felix, \"Shall we find Ted?\"  Felix nodded and got out of bed.  The pair then departed from their room and went to search for their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bedroom Ted was in, he received a similar wake up and as he slipped out of the bed, Solita opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're awake,\" she said smiling down at Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that ringing noise woke me.  What is it?\" Ted asked, as Solita held the door for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a charm to let us know when dawn has come,\" Solita said, watching Ted walk over to the bow and quiver.  With great honor and benevolence, Ted removed the weapon from its honored spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this quiver have a similar enchantment to my old one had?\" Ted asked, examining the bow in greater detail, seeing runes etched on the shaft.  Solita nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and there are other enchantments to it as well,\" Solita said, \"But first, why don't we have some breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if we find Felix and Fakira first?\" Ted asked, looking up at the fairy.  Her head was turned away from him for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not,\" Solita replied.  \"<i>Why was I stung when he said he didn't want to eat alone with just me?</i>\" she wondered as she lead Ted out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for Solita and Ted to find his companions and the four made their way back to the hall, where breakfast was usually served.  Dalil was waiting for them as they entered and informed them Elders Luto and Telim were waiting for them at the far table, all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Ted asked, Solita, noticing her apprehension as they walked towards the Elders' table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just an honor to be invited to the High Table, for a fairy like me I mean,\" Solita said.  Ted blinked for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, considering what I know about you, it's no surprise really,\" Ted replied, before kicking himself in his head for flirting with Solita once more.  Solita blushed lightly at the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip passed with no more talk as they sat down and were served fresh fruits and more of the juice from the previous night.  The Elders were already eating when the group arrived and finished about the same time as the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are your plans for today?\" Elder Telim asked, looking at the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were planning on continuing our way through the woods,\" Fakira said, \"I want to return to see my mother.\"  Both Elders took this information with mild interest.  Solita's eyes widened a little with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And will you be staying in Felarya?\" Elder Luto asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Fakira said, \"I plan on telling my mother I cannot live the Felarian life and tell her I'll be safe in this world.\"  Both Elders nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then?\" Elder Luto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have anything concrete after that,\" Felix spoke up, \"We were hoping to be able to stay in or near this forest.\"  Solita breathed a breath of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering your actions, that would be easy to arrange,\" Elder Telim said, \"On the matter of traveling through the forest, though, you should know the other Elders do wish to meet you for your actions and bravery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Elder Telim?\" Solita said, catching her Elder's eye, \"If they are to be journeying through the woods, then I would like to join them as they traveled.\"  This comment was no surprise to either Elder, but appeared to take it in consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why do you request such task?\" Elder Luto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the other fairies on patrol do not harm them first, not knowing who they are,\" Solita responded quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a wise plan,\" Elder Luto replied, \"However the final say lies with them.\"  Elder Luto looked to the guests of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no trouble with me,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither,\" Felix replied.  Solita's eyes then turned to Ted and held her breath as their eyes met over the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no problems with it,\" Ted replied, smiling.  Solita smiled as well, while Felix turned to Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira, will you be staying small as we walk through the woods?\" Felix asked, recalling their talk the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make us human size while we travel,\" Fakira reminded Felix, \"I said I'd remain tiny only after we meet my mother.\"  Felix nodded as the others took the info in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What would it be like to be human size with Ted?</i>\" thought Solita as she glanced at her human friend.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Solita thought of how exciting it would be to be a giantess. Well, a giantess to fairies. She thought that it might be fun and an interesting change in perspective like Ted's experience with turning small. Solita thought it would be worth a try becoming human size, but before she could ask Fakira, she thought of something else. <i>\"Though I'm going on this journey to be closer to Ted, on the record, I'm going with them to help them meet the other fairy villages and making sure they aren't attacked by fairies on their journey to the dimensional gate on the opposite edge of the forest,\"</i> Solita thought, <i>\"If I have Fakira make me human sized, the fairies might think I'm a Felaryan fairy as well and might not recognize me. At least if I'm fairy sized, the others might recognize me easier.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm going to have to stay fairy sized at least until they get to the edge of the forest,\"</i> Solita decided, <i>\"It might be a more dangerous journey for me due to giant animals, but I'm sure three human sized friends can keep me safe. This also might give me the excuse for sitting on Ted's shoulder again.\"</i> Solita blushed slightly for even thinking about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe again wondered why she was so attracted to Ted. He was a human and a giant compared to her species. And though she only look slightly older than him, she was much older due to the different lifespans of humans and fairies. Those two factors alone would convince a normal fairy from being attracted to a human. Yet, she still had feelings for Ted. Maybe it was because he was so cute and a very kind person. He had saved her life and was the only person who truly cared about her. Sure Dalil was like an older brother to her, but there was something about Ted's care that made things seem different. There was just something about him. It was as if he had all the right qualities she wanted in a man. It's a little unfortunate that all those qualities were put into a human, but that wasn't stopping Solita from falling in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen breakfast was finished, all the fairies left the safety of the old trees and were out in the clearing. Felix, Fakira, Ted, and Solita all stood next to each other and the fairies were all saying their farewells and goodbyes to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elders approached the group. Elder Luto looked upon the three heroes and said, \"You three are great heroes. You have saved us from the evil Lord William and protected the forest when there was no real reason to do so. You could have minded your own business and not cared what happened to us. But the virtue in your hearts kept you from just leaving us to our fates. Here are two humans and a Felaryan fairy. Proof that not all of your species are cruel and careless creatures. You have proven that there are still trustworthy people beyond this forest and you have given us hope when we had previously thought no outsiders could be trusted. Thank you for everything you have done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElder Luto bowed his head and Felix, Fakira, and Ted replied by bowing as well. Elder Telim then added, \"The three of you have proven to be trustworthy friends of the fairies and you can come back to this forest when ever you desire. You are forever welcome in this forest and in our hearts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. That is very hospitable of you,\" Fakira replied, glad to have another place where she could belong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany fairies stepped up to the group giving goodbyes and thank yous. After Dalil said his goodbyes to Felix, Fakira, and Ted, he approached Solita and asked, \"You sure you want to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure. I feel as if it is the right thing to do. I can't quiet explain it, but I just feel like I have to do this,\" Solita informed Dalil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Destiny doesn't like to explain itself. It only tells people what they should do,\" Dalil replied, \"Well, when you come back, or if you come back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean if?\" Solita questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you never really felt as though you fit in with us,\" Dalil replied. That was an understatement. Ever since her parents' deaths, she had felt as though she was completely alone. \"If you decide you belong with them, then it would be alright to pursue that belonging. You must do what you think is right for yourself. Only you can decide what is best for you, not anyone else. But if you come back, we'll save your spot in the squad for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Dalil,\" Solita thanked. Dalil had been like an older brother to her. A person who looked out for her and kept her on a straight path. He was a good friend and that was as far as both of them wanted the relationship to go. Solita hugged Dalil and said goodbye to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDalil patted her back and added, \"Just watch yourself out there. It's a dangerous world out there for a fairy to be alone. Just stay close to Fakira, Felix, or Ted and they will keep you safe. I'm sure you don't need to be reminded all the animals that would love to capture a fairy for a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will always stay close to at least one of them,\" Solita promised, \"Don't worry about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the hug finished and Solita turned to the others, Fakira asked, \"Solita, would you want to grow human sized with all of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should stick with my normal size,\" Solita answered, \"The other fairies might think I'm a Felaryan fairy as well and may not recognize me if I'm human sized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira nodded and then turned to all the surrounding fairies. \"You all might want to step back and give us some room. I don't want our growing bodies to accidentally crush you,\" Fakira suffested to the fairies. The fairies, including Solita, took to the air and waited for Fakira, Felix, and Ted to grow. Eventually, all three of then grew back to their human size and Fakira made herself around the same size as Felix, making Ted the tallest of the three. When they all felt ready to leave, they waved a final goodbye to the fairy village and walked off with Solita flying near them and giving them the directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were a good distance from the village, Solita flew over to one of Ted's ears and asked, \"Could I sit on your shoulder again? We're far from any fairy village and wild animals would like to nab me if I'm too far a head of you guys. It would be safer if I'm very close to one of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, go a head and sit,\" Ted whispered back. Solita gladly complied and sat on Ted's right shoulder, continuing to give them directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you didn't want to become a giant again, Fakira?\" Felix asked, \"It would be a faster journey to the gate if you were a giantess and carried us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no real hurry in getting there fast,\" Fakira informed Felix, \"Lord William is a threat no more and we don't really know how we're going to open the gate when we get there. It takes someone who is gifted with a strong dimensional magic to open the gate, and none of us are proficient in that type of magic. Besides, the other villages on the way want to meet us and arriving as a eighty foot fairy will scare many people.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Felix agreed, \"It probably is best that you're human sized.\"  </span></div></div>",

With Solita aiding them, the three larger beings were directed around harder to trek areas.  And through out it all, changes were happening in their thoughts towards another in their group.  Felix and Fakira were walking very close to each other and Felix would regularly help Fakira over some more uneven ground, even when it was not needed.  Solita similarly would point out the best path for Ted to walk, while rarely leaving his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now the four were crossing the shallows of the great river that passed through the old forest, a path once again shown to them by their fairy guide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solita, are you all right?\" Ted asked, once they had crossed the waters, \"You seem tense now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On this side of the river lay some of the animals who regularly hunt fairies for food,\" Solita said, \"We are also in Elder Sheeka's domain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of elder is she like?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is wise, like the other elders,\" Solita said, \"She is also the one who guards the great river from ways of attack by evil humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what Elder Telim said, we ought to expect her to see us or send an envoy to ask us to come with them to meet her,\" Ted recalled.  Solita nodded when she suddenly saw Ted gasp in shock.  She felt a light prick in her chest and looked to see small fairy arrows in Ted's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted!\" Felix called before he was struck with the arrows as well.   Solita felt Ted's large body begin to waiver and started to fly just as the boys collapsed on the ground.  Solita looked around with hateful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the names of Elders Telim and Luto, I order you to show yourselves!\" Solita bellowed as Fakira knelt over Felix.  From two branches above them, two fairies appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?  Who are you?!\" one patrolman called out.  Solita looked up at the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am from Solita of Elder Telim's guards.  I am escorting the ones who helped save our forest through the woods!\" Solita shouted back.  Both guards exchanged glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No humans would help us!\" the other called down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet she speaks the truth,\" came a cold harsh voice, causing Fakira to look around.  Something magically strong was coming towards them when she saw a pale blue-haired fairy appear before Solita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elder Sheeka,\" Solita said, bowing her head.  The Elder looked up at her guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were told to alert me if any humans came across the river,\" Elder Sheeka said, \"You ignored my orders and in your ignorance injured two humans who have Elder Luto's respect.  Stay where you are until I'm done with them.\"  She closed her blue eyes and looked to Fakira.  \"I am sorry for that attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, can you tell me why they won't wake up?\" Fakira asked, holding Felix in her arms.  The Elder hovered over to the arrows and pulled them out.  She sniffed the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ester berry juice and . . . Opine grass,\" she saidm \"It's a sleeping potion we use on larger beings.  Only a small dose is needed to make them sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For how long?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given the number each took was only four,\" Elder Sheeka said, \"I would estimate . . .</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Traveling to the dimensional gate normally would have taken about a week in a half to reach, provided that fairies weren't making the travelers walk in circles. However, it took closer to two weeks for the four to get to the other end of the forest. This was because of the fairy villages they came across. The fairies weren't purposely diverting their paths with magic like they would do to most strangers. They just wanted to met the supposed saviors of the forest. They all wanted to met Felix and Ted, and they especially wanted to meet Fakira. The fairy rarely met Felaryans and when they did meet Felaryans, no matter if the Felaryan was a human, fairy, or other species, the Felaryans tended to eat the fairies and not care that fairies were sentient beings. So upon hearing news that there was a Felaryan fairy that actually regarded regular fairies as people and not food, they just had to see it for themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNews had spread throughout the entire forest rapidly. So, none of the fairies attacked when they saw two humans, a giant fairy, and normal sized fairy traveling together. When ever the four travelers were close to a village, the village invited them to stay the day in this forest. Since there was no real hurry to get to the dimensional gate, the group was happy to accept the hospitality of the fairies and had to shrink down to fairy size to stay in the villages. This is the main reason it took longer to get to the other side of the forest, but none of the travelers complained. Solita was happy since she got to spend more time with Ted, and Fakira wasn't too fond of seeing her mother to soon. Sure, she wanted to see her mother, but she wasn't looking forward to what would have to be said. Felix liked the fairies' hospitality and making more friends and Ted was happy to learn more about their culture. So, each of the four had a good reason for taking their time. Especially since they would be heading for the dangerous world of Felarya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their destination was getting closer, the group asked the fairies to see if they knew anyway to use the dimensional gate. However, none of the fairies, not even the elders, knew of a way other than dimensional magic. The only problem was that none of the fairies they had encountered had such magic. Dimensional magic was a very rare gift to have for all species. The only creatures that naturally had such magic were Dimensional dragon, also known as Silver dragons, but each world only had one of those dragons at a time and they bonded to the first sentient creature they see when they're hatched. Such creatures were hard to come by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when they finally reached the edge of the forest, they still didn't know how they were going to open the dimensional gate and control where it would take them. Nightfall was coming upon them when they reached the edge of the forest. They set up camp and started the fire at the edge of the forest. They kept the camp in the forest, though their flame come probably be seen from outside the forest. All four sat close to each other, but Felix sat closer to Fakira and Solita sat on Ted's shoulder. Her excuse was the same as the other nights that they weren't in a fairy village. There were dangerous creatures in the forest at night and being three inches tall and wanting to stay three inches tall she needed to be close to one of them. That was a true excuse, but she could have stuck close to any one of them, and choose Ted. All four of them knew Solita was developing a fondness for Ted, even though she hadn't outwardly admitted such feelings for him. Everyone else also knew Felix and Fakira were developing a relationship as well, even though both told everyone that they were just friends constantly. At the back of Fakira's and Felix's minds, they knew that they were developing feelings for each other. Though they kept hiding it from their selves and trying to keep such feelings back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first glance, it was a night like any other after dinner. The group just huddled around a fire, thinking about their next moves, thinking about what the next day would drag along with it. \"So,\" Felix spoke up wanting to end the silence as well as putting forth the most pressing matter of all, \"We have no idea what we're going to do about opening the dimensional gate, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have found no way of opening it,\" Ted answered, \"Unless we can find a way to do so, we won't be able to do what we've come here to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix turned to Fakira. She was very quiet. She grew more and more quiet the closer they got to the edge of the forest. \"We can back out if you want,\" Felix informed Fakira, he knew how Fakira didn't want to go back home. He knew how uncomfortable she was getting with the thought of the day she'd confront her mother getting closer. Fakira was worried about the place she grew up in, and how it raised her to be a terrible monster. She now know how cruel that world really was, and she didn't want to get trapped there. She also didn't want her new friends being trapped in the cruel world along with her since it would be the most dangerous place for them to live. Her mind was a whirlwind of worries as the days were drawing closer. \"If there is no way of getting back to Felarya, then it's alright to back out,\" Felix added, \"I know how you don't want to go through with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've gone this far to do it, and even if I don't want to go back, it is something I must do,\" Fakira replied, \"Maybe there is something at the gate that could help us use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is possible,\" Solita agreed, \"There's probably a reason why the gate is there, and maybe there is someone there watching over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next thing we have to figure out is what will happen if we do end up reaching Felarya,\" Felix brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The three of you will not be safe at your natural sizes. You wouldn't be considered as people in Felarya,\" Fakira informed them, \"Well, at least not to the fairies. I'll have to grow all of you to giants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that keep us safe?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but if you're normal sized, you wouldn't be safe at all. Are you sure you want to come to Felarya with me?\" Fakira questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix and Ted nodded, telling her they needed to stick together. Solita spoke up, \"I'm coming too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was surprised by this and looked at her questionably. \"You want to go to Felarya?\" Fakira questioned, \"You know how dangerous it is, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the dangers. I also know the dangers here if the three of you are gone. Whether I end up staying at the gate to wait for you or if I try to make my way back home, it will not be safe for a lone fairy. The safest place is with all of you,\" Solita explained, \"Besides, it sounds like it could be fun being a giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you may come with us, if everything is alright with that,\" Fakira replied, and both Felix and Ted nodded. \"Since that's settled, I think we better get some sleep,\" Fakira suggested and the others agreed. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ted sat by the fire as Felix and Fakira were getting ready for bed. Ted turned to look at the fairy on his shoulder. Solita was standing and was about to fly to Fakira. Since Solita wanted to stay fairy sized during the trip, she had to sleep close to one of the human sized companions. Since her choices were Felix, Ted, or Fakira, she ended up sleeping with Fakira at night. She didn't want to sleep with Felix, because it would be to awkward, and she didn't sleep with Ted, because she didn't want to approach things too fast with him, even though she really wanted to sleep with Ted to show him her love for him. However, she slept with Fakira each night, because it just seemed proper that when a single lady not committed in any relationship, as of yet, would need to sleep with a giant person for protection, it should be another lady. Besides, over the travels, Fakira and Solita have become good friends. Even though the back of Fakira's mind sometimes wondered how Solita would taste if she ate her. Luckily, Fakira kept in control and never acted upon those desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Solita could start flying to the waiting Fakira, Ted asked, \"Solita, may I have a word alone with you? There's just something I have to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita looked to Fakira and Fakira nodded, \"Go ahead Solita, I'll try to rest and stay awake while you and Ted talk. So that once your done you can sleep with me. If you come back and I'm asleep, just wake me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed slowly and carefully rose to his feet. He didn't want Solita to fell off his shoulder. Even though she had wings that would help her if she fell, she was still a little living lady and he needed to be careful with her. There was much responsibility in taking care of a little person when nearly everything was dangerous to said little person. Ted then walked outside the camp only far enough so that Fakira and Felix, couldn't listen in. Once Ted felt that they were far enough, Ted brought a hand up to his shoulder and Solita hopped into his waiting palm of the giant she had fallen in love with. Ted brought his hand up to face level and looked at the miniature three inch person in his palm as she sat down and looked up at him. As she stared up at Ted's admittedly cute and attractive face, she was inwardly hoping that Ted was starting to feel the same feelings for her that she was feeling for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed looked as the beautiful, but small fairy in his hand. He had to admit that when he had first seen Solita when he had been shrunk down to fairy sized, Solita was one of the most beautiful girls he had seen. Though he was much larger than her now, he could still see some of her details well, since she was holding still in the palm of his hand which was near his face. He was able to see her eyes, and in them, he saw love for him. <i>\"It's just as I thought. Solita might actually love me,\"</i> Ted thought, <i>\"But how is that possible? We barely know each other and she's a fairy and I'm a human which means there's a large size difference between us. And let's not forget that she's probably decades older than me, even though we physically look about the same age. What is it that she sees in me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ted thought about what he should say to bring up the conversation, there was silence as they stared at each other. Eventually, Solita asked, \"What is it you want to tell me, Ted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Ted said as he thought of how she should put it, \"We've been traveling for about two weeks, and I noticed a few things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Solita asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you like me Solita?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita had a feeling he'd bring it up. She had never confessed her love for him in words, but one would have to be blind to not see that she was in love with Ted. She was almost always on his shoulder or by has side. She acted like a small child with a big crush. However, Solita was beginning to fear that Ted didn't like her in the same way she liked him. She began fearing that this talk was for him to tell her that this love wouldn't work out. \"Well, I really like you as a friend and...\" Solita began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ted was able to interrupt the small voice of the fairy and he questioned, \"Are you sure you like me just as a friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you ask that?\" Solita replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't avoid the question, Solita. I've noticed the way you act around me, and I've spotted how you've stared at me sometimes. Now, do you like more more than a friend or not?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I...\" Solita started. She was starting to get uncomfortable in Ted's palm. It wasn't that his hand wasn't comfy, but she was getting uncomfortable because she was getting nervous. She began thinking about how Ted may react if she told the truth. It wasn't normal for a fairy to fall in love with a human. Humans were giants to fairies, and it's a little odd to fall in love with something so large. Plus, the lifespan of fairies and humans were very different. Fairy lived a lot longer and aged slower. Falling in love with a human meant that the human lover would die much sooner than the fairy. There were many other factors as well that made a human and fairy relationship out of the ordinary. Solita looked down and spoke quietly. Too quiet for Ted to be able to hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Solita, but I couldn't catch that last part,\" Ted informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita looked up and spoke up, \"It's true. I do love you, Ted.\" After saying those words, Solita blushed and forced her head downwards. She didn't want to see the reaction in Ted's face, fearing it would be a negative reaction to her statement. Silence feel upon them and Solita cried a little, thinking the silence confirmed her fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solita, what's wrong?\" Ted asked, only so that he could try to comfort her from crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably think I'm some weirdo fairy,\" Solita cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would I think that?\" Ted asked. Ted knew the answers, but he only asked in hopes to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, it's not natural for a fairy to fall in love with a human. We are just such different species. You probably think I'm a nut job for falling in love with you. I even think I should be examined, but I just can't help it. I don't know why I've fallen in love with you. Maybe it was because you saved my life and you're the first friend I've gained, other than Dalil who treated me like a younger sister. I've just fallen for you, and I don't care that you're a human,\" Solita explained, \"I wish that you could feel the same way for me, but I'd understand if you only see me as a friend.\" Solita laid down in her stomach and buried her eyes into crossed arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed definitely liked Solita as a friend, and he couldn't stand seeing a friend cry in his palm. Ted used his free hand and placed a finger on Solita. He then pat and stroked her back, being careful of her wings as well as her fragile, miniature body. \"Solita, I don't think you're a weirdo. You're a good friend and one of the only friends I have,\" Ted tried to assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I've fallen in love with a human. That's enough proof that I'm weird,\" Solita argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are different, but that's nothing to be ashamed about. My parents were explorers who documented many different legends for nearly every sentient species out there as well as documenting some interesting tales they witnessed. He had come across true events as well as legends about creatures of other species fall in love with each other. They even found a giant naga falling in love with a human,\" Ted informed Solita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? One of those giant snake people fell in love with a human?\" Solita questioned, cheering up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just goes to show that you shouldn't worry about what others think of you if you fall in love with someone, you should let anything get in your way if you truly love them,\" Ted told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita rose to her knees and hugged Ted's finger. Her three inch body, well less than three inches since her shins and feet were planted on Ted's palm, pressed against the finger with her arms wrapped around. As she continued to hug Ted's finger, she asked, \"Ted, do you like me a little more than just a friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed thought about it carefully and then replied, \"You're very sweet and attractive girl. Whenever I'm shrunk down to your size, I find it hard not to stare at such beauty. I know that you're a fairy and I'm a human, but I think I'm starting to have feelings for you as well. I'll be will to try this relationship if you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're willing to try?\" Solita questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Ted answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita was happy about his decision and hugged the finger tighter. \"Really? That's great, Ted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, we better get back to the camp,\" Ted replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira said that I could wake her when we came back, but I could sleep with you. But if that's too fast and a little uncomfortable for you, then I understand and I'll sleep with Fakira,\" Solita stated.</span></div></div>",

So there really shouldn't be much difference now.\"  Solita smiled and flew into the air and touched Ted's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath her hand, Solita felt strong, toned muscles.  She looked up at Ted while he craned his neck down to see what she was doing.  \"Thank you,\" she said softly, before flying back to her place on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no trouble,\" Ted said.

Ted blushed as well before walking back to the campsite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the fire, Felix looked at Fakira.  She gave a small yawn, tryoing to stay up for Solita.  Inside his chest, Felix felt his heart race.  His eyes glanced over the vacancy left by Solita and Ted and knew this was the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira,\" Felix said, causing the girl to look towards him.  She saw the strain in his face.  Her fatigue seemed to lessen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Fakira asked, worry was in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say thank you,\" Felix said, looking her in the eyes,  Fakira blinked.  She thought back to the past few days, trying to think what he could be thankful for, considering each time they had helped each other they gave a quiet thanks.  But this seemed to have more weight than those minor times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For accepting my help back in those dungeons and giving us a chance,\" Felix said, \"I realized I never really thanked you for that since we escaped.\"  Fakira felt her cheeks grow warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, you have thanked me in other ways,\" Fakira said softly, \"You continued to show me how eating humans is wrong.  And then you saved my life when the thief tried to kill me.  So I think we're even.\"  Felix smiled at that comment.  He glanced to where Solita and Ted went off to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if they're telling each other how they feel,\" Felix said, giving an awkward moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably,\" Fakira said, adding another.

It was a very odd feeling for the both of them, for neither had felt such strongly towards an emotion. Looking back, both would have thought love was impossible for them. Felix never thought he would find another person he could trust and feel passionate towards. He had lived most of his life alone with very few he could trust or confide in. He had almost lost hope until he had met the most beautiful creature he had ever seen and saw she had been in the same predicament he was in. It was that understanding of each other that opened the door and eventually helped Fakira see that humans were people too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Fakira never thought in a million years that she would fall for a human. All her life, she was taught that little people were food, no matter what, and that size determined a person's status on whether they were a person or just some snack. She had gone her whole life never thinking twice on such a subject, never once questioning that. In her world, it was permissible to eat a person just because they were smaller. So, falling for a human seemed impossible to her. However, Felix and Ted questioned her definition of a human and started the moral dilemma. They had opened her eyes to the truth and showed her the cruelty of her definition. Because of this, she now saw humans as people and was now falling for the first human she had ever truly met. She had no regrets doing so, even if her family would most likely not approve of her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Fakira and Felix looked away from each other and both wanted to tell the other one how they felt, but both were having troubles speaking there mind. Both were worried what the other might think. Here was a former slave, who had proven himself to be brave by finally standing up to an evil monster of a master as well as stand his ground against a Felaryan fairy and help change her life despite the dangers. Now, he was trying to find the courage to talk to Fakira and tell her his feeling. On the other side was a Felaryan fairy who once saw humans as just little insignificant creatures she could do whatever she wanted with them without consequences and deemed her species high above the human race, was now having troubles speaking to one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both turned to each other after a deep breath and spoke up, \"I have something to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth said it at the same time and both blushed afterwards. \"What is it you wish to tell me, Felix?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, you can go first,\" Felix insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Fakira replied before taking another deep breath, \"I... I love you.\" Felix's eyes widened in amazement and shock. Felix continued to stare at Fakira without saying a single word. His questions were answered, Fakira loved him! \"Well, aren't you going to say something?\" Fakira questioned, not liking the silence after such a revealing statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to tell you that I love you too,\" Felix informed her, \"I was worried you wouldn't love me back, but now I see that you do actually love me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira smiled with joy and said, \"So, you really love me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you're a wonderful person, Fakira,\" Felix told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira hurried over to Felix and hugged him, happy that they both had feeling towards each other. \"I'm glad you feel that way,\" Fakira whispered in Felix's ear as she hugged him tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you guys finally confessed each other's love as well,\" said the voice of Ted as he stood at the edge of the camp. Both Fakira and Felix escaped their hugs and looked to Ted as he stood there with Solita on his shoulder. \"It's refreshing to know that none of us have to keep secrets any longer about who loves who,\" Ted added. The rest agreed and they eventually fell asleep. Solita slept on Ted's chest and he covered her body and kept her warm with his hand. Felix and Fakira still had their on beds, but Fakira and Felix now slept closer to each other. None of them knew it, but a magical bond was forming between them: one between Ted and Solita and one between Felix and Fakira. These bonds have been going on for a while and were slowly growing stronger since they had started. It's what pushed them into falling for each other, but now, that bond will get much stronger more quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen when they reach the dimensional gate?</span></div></div>",

Felix found himself laying on his side, looking at Fakira, and Fakira was looking back at him.  Solita was pressing herself on Ted's chest, as though she wanted to be within him.  With the sun filtering through the trees, the four woke and ate a quiet breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will the gate look like?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Ted replied, \"They won't need to be the same device everywhere, depending on how often Felarya appears in that land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope we can find someone to operate it for us,\" Felix said, \"Even though we are still in Lord Willaim's domain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix!\" Fakira shot at the boy, \"If you're going to say <i>his</i> name, don't add <i>Lord</i> to it.\"  Felix nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, old habits die hard,\" Felix replied, smiling.  Fakira smiled as well.  Ted nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is nothing to us anymore,\" Ted said, \"But you are right the local gatekeeper may be sided with him.\"  His gaze looked to the little lady on his shoulder.  \"You said this guy lives all alone, Solita?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Elder Gailita said the gatekeeper is one man, but she doesn't know much else about him,\" Solita said, refering to the last elder they encountered and protector for this part of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope he's a nice man,\" Felix said.  No one said much else after that and the group packed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group departed the forest, they saw the gate.  Two ivory spires shooting up into the sky.  There was nothing between them, but between the spires and the forest stood a cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, not what I expected,\" Felix said, \"Do you think the doorway will open between those spires?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense if you wanted to make a way to my old home,\" Fakira said, \"Otherwise you would just need to find an overlapping spot, like what happened with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get closer,\" Ted said, as they walked towards the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the cabin window, a man was watching the approaching beings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting, very interesting,\" the gatekeeper said.  He stayed quiet and moved to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four travelers got close to the cabin, the door opened and a tall, strong looking warrior stood there.  \"Hello,\" he said, looking down at the travelers, \"Are you the ones who had the fire in the forest last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are,\" Ted said.  The man's stoic face flickered a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll assume you are friends of the faries within,\" the man said, his eyes glancing at Solita, who was still on Ted's shoulder, \"In fact I'm sure of it.  So what business do you have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to use the gate,\" Felix said.  The man nodded.  He walked out of his doorway and sat on a chair on the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's unusual for young ones like yourself needing to go to Felarya,\" the man said, \"Though when one is a Felaryan fairy, who escaped from Lord William's castle with two other slaves, it's not so unusual.\"  He watched as the group tensed up with their idetities known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you plan on capturing us for that man?  A dead man?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's dead?\" the gatekeeper asked, sitting up.  Ted nodded.  \"You felt his heart stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He exploded,\" Ted said.  The man had a grim look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there's no garuntee,\" the gatekeeper said, \"But regardless of him, I won't let you into Felarya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because opening it up without anyone aiding me, on this side of that side, may let one of your kind in here or an adult naga and they are hard to get back through,\" the gatekeeper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mister . . .\" Felix started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric,\" the gatekeeper provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Eric, Fakira didn't come through the gate and it's not like we plan on being there for very long,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter.  I have a responsibility to many people,\" Eric answered.  Fakira raised her hand at Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will make you open the gate for us,\" Fakira growled.  Eric smiled and walked off the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Planning on shrinking me, then?\" Eric asked, in a challenging tone.  \"It won't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch me,\" Fakira said, casting the spell.  But the gatekeeper waved his hand and Fakira and Felix heard a shout from Ted and watched him shrink to Solita's size.  \"What the?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of my bond with the most beautiful woman I know,\" Eric said, \"Alicia, a diamond naga.  We are bonded and so the magic she knows, I can use as well.  Casting spells against me is useless.\"  Fakira backed away slightly.  While she had never met a diamond naga, she knew they were one creature fairies should always avoid at all costs.  They had the ability to redirect magic as easily as one breaths.  They could even absorb it.  If this human could use such powers, she doubted they could beat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric moved closer, to prove his threat, he felt it.  On his left ring finger, a silver ring with a ruby in it began heating up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is interesting,\" Eric said, chuckling, \"It seems I'll be able to help you in the end after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Felix asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of you has the ability to use dimensional magic,\" Eric said, \"And it seems to be coming from . . . \"</span></div></div>",

Solita was worried about Ted when he shrunk right beneath her and she was worried something might have been wrong since Ted was hit with a shrink spell that had been countered. Solita was worried that there might have been some sort of strange side effect. So, Solita landed next to Ted and examined him, despite the fact he had told her he was alright. She continued her worried examinations as the giants around them conversed. It wasn't until Eric had said something about a \"shrunken boy\" that Solita and Ted turned their attention upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was looking down at Ted and Solita as they stared upwards. \"Wh-what?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems as though you have dimensional magic in your blood, boy,\" Eric stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira had a feeling that Ted had a lot to say and she began growing him to normal size so that he wouldn't have to yell up at them. Once Ted was back to normal size, Solita sat upon his shoulder, listening intently. Ted looked at Eric with much confusion on his face as he said, \"You must mistaken. I don't have any magic in my blood. I've never been able to use magic. I'm the only one in this group that can't use magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see the ring on my finger?\" Eric questioned rhetorically, \"It's a magic ring that is able to sense dimensional magic users, besides myself. This means that one of you can use said magic and it glows brighter upon pointing at you.\" Eric demonstrated this by pointing it at Ted. He even ordered Solita to leave Ted's shoulder and the ring still glowed in Ted's direction. \"There's no denying it, you are the dimensional magic user,\" Eric concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I haven't been able to use magic my entire life,\" Ted argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible that dimensional magic is the only magic in you,\" Eric suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's the rarest type of magic. It usually has to be past down or I'd have to be bonded with one of the few creatures capable of that kind of magic,\" Ted continued to argue. He couldn't believe he had dimensional magic. He had never been special before, other than his exceptionally gifted knowledge of magical creatures and other worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did one of your parents have dimensional magic?\" Eric questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Ted quickly answered, but then he thought about it and continued, \"At least, I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you not certain?\" Eric asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My father traveled a lot. He was almost always gone, but he always came home to check on me regularly and would stay for about a month before heading out again,\" Ted explained. Ted thought carefully and began to think aloud, \"He's been in other dimensions and worlds like Felarya. Maybe he did have that kind of magic. That's probably how he was able to travel around so much and get into other worlds. He was able to use dimensional magic, and I didn't even know about it. It all makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father traveled a lot? Even to other dimensions? It would make sense that he would have magic to help him go to those places,\" Eric replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He gone for long periods of time, but he always came regularly for a few months. He saw many places and creatures and told me about them. He's how I now so much about different worlds and many creatures. I learned everything from him,\" Ted informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sounds like a dimensional magic user. Usually, they don't like to stay in one place for too long. I unfortunately have a duty here and this gate. Otherwise I would be with my bond mate,\" Eric stated. Eric paused in silence for a moment. But that silence was ended with a sigh before he continued to speak, \"Not only did your father pass down a rare magic, but he past down an even stronger dimensional magic than most users of said magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" Ted gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually those gifted with the power have to use a dimensional gate just for our powers to work. That's the type I am. However, you bloodline has a more powerful magic. With your magic, you can make portals on your own without the use of a dimensional gate,\" Eric informed Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without a gate!\" Ted gasped in shock. The others were just as surprised when they heard this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, when he has honed his skills, he would be able to make portals appear at will and direct them to where he wants to go by just thinking about where he wants to go,\" Eric explained, \"But since he's just now learning of his heritage, that's too advanced for him at the moment. But with practice, he'll be able to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed was speechless. He had dimensional magic all his life, and so had his father and he had never realized it. What made him feel worse was that he was William's slave for three years. If he had known what he was, he could have just teleported himself out of the castle and his problems would have been all over. <i>\"I could have escaped William's castle all along!\"</i> Ted thought as he clenched a fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira was the first to notice this. \"Ted what's wrong?\" Felix and Solita grew concerned and Solita, who had flown back to Ted's shoulder, placed her hand on his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I would have known about my powers, I could have escaped William's slavery much simpler. Hell, I probably wouldn't have become a slave and I would have teleported back to my house and have some unpleasant words with my mother,\" Ted explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother?\" Solita questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When my father didn't come back on his regular visits, we assumed he was dead. My mother never loved me as much as my father. She was still nurturing and still took care of me, but I never felt the motherly bond most children had with their mother. Maybe that's why she found it easier to sell me when times grew hard,\" Ted told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had heard this story before, but Fakira and Solita were hearing it for the first time. \"I'm sorry I brought that up,\" Solita apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" Ted assured her. Ted turned his attention back to Eric and asked, \"What do you need from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can open the portal for you four, but Felarya is dangerous and I can't keep the portal open till your business is done. I've told you already that you wouldn't want a naga to come through the portal while you're doing whatever you need to do,\" Eric stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you're getting at. You're going to need me to open the portal back up when we're finished,\" Ted said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct. But I'm going to have to teach you how to open the portal, since you're a beginner. I can't bring myself to send you kids into Felarya without a sure way back home. I know what dangers lay in that place. It's no place for young ones such as yourselves. But then again, it does help to have a Felaryan fairy as a friend,\" Eric commented as he looked to Fakira, \"Stories of humans and Felaryan top predators becoming friends is rare. Fairies are usually kind creatures that are friendly to all the other top predators despite whatever species they are, but even they see humans as snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to think that about humans,\" Fakira admitted, \"But Ted and Felix taught me the truth and that I should judge a person by their intelligence and sentient minds, not by their size. I will never eat a human, ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is good that some Felaryans have enough reason to be brought to the light,\" Eric replied, \"So why are you going back to Felarya though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to go there to say goodbye to my mother. Then I will come back here where I will live with my friends. I can't live in a place far away from my friends and Felarya is too dangerous for them,\" Fakira answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for the questioning, but it is a highly unusual situation to find four children wanting to go to Felarya,\" Eric explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I may look like a child, but I'm not a child,\" Solita yelled from Ted's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very sorry,\" Eric apologized while bowing slightly, \"I forgot that fairies stop aging regularly at thirteen and start aging like elves at that point, taking decades for their body to age one year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed turned his head to look at Solita and he whispered, \"You've never told us how old you are. How old are you really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny fairy whom was sitting on Ted's shoulder and that had the body of a fifteen year looked back at Ted and replied in a teasing tone, \"I'm not telling you that yet. You're just going to have to guess for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you four want to be off as soon as possible, I suppose. Come and I will show you the basics of dimensional magic. By just learning the basics, you will be able to open the portal by using a gate. Especially since dimensional gates can only go to certain places,\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita had to leave Ted's shoulder and she landed on Fakira's as Eric led Ted to the gate. \"Now, you're lucky with this one, because this gate only goes to one other place, and that's Felarya. The gate on the other side could be different. If it is a newer model, it will have more than one possible exit point. If that's true, it will look different from this and have an arch shape with different writings on it. Each of those writings will be a different destination. I will write the words that would mean this gate since dimensional portal destinations have their own language. If the gate on the other side is new, you'll have to touch that magical word as you try to make a portal as well as picture your destination in your mind,\" Eric explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so how do I open a portal?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It works a lot like most magic. You have search deep within yourself. There will be a funny feeling in the center of your body,\" Eric informed Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of feeling am I looking for?\" Ted questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to explain, but you'll know it's the magic within you when you feel it,\" Eric answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed took a deep breath and closed his eyes, concentrating deep within himself. At first, he felt nothing within him. He began to doubt that he had such rare magic within himself. However, he suddenly felt something within him near the center of his body. It was a strange feeling. It was as if it was a living mass deep within him. Ted was startled by the feeling and opened his eyes and stopped concentrating. Ted even jumped back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you found it, but you mustn't pull back if you want to use the magic within you,\" Eric informed Ted, \"You need to take hold of it.\" Ted took a deep breath again and closed his eyes, concentrating on what he had felt earlier. This time he didn't pull away from the mass inside him. His mind and thoughts dove into it, taking it all in. As if knowing what point Ted was at, Eric continued, \"You're going to have to mold it now and divide it up into two parts of your body, your mind and your hand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed did as Eric instructed and took the magic into his mind and hand. \"You're going to need to open your eyes and keep concentrating,\" Eric instructed. Ted opened his eyes. \"Aim your hand at the gate,\" Eric ordered. Ted did so. \"Now, in order to open the portal and use your magic, you have to just the emotion that compels it. Dimensional magic has great ties with longing. You mustn't just want to go somewhere, but you have to long to go there as if your life would be complete if you could just go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed understood the feeling. He had had that feeling for the last three years he was a slave. Ted imitated that feeling, but directed it towards the gate. Suddenly, a strange silver colored smoke began to emerge from between the two pillars. It continued till the smoke had filled the entire space between the pillars. The smoke began to create an image. Ted could see a dirt path, with enormous trees bordering the path. The sun was shining brightly and in the distance appeared to be a city, but he couldn't see it too clearly. The image was still hazy like the smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done it,\" Eric congratulated, \"Usually it takes a few tries for beginners. There is very powerful magic within you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I close it?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of the magic and way your hand as though you're clearing smoke,\" Eric answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed did this and the portal and smoke blew away. Eventually, there was nothing left between the two pillars. \"When you're finished with your business in Felarya, you must go to the gate you came in and open the portal. I will be on the other side helping keep it open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't the portal disappear when I lower my hand?\" Ted questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To keep a portal open once it's started, you only need to keep hold of the magic. The only way to close a portal is letting go. Waving you have makes it go a little quicker. Now, before you're off, I'm going to write down something in case the portal on the other side is a newer model,\" Eric told Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eric left back to his house, Fakira, Felix, and Solita approached Ted. \"That was incredible, Ted,\" Felix congratulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can't believe you did it your first try,\" Solita added from Fakira's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira embraced Ted in a firm and tight hug. \"Thank you. Because of you, I'm able to see my mother one more time,\" Fakira told Ted. As Fakira hugged, Solita climbed onto Ted's shoulder since Fakira was slightly shorter than Ted, being ten years old and Ted being thirteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric soon came back with a piece of paper with strange writing on it. He handed it to Ted and told him, \"If the portal is a newer model on the other side, you will have to touch the writing on the arch that resembles these markings. Ted nodded and placed the paper in his pocket. \"I will open the portal for you four,\" Eric announced before actually opening it. Felix, Fakira, Ted, and Solita all went through the portal and Eric closed it quickly behind them. \"Good luck to you all. You will most likely need it,\" Eric muttered. He still couldn't believe he had sent children into Felarya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does the portal send them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's a map of Felarya... Hope it's not to hard to read... <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.felarya.com/wiki/images/d/d4/Felamaplargewiki.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.felarya.com/wiki/images/d/d4/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The portal exits out on a path to Negav City. The gate is a newer model and Ted will have to use the paper when they decide to leave. The gate is located near the back of the city. Negav is a large human city and is the human capital. The city is enormous and has withstood past top predator attempts to destroy it.

The ruins used to be a city that has resemblances of ancient Babylonian and Egyptian architecture. The dimensional gate is very different and highly efficient.

Fakira shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I rarely left the kingdom,\" Fakira said, \"I was actually inside it when I hit a portal taking me to your world.\"  Ted looked around and blinked in confusion at a strange stand selling clothing and other odd things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this place?\" Ted asked, walking towards a place with a sign reading Mr. Mhurr's Many Marvels and Souvenirs Shop.   It had a sign in front of it with words written in various languages.  In the one he could understand, it read \"Be back in five minutes.\"  He glanced back at theeing had  name.  It seemed vaguely familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Fakira said, moving close.

Perfect for the meal you're about to be.'\" she read one of them.  There were similar bottles for mint, cherry and other fruits.  She turned her head to Fakira who raised her hands defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask me,\" Fakira replied quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, it's obvious.  Any one who is about to be eaten ought to at least taste well to the one eating them,\" came a voice from behind the group.  Fakira, Ted, and Felix turned quickly and looked up, and up, and up.  The being had gray hair covering his muzzle and stood stooped forward, but was still well past the seven foot mark in height.  Ted looked at the creature his father has described many times to him and knew this was a neko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Fakira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, don't start with the bottles just yet,\" came a female voice from behind the tall neko.  Appearing in their view was an equally tall female neko.  She had a tall beautiful body and amazing red hair.  \"Hello, my name is Likki.\"  she batted her eyes at the boys, causing Solita and Fakira to move close to their guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Felix,\" Felix said after a moment of silence.  \"And this is Fakira, Ted, and Solita.\"  Likki nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you care for a souvenir?\" Likki asked, \"Is this your first time to Ferlarya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Ted started, unsure whether to tell them what Fakira really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an interesting fairy.  You don't usually see one that small,\" the elder neko and owner of the shop, Mhurr said,  \"Unless we have an eclipse, mind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that affect a fairy's power?\" Felix asked, looking at Fakira with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my father just says some odd things at times,\" Likki said, \"So what may we offer you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Directions please,\" Solita answered, \"we need to reach the Fairy Kingdom.\"  Both nekos pulled back from this comment.  Generally they could keep their composure at some of their customer's odd responses, as well as their own.  But four young, small beings wanting to go to the Fairy Kingdom was far outside even their norm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want to go there?\" Mhurr asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to live there,\" Fakira answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Used to?\" Likki asked.  Fakira nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was taken by a portal to their world and learned to not judge personhood by size.  I can't live here anymore.  So I want to say goodbye to my mother before returning with them to their home,\" Fakira explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is very strange,\" Mhurr replied, \"Yes, we do have maps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\" felix said, smiling.  The elder neko nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But nothing is for free,\"  Likki added, as her eyes looked closely at Ted.  She knew she had never seen him before, but he looked familiar.  He kept glancing at their sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know a man with a scar on his left cheek connecting his mouth to his ear?\" Ted asked.  Mhurr looked at Likki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean that mage, what's was his name again Likki?\" Mhurr asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur, I believe,\" Likki said when Ted's face brightened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my father!\"  Ted exclaimed, \"I knew I recognized your name.  My father told me about this place.  I get why he said they had some strange items on sale.\"  His eyes glanced at the shirts saying \"I'm with Stupid. Eat him instead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was your father?\" Likki asked, giving Ted another look over.  The nose and eyes were very similar to the mage she knew.  And that smile was the same when Arthur laughed at some of their merchandise.  As she thought on it, she always had a hard time selling to that man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, isn't this a coincidence,\" Mhurr said, \"He was always good to us when he stopped by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you'll give us the directions for free?\" Solita asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could do that much,\" Likki said, \"As he gave you such a glowing recommendation of our shop.\"  Ted smiled as Mhurr walked behind the counter and looked through some things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Felix said.  Likki smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really no trouble,\" Likki responded, </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"By the way, are any of you mages?\" Likki inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we all are,\" Felix answered, \"I can use fire and wind spells with ease as well as a few other spells. Ted can only use dimensional magic, but without it, we wouldn't be here now. Fakira is a Felaryan fairy and Solita is a fairy from our world. So, they can use magic as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikki's eyes lit up with excitement as she turned them upon Solita. \"So, you're a fairy from another world? I've never seen a fairy of your size before. I've only seen Felaryan fairies, since my world has no fairies in it, and those Felaryan fairies tend to keep themselves as giants. Tell me, can fairies of your world changes their sizes as well, little fairy?\" Likki had crouched down so that she was more level with the humans in front of her. Likki looked as though she was a small child waiting to be told a fascinating story. Female nekos, like fairies, tended to be in touch with a sort of child-like side to them, and Likki didn't seem to be an exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita was very nervous now that the neko's attention was fully on her. Not only was it because she was small and they were giant strangers, but they were also nekos. There was the reason why Solita had flown to Ted's shoulder as soon as the nekos showed themselves. She was frightened of nekos and now scooted closer to Ted's neck, hoping Ted would protect her, even though these nekos seemed to be kind. Solita had heard horror stories about wild nekos eating fairies, but also playing with them, like a cat would with a mouse, before devouring them. Solita even heard that \"civilized\" nekos ate smaller beings as well. There seemed to be an instinct to eat small creatures in nekos that is hard to resist when they spot small creatures, even if the creature is sentient! This neko wasn't from her world, and luckily wasn't from Felarya, but it was a neko and she still feared it had that instinctual urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikki and the others noticed Solita shivering and Likki figured out the reason. Likki backed away a little in hopes to make Solita more comfortable. \"I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were frightened of me,\" Likki apologized. \"There is no need to worry about me, Solita,\" Likki added Solita's name in hopes to assure her she saw her as a person and not prey, \"I don't eat smaller beings that are sentient. There are smaller sentient beings in my world as well, but I never harm them. I can resist the urges that nekos have that you must have heard of. Trust me, you're safe with me.\" Likki giggled a bit and added, \"Now, if you had a mouse tail and mouse ears, it may be a little tougher to resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita seemed to cheer up a little, but she still stayed close to Ted's neck. \"So, can you size change like Felaryan fairies?\" Likki asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can not,\" Solita answered, \"Fairies of my world don't have that power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would explain why you are so little than,\" Likki replied, \"It's rare to see a fairy of human size, let alone one of your size, Solita.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bit of silence and they could hear Mhurr muttering to himself, \"Maps, maps, so many maps.\" He picked up a few maps and looked at the titles. \"Map of Doom, Map to a Felaryan's Stomach, The Insides of Felaryans. Yet no Felaryan Map,\" Mhurr continued to mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you've seen my father,\" Ted broke the silence, \"When's the last time you've seen him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikki thought about it carefully and answered, \"We haven't seen Arthur in three or more years? Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen him in that same duration of time. Because he never came back, I was sold into slavery,\" Ted sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I didn't know,\" Likki apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea what has happened to him?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Arthur was a mysterious man. He was kind and sociable, but he never talked about his past to us or told us where he was going. He told us some of his adventures, but never anything personal,\" Likki informed Ted, \"I wish I could help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the map!\" Mhurr hollered joyfully when he had found it. Everyone turned their attention to Mhurr who left the stand and presented Ted with the map. \"Here you go, Son of Arthur, a Map of Felarya,\" Mhurr stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed took the map and pulled it from the scroll to reveal all of Felarya. \"There is a lot of forest,\" Ted commented, \"My dad wasn't kidding when he told me it was mostly made up of forests.\" Ted looked at the map closely and found where the Fairy Kingdom's borders were. It was clear that it would take a week or so to get there. \"What's the best way to get to the Fairy Kingdom?\" Ted asked Mhurr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends,\" Mhurr replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on what?\" Ted questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whether you want to look at the sites, explore other places, Meet interesting predators, or if you want a safe path,\" Mhurr replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would much rather go on the safest and quickest path possible to avoid as many dangerous predators as we can,\" Ted informed the tall neko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the safest path is staying here and not even going to the Fairy Kingdom, and even then you can still be eaten. There is no safe path,\" Mhurr informed Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what would you suggest?\" Ted asked trying to get an answer form the neko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, getting close to the Giant Tree is suicidal due to Crisis living there,\" Mhurr said while pointing at the tree in the map, \"You'd have to go around it. If you decide to go south of the tree, you can follow the Shard River. The Tolmeshal Forest is about as dangerous as any other Felaryan forest, but nothing to make it over the top danger. There are the usual predators there. It's still highly dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" Mhurr continued, \"There is a small town called Safe Harbor in the forest along the river. It is a human and neko settlement started by a giantess named Jade. Jade does not eat sentient beings and protects that town. Maybe you will be lucky to come across her and she can protect you and bring you to the town. Continue along the River and you should make it to the Fairy Kingdom, but it's still a dangerous trek past the Safe Harbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the path to the North like?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd have to go through the Bulvon Forest before you can get to the northern river. This area contains many slug girls and dridders that will eat you. And insects are impervious to most fairy magic. There is a naga that had been raised by humans in there named Fiona, but it's still dangerous with the dridders and slug girls. The Forest of Whispers is even more dangerous. However, this may be the quicker of the paths,\" Mhurr informed them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we can go the slower but safer path, or the quicker but more dangerous path,\" Ted muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though it might not be as dangerous for you if you have a Felaryan fairy on your side,\" Likki pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, my magic might not be as usual on the Northern path. I can still make us giants, but I can't stand bugs,\" Fakira informed the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what will it be? Which path do we chose?\" Felix questioned.</span></div></div>",

Generally, the fairies are considered tricksters and would do anything to eat Tinies,\" Mhurr agreed, glancing at Fakira.  \"No offense to you, young one.\"  Fakira sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken.  My mother's ways are not mine anymore,\" Fakira affirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll be choosing to travel through the Bulvon Woods,\" Likki replied, \"Then I'll give you some advice:  Stay off the slime trails.  Like my father said, there are slug girls there and they can be dangerous.\"  She shuddered a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have experience with them?\" Felix asked, looking up at the neko.  She nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About a year ago, one thought to try this gate for some food.  She nearly got me if it wasn't for that,\" Likki pointed high above them at an orb on a pedestal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it do?\" Solita asked.  Likki turned her eyes to Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anything over a certain size comes near the gate, it zaps them with thunderbolts,\" Likki informed them, \"I don't know the exact size it takes to set it off, but my father and I are safe in this region.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I won't grow us around here when we are going to leave,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would that be a smart idea?\" Felix asked, looking at Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish to travel this land at your size?!\" Mhurr exclaimed.  He had known humans or nekos to try, but when you had a fairy friend who could change your size, you don't pull a nice fairy's wings.  His companions looked at him with strange looks as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just thinking maybe we could have Fakira grow Solita to a large size.  They could carry us until they were tired, then we could switch sizes and Ted and I would carry them,\" Felix replied, \"I imagine flying would be quicker than walking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Yes, I imagine it would,\" Likki agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't mind carrying all of you, really,\" Fakira replied, \"What do you think Solita?\"  Solita said nothing for a moment.  She knew she was taller than Ted if he was shrunk to fairy size, but what Felix was suggesting would be the complete reversal of their current sizes.  She didn't mind the idea of being larger than Ted, not if it meant helping him survive this jungle nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a good idea.  But when we sleep, we will all be giants, right?\" Solita asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine if you plan on sleeping, you best have someone keeping guard during the night,\" Mhurr injected, \"There are things that go bump in the night.  But here in Felarya, there are things even those bumps fear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you for your advice and the map,\" Ted said, looking up at the neko.  Mhurr nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you find out more about your father,\" Mhurr said, before pausing, \"Now, would any of you care for a t-shirt?\"  He picked one up with the words \"Add Salt, I'm a bit bland.\"  Solita felt an urge to get back near Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, no thank you,\" Ted said as Slita sat on his shoulder, \"But when we come back, we might.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, then,\" Felix affirmed, taking Fakira's hand and the four set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I need to hunt something,\" Likki murmured, \"That little fairy was cute.\"  Her father said nothing and put down the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were several hundred feet away from the gate when the four stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, are you ready Solita?\" Fakira asked.  The small fairy flew off her love and waited.  Fakira raised her hand and both grew larger and larger until they were 80 feet tall.  The titanic ladies looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Solita said in a hushed voice.  Things did look a lot different at this size.  Fakira nodded and looked down at her shrunken friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This seems familiar, doesn't it Felix?\" Fakira asked, kneeling down with a large smile.  Felix nodded as a large hand came down for him.  But he knew things were drastically different from those cold days in Lord William's castle, when he had to let himself be shrunk in order to gain Fakira's trust.  Now he was putting his life in the hands of a girl he loved and trusted implicitly.  He stepped on the hand and was lifted upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Familiar, but still different,\" Felix answered while Solita picked up her Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we head out?\" Solita asked as she held Ted close to her chest.  Fakira nodded and began flying towards the Bulvon forest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Solita soon followed suit and took to the air with Ted in her hand, pressed comfortably against her chest. Fakira and Solita flew through the jungle ahead of them. Fakira lead because she had taken a good long look at the map and knew what general direction they need to go, and they need to go west almost exactly. If the map was highly accurate, they could go straight, westward from where the dimensional gate was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira and Solita flew through the forest quickly, easily dodging and going around trees. Solita was surprised to see how large the trees were. It was as if she wasn't a giantess at all, but human sized. However, having Ted in her hand was proof that she was a giantess at that moment, but that seemed to be the only proof that see was at that moment. It was clear that Felarya was a land of giants. It was a world meant for gigantic creatures to live in, and any human sized creature or smaller was clearly at a disadvantage. Solita was glad that she wasn't her puny fairy size anymore and being the giant meant that she would have to protect Ted from the monsters of Felarya and she had no problems doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solita!\" Fakira called back, interrupting Solita from her amazement and wonder of Felarya's beauty, size, and dangerous environment. \"We should fly above the canopy. We'd be less likely to encounter predators and we'd get a better look at our surroundings,\" Fakira suggested. Solita nodded and flew upwards with Fakira avoiding branches as they flew at fairly high speeds. Though Felix and Ted trusted their giant friends' abilities, they had to close their eyes at points, fearing they were going to crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing small all her life, Solita was highly adapted to avoiding branches and flying through trees. Fakira noticed this and without consulting Felix and Ted and without even saying a word to each other, Fakira and Solita seemed to agree on a small game. Fakira and Solita flew really close to branches and dodged them at the last second. They would also venture into places where there were fewer spaces between branches. Fakira and Solita were having fun, knowing they were in very little danger of actually crashing due to their experience. However, it pretty much scared the hell out of Felix and Ted who had never experienced flying before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira and Solita soon reached above the canopy laughing and giggling. When they reached above the canopy, they began hovering over it. \"That was fun. You're a really good flier,\" Fakira complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I am older than you and I have more practice,\" Solita told the other giant fairy, \"But you're really good to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were interrupted by a voice calling up to them. Fakira looked down at her chest to she Felix shaking between her hand and breast. Fakira grew worried quickly upon seeing Felix so terrified. Fakira put a finger on the back of Felix's head and pet his head as she asked what was wrong. \"Can you warn me before you do something like that again?\" Felix pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Felix,\" Fakira apologized as she continued to stroke the tiny frightened human, \"I didn't realize how terrifying it must have been from your perspective. You're not used to flying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing how fearful Felix was, Solita looked down at her passenger who was pressed against her makeshift bra. Ted's nerves looked just as shot at Felix's. \"Was it frightening for you as well?\" Solita questioned in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix and I don't have wings,\" Ted informed the giant face above him, \"We're not as accustomed to flying as you two. This is our first flight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for scaring you, Ted,\" Solita apologized sincerely, \"Trust me, flying is fantastic once you're used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll promise not to do something like that again, too soon,\" Fakira spoke for Solita and herself to Felix and Ted, \"From now on, we'll take it easy for you two to gradually get accustomed to it.\" Solita nodded in agreement with Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that agreement, both giant fairies began flying once more going much slower, but keeping a good pace. They also needed to keep themselves from tiring themselves out as well. Solita looked around, but all that was around them was the forest below them. There was an occasional clearing or stream, but other than that, it was just a sea of green below them. Because of this, Solita judged that it was okay to look down at her passenger more often since there was nothing around she had to dodge. Ted was clinging to Solita and pressing himself against her breast to try and protect himself from the wind. Solita thought Ted looked cute the way he did. She had never been so gigantic compared to him and it felt strange. She wondered if she was feeling some of the same feelings Ted did when she was small compared to him. It felt strange to Solita for Ted to be the small one, but she kind of liked it. She had the power to hold life in her hand. No longer was she small and at the mercy of others. She was the one that could do whatever she wanted. She was the powerful one. Of course she would never abuse such powers since she knew what it felt like to be the helpless one. She just liked the feeling of being powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Fakira slowed down to Solita and informed her that it was about lunch time. It had been about an hour and a half since they had entered Felarya, but they had made good time flying and they deserved a bit of rest and food. They came upon a clearing where there was a herd of duiker grazing. They hadn't noticed the giant fairies, probably because there weren't as many flying predators in those parts. Fakira captured the biggest with her magic while the others ran. Fakira and Solita landed in the clearing. Fakira hand Felix to Solita and killed the duiker before growing it to a size that all four of them could share a meal. They ate the tasty antelope creature as well as a few fruits that grew in some of the trees. Felix and Ted stayed human sized and all were very alert. Fakira and Ted told them of some of the predators in Felarya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then flew on till dinner and did the same thing. The camped in the safest place they could find and looked at the map. They judged where they thought they had another day of flight before they could reach the Bulvon Wood. They continued the next day with no incidents. They did manage to kill a Glouteux for lunch, a 30 foot tall very dumb fowl. The next day they set off and before noon, they could see the Bulvon Wood in the distance. They could tell because of the different trees. They could see some of the Giant Tree in the southwest. It had to have been enormous to even be able to see the tip of it in the distance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: They are attacked by bolas dridders. They manage to snag Solita and pull her down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: They are attacked by rock harpies who try and capture Felix and Ted from them. Fakira's wings are injured in the process making her unable to change people's sizes. Solita and Fakira have to stay giants and Felix and Ted have to stay their normal size till Fakira's wings recover.</span></div></div>",

Thirty minutes later, they guessed they had crossed the threshold of the wood, given many trees were thicker than before and there was some slime trails on the ground and trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira!\" Solita called to her friend.  She paused in mid-flight, looking back.  Solita came level to her comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Fakira asked.  Solita leaned close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something is watching us.  I feel it,\" Solita answered in a low whisper so the boys could still hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what it is?\" Ted asked, straining his neck to see Solita's face.  Solita looked down and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but something is there,\" Solita replied.  Ted turned to Fakira and Felix, wondering their views.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's to be expected, right?\" Felix asked, \"I mean, even here there are things that make either of you look small.\"  The fairies exchanged a look.  It wasn't a comforting thought, but true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess we should be on our guard even more,\" Fakira answered.  Solita nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have more experience fighting and looking out for attacks,\" Solita noted, \"I've been doing it for years back home.  I'll take point.\"  Fakira nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" she said before Solita flew ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did not see the movement above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes passed, but no enemy attacked.  But her gut did not let up.  Something was still bothering her.  She saw a branch coming up and carefully landed on it.  She looked around, above and below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solita, is something still watching us?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Solita answered, trying to move her left foot, but couldn't.  It was stuck.  \"Ted, something's wrong.  I can't lift my foot,\" Solita said as Fakira came close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solita, what's wrong?\" Fakira asked, seeing her friend unable to lift her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't come close!  My foot is -- AHHH!!\" Fakira watched as Solita fell forward before stopping on some invisible net and now a being her mother described to her as a dridder stood, smiling.  Felix looked at the giant creature, her green skin with long dark green hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we don't usually get fairies here,\" the dridder said, smiling, \"This will be some good prey.\"  Fakira's eyes narrowed and grabbed a small twig attached to her wrist.  She focused her magic and the Elder's Staff grew before she swung it towards the dridder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dridder saw the staff appear and as the staff pointed towards her, she felt the change in air and jumped away, just in time as a large gash appeared in the branch, nearly cutting through the old tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's powerful,\" came another voice from behind Fakira.  She turned to see another dridder, this one with short hair, standing on one tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release my friends!\" Fakira replied, pointing the staff at the new comer when the dridder dodged a fireball coming from the staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita watched Fakira fend off the two dridders.  <i>Her size and natural magic in conjunction with that staff, those things would be dead if she hits one,</i>\" Solita thought, still holding Ted close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends?\" the first dridder repeated, before pausing.  It took her a moment, but there was a tiny struggling against the webbing beneath the fairy's bosom.  \"You have some tinies with you,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does?\" her friend asked, still dodging the attacks, \"I wonder why she called them friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they are!\" Fakira shouted, sending more cutting winds at the dridders.  They both dodged easily.  It was clear to them, powerful this fairy may be, but she was not a fighter.  All they had to do was wait to knock her into the webs near by and capture her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fakira continued her attack, but the dridders were just too fast for her. The dridders continued to jump from branch to branch with tremendous speed and accuracy. Felix was surprised that the dridders seemed to do this with much ease, but this world was built for giants where humans were the little ones and the tinies were like insects to the giants. This was a giant's world. Fakira tried to keep track of both of the dridders as she attacked, but she lost track of the female one. (The one with shorter hair was a male.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did she...\" was all Fakira had time to mutter before something powerful collided into her back. The female dridder had gotten behind Fakira and leaped at her. The dridder hit Fakira in the back with all its spider legs and then jumped off her to land on another branch. The attack was powerful and caught Fakira completely by surprise. Because of those two facts, Fakira was propelled forward towards another web. Fakira clutched Felix tighter and pressed him closer into the fabric of her dress covering her breasts so that she wouldn't lose him. Fakira wheeled herself around to face the dridder and possibly fire off one last attack, but the dridder jumped at the last split second, causing the cutting spell to miss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira fell into the web that was positioned horizontally. The arm with her staff hit the web as well and was stuck. Fakira couldn't break free from the web; all that was free was her forearm and hand with Felix in it. Fakira let go of Felix and he clung onto her dress as she lifted her hand away. With a last effort, she tried to use her hand for a spell, but the male dridder came out of nowhere and grabbed her forearm. He then wrestled with it and tried to force it down on the web. If he succeeded, Fakira wouldn't be able to use certain magic attacks, the attacks that actually worked against dridders. Most of Fakira's magic didn't work on insects and dridders were part spider and impervious to fairy magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira then realized that Felix was out in the open upon her chest. A dridder could easily snatch him up and she wouldn't be able to stop them. As the male dridder still struggled to force her arm down, Fakira whispered, \"Felix, get in my dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Felix exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't argue, just get in,\" Fakira ordered. Felix was shocked by the fact that Fakira was willing to have him in her dress between her breasts. (Fakira had the body of a eleven or twelve year old, but she still had breasts and because of her Felaryan blood, hers developed quicker than normal. They would be very large once she grows to adulthood.) Fakira didn't really want Felix between her breasts, even if he was the human she had a crush on, but she was still young and wasn't ready for such intimacy. However, both of her arms would be trapped in the webbing soon, and Felix had to get out of the open. He was closer to her breasts making it the best option. Felix's life was more important to her than her comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix tumbled over the top of her dress and crawled between the two mounds before the male dridder could pin Fakira's arm down and before the female dridder could reach him. Fakira's breasts tickled as Felix crawled between them. \"Damn! The other human crawled into her breasts!\" the femal dridder cursed as she reached the web Fakira was on, \"Why didn't you grab it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was busy pinning her arm,\" the male dridder told her, \"I'll get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd like that, wouldn't you? No, I'll get it,\" the female dridder replied angrily. The female dridder stood on the web with her spider body on top of Fakira. The female then plunged her hand in Fakira's cleavage. Fakira squirmed uncomfortably, and Felix saw green fingers approaching him. Felix took out his sword, careful not to cut Fakira and stabbed a finger of the dridder. The female dridder retracted her hand. \"Ow! It stabbed me!\" the dridder whined as she examined the small cut on her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a baby, get it!\" the male dridder ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female dridder glared at the male before trying to grab the human in the fairy's breasts. This time, the female dridder grabbed Felix and ignored the sword he continued to stab her with. The pulled him out and lifted him to her angry face. \"How dare you stab me you little shit,\" the dridder growled. She closed her fist tighter causing Felix pain. She grabbed the sword out of his hand and tossed it over her shoulder. \"I'm going to enjoy swallowing you whole,\" the female dridder said with an evil grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira struggled, but could not break free from the webbing. \"No! Let Felix free you monster,\" Fakira yelled, tears fell from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She called it by its name,\" the male dridder pointed out, \"Could this be her pet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female dridder looked deeper into Fakira's eyes and realized, \"No, it's more than that. I think this fairy is in love with this human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In love with a human?\" the male dridder exclaimed before laughing, \"Stupid girl, you're supposed to eat humans, not fall in love with them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we need to teach her what to do with humans, by showing her an example,\" the female dridder suggested, a wicked smile stretching at the bottom of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Please!\" Fakira begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dridders just laughed as the female dridder pinched the back of Felix's shirt and lifted him up high in the air. The female dridder looked up and opened her mouth wide under poor Felix. Felix looked down at the opened mouth he hovered over. It was wide with a pink tongue inside, but there were pinchers inside the mouth as well. Saliva strands stuck to the roof of the mouth to the tongue and in the back of the mouth was the dark abyss of her throat. Was this how Felix's life was going to end? Felix tried to lift his arms and grab the fingers that pinched his shirt, but he could reach them. \"Fakira!\" Felix called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix!\" Fakira screamed before starting to sob. There was nothing she could think of that would save her friend. She felt completely helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger's of the dridder parted and Felix felt gravity take control. The female dridder closed her eyes, waiting for her snack. Suddenly, a blur of flesh hit Felix and enclosed around him. Felix had been in a hand so many times that he realized another giant had grabbed him, but what was it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hanging upside down on the branch above the web, was a giant female naga. She had caught Felix and he was in her fist. This worried Felix and Fakira because they had heard stories of how nagas never passed up an opportunity to eat a human. The naga swung around so that she stood on top of the branch with her emerald green tall with irregular white stripes with pale yellow underbelly wrapped around the branch. This caused Felix to be upside down in her hand, but she quickly deposited him onto the open palm of the other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix fell into the giant hand of the female naga that seemed to be over 70 feet tall from the ground up (she was 73 feet tall to be exact) and he cowered in the hand. He was quickly lifted to a very large and beautiful face. The naga was very cute with freckles dotting her cheeks and long blonde hair. She even had a large flower in her hair. The naga stared down at Felix with irregular colored eyes. Her right eyes were blue and her left eye was green. Felix feared that he had been saved only to be eaten by another monster. However, he was surprised when the giant face, that was uncomfortably close by the way, asked in a sincere voice of concern, \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was shocked by the kind and sincere voice. From what Fakira had told him about giant nagas, he had thought the naga would gobble him up within seconds. He couldn't believe that this one was being so kind. <i>\"Maybe this one doesn't eat humans. Maybe she's like Fakira,\"</i> Felix thought. \"I... I'm not hurt,\" Felix informed the giant naga with a fearful voice. The giant naga seemed to sound gentle and kind, but she was still a stranger and a giant Felaryan naga. Plus, her giant face being so close to Felix made him very uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant naga sighed and said, \"Good, I was worried I might have hurt you when I caught you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Give me back my snack you human loving skin shedder!\" the nasty voice of the female dridder screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira had been worried for Felix's safety when he was caught by a giant naga and she was going to grow him. However, when the female dridder called the giant naga a human lover, she stopped herself from growing him. <i>\"Human lover? Is this naga like me and sees humans as people?\"</i> Fakira wondered. Fakira had heard rumors of some Felaryan predators that saw humans as people and how they could even get along with other giant predators, as long as that predator didn't eat any friends. Hell, she had heard that even some of the predators that enjoyed eating humans that would somehow befriend a predator that didn't eat humans become friends with the human friends of the \"human lover\". It sounded like an odd complexity, but it somehow happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I will not give you this human,\" the giant naga yelled as she wrapped her hand around Felix and brought him against one of her bare decently large breasts, \"How could you even try to eat him. Can't you see that he's still a child? Have you no mercy at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Felarya. It's survival of the fittest. Large creatures eat smaller creatures. That's just how the world works. How long are you going to lie to yourself about this nature?\" the female dridder questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not let you eat this human or any other humans for that matter when I'm around,\" the giant naga replied, \"So free your captives and leave this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think not.\" The female dridder smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant naga noticed that the male dridder was no longer in the same place and she realized he must have been behind her. Just as the dridder leaped, the giant naga shifted her body over the side while her tail still wrapped around the branch. The male dridder jumped over the naga and the naga swung around back to the top of the branch, but not before socking the female dridder in the face in the process. \"This is your last chance!\" the naga informed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not be ordered around by a fucking snake skin!\" the female dridder hissed. The female dridder leaped at the naga, but the naga lifted her free hand and a gust of wind threw the dridder off balance and she had to land on another branch. The male dridder leaped for the naga, but she spun around and let go of the branch, smacking the dridder with her tail in midair. The giant naga wrapped only a little bit of her tail around the branch and swung upside down. With her free hand, she grabbed another branch and swung from branch to branch in this fashion, just as fast as the dridders' leaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fakira, what's going on?\" Solita yelled from the other web. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A giant naga has Felix, but I think she's trying to help us. Is Ted okay?\" Fakira asked, wanting to know if all her friends were safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he's under me, but he seems to be fine and not getting squished,\" Solita informed Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira was glad that her other friends were okay and she looked back at the battle. The battle had turned in favor with the giant naga as she had the male dridder in a death lock with her powerful tail. She was constriction his upper body with her tail. \"Let him go!' the female dridder screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you let your captives go and leave. If you try anything funny, I will kill him,\" the giant naga demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't,\" the female dridder replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You willing to risk your mate's life?\" the giant naga questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, just do as she says,\" the male dridder pleaded weakly.</span></div></div>",

The male dridder groaned in pain as his breathing became more labored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!  I'll do as you command,\" the female dridder shouted begrudgingly.  The naga nodded and smiled darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then help the one on her front first,\" the naga ordered.  The female dridder glared cold hatred at the human-loving naga, but did as ordered and moved to Solita.  She carefully cut the webbing that was holding Solita down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Solita felt the webbing become unstuck, she began moving her wings so she wouldn't fall down once free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm losing two fairies,\" the dridder grumbled as she worked on freeing Solita's upper body first.  \"You would have lasted us a month, maybe more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to disappoint,\" Solita replied snidely.  Soon she found her top torso free and she could lift her body off the webbing more and more as the dridder worked downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira and Felix gave a breath of relief when Solita was flying once more.  She did not wish to chance landing on another branch.  Still glaring, the dridder moved to Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start with her head and make sure her wings are still usable,\" the naga added as Ted poked his head out of Solita's hand to watch.  The dridder growled and was about to snap back when she heard her mate groan once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Fakira felt her head being freed from the webbing and lifted it up.  The dridder worked on her spanned arms next before moving to the torso, where she was careful to not damage the fairy's wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short time, Fakira was once more freed and held the staff tight in her hands.  She glanced uneasily at the naga still holding the boy of her life before staring at the female naga, now glaring at the naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did as you demanded, now release my mate,\" she said.  The naga said noting but gave a pwerful motion with her tail, throwing the mate to the female dridder.  \"How are you?\" she whispered as she caught her mate on the webs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My arms are broken,\" he answered.  The female growled, knowing it would be impossible to catch them all again with him being injured.  She helped him in their retreat.  Hopefully they would find another catch in some other webs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good riddance,\" the naga said, sighing before looking down at the fairies.  She saw another human with the first fairy freed.  She opened her hand and looked at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These two, are they your friends?\" she asked.  Felix moved quickly to the edge of the hand and saw his friends free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they are,\" Felix said as Fakira came up quickly.  She snatched Felix from the hand in a flash and held him close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're safe,\" Fakira said as she hugged Felix.  The naga had a soft smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad there are others who see humans as people,\" the naga said, \"My name is Fiona.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Fakira,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solita,\" Solita added, \"So how did you come to see humans as equals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, but we don't have time to tell it now.  Those dridders were pretty pissed and could come back with reinforcements,\" the naga Fiona said, \"Follow me to a safer place.\"  She turned away and began moving across the canopy.  She paused for a moment to see neither fairy had moved with her.  \"I promise you I won't eat your friends,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can trust her,\" Felix noted.  Fakira looked down in her hand at Felix and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solita?\" she asked.  Solita glanced at Fakira, then to Ted, who nodded in agreement with Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" she conceded and the two began following Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little under a half an hour later, Fiona stopped at a large tree with an opening in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my home,\" she said, \"No dridders come around here at risk of me killing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do know how to fight, that's for sure,\" Solita said, staying in the air.  She still didn't fully trust this naga.  Fiona nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but part of me wishes I could use magic like you two.  To make such wounds in the trees is truly amazing.  You might even be able to fight Crisis or Anna with some training,\" Fiona commented.  Fakira recalled the name from Mhurr's comments on their path.  whoever this Crisis was, she sounded like a powerful being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, do you know your way through this land?\" Fakira asked.  Fiona nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, where are you four headed?\" Fiona asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Fairy Kingdom, to say goodbye to my mother,\" Fakira answered.  Fiona caught the pain in the young fairy's voice and recalled her own pain of leaving her human parents.  Part of her wanted to ask why, but realized it was because of her views on humans.  No fairy could last long in this world with those views.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Fiona replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you could help us reach there?\" Felix called from the hands.</span></div></div>",

Her face then looked down at Felix in Fakira's closed hand with a sincerely apologetic face. \"I'm sorry, but I can't take you to the fairy kingdom. Going to a land where I can be shrunk and eaten doesn't sound like a good place to me,\" Fiona informed him, emphasizing the \"I\". Fiona was too frightened by a place where she could become the prey. She had been a giant predator all her life and knew what could happen to humans, which was why she sympathized with them so much, as well as the fact that she was raised by humans. This showed how little Fiona knew about fairies, however. Giants were in fact safe around most fairies, because they judged people by their normal size, and if one's normal size was a giant, then they were a person in the eyes of fairies. That is unless they encounter a fairy that viewed everything as prey, they seriously upset a fairy, or they encounter a playful fairy that wants to shrink them. Even though playful fairies could see a shrunken giant person as still a person, they might be tempted to see them as a toy, pet, or prey. So, Fiona was safe around fairies, but then again, she thought herself as a human more than a naga and if a predator ate humans, she felt they were dangerous creatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona noticed the disappointed faces and added, \"But I think I know someone that would help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the travelers' faces lit up upon hearing this information. \"You know someone else that might help us, and the 'person' doesn't eat humans?\" Solita questioned in a little disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He would never eat a human because he is a human,\" Fiona replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human? How could he be much help? This is a dangerous task,\" Fakira said. Fakira didn't want to sound like humans were worthless, but she had to admit that a human guide would be dangerous for the human, even if they could try their best to protect him like they were doing for Felix and Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's very skilled, \"Fiona defended, \"He knows this world like the back of his hand. He's been everywhere in this place and knows about everything. He even created the map of Felarya, well, at least the best map of Felarya. It even has pictures of the top predators and where their territories are. They have red circles around them, and he also has pictures of people with blue circles around them and where they could be found. The blue circles are the human sized people and the giant predators who would help humans and not bring harm to them. There are others like me out there that would help protect humans, such as Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to have high regard for this human,\" Fakira noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he and his family helped me during a dark time. I owe a lot to them,\" Fiona said, \"They even put my picture in a blue circle on their map. I just wish he would allow copies to be sold in every market. Maybe then I would get to met more people and help them. You could probably imagine how lonely it gets here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish we would have had that map as soon as we came here,\" Felix stated, \"Then we would have searched for you first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona's cheeks turned red form Felix's words, well, every part of her cheeks except for the brown freckles. Fakira was slightly jealous by Felix's compliment towards Fiona. As she examined Fiona, she noticed that Fiona was much older and had the same kind of body as Solita, age wise, and Fiona was three feet taller than Fakira. Fiona had a cute yet beautiful face like hers. Fiona was also naked, showing off more developed breasts and her vagina. Fakira was slightly used to this, because she remembered that almost all Felaryan predators were naked. This was because most didn't have size changing abilities and couldn't find clothes that fit them. So, they've just accepted their nudity. Even some fairies stayed naked in order to attract the opposite sex of a human sized prey. Only those giant predators that had no size changing abilities that were extremely self conscious of their nudity insisted on trying to find something to use as clothing. Fakira could tell that it was Ted and Felix's first time seeing a nude female, because they kept glancing at Fiona's breasts every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can you take us to this human?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can so you the way out of the Bulvon Forest, but that's as far as I will go,\" Fiona told them. Fiona didn't say that she was afraid of leaving the Bulvon Forest, but she didn't have to. The others could see it in her eyes. \"I'll lead you to the river and take you to the edge of the Bulvon forest,\" Fiona continued, \"Then, all you'd need to do is follow the river and you'll find his home. I've never been there, but that's the directions he gave me if I ever needed his help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we start traveling there now?\" Fakira asked, ready to get going again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we have lunch first,\" Fiona insisted, \"Are you four hungry? I know I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's okay,\" Fakira hesitantly agreed. Fakira looked down at Felix and asked, \"Are you hungry?\" Felix nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira looked at Ted and Solita. Ted nodded, but Solita looked at Fiona suspiciously. Solita had always had trust issues, ever since her parents had died. She still didn't trust the Felaryan naga. It's not Solita's fault that she has an untrusting personality. She lived in a different world from Fakira. She lived in a world were she was the small person and there were many large creatures that would like to eat her or harm her. She had to be suspicious to survive this world. Luckily, once a person was deemed trustworthy to Solita, they were forever trustworthy in her eyes. Fiona still hadn't passed the test yet. Solita eventually nodded her head since everyone else had agreed with Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Fiona cheered like a giddy child, \"I'll go hunt for some food. Would anyone like to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll join you,\" Fakira offered. She then turned to Solita and asked, \"You don't mind staying here with Ted and Felix while I hunt, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind,\" Solita replied as Fakira handed Felix to her open hand. Solita was actually glad Fakira would go with Fiona, because if the naga tried something on the hunt, Fakira would be able to shrink her. Plus, if the naga was truly untrustworthy and had some dangerous predator in her home, waiting for them, Solita would keep an eye out for it. She would not let anything happen to Felix and especially Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be back with fruits and animals,\" Fiona informed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might not need as much food as you think, because I can grow food and dead animals much easier than living things,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" Fiona exclaimed before heading through the canopy and motioning for Fakira to follow. Solita entered the tree through the hole at canopy level.</span></div></div>",

The way she moved from tree to tree was amazing, not losing any speed at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will we hunt?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I usually go after a flock of drashig,\" Fiona replied, not wanting to add an occasional human.  She saw them as people, she knew it was wrong, but sometimes her instincts got the better of her.  \"It takes about ten to fill me, but if you can grow them, that will help on how many we need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big are they?\" Fakira asked, who had never seen one before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About seven feet tall.  They also spit an acidic venom at you,\" Fiona replied.  Fakira nodded, happy she left Felix with Solita.  He would be safe there and not have a chance to spend any close time with Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the warning,\" Fakira said when Fiona paused and looked at a branch.  Fakira saw her smile and looked to the branch.  A Bulvonian snail was passing over the branch, but that was not what was making Fiona smile:  Two nekos were on top of it and one was holding a pole with some cabbage on it in front of the snail.  Fiona moved to hide and signaled Fakira to follow her.  She led Fakira away from the snail and it's riders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were smart,\" Fiona said, looking at Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snails avoid dridder webs and slug girl can't track them on the snail's paths,\" Fiona said.  Fakira nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see people using them often?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, but I can't see everywhere,\" Fiona replied.  Her eyes scanned around.  \"Do you mind if I ask you some questions?\"  Fakira shook her head, guessing already what she wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" Fakira replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you come to see your friends as people?\" Fiona said.  Fakira took a breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They saved my life when I owed them nothing,\" Fakira responded, \"They showed me the truth that my mother would never accept.  They accepted me and trusted me, depsite knowing where I came from.  I have come to care for my friends and will kill any who try to take them from me.\"  She blinked as she saw the worry on Fiona's face, realizing that last part was said much colder than she planned.  But she didn't mind.  Now Fiona would know to not be so nice with her Felix when they were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I think there's a flock this way,\" Fiona said breaking the ice that just formed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead on,\" Fakira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita looked carefully around the home.  It was a quiet place with a large cushion made from leaves and other things for a bed.  But there was nothing dangerous inside.  Sighing, she opened her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solita, what was that for?\" Ted asked, looking up at his girlfirend's beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't trust Fiona,\" Solita said simply enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\" Felix asked.  Solita's eyes looked at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have spent most of my life the small one, so I'm weary of new people,\" Solita replied, \"I don't trust quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if she saved us?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Solita affirmed, sitting on the floor.  \"I don't want to lose you Ted, and I know Fakira would be devistated if you were lost Felix.  So please bear with my actions.  We only want for you two to be safe.\"  Ted and Felix said nothing for a moment.  They knew what it was like to be alone.  In the dark halls of Lord william's castle, finding an ally was rare, finding a friend was even rarer.  Solita was just trying to look out for them.  Even if it was a bit cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Ted said, walking down Solita's arm.  She kept still as he reached her elbow and hugged the arm.  Solita smiled and sighed.  It had been a long few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you find this flock so far away?\" Fakira asked, as they held onto six drashigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I smelled them all the way back from my home.  I have a better nose than most anything in this land,\" Fiona said, \"It's how I found you four being caught by the dridders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's some nose,\" Fakira said, noticing how Fiona suddenly tensed and began taking deep breaths through her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" she bemoaned, turning to the way home, she started quickly.  Fakira jumped into the air and followed the racing naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A storm's coming, a big one,\" Fiona said as distant thunder rumbled over head. \"I don't like storms,\" Fiona added, \"I haven't since I was little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira said nothing in response as they pressed on.  She was happy Felix would be safe in Fiona's home.  She understood the worry about big storms in Felarya.  And a giant wouldn't say \"big\" unless they meant it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fiona was relieved that her and Fakira made it to her home in record time and before the storm could get anywhere near them. When Fiona was securely on the branch that led to her home's entrance, she sniffed in the direction of the big storm. It was definitely heading in her direction, but she could possible finish lunch before it reached them. Fiona sighed and whispered, \"Good, we made it here before the storm could catch us.\" Fiona couldn't stop her mind from recalling the memories and the feeling she had experienced the last time she had been caught in a storm. This caused Fiona to shiver as she looked down at the branch she was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira landed on the same branch just before Fiona had whispered. She landed right in front of Fiona and had heard what was said. She saw that Fiona was looking down and shivering with her arms hugging herself, her hands were still carrying the three drashigs she was in charge of. Though Fakira was still a bit jealous of how Felix had gawked at Fiona's nudity, Fakira still felt concern of the Felaryan naga. It wasn't the naga's fault that she was naked and Felix had never seen a nude female before. Of course he'd stare at her and Fiona didn't have clothes to fit her. Plus, the friendliness she had given Felix seemed to be the same friendliness she gave to everyone. Fiona just seemed like a very kind and friendly person. Plus, she saw humans as people, and any Felaryan that did so was good in Fakira's book. \"Fiona, are you alright?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrible memories in Fiona's mind suddenly disappeared and she was back in the present. Fiona looked up to see Fakira concerned for her well being. It wasn't the same amount of concern as the two people that had helped Fiona through her dark times, but it was still concern. Fiona might have found four more friends, even if they were leaving Felarya once Fakira's business was settled. Also, the possibility of having two human friends made her even happier because she had so very few human friends. \"I'll feel better once we're inside,\" Fiona told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFakira and Fiona entered the tree home with six drashigs. Solita was sitting against one of the walls with both Felix and Ted in her hands which were close to her stomach. Ted was leaning against the soft skin of Solita's belly. Once Fiona had the two curtains that she had made out of leaves and other material from the forest closed where her entrance and window were, she felt much happier. \"Lunch is here!\" Fiona called out quite cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you close everything up?\" Solita interrogated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a storm approaching,\" Fakira informed her. After Fakira set her three drashigs down where Fiona had put hers, Fakira approached Solita and held out her hand once she crouched in front of her. Knowing what Fakira wanted, Solita lifted the hand that Felix was in towards Fakira's waiting hand. \"Did you miss me?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, actually I did a bit,\" Felix answered as he crawled onto the hand of his giant fairy girlfriend. When Felix was seated on her palm, Fakira lifted her hand to her cheek and pressed Felix gently against it. She smiled as his tiny body was against her cheek and as he tried to do his best to hug it back. Fakira began shaking her head slightly so that her cheek continued to rub against Felix's body. Felix felt that he was in a soft and warm heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona smiled upon seeing this. It was clear that the human and the fairy cared for each other deeply and even loved each other. Fiona had thought it was impossible for a Felaryan top predator that had been raised by its own kind could ever actually fall in love with a human, but Fakira and this human proved that it was indeed possible. \"Maybe there is still some hope for me,\" Fiona thought. She had been raised by humans and thought she was a human in a naga body. She wished for a human mate and not a naga mate that would see humans as prey. She wished for a human friend who wouldn't see her as some monster, a human she could stay with and protect from all the other predators out there. Fiona wanted to feel for a human the way Fakira felt for hers. She wanted what Fakira had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be saddened or jealous of Fakira, Fiona cut off those thoughts as soon as she realized something. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" Fiona said causing everyone to turn to her, \"I didn't catch your names or introduce myself to the two of you.\" Fiona meant the two humans who were friends with giant fairies. \"That was very rude of me not to ask for your names,\" Fiona said before slithering close to the fairies. She stopped in front of Fakira and looked down at the human in her hand. \"My name is Fiona, and what shall I call you?\" Fiona asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Felix.\" Fakira had Felix in an open palm, but still held him close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you Felix,\" Fiona said as she brought a fist in front of Felix with only her pointer finger sticking out of the fist. The finger was pointing at Felix and directly in front of him and she held it there. Felix was confused by the action as well as everyone else. Fiona tilted her head and asked, \"Don't humans shake hands when meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally realizing what Fiona meant with her action, Felix replied, \"Oh. Yes, they do. I just didn't realize...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have been clearer. I mean, I can't shake humans' hands the same way. I can only offer a finger,\" Fiona said. Normally, she didn't shake hands when meeting a new person. Fiona was the type of person that was more comfortable hugging people. Heck, she even picked up human sized strangers she just met without a second thought and would hug them against her breast. Maybe that was part of her \"clingy\" nature. However, these fairies were very protective of their humans and Fiona didn't want to offend them or scare their humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Felix grasped Fiona's finger with both hands and \"shook it\", Fiona approached Ted who was held even closer to Solita. Solita protectively held Ted in a fist where only his arms, shoulders, and head stuck out. \"And what might your name be?\" Fiona asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Ted,\" Fiona said as she \"shook his hands\", but as she did this, she looked at Ted deeply and fell into a trance-like state. Being naturally worried, Solita blocked the rest of Ted with her other hand. Fiona shook her head and apologized, \"Sorry, it's just that... Never mind. What shall we do for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, we need to know how many want cooked food. We will cook the drashigs while they're still small, because it will be easier,\" Fakira stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can cook them?\" Fiona asked with mouth watering, \"I haven't had cooked food in a long time. I would like my drashig cooked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's cooked for Fiona, Ted, and Felix as well as raw for my meal. What about you Solita?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't eat raw meat. My species of fairy are like humans. We need food cooked,\" Solita answered. Solita then turned to Fiona and asked, \"You used to eat cooked food? I thought nagas ate their food raw.\"</span></div></div>",

A powerful storm hit the lands and the thunder was unlike anything he had lived through.  A stray bolt of lighting actually struck the castle and damaged the tower it hit.  It was a storm he wouldn't soon forget.  But that horrific storm was nothing more than a mild shower to what he heard hit outside.  He felt his body continue to shake and felt like Fakira was pressing him against her chest.  Turning around, he saw Fiona hugging onto Fakira, her large breasts pressing against Fakira's hands.  She was shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said anyhting as Fiona calmed down and quickly pulled herself off of Fakira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Fiona said, \"I've hated storms for years.\"  No one said anything for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you were saying about eating cooked food,\" Felix prompted.  Fiona nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was raised by human parents,\" Fiona responded, \"They used to cook my meals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were raised by humans?\" Solita asked, not fully believing the statement.  Fiona nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was out in the woods when a storm hit and I was lost from my birth parents.  I was small, scared and alone,\" Fiona answered, \"But I was found by my human mother and father.  They cared for me and loved me dearly.\"  Felix and Fakira could see small tears forming in the corner of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they die?\" Felix asked.  Fiona shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was growing too large and the other humans we were living with were becoming worried.  So I left and came here,\" Fiona said, \"I didn't want my parents to be thrown out because of me.\"  She took a breath and looked at her company.  \"So how did you end up together?\" looking at Ted and Solita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, Fakira and Ted entered my clan's woods and didn't act like normal humans,\" Solita answered, \"They were considerate, wise, and trustworthy.\"  The words echoed strangely in Fiona's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's another fairy wood than the Fairy Kingdom?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here in Felarya,\" Solita responded, \"I'm not a fairy of this world.\"  She ended it there, not wishing to reveal her true size to this . . . ally.  That was an acceptable term for Solita's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why don't we get started on cooking?\" Fakira asked, \"Do you have some dry wood?\"  Fiona nodded and moved to one side and pulled out some small dried branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to use these to try and make a table, but when the last storm hit, I broke the branches.  Will this work?\" Fiona asked, placing the wood on the ground.  Fakira knelt down and let Felix off to look at the pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a stone we can build the fire on, so we don't damage the floor?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I don't mind if you leave some marks on the floor,\" Fiona said.  Felix nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted, mind helping?\" Felix asked.  Ted glanced at his Solita and she placed him down near Felix.  \"I think something like the roast pits back in the kitchen would work here,\" Felix said, looking at the dead birds which were taller than either human.  Ted nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that should work,\" Ted replied, \"Let's get the wood out in that order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything we can do?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, mind cleaning the birds?\" Ted asked.  Both fairies smiled and picked some of the dead birds and began removing the feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about ten minutes to finish cleaning the birds and for the boys to set up the roast pits.  With the giant ladies help, a branch was speared through the bird and set up to roast.  Felix stood before the wood and concentrated for a moment.  He opened his eyes and the wood caught on fire.  He moved the fire so the entire pit was ablaze and they began slowly cooking the birds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona was happy to smell cooking meat once more and her guests were a great distraction from the storm as it was raging outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, would you mind telling us about this person you're taking us to meet?\" Solita asked, glancing at Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we shouldn't move until after the storm passes,\" Fiona replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can still tell us about this being,\" Solita countered.  Fiona nodded.</span></div></div>",

I cannot remember how long ago it was, but I think it was at the very least around six years ago,\" Fiona informed them all, \" I had left my parents and by the time I met him, I had been living in the Bulvon Forest for a couple of years. It was a very dark time for me.\" Fiona's mind recalled those first years in the Bulvon forest. She had been completely alone for that whole duration between then and the time she had left her parents and the human village. They seemed very long and lonely years for her, and it had allowed her naga instincts to kick in more frequently than ever.  Those instincts took over at times and caused her to devour humans which only brought her into a deeper depression and filled her with terrible regret and fear for any human that should encounter her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that a dark time for you because you were lonely?\" Felix asked, seeing the expression Fiona had made after she had told them when she had first met the human and while she retreated into a silence and gazed into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that was one of the reasons,\" Fiona muttered as she continued to stare into nothingness. Protecting her parents by allowing them to stay in the safe human village wasn't the only motive for running away. She also feared her naga instincts and her naga desires of eating humans. She thought that the village would be much safer with her gone. But being alone in the savage world of the Bulvon Forest only allowed her instincts to strengthen their hold on her and she had given into the evil within herself that she tried to keep at bay by staying as far away from humans as she could. Fiona closed her eyes, but could still see all the faces of the humans she had eaten over the course of her life which brought upon a terrible feeling in the pit of her stomach and a single tear drop form the corner of both her eyes, leaving a tear trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Fiona act this way made Fakira feel sorry for the Felaryan naga, because she was clearly recalling her \"dark days\" more than the human she was supposed to talk about. Hoping to bring Fiona out of such a recall, Fakira asked, \"So what happened when you met this human you wish to bring us to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question did bring Fiona back to the whole reason she was recalling these memories and she cleared the faces that plagued her mind. \"When I first came across him, he didn't really trust me all that well. I am a naga after all and there are very few nagas out there that are friends of humans. He was a very powerful mage and was able to bind my down to the ground,\" Fiona explained. Fiona left out the part that the human's suspicion of her was well deserved, because when she first met him, she tried to eat him. It was his powerful magic binding her to the ground that gave her the time to regain control. \"I pleaded to him, and I explained to him that I was raised by humans and didn\u2019t want to eat him. Luckily, he believed my words and stayed two days with me to help me with my loneliness. He was a very kind man and I quickly saw him as a friend. He was a traveler, and though he told me very little about himself, I was fine with that. I got to see him quite regularly, because he traveled the same route at regular intervals. Though I would only see him a few days during his travels, and a few special days he would come see me, it did wonders to wiping away my loneliness. Sometimes while he traveled, his wife, or at least I think it was his wife, would stay with me a few days as well to help me. They told me that if I ever needed them, I could visit their home, and they gave me the directions. Though, I've never traveled there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This human has a wife?\" Solita asked. She found it odd that Fiona did know whether this other person was a wife or not to the human they were going to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They never told me they were married or not. They discussed very little about themselves, but she told me a few things about her past which helped me in many ways. However, they acted like husband and wife, but I've never hear of a human ever actually marrying a Felaryan Top Predator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Felaryan Predator? What was she?\" Fakira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a pantaur. I know pantaurs are a branch from the sphinx family, but she definitely must have had some sphinx blood in her, because even if she looked physically like a pantaur, she had some personality qualities of a sphinx. She had a similar past, because she was raised by a human family as well.\" Fiona remembered one of the many talks she had with the pantaur. Also being a giant Felaryan that was raised by humans, the pantaur saw humans as people, and she to have some difficulties holding her instincts back. However, the pantaur never let it take hold of her and never gave in to eating humans. The pantaur gave Fiona pointers on how to control those savage instincts, and from then on, Fiona had eaten very few humans. She still at humans from time to time and the instincts got the best of her, but she kept in control for close to 95% of her human encounters opposed to those first years alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolita, who was still a little skeptical about Fiona's story, asked, \"And what are their names? I could understand them keeping some secrets from you, but surely they've told you their names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pantaur's name is Aubree and the man's name is Arthur,\" Fiona answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the group froze and stopped what they were doing once they heard that name. They stared at Fiona with wide eyes of surprised while Fiona grew a little uncomfortable with their stares. Ted, who was no longer focused on the cooking meat, stared up at Fiona and quickly asked, \"Are you sure his name was Arthur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm very sure. Why are you all looking at me strangely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed thought about what Fiona had said about the man she called Arthur. She said he was a traveler and walked through the Bulvon Forest regularly. Did that mean his father walked through this forest to get to the dimensional gate? Plus, Fiona said he was a powerful mage. Ted now knew of the dimensional magic his father must have possessed, but maybe he had more magic. The only thing that didn't make since was the pantaur Fiona thought was his wife. <i>\"Did he have two wives? Is that why he traveled back and forth though the two realms? Hell, he might even have wives in other dimensions if this is the case.\"</i> Ted had to know if the Arthur she talked about was the same Arthur that was his father. \"Did he have a scar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, why do you ask such questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, I think the man you speak of could possibly be my father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona's eyes widened now. Was that why Ted looked familiar to her? \"Ted, may I take a closer look at you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\", but it wasn't Ted that asked this. Instead, it was Solita who got closer to Ted, ready to protect him from the naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona looked up at the suspicious fairy before telling her, \"I just want to take a closer look to see if he and Arthur have some resemblances.\" Fiona looked back down at Ted and asked, \"So, may I take a closer look at you?\" Fiona placed a hand down on the floor with her palm facing upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed looked up at Solita who was staring down at him with worry in her eyes. \"It'll be alright,\" Ted mouthed the words to Solita before walking onto Fiona's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona lifted her hand very carefully; she didn't want Solita to be angered with her any more than she probably already was. Fiona lifted Ted to her face and examined him with her different colored eyes. \"I knew you looked a bit familiar,\" Fiona finally told him, \"I can see many resemblances of Arthur in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really? Could the Arthur you speak of be my father?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you see him last?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona thought carefully. She hadn't realized this before, but she soon realized it had been a very long time since she had seen Arthur. \"I think... I think it's been close to three, maybe four years since I've seen him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you find it odd that a person that you haven't seen a person you used to see regularly in three to four years?\" Solita questioned, \"You didn't think about going to try and find out what's happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I didn't realize it's been so long until I thought about it now,\" Fiona explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he's dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Fiona started, but had no idea what to even say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still have to go and see him,\" Ted turned and informed the rest of the group, \"If what Fiona says is true, then we have to see him more than ever, because we now we know where he lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona soon set Ted down on the ground and he proceeded to approach Solita and the fire that was cooking the meat. Eventually, the meat was cooked for everyone and Fakira grew the food for Solita, Fiona, and herself, while Felix and Ted shared from Fakira and Solita. They really didn't need all the birds Fakira and Fiona captured, but Solita and Fakira knew a way to preserve the food magically and they could carry it with them. Felix blew out the fire with his wind magic. Fiona noticed this.</span></div></div>",

Felix glanced up at Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah,\" Felix replied.  Fiona smiled slightly.  Ted and Solita exchanged glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know any spells?\" Fiona asked.  Felix glanced Fakira before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I only know a few,\" Felix replied, \"I only started learning.\"  Fiona's smiled dimmed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I also am a wind mage.  I never learned much past making gusts,\" Fiona said, \"Would you please teach me what you know?\"  Fakira gave him a nod of affirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, all right,\" Felix said  \"First is the cutting spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the spell I used and made those large cuts in the trees,\" Fakira added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a useful spell,\" Fiona answered.  Felix nodded and started explaining how the spell works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBola dridders do not like water and so when large storms come they tend to flee or take cover.  And so the two dridders who were defeated by Fiona fled away from the storm.  They now watched the storm pour over the Bulvon wood growling in hatred of those that defeated them.  So when they looked around and saw a tiny, they decided to play with it and release their anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was ten minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the dridders were facing the wrath of a very angry succubus who was enjoying tormenting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I normally don't torture non-tinies,\" she said, looking at the tied up dridders.  She lifted her hand and fire appeared,  She glared at the female dridder.  Her mate was knocked out soon after the fight began. \"But as you attacked me, I'll make an exception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!  We just had a bad day and needed to have some fun with a tiny,\" the female dridder screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  What would be so bad you didn't notice my wings?\" the succubus replied darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some humans traveling with some fairies,\" the female replied, \"And then a damn tiny-loving naga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans ... and <i>fairies</i>?\" the succubus replied.  She could believe if it was a naga, or dridder, or even a succubus.  But a fairy would never be with tinies, alive tinies at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  The humans and fairies loved each other,\" the dridder replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how old were these fairies?\" the succubus entertained.  She was enjoying watching the dridder squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One was young, a child,\" the dridder replied, \"She called her human by his name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was that name?\" the succubus asked.  The dridder held her breath.  She thought back to those moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix!  She called the human boy Felix!\"  The succubus paused. A human named Felix traveling with fairies who cared about him ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It couldn't be,</i>\" she thought.  \"Are you positive that was his name?  No lies?\"    The tone had changed.  The dridder knew something had caught the succubus's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know it was,\" the dridder replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is a lie, I will hent you down and kill you,\" the succubus replied, rising up to her true height which towered over the dridders.  She took off to the air.  She needed to get to her lair and contact William.  She remembered that name when she looked over the memories of the battle and showed William where he almost died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">**********</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Fiona's, the storm had passed on and Fiona had taken well to the spell.  Fiona glanced outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take you now,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And maybe I'll meet my father,\" Ted said, smiling.  Solita smiled as well, wondering what sort of man Ted's father was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we'll be that much closer to my mother,\" Fakira whispered as Felix walked onto her hand.  She lifted up Felix and let out a heavy sigh.  She wished so much she could live with her mother and Felix, but she knew her mother would never accept Felix.  This was the only option they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona moved to the the doorway and existed.  Solita and Fakira carried their guys out and Fiona led them towards the edge of the Bulvon woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*******</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanya, the succubus entered her lair and laid down.  She closed her eyes and called on William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William glared at the council before him.  No decent ideas had come about to breaking into the Fairy Woods once more and Sanya had been firm that she wanted a good plan before trying to break into the forest again.  She was the only person he would agree to follow, even if he disagreed with the idea.  And now he was feeling tired.  But it wasn't a normal fatigue.  He knew it well and knew she wished to swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me.  If there are no decent ideas for breaking the new barrier, I will be very angry\" Lord William barked suddenly, startling those present.  They glanced at each other and rose quickly.  Once they had left, he rose and went into his bedroom and placed a sign outside it.  He moved to his bed and laid down, falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he opened his eyes once more, he found himself in a lush jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"William,\" came a voice from behind him.  He turned and saw Sanya standing in all her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" William asked as she walked towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea on how to use the portals here in Feylara to reach you,\" Sanya answered.  His eyes widened in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?  The one in the human settlement is guarded and they won't open it for a succubus and the one in the ruins won't let you near it, even in your small form,\" Willam replied.  Sanya's eyes darkened as she recalled the energy blast that damn gate had hit her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it will be because of those escaped slaves.  They're here in Feylara,\" Sanya replied,\"And I have an idea on how to use them for my escape.\"  William took a deep breath when he heard mention of those slaves who nearly killed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain,\" William replied.  Sanya smiled and began telling of her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">********</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually reached the edge of the Northern edge of the Bulvon forest where a bend in the Chordoni River was located. Fiona climbed down to the forest floor and the fairies landed on the ground beside her. Right before them, was a wide river, and to their left, much smaller and different trees along with very small vegetation along the river. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Following the river west will eventually bring you to Arthur's home,\" Fiona informed them, \"It shouldn't be too far away, because further down the river would bring humans in a dangerous territory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does it sound like you're not coming?\" Solita interrigated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't come,\" Fiona answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I haven't left the boundries of the Bulvon Forest since I've ran away from home and ended up here. I don't know if I can leave,\" Fiona explained. She was afraid of ever leaving the Bulvon Forest because of the monstrous naga instinct inside her. She didn't want to leave Bulvon Forest in hopes that she wouldn't succomb to eatting humans. Humans were safer if they weren't near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the fairies and humans she now called friends couldn't tell why Fiona was afraid, they could tell that she was affraid of leaving the Bulvon Forest. \"Fiona, Arthur and Aubree meant a lot to you, right?\" Fakira spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They helped me out of a dark time. Their help was so great that I don't think I'd ever be able to truly repay them fully for their kindness,\" Fiona replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you said these people haven't come to see you in years. Doesn't that worry you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it does. I hope that they're alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you should come with us and check on the people that mean so much to you? Can you really abandon them?\"</span></div></div>",

However, when Felix and Ted noticed this, they grabbed a hold of her, to keep her head above the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they saw the sky, and saw the stars. However, the river was still too strong for them to move to the shore, and they were held together by the rope, which had wrapped around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, another rope was tossed at them, and a voice said, \"Grab a hold you three before you reach the falls.\" At this, they heard the water starting to roar. Fearing for their lives, the three grab a hold of the rope, and found themselves being pulled to safety. When they looked at the person who had saved them, they saw a young man, about twenty years of age. \"Well,\" he said. \"Do a bit of night fishing and I catch two lads and a lass. Well, let me get that rope off of yah.\" With that, he pulled out a knife and deftlly severed the rope that had held the three together. \"There,\" he said. \"That must be a lot better, eh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, who are you?\" Ted asked, with a bit of boldness, \"You seem to talk funny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, let me introduce myself,\" The man said, as he helped the three up to their collective feet, though Fakira was reluctant to let him touch her. \"You may call me Corears, that's Core-Ars mind you. Now, while that isn't my real name, it is the closest thing to it around here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're not from here?\" Ted asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even close,\" the man, Corears, said. \"I'm from another world, much like that fairy with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that she is a fairy?\" Felix asked, wondering what the man would do to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been to her world kid,\" the man said. \"Lovely place, lovely people, especially the women, oh man, very lovely indeed. However, I hate it, and I hate the monsters. Nothing more than animals those creatures be, nagas, harpies, mermaids, angles, demons, centaurs, dryads, fairies, all of them.\" \"Hey, I'm not an animal,\" Fakira said, with anger in her voice, and starting to get her energy ready to shrink the man. \"Don't even think about it, fairy,\" the man said. \"I've killed those of your race before, from the inside, in their stomach. Besides, I'm part Falarian fairy myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, with just a snap of his fingers, Fakira became the size that she had shrank Felix the last few days. Then, just before she could move, she found herself in the man's hand, with a teleportation spell, much like one that could of sent a human into a fairy's stomach. \"What are you?\" she asked, scared for her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm every race there is in existance,\" he said. \"I touch someone of a race that I haven't encountered, I absorb their abilities, and I can change into that race. watch.\" Suddenly, wings sprouted from his back, several of them. One was of an angle, one was from a demon, one was from a harpy, and one was from a fairy as well. \"And that is not all I can do,\" he said, as scales started to cover his body, and his abdaman became that of a dridder, including eight spider-like legs. \"However, I prefer this form.\" With that, he turned into a human again. Then, he set Fakira down, and snapped his fingers again, turning her back to her previous size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you best come with me and spend the night at my place,\" Corears said. \"The woods are dangerous at night for travelers, as there are dangerous animals, bandits, and Lord William's men patroling the area from time to time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Lord William?\" Ted asked, cautiosly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know him, I despise him. If it worn't for the fact that I swore off killing people for non-survival reasons, I'd of killed him years ago,\" Corears said, with venom in his words. \"The way that monster treats others is dispicible. After all, a lord should help the people, and help out the common man, and build better roads for trade and travel, schools to educate the young, and more. Instead, you even think of something different, and you get a knife in-between your shoulder blades. Well, are you three going to come with me or what?\"</span></div></div>",

However, aside from me, and any mixed breeds out there, our race is all but finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Fakira asked, wondering how such a creature could be the last of its kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a war between those who befriended people before they asked if they could touch them and acquire their forms and those who kidnapped people to acqire their forms,\" Corears said, as a tear rolled down his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the difference?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Corears sighed, and said, \"For one of my kind to acquire the form of a different race, we'd have to absorb that person, and kill them in the process. Currently, I have over two thousand forms that are from over two thousand different races. That means that I had to kill over two thousand people to acquire those forms. In fact, if you've noticed, I have a special pair of, what you would call them, gloves, on my hands. If I wanted to acquire someone's race, and add it to my being, I'd take one off, and touch them, and I'd absorb that person's being into me, including their memories. Let's say that if I'd absorb someone who had been scared of me, I'd have that memory, but, if I had befriended them, and waited until they were on their deathbed before I absorbed them, then I would have nothing but fond memories that that person had of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can your kind do that?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My kind can live for thousands of years,\" Corears said. \"Waiting several decades for someone to die of old age was no problem for those who took the patient route to acquire a person's form, as it was part of our rules, to not take the form of another unless they were dieing, or they were a threat to your life, or the lives of those you cared for, as there were those who had fallen for the person whose form they wanted to acquire. Also, we can also have children with those of other races, though they tend to be of the race that the other person is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, there was a large group who forsaked that golden rule, and would absorb people of other races left and right, with no regards as to what it meant to our relations with those of the other races. Where once our kind had been welcomed as friends, who respected the lives of others, we were now feared or hated, all because of these monsters, who had no respect for the lives of others. As a result, we went to war with those who had been our kin, sibling against sibling, cousin against cousin, friend against friend, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the end, it came down to me, and one other, who was a Taker, as us Befrienders had called them. Well, I killed him, and absorbed him, as that is the only way for an Acquirer to die, is if another absorbs him. However, the sad thing was, the man had been my brother, and I had tried to pursade him to end his foolishness, before he stopped listening and attacked me, so I had to defend myself. As a result, I swore that I'd never take another person's life to get their form, unless my life was in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, the man sighed, and the group walked in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, they came upon a small hut, one that looked like something that a pesant would live in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we are,\" Corears said, as he opened up a door. \"Make yourselves at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the inside look like?</span></div></div>",

Of course, the only way to enter is to be invited in by the one who made it. A very usefull safety precausion. Not only does it keep people from discovering my location, but, if some one is after you, and I let you in, and shut the door, when they open the door on their end, they will see only a normal hut, with no one in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if someone tried to come in?\" Felix asked. \"What would happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends.\" Corears said. \"If they were just looking for a place to stay the night, they will find some very ordanary rations that they can eat, and a straw bed with a deerskin covering to sleep on. In the morning, I'll be at a table, and offer them breakfast, and tell them that since I came home late, and found them asleep in my bed, I decided to let them stay for the night, and not wake them. However, if they tried to steal something, like say some money that I have on the table next to the food, SNAP! they find themselves to be not only shrunken, but sent to one of my cages in my lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by lab?\" Ted asked, as the only other person he knew of, that used that word, was Lord William, when he told the guards to send some unfortinate slave, or prisoner, to a dark and horrid place where only the screems of the person were heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's were I work on my expariments,\" Corears said. \"But, don't worry, I don't do anything to those who are in the cages, well, nothing that would be life threatening at any rate. Instead, I just check them over, and put them under a spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of spell?\" Felix asked, wondering what he and the other two had gotten themselves in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A transformation spell,\" Corears said. \"I can change one's gender, and, or, race. I can turn a man into a woman, and a human into a fairy, a fairy into a naga, a naga into a neko, a neko into a kitsune, and so on. Of course, the spell lasts, at most, two days, unless I reaply it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might be usefull to have,\" Ted said. \"If only until we get out of Lord William's land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't try that,\" Corears said. \"Lord William is very skilled in the most evil of magics, and can see past any disguises that you have on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean dark magic, like necronamcy?\" Ted asked, wondering just how powerful his former master was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that type of magic isn't nesicaraly evil,\" Corears said. \"ALL magic can be used for good and evil.In fact, I know a necromancer who is concidered a hero to his village, because he was able to ask the viliagers who had died in the past to awaken from their slumber and protect their living decendants from a large horde of bandits. Also, I know a man, who practiced what most call Holy magic, who could bring someone back to true life, who would bring people back to life, so that he could kill them again, and again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you mean by evil magic?\" Felix asked, worried about his own magical abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, by evil magic, I mean when it is used for selfish gain,\" Corears said, as he looked the boy over. \"If you use your magic to help others, no matter what type it is, then I would concider it to be good magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what magic I have?\" Felix asked. \"I haven't used it much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest,\" Corears said. \"I don't know. You are unlike any being that I have seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Fakira asked. \"I thought that you said that you have the forms of over two thousand races.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady, My kind encountered thousands, upon thousands of beings of different races,\" Corears said, causing the young fairy's eyes to widen, as well as those of the other two. \"My kind documented every race that they ever encountered, and every year a new one was discovered. They documented the phsyology, the diet, the cultures that the beings had with each other, their languages, everything. Every year something new was discovered, even those who had already been documented could become different somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was my world discovered?\" Fakira asked, wondering if the man could take her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA, your world was discovered three thousand years ago,\" the man said. \"In fact, your world was classifided as Allmal by us. In our language, that means, 'Planet of Evil People who take the Lives of Others for Selfish Reasons.' The explorers documented case upon case of canibalism of the various sentiant beings eating others, for non-survival reasons. Now, while the canibalism itself, if it had been for a reason like the person was starving to death, and all that was avaliable to eat was another sentiant being, would of been understandable. However, there is plenty of non-sentiant animals in the forests, seas, mountians, deaserts, and so forth, that your kind could of eaten. When we found out it was because they liked the taste of those other sentiant beings, we changed the name. We had been thinking of calling it Allbon, Planet of Large Beatiful Women, as the explorers tended to locate large females with large chests for the most part. After we found out what your world was really like, it took a lot of effort to not just send our forces there to take it over to make sure that every race was safe from each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were thinking about taking my world over?\" Fakira asked with shock in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Corears said, as he glared at the young fairy. \"In fact, I was in favor of taking it over. Unfortanatly, we had our own problems, from within our own people. Our civil war was the only reason we didn't take it over. Now, since I am the only one left of my kind, I'm launching saomething of a one-man-war against your world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Farika asked, as she looked at the Acquirrer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your people are savages,\" Corears said. \"And I don't mean by technology levels, as there are advanced cities in your world, but because of how you act towards other beings around you. Depending on how they act towards those around them, I could call those who live in a cave and make stone tools civilized and those whose technology is way beyond this world's own savages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" Ted asked. \"How would you classify our world?</span></div></div>",

I picked that information up from a naga that I absorbed when she tried to eat me over three hundred years back, in Felarya. If I can have that information in my head, and still know about her last few meals, and what they tasted like, imagian what it would be like if I did that to Lord William, who is a thousand times worse than that. In a sence, I'd become him. This world, and all of those that I know about, would become nothing more than things for that monster to play with. If he was just a bandit, who just prayed on travelers along the road, I could deal with it.

I got her pregnant, and he was born within a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how could that evil man be your son?\" Felix asked. \"You and him are nothing alike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty years ago, you would of said differently. You would of said, 'You must be a proud father to have a young man like that for a son.' Your sister or daughter would of wanted to be his betrothed, and all that, for he was a good man then,\" Corears said, with a sigh. \"And I was proud to call him my son, and I'd taught him a great deal about magic. Name a spell and that boy could do it, levitation, teleportation, illusion, lighting fire with his mind, lightning bolts from his fingers, bringing the dead back to life, both true life and undead life, though we used things like mice and rats for that type of magic, everything. But something happened twenty years ago, and he started to go down the path of darkness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Farika asked, wanting to know more about the man who'd captured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His wife and daughter were brutally murdered in front of his eyes,\" Corears said, as he sat down in a chair. \"That was the whole thing that started him down that path, especially when he found himself unable to revive them, as he was missing an important element, the blood that was on the blades of the bandits who did the deed. As a result, he went after them, originally to retrieve the blades, but when he found out that the blades had been tossed in the river, and thus clean off, well, he killed them in ways that I dare not describe. At first, I tried to consoul him, and that sort of stuff, like any father would, but then, he went and destroyed an entire bandit village, in cold-blood. True some of them deserved death, but this was nothing short of murder, as it was that, murder. After that, I was unable to reach my son. He'd been killed and replaced by that, that, that monster. Hell, I even tried to kill him once, so that I could erase his memory of that whole event, and bring back my son, but, at the last moment, I found myself unable to release the arrow that I had pointed at his throat, and he cut my head off, as we'd been fighting each other a month after he killed those in that bandit village. Needless to say, he thinks that I'm dead, as he thought that I was just some powerful magician. He never knew that I wasn't human, and that I can't die, like he can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is William a, whatever you are?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An aquirerer, no,\" Corears said. \"His mother was a human, just like he is, though he has the gift, or curse, of magic. It was very rare that a child of an aquirerer, and someone of another race, had the abilities like that of a full-blooded aquirerer, such as the ability to absorb others. True they might of had magical abilities, but so do many other races out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he stood up and said, \"Now, you might want to come upstairs with me.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following day Felix woke up early, even after the late night last night what little sleep he had received had refreshed him, he was looking forward to the day, and even a little curious about the girl in the dungeon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, the usual watered down porridge, Felix went about his duties. This morning he was pulling weevils out of the wheat of the last shipment, something that was neglected in the oats eaten by the slaves, it was a simple but tedious job that entailed putting each individual grain into an empty barrel and throwing the black specks that were weevils out onto the grass. Felix settled down to the monotonous job until there was a cry from someone nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked around and saw another of the children with his hands over his eyes wailing \u201cI've gone blind!\u201d over and over, a few of the other children had got up to comfort him. Felix got up to help and immediately realised that he had been muttering that song under his breath, the one that the girl had been singing when he saw her yesterday. After a few minutes he calmed down and began to regain his sight. People went back to their sorting, though his temporary blindness was certainly the main discussion point. Not five minutes after that people began experiencing mild stomach cramps and again Felix realised that he was muttering the words under his breath the moment his mind began to wander. The morning passed for those surrounding Felix as sudden stomach cramps and blindness and rumours of plagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt noon Felix remembered that he had to feed the girl, it was so hard to think of her as a monster no matter what he was told, so he went to the kitchens and luckily evaded the chef this time. With another packet of meat over his back Felix made his way down the corridors to the dungeon where the girl was chained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time there were three guards, one now wore a bandage across his eyes and when Felix spoke to the one with the keys to get him to open the door the guard didn't seem to hear at all, he turned to the third man who flashed several hand signals to the second man and the second man turned and opened the door. It struck Felix that they must be blind, deaf and mute. Had the day been better Felix would have laughed at the reference to a children's story, but having all his friends sporadically going blind and doubling up from stomach cramps did not leave Felix in a laughing mood. He had learned however that slaves who let emotions affect their actions were punished quickly and painfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix entered the door and stepped in. When saw the girl again a flash of anger washed over him. \u201cWhat did you do to me!\u201d Careful to stay out of range of the chain bolted to the floor he took a step forward. \u201cWhat!\u201d The girl backed into the corner and cowered there. Felix had found an outlet for the past five years. He was going to tame her. All he could remember Lord William had been the closest thing to a father, poor excuse though he was and so Felix knew little of kindness or even disobedience. Just fear and a simmering withdrawn hatred. And now a way to release it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix began to chant \u201cEthna Hepalu Calum\u201d Concentrating on the girl, curiosity replaced by the rush of releasing pent up anger. The girl was doubling up and crying out, chains clinking as she rocked forward onto the ground. Felix felt something else too, as he chanted he felt as if thousands of tiny lines of energy were suddenly bursting to life throughout his body, he could almost see the line that traveled to the girl from him, and others that fanned out from his body, he concentrated and more of them moved to the girl, causing her to let out another shriek of pain. Felix stopped and said \u201cEat\u201d and threw a piece of meat at her. Tipping the remainder on the floor just in reach, if she stretched. Felix turned to go. Before he left the door he said one thing to the girl, \u201cTomorrow you will tell me\u201d Leaving and shutting the door behind him.<br>\r\nThat night Felix lay on his bed, those lines of energy still pulsing, but not as much as when he had been chanting. He was sure he wasn't doing it without thinking this time though, it was just there. Eventually though he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a new dream that night, one he would remember for the rest of his life. In the dream it was night time and he was younger, maybe four. He was standing on the ramparts of some castle, hiding in a corner near a tower. There were troops on the tower, and also a man and a woman hand in hand, the troops were busy preparing but the man and the woman turned to each other, wrapped their arms around each other and Felix could hear them crying, could feel himself crying too. Then they turned and faced outward and Felix looked beyond the ramparts and saw an army, men in red and black armour, both absolutes either red or black no combinations of the two. There were siege weapons in a row behind the front, mostly ladders or towers, no mangonels or trebuchets at all. Two battering rams that Felix could see. But most fearsome was the creature that stood behind the army, over the hight of the walls he was blood red and covered with enormous scales, leathery wings folded behind his back and teeth that reached almost beyond what his gaping maw could contain. It was the eyes however that terrified Felix, they burned with crimson fire. A horn sounded and the Demon roared and the army advanced, the ladder troops proceeding at a run while the towers rumbled forward with men sheltering behind them. The man and the woman began glowing, thousands of lines covered their bodies and pulsed with extraordinary power, thunder clapped and the bolt of lightning struck one of the towers which began burning and collapsed almost instantly, another bolt of lightning struck and another tower collapsed, the man and woman began to lift off the ground, stopping about three feet above the stone, still clasping the others hand, they extended the other hand and lightning began arcing between them, increasing to form a ball of crackling energy that flew at the giant and exploded on it's chest forcing it back a pace, for a hundred foot monster a pace is quite significant. The Demon responded with a ball of fire that streaked toward the wall and struck something invisible that curved inwards, it struck Felix that though the fire itself was burning brightly nothing else lit up, as if the fire shed no real light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe firewall continued to bend inwards until it touched the man and the woman and they were consumed. Then it vanished and the demon stepped back, it's impossibly deep and terrible voice carrying all the way to the wall. \u201cI have played my part, now you play yours.\u201d He then vanished in a burst of fire. The rest was a chaotic blur as the soldiers reached the walls and began killing the men defending the walls, not without their share of losses but numbers won out in the end. At one point a man had advanced on Felix with his sword dripping in someone else's blood. Felix felt those lines of energy again pulsing in his arms and legs, in his head and in time with the beating of his heart. And the thought that existed so powerfully in his head. Felix screamed \u201cGet Away from me\u201d at the man and the lines converged and he flew backwards off the wall. Three more men met the same fate before Felix was bound and gagged and blindfolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later he was grabbed and carried somewhere and dumped on soft wet earth, and heard a man reporting \u201cSir we found something you might like, lost four good men getting him, anyone who came near him got thrown off the wall, didn't see what did it though. Mayhap he's like the Archmages and can do magic\u201d that sounded like a joke in the mans voice but Felix realised it must be true, at least about the magic, he didn't know what an Archmage was, maybe they were that man and that woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice replied \u201cWe'll take him back to the lost plane, the Lord William likes pets and maybe in a decade he will be ours anyway. Especially if we give him a human mage as a pet. He'd like that almost as much as an angel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third voice said \u201cI'll take him, I'm supposed to be getting close and this might earn me a generalship from him.\u201d That sounded like an irony. Confirmed by the others simultaneous replies of \u201cAs you say Grandmaster.\u201d The dream ended there but in it's dying moments Felix recognized that voice. It was General Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix woke up and cried into his blanket, the moment he woke up he had realised what he had seen. He knew what the man and the woman were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were his parents. Felix thought of the girl in the dungeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't want to limit what happens in the next chapter so I'll continue the story in option 1 and whoever gets option 2 can decide for themselves what happens next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chilotaurs- Chilotaurs resemble a cross between an human and a giant centipede. They vary in size but average between 40-120 feet in length. Their human halves have deeply tanned skin, pointed ears, and two long antennae protruding from their foreheads that are always in motion. Their function is to alert the chilotaur to any threat or food source nearby. They are very sensitive to movement to a range of about 60 feet. They are longer for males to help them locate mates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir centipede bodies are various shades of colour ranging from a very light tan to deep black or red. The number of legs varies but most have around 40 pairs. The first pair of legs are actually a delivery system for a very nasty venom which is why most predators leave chilotaurs alone. Effects are paralysis followed by difficulty in breathing and death in a matter of minutes for human sized victims. Larger predators may escape with severe pain and nausea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever chilotaurs do have their weaknesses. They can\u2019t stand bright light of any kind and prefer to avoid travelling in daylight if they can help it. They prefer dark, moist environments and are usually found on the forest floor among the leaf litter or in caves or in ruined buildings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChilotaurs aren\u2019t fussy about their diet. If its slow enough to catch and small enough to be swallowed, its lunch! Favourite food items include small mammals, flightless birds, reptiles of all descriptions and various fruits and vegetables. They are particularly fond of small arboreal frogs and doesn\u2019t seem to mind the skin secretions at all from the poisonous varieties. Although rare, it has been known for greater specimens to turn man-eater. These individuals can be a real hazard for adventurers exploring cave systems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagas- Nagas are half human, half snake people. Their size varies a lot, ranging from 6 feet \"head to ground\", to about \"120 feet head to ground\", with very different body lengths. (The creature is goint to be a giant naga, though.) Giant nagas are very dangerous and pose an enormous threat to adventurers on Felarya. They are fast and agile predators, surprisingly silent for their size and possess huge appetites. They love to ambush convoys and small groups of humans. A typical giant naga eats about 5 humans a day to stay healthy, and many more in order to feel satiated. They eat animals if the hunt is going poorly, and some have even included fruits and vegetables in their diet. Nagas have very strong stomachs. Not only it can digest just about everything, but it's very resistant to damage as well. Once an unfortunate adventurer finds himself trapped inside one, there is really only one thing that can happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn battle, nagas mostly use their tail, along with their bare fists and sometimes a weapon. A naga's tail is tremendously strong, and can do great damage when swung, crushing their foes between the ground and their tough scales. In spite of their physical powers nagas are usually peaceful towards other creatures and are not really a war-like race. The major exception is when dealing with dridders, who have been their natural enemies since time immemorial. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lord William stared down at Felix and smiled due to Felix's obvious fear. \"The creature that General Ethan has captured for me is the most dangerous creature in all of Felarya,\" Lord William replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix quickly became confused. \"Felarya?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William's wicked smile disappeared when he saw Felix's fear turn into confusing. Lord William's expression turned into annoyance since he would have to explain what Felarya was. Normally Lord William didn't bother with explaining things to his slaves, they were slaves after all and didn't need to know anything, but Lord William loved torturing and bringing fear into the hearts of his slaves. In explaining Felarya and the creature Ethan had captured, Lord William knew that he would put fear in the slave boy and the boy would more likely be more efficient and cautious in his work, or the boy would be too scared and do a terrible job so that Lord William will have the pleasure of putting him to death or punishing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, Lord William explained, \"Felarya is the most dangerous place for humans to go to. It is another world like our own, but its wilder and mostly untamed. Nearly every creature there are larger than humans and eat humans. Even some bugs are be enough to eat humans.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix gulped and Lord William could see the slave boy's fear which caused Lord William's wicked smile to reappear. \"There is no regard for humans that live in Felarya. Even the large sentient creatures of Felarya eat humans,\" Lord William continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, if their sentient, then their intelligent. Why would they eat a human? It would be murder,\" Felix argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felaryan don't see things the way humans do here. Felaryan consider beings of their own size people and things smaller than them as food and not a person,\" Lord William explained, \"Since humans are smaller than them, they don't see us as humans. Only as small creatures that could be swallowed whole and can fill their stomachs. They feel that creatures that are that small can't be anything else other than food. They have no regrets eating humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was completely horrified by this statement. <i>\"How could a sentient being eat another? Even if a sentient being was smaller than me, I'd never eat it. It's murder. How can Felaryans be so cruel and heartless,\"</i> Felix wondered. For the first time in his life, he had realized there was a place far worse than Lord William's castle and Felix didn't want to leave the safety of the castle and end up in Felarya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked at the wooden crate being pushed in the cell by strong men and Felix started to wonder what terrible and cruel monster was in the crate. The men pushed it through the large gates of the cell, about the same size as the main gate to the outer wall, and closed them again. Felix knew the men were opening the crate and fighting off the creature to get it in the chains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William followed Felix's gaze and said, \"The creature Ethan captured is the most dangerous sentient being in Felarya. I will tame it though, and it will be my slave and devour my enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A giant naga,\" Lord William informed Felix, \"But it's different from our giant nagas. These nagas love the taste of humans and once one eats one, they have can't help themselves and have to eat more. Some eat up to five humans a day. Nagas from Felarya are always hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They also look more human than our nagas,\" Lord William continued, \"Their upper body is fully human as opposed to our nagas that have human structure for an upper body but have snake skin and a snake head. Felaryan nagas have fully human upper halves and a long tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has this naga eaten a human yet?\" Felix questioned. He was worried that the naga was going to try everything in its power to eat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too young. It's not large enough to eat a human,\" Lord William explained, \"So it doesn't have the craving, because it hasn't eaten a human, yet. The naga is about five years of age and only about ten feet tall from the head to the ground when upright, but the tail behind it is at least twice as long as its height. Though, the naga will grow quickly. When a Felaryan naga becomes five years of age, they have sudden growth spurts till they grow the proper size for a five year old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How large is that?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About seventy feet from ground to head,\" Lord William stated, \"It will be that large within a month and will have random growth spurts till it reaches that height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men exited out of the human sized door of the cell and Lord William said, \"It's time for you to feed it and bring it water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix noticed the food and water on a cart near the door and Felix gulped. If a five year old naga's true height was seventy feet, how large was its adult size? Felix took the car and pushed it in.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix's eyes adjusted to the low light and looked around the dungeon. The room was tall, well over 100 feet tall. There were some skeletons still hanging from chains on the walls. He gulped and remembered why he was there. He expected to be attacked quickly, but there was no attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to look very far to find the naga. Even if he couldn't see it, he would have been able to hear it. The naga itself stood just as how Lord William described it. Ten feet tall from the head to the ground when upright, and the tail behind it was at least twice as long as its height, though he had to guess as the naga was coiled up in a corner, crying. That was when he found out it's gender. It was a girl naga. Kinda hard to miss it with her crying. For a moment, Felix was astounded by how she looked. Her scales were a mixture of dark gray and yellow that formed a pattern, her hair was down to her shoulders, and was blueish green hue. Then she shifted and looked right at him with one of her eyes. It's eye held a serpentine pupil, with the iris being golden in color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reaction to seeing him, the naga girl just coiled in on herself, trying to become as small as possible. Felix bit the inside of his cheek and wondered what he should do. Should he just push the cart towards her and be done with it? Or should he try to talk with the giant naga girl? After all, she had to be scared to death, and if she was anything like he was, then she would probably need a friend to get through this. Plus, if he convinced her not to eat humans, then there might be hope yet! He...just hoped that she wouldn't just fool him into dropping his guard and then eat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia had been crying ever since she had been captured, especially when the tiny people started hitting her with bits of steel and other things, forcing her into her current state right now. Ever since, she had been sobbing, waiting for the next bad thing to happen. When she heard the doors open, she didn't bother to look, as she as certain it was more tiny people trying to hurt her. When she heard something being pushed in, she stopped her crying long enough to look. It was just one tiny person, this one being smaller than the rest of them, and it was pushing something towards her. When it got close enough to her, she saw that it was food and water. She was starting to get hungry, but she had been ignoring that because of her current situation. She wondered why this tiny person was feeding her, while the others were hurting her. Should she ask it? Or would it be better not to talk. She had to think quickly, otherwise she was certain that it would leave as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix thought it best to not talk to the naga girl...at least not right now. He had other duties to tend to, but he knew that he would be back tonight, after all, it was now apart of his duties to care for the naga girl. He turned around to go, but he heard movement behind him, and before he knew it, the naga girl had grabbed him. Felix's mind started to go haywire, with almost a million bad things going through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia had been just about to say something when she saw that the tiny person was leaving. She made her decision in a split second and decided to grab him before he left. She had just reached him in time too, as she could feel the chains that were around her almost yank her back. She looked at the tiny person in her hands and noticed that he was starting to panic. She looked at him with her eyes filled with sadness and fear of her own, and opened her mouth to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix saw that she was opening her mouth, and instantly shut his own eyes, fearing that he was going to be eaten. He was too scared to remember that Lord William had told him that the naga was still too young to eat humans. Instead of being eaten, Felix heard a soft, young, feminine voice plead, \"Please...tell me what's going on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix opened his eyes in shock. \"<i>D-did...she just...talk to me?</i>\" Felix thought and he searched his brain for any other explanation for what he heard. When Felix looked back up at her face with a shockeed expression, she repeated her question. \"C-can you put me down first...please?\" Felix asked her, obviously frightened at where he was currently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia noticed that her actions were scaring the tiny person, but she didn't want him to run away. She didn't think she'd be able to catch him this time if he did. \"Only if you promise not to run...\" Cillia said, trying to hold back the tears that were still coming from earlier. Unless he said he would, she wasn't going to put him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knew that if he said yes, and then ran away, he could kiss trying to be friends with her out the window. \"I have to go and do other things, but I'll be back later. If I don't leave now, I'll be punished. I promise that I will talk to you then.\" Felix said, hopefully she would understand and let him down. He saw her eyes shifting to the sides, like she was thinking on it.</span></div></div>",

She was taught that tiny people that could be swallowed whole weren't people at all and just a snack. She was told by her mother that tiny people were of no other use to her other than a food source since they were too small, too small to be considered people. Her mother even described the pleasurable sensations that came when swallowing a human whole: how they'd try to fight back her tongue when it was too powerful, how they'd squirm around and try to escape even when they slide down her throat, and especially the sensation of their tiny fists pounding the inside of her stomach without any chance of escape. The way Cillia's mother had described the experience of her first eaten human made Cillia feel as though she couldn't wait to be gigantic like her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Cillia was still too small to swallow something human-sized in one bite, and since she was five years old and just starting her growth spurts, she wouldn't be big enough to do so till those growth spurts finished by the end of the month. Not only was Cillia unable to eat a human-sized creature, but her mother never caught her any tinies, creatures on Felarya that were humanoid but had the average height of about three inches. So, Cillia would just have to wait till she grew large enough, though she wanted to experience it badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Cillia being a dangerous Felaryan naga and still larger than the average human, she was still not big enough to swallow them and that made them people in her eyes, because they weren't too small just yet. Even though Felix was doll-sized to her, he was still a person, and an older boy at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Cillia would respect her elders and do as they say, even if that older person was still a kid like herself. However, her young and desperate mind wasn't listening to Felix's argument. She was very scared, because she was suddenly brought to an unfamiliar place and captured by humans for seemingly no reason at all. She was now in a terrifying place, chained up, and her clothes stripped from her. She wanted answers, and when a five year old was desperate for answers, they were going to try and get it by any means necessary. She couldn't be told no, or in this case \"I'll tell you later\", especially not from someone the size of a doll.  \"I'm not putting you down till you tell me what's happening,\" Cillia demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was worried that this would happen. The naga was young and still ten feet tall. <i>\"What was I thinking? Did I honestly believe something so young and large would see me as a person when I'm so little? Why would something so large listen to me,\"</i> Felix thought to himself as he was held in the air by two large hands positioned under his arms. Felix looked up fearfully at the large youthful fast of the giant naga. There was anger in it and Felix feared what the naga would do to him if he didn't tell her what was happening to her. It was his first day feeding the naga and it seemed as though he was in a life or death situation already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia noticed the human's fear. It was completely frightened of her. \"Please, tell me what's happening. I promise to put you down,\" Cillia told Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this statement, Felix realized that the naga was desperate for answers. This naga seemed to be five years old. He remembered some of the guests that had entered Lord William's castle. Some had kids of that age. He remembered one that really wanted something and did whatever he could to convince her father to give it to her. <i>\"The naga's not angry. It just really wants something like the kid. This is still potentially dangerous since she'll do whatever it takes to convince me, but there's still hope that I might be able to befriend this creature. Looks like I have no other choice except to answer her questions. I hope she doesn't have too much. I really have to go,\"</i> Felix realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix sighed, \"What do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I? Why am I here? What's...?\" Cillia asked quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, one question at a time!\" Felix yelled over the naga's voice. There was some silence before Felix calmly answered, \"You're in Lord William's dungeons in his castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... Who's Lord William?\" Cillia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a human, but he's a monster. He's a terrible ruthless man who doesn't care who he hurts or kills to get what he wants,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia shivered when she heard the word monster. She began to worry why a monster wanted her. Forgetting that Felix had told her that Lord William was technically human, she asked, \"Does the monster want to eat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Felix replied, \"He wants to keep you here and make you his slave and weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave? What's that?\" Cillia was confused by the word, but she didn't like the sound of it when it was said with the word weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a slave. Lord William owns me as if I'm property. I have to do whatever he wants me to do, no matter how much I dislike it,\" Felix informed the naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't like doing something, why don't you just don't do it?\" Cillia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I disobey, he hurts me badly. I have no choice but to do what he asks,\" Felix told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants me to be his slave? I don't want to be a slave,\" Cillia cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you can find a way to escape, you may not have much of a choice,\" Felix sadly informed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, why me?\" Cillia questioned with tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a giant naga. He wants to use you as a weapon to kill people and eat them,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't want to kill people. Please, don't let the monster make me his slave,\" Cillia pleaded to the human in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix couldn't believe what he was witnessing. This large, yet young, creature was pleading to him for his help. He never thought something so large would do that to him. Not know what else to say, Felix said, \"I'll do what I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise?\" Cillia questioned.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFelix nodded and said, \"Now, I really have to get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you promise to come back?\" Cillia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm the one that has to feed you. I'll come back this evening, and we'll see each other everyday, I promise,\" Felix told the giant naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia bent down and reluctantly put the human down on his feet and removed her hands. She looked down at the human with sad eyes and he looked back at her. \"I'll be back later with dinner and we can talk much longer,\" Felix assured the giant naga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix turned and began to push the empty cart away, but Cillia ordered, \"Wait! What's you name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix,\" Felix answered, \"What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cillia,\" Cillia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Cillia, I'll see you again at dinner,\" Felix said before he pushed the cart again and left the cell.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Felix had left Cillia's cell and left to go clean Lord William's library, he thought back to what had just transpired. Contrary to what Lord William thought, the giant naga that he had was only a child, an infant. She still saw humans as people, and not food...for now. He wondered, was it possible to have Cillia keep him in that view? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his cleaning, he stole a book away from one of the shelves that lined the wall. While Felix only had basic reading skills, the book had plenty of detailed pictures to make up for that. It showed various giant nagas in many different poses. Almost all of them had a human or some such small sentient being held over an open mouth. However, there was one that had a giant naga lying on their back, apparently taking a nap, with a human with them as well. That gave him hope. What he didn't, or rather couldn't read, was that the chances of befriending a giant naga were very low. The trick was to make sure that the giant naga kept thinking you as a friend, but once they thought that of you, you were safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix quickly put the book back where he got it from and continued to dust and clean, making it look like he had never even cracked the book open. He had a busy day ahead of him, several of the jobs were quite tiring indeed. But he had to keep his promise to Cillia. Not because he had to, but because he made a vow to never break a promise. After living a life of a slave, Felix had learned many things about humans, more so than any others could. He learned that there were all types of humans, and the majority of the ones that he knew, they were deceivers, liers, thieves, slavers and murderers. Those were the kind of people that Lord William dealt with. He went to any lengths to make sure that his power was absolute. Felix hated him and the ones he dealt with behind the curtains. Just because he was a slave didn't mean he couldn't hear what was going on. It was because of this that he had made the vow to never break a promise, He did not want to be anything like Lord William or the ones he dealt with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, no matter how many times Felix thought of a way to escape, he could never do it by himself, and the other slaves were already broken. He could tell just by looking at their eyes. They had already lost their will to fight a long time ago. Most even wondered how Felix could stay as hopeful as he had been in this hell on earth. However, with some help with Cillia, Felix just knew that they would be able to get out of there, someway...somehow. But for any of his escape plans to work, that he was now reformulating, he would need to know if Cillia would think of him as a friend from then on...and not food when she grew bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia, for her part, was terribly lonely. While she may have been an only child, that much may have been true, but she almost always had at least one person or thing to keep her company until she woke up in a strange place. It was mainly because of this that she had snatched the human all of a sudden, she didn't want to be left alone. She had been comforted by his assurance that he was going to come back, everyday, but that didn't stop her from being lonely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, it really wasn't a surprise that she was curled up in the furthest corner that the chains would allow her to curl up in and waited, staring at the door. As she was a giant naga, she had a sort of sixth sense for where living things were at, so she got ready to move when she felt one start to approach the door. She wasn't adapt at sensing who the living creature was, not yet. She had heard tales of another giant naga who was so good at sensing the location of living creatures that she could not only tell how far away they were, but their general size too, even when she was asleep! She hoped that she would be as good as that naga someday, that way her current predicament would never happen again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The iron bared human sized door squeaked open and the familiar cart of meat and water came rolling out. Cillia rose from er curled position. Her tail was still curled on the ground, but she was straightening her upper body upwards while holding herself up with her arms and hands. She waited, hoping that it was Felix coming through that door. Sure enough, pushing that cart was the small human she had met and talked with earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia was excited and relieved upon seeing him due to her loneliness of being in the cell. Cillia shot up and slithered towards the front of the cell, completely forgetting about the chains around her wrists, midsection, and neck. She was just too glad to finally see someone that she could talk to and no longer be by herself. Cillia quickly slithered towards Felix which scared Felix a bit seeing a ten foot tall naga child charging towards him. \"Fel...\" was all that Cillia could say before the chains stopped her voice by choking her. The chains pulled her back and she fell backwards. The chains had hurt Cillia, especially her neck. Cillia clutched the chain cuff around her neck and began to cry. She was five years old after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Felix saw Cillia start to cry, he quickly got over his fear of her when he had seen her charging. Cillia had been going full force and it looked painful just to watch the chains stop her and force her back. Plus, Felix was a very kindhearted person and he couldn't just stand there and watch Cillia cry. He felt that he needed to comfort her. Felix quickly pushed the cart forward and stopped pushing it once it was in her reach. Felix then hurried to Cillia. It was a very odd thing to see something as large as Cillia crying, but Felix wasn't thinking about her shear size. She was a young child, and it was natural for a child to cry when they were hurt. She was a child, was all that Felix thought about in his mind, and he just couldn't let her cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia was curled up with her back turned to Felix, crying uncontrollably. Felix knelt down, even though her back and side were large and vast being ten feet tall. Felix placed his hand on her bare shoulder and began rubbing it. Cillia's cries called slightly due to the fact she knew someone was there trying to give her comfort. Amidst her cries, Cillia turned her head to look at the small hand on her shoulder. Suddenly with lightning fast speed, Cillia turned around and grabbed Felix. While she was now lying on her other side, she pulled Felix against her torso and hugged him firmly as she continued to cry. It looked a lot like a child hugging a teddy bear where Cillia was the child and Felix was the teddy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was in a state of shock for a few moments since he had been on his knees and then before he could blink, he was in the arms of the naga being pressed against her body's soft skin. However, Felix was able to escape his state of shock quicker than usual because he could still hear the cries of the naga child. Felix began patting whatever his hands could reach while in the naga's embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Felix found his voice and tried to sound as calm and caring as he could, \"Did those chains hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Cillia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia stayed lying on her side, but she lifted her arms closer to her chest so that Felix would be pushed upwards and be able to look at her neck. Felix touched the cuff around her neck and peeked between the metal and Cillia's neck. The skin was a little red, but it didn't look like there was much permanent damage. \"Does it still hurt?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... a little,\" Cillia answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was able to fit his hand in between the cuff and Cillia's neck. The reason for the space was so that Cillia would grow into it and that they might not have to change the chain cuffs too quickly due to the growth spurts she'd experience. Felix rubbed the slightly red neck and Cillia twitched a little. \"Does it still hurt?\" Felix asked while continuing to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it... it kind of tickles,\" Cillia replied with a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, does this tickle?\" Felix asked as he intentionally began to tickle her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Cillia said as she began to laugh uncontrollably. Cillia began to roll and squirm from the tickling on her throat. She never rolled onto her belly though and never squeezed Felix too hard. Despite being very ticklish, she seemed to be conscious of Felix on her. Eventually, she put her hands under Felix's arms and lifted him up as she was on her back. \"Stop tickling me,\" Cillia giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all better now?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia thought about it, and she didn't feel any pain anymore. \"I feel good now,\" Cillia told and it was all thanks to Felix distracting her from the pain. Cillia pulled Felix into a hug again and whispered, \"Thank you, Felix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Cillia,\" Felix replied as he laid his body against Cillia's skin and hugged whatever his arms could wrap around. It was an odd experience for the both of them, but they enjoyed it. Cillia found it odd that she was befriending a human so quickly. She had thought that she would see her first human when she was large enough to eat it and be able to hunt with her parents. However, she was introduced to humans quite early due to her being captured and put in a strange place. All of them had been mean to her except for Felix. Due to her situation of being alone with Felix being the only kind person around and her being too small to view humans as food, it seems quite natural for Cillia to befriend Felix. In fact, Cillia began feeling as though Felix was like a big brother to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix also found it odd to become friends to a giant naga. A few months ago, he would have never believed it was possible to have a giant naga as his first friend ever. Especially after what Lord William had said about Felaryan nagas. Yet, here he was befriending a giant naga. He just hoped that Cillia would continue to see him as a friend and that he would be like the human in the picture he had seen with the girl lying on the naga's stomach causally without fear of being eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia stopped hugging Felix which aloud him to sit up and st cross legged on her. Cillia turned her head and saw the cart. She stretched out her arm and pulled it to her. She sat up at an angle letting her forearms and elbows keep her up and she grabbed some meat and started eating. \"So, what do you want to talk about?\" Cillia asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a little while, Felix and Cillia just discussed various things that they hoped the other would know about. However, there were problems...for instance, Cillia had asked where were Felix's parents. Felix had to carefully explain that he didn't know where his parents were, or what they even looked like. It had been so long ago when his parents had either sold him off to slavery, as what Lord William had told him the one time he had asked, back before he knew better than to talk to someone like him. The other thing that was more of a possibility was the fact that he may have been kidnapped, as he had seen some slave traders kidnap children from farmers and the like in order to make sure that they always had a good supply for any potential 'customers', like Lord William. However, whatever had happened, they either couldn't do anything about it, or they just didn't care. Felix didn't want to know the answer to that question. He didn't even know if his parents were still alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Felix asked about Cillia's parents, he was surprised to find out that her mother, who was a pure blooded Giant Naga, had actually taken a sorcerer as her mate. But then he thought back to the book he had read. Somehow, Cillia's father must have somehow convinced her mother not to eat him, and as they got to know each other, they must have eventually fallen in love. However, Cillia didn't know where her father was at anymore. Her mother wouldn't talk about the subject. Felix thought to himself that for a seemingly innocent child, Cillia had a very good memory if she was able to remember stuff that had happened when she could probably barely open her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix always kept an ear out for the tell tale sign that he was about to hit his time limit for being in here. Not that the guards minded, it was just that it was always less of a pain to make sure that the slave was dead, and know about it, than the other way around. That way they would know to order a new slave to take the place of the one that had been...disposed of. Felix thought to himself grimly that there was always that way out of Lord Williams grasp, but he wasn't going to kill himself. Not now anyways. He may have thought about doing that before he had met Cillia a few times, but now that he knew someone else in this hell hole, and vice versa, he wasn't going to leave the other person he knew, the person in this case being Cillia, alone in a place like this. Especially not someone as young as Cillia. For someone like her, being alone in a place like this would most likely have made her into the monster that Lord William was thought she was. Felix had made it his job from then on to make sure that Cillia would know what was right, and what was wrong from then on. In a way, he wondered if this was what an older brother would do with a younger sibling. Of course, most older brother's younger siblings didn't dwarf them at only five years of age.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Felix pushed the cart from the kitchen to the dungeons, he thought about Cillia. Despite her being a giant naga, she acted like any normal five year old child would. Sure she had some personalities of a Felaryan naga, but all and all, her mind was quite human like, at least human enough for Felix to understand and relate to it. A few weeks had past and thanks to Felix having to go feed her three times a day; they had gotten to know each other very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOften times, Cillia talked about her mother and as well as Cillia's life in Felarya. She had described her mother as a beautiful and caring mother. However, Felix knew her mother wouldn't be as caring to him as she was with her daughter. Felix was human, after all, and could easily be part of Cillia's mother's diet. It was clear that Cillia missed her mother dearly and she'd cry sometimes when she mentioned her. Felix chivalrously was there to comfort Cillia when this happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also described her home and its beauty. Felix couldn't remember anything past the walls of the castle and loved to here about the environment and imaging its beauty, even if it was a land full of dangerous predators that wouldn't hesitate to eat a human. Cillia even told him how her mother taught her to hunt and told her how she would have to hunt when she was bigger. Cillia still wasn't as good as he mother, but she was decent enough to catch smaller creatures. Felix knew that Cillia would be very useful in hunting if they ever found a way to escape together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the weeks they were together, Cillia began to truly see Felix as a big brother, despite the fact she could pick him up quite easily. She looked to him for guidance and respected him as a brother. Felix began seeing Cillia as a little sister as well. He didn't remember ever having a family and he felt relieved to finally call someone part of his family, even if they weren't related by blood and even if the person was a giant naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring those weeks, Cillia was having growth spurts. Her body was having them so that she would become the height of a five year old giant naga. She was one of the more gigantic species of nagas that averaged to be about 120 feet tall from head to ground. So, when the growth spurts stopped, she would become about 50 feet tall and then continue to grow normally. Cillia had been growing to about that height. Cillia hadn't reached that height just yet and didn't have problems seeing Felix as a person, because not only was he not prey because of their friendship, but also because he wasn't small enough to swallow whole. However, when she would reach that fifty foot Felix would seem like he would be less than six inches compared to her. Oddly, as she grew, the cuffs around her neck, waist, and wrists never broke. They seemed to grow with her body, as if magically enhanced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was getting closer to approaching Cillia's cell. He knew Cillia would be waiting for her dinner and be waiting to be able to talk with him since he could stay with her longer at nights. He trusted Cillia and he knew that it was finally time to try and figure out an escape plan with her. He knew that he could trust her and be able to escape with her and still be safe with her. However, he still had to figure out a plan. Maybe Cillia could have some insight on the matter. She was a very bright child for being only five years of age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix reached the cell and the guard opened the door for him. Felix pushed the cart through and the guard closed the door behind him. Cillia was as close to him as her chains would allow her. She was lying down on her stomach with her tail coiled up, forming a bed for her upper body to rest upon. She had heard the door and was slowly waking from her nap. Sometimes, Cillia napped. She needed to rest at time, especially the days Lord William's men tried to tame her. \"Hi, Felix,\" Cillia greeted as she yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Cillia,\" Felix replied as he started pushing the cart towards her. He noticed that Cillia must have had a growth spurt, because she was bigger than she was the last time he had met her. He didn't know that it was her last growth spurt and she was fifty feet tall from the ground up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Felix was close enough, Cilla reached her hand out to him. She wrapped her fingers around him and picked him up to her face as her chin continued to rest on her coils. Felix had gotten used to Cillia picking him up. She did it quite often and now it was easy enough and she was big enough to pick him up in one hand. Cillia stood her upper body upright and hugged Felix by gently pressing his body against her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of her hug, her stomach growled and Cillia giggled, \"I'm really hungry. You always come just in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia placed her palm upwards so that Felix could sit on it. Cillia reached down to the cart and ate all the food and drink all the water from it. When she was finished, she noticed how small Felix looked in her palm. He was small, small enough to swallow whole, well for a naga anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she remembered her mother's words and her detailed descriptions of swallowing humans whole. The way her mother had described it made it sound so wonderful and good. Humans were supposed to be the second most delicious creatures, elves being number one. She was now big enough to swallow a human whole and there was a human in her hand. She was increasingly becoming tempted to eat Felix, especially since she was still a little hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have been giving Felix a strange look, because Felix looked worried and nervously questioned, \"Cillia, what's wrong?\"</span></div></div>",

He had also been there for her whenever she needed him most, and continued to look after her, even though there was such a huge size difference between the two of them. Felix was her big brother, not food! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer human side of her quickly pushed away her naga instinct because of that, and gently shook her head. \"Nothing, I was just thinking of how cute you look being that small.\" Cillia said, spinning a good lie. Like all nagas, she had an uncanny ability with lying, even though she always regretted doing it to Felix. But she was thinking that at the same time, so it wasn't a complete lie, plus it was an old subject that the two of them always had fun arguing over. But this time Felix wasn't arguing with her, something that struck her as odd. He seemed different today...so she decided to ask him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix...what's wrong?\" Cillia asked her big brother, but he didn't seem to hear her. \"Brother...?\" Cillia asked quietly. Her mind raced, was he able to see through her lie? After spending so much time with her, had Felix begun to know when she was lying and when she was telling the truth? That thought scared her, she never willingly wanted to lie to Felix, she just knew that if she had told him what had just happened, he might not see her in the same way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, her mind countered, if he was her brother, he would know that she had seen him as her brother, and there for not food. Wouldn't he congratulate her for fighting off that urge? But there was also something else about him, it seemed as if he was trying to think of something else as well...sometimes she couldn't tell what it was that Felix was thinking about, but she always knew a lie when she heard one, not that Felix ever lied to her. Which made it all the harder for herself to lie to him from time to time. She just hoped that he was trying to think of something, and hadn't of figured out that she had lied to him, even if it was only a little.</span></div></div>",

He knows!\"</i> Cillia panicked in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't seem like you were looking at me like that because I was cute. You've given me that face often, and that look was nothing like that,\" Felix told her. Felix examined her expression. She seemed to be getting more worried and nervous. It was as if she was trying to hide something, but was getting closer to find out the truth. \"Is there something you don't want to tell me?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no,\" Cillia lied even though she knew he would see through such a lie. She was becoming more and more obvious that she was hiding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix thought about the look she had given him after she finished her dinner. He had seen that look before, but he couldn't remember where or when she did it. Felix thought very carefully, and as the silence continued, he noticed Cillia becoming more uncomfortable. She fidgeted and bit her bottom lip. Then Felix remembered. Cillia had never given him that look before, but she had given that look towards the animals he feed her. She had been looking at him with a hungry expression as if she wanted to eat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked up at Cillia with shock clear in his face. \"Were you thinking of eating me, Cillia?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wasn't,\" Cillia answered quickly as she shook her head. Her beautiful, big eyes were forming tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were thinking about eating me,\" Felix gasped in realization. Felix tried to back away, but quickly realized he was in the palm of her hand and he had no where to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, I...\" Cillia tried to think of a lie to say, but another lie would just make the situation worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me the truth, Cillia. Did you really think about eating me?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia knew she had to tell Felix the truth now. She had no idea how he would react to the truth, but she had to tell him. \"Yes,\" Cillia answered with teary eyes, \"I did think about eating you, but it was only for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you even think that?\" Felix replied in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother told me that when something is swallowable, it is prey and I can eat it, even if it is sentient. It's not a person,\" Cillia explained, tears still falling, \"You're small enough for me to swallow now. Mother told me what it was like to eat a human. She described how good it was had have tasty and pleasurable swallowing a human whole could be. I really badly want to try it. You were in my hand as I thought about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have eaten me, despite everything I've done for you, despite the fact I treat you like a sister?\" Felix said, clearly upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't eat you,\" Cillia argued, \"I can't possibly eat you, Felix. I thought about everything you've done for me. I thought about that day I hurt myself with the chains and you were there for me. You're always there for me when I need you. I will never hurt you. I resisted the urge, because you're my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked away to think about what had just happened. Cillia continued to stare down at Felix, waiting for his judgment with watery eyes. <i>\"What if he's mad at me forever, now? What if he hates me for thinking about eating him? I don't want to lose him. Felix is my brother. If he thinks I'm some terrible monster, then I don't know what I'd do,\"</i> Cillia thought to herself. She was worried Felix would hate her and see her as a monster. She was worried that he wouldn't want to be her brother anymore and leave her. Then she would be alone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, brother,\" Cillia pleaded as she cried, \"Don't hate me. I don't want to lose you. I promise that I'll never think about eating you ever again. You're still safe with me, I promise. Please, stay my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked back up at Cillia. It was clear from her crying that she was truly sorry for what she had done, and if she was truly sorry, then Felix would be safe with her. She wouldn't ever think of eating him ever again because she'll know how mad he would get and would worry that he would leave her. Besides, even though she had the urge to eat him, she stopped herself because she remembered everything he had done for her. She truly sees Felix as a brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do?</span></div></div>",

He signaled for Cillia to raise him up closer towards her face. She did so, wondering what he was going to do. As he got closer, he suddenly reached out and hugged her around her neck, as much as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay mad at you Cillia.

Now, there were tears of joy from the fact that her brother was not leaving her alone. \"Thank you...\" She whispered to Felix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix patted her neck and brought himself out of the hold. \"Now, I have something else to tell you.\" That caught Cillia off guard, and surprised her.

As I've told you before, I have tried to think up of a great many ways of getting out of here. However, there has always been one thing that has stopped me. I am the only slave that hasn't lost their spirit, the rest of the others...they are more like the living dead. Their spirits died out long ago. Now, however, I have you, and with the two of us together, I'm sure we can get out. It's just a matter of when.\" Felix continued to say, getting back up and starting to pace along Cillia's palm. \"I have noticed that there are times when the guards are less in numbers than usual. From the gossip that I overhear at the tables, they say it is because General Ethan is trying to find Lord William another being such as yourself. Some say it's because he is getting tired from the lack of progress from your...ah...taming.\" Felix said, the last part carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean...he's trying to find another Felaryan creature?\" Cillia said, surprised. She started to think then. She didn't know any of the other nagas, except for the ones that were like legends. She knew from her mother that all dridders needed to be destroyed. The two species were mortal enemies since...a very long time ago, so it would be horrible if they caught one of them and they placed it in her cell. She would be surprised if they ever managed to catch a dryad. Besides nagas and, though she hated to admit it, dridders, dryads were among the more deadlier races, if not because of their size, then because of their ability to conceal themselves. Mer-folk were just as hard to catch, as they rarely came out of the waters that they called home. Fairies would be able to fly out of their reach, and they had an innate sense of magic as well. Something she had yet to see a human use. A list of many other races that her mother taught her about ran through her, each less likely to be caught than the last. \"I don't think he's going to succeed.\" Cillia said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll trust your words. Anyways, it's always a certain day of the week. That's when he gathers up all of the experienced guards to go out and hunt.\" Felix said, after he waited for Cillia to get done thinking. He could always tell when she was thinking. Her eyes had a habit of wandering. \"That will leave the less experienced ones. That is when we will have to try our luck. Hopefully, before this week is over, we both will be free from Lord William's clutches.\" Felix said, and started to pace again. Now came the hard part. They knew that there was a time window that they could use to get out, now he needed to think of a path, and the means to escape.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, we know the time that's best to escape, but how do we escape?\" Cillia asked mainly to try and help both their thought processes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stopped pacing for a while. Pacing normally would have helped him think, but even though Cillia's hand was large enough for him to stand on and even lie on, pacing back and forth with that little distance to pace was making him a little dizzy, even with her cupping two hands together now to give him more room. The last thing Felix needed was to accidentally fall off the hands of his... sister... and hit the stone floor from such a height. Felix looked at the chain cuff around Cillia's wrists and the one around her neck. He knew that she had another around her waist, but he didn't look down at that one. \"We should figure it out one step at a time. Starting with how to get those chains and metal cuffs off you,\" Felix finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how do we do that?\" Cillia asked, \"I don't suppose you know where the keys are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked up at Cillia's giant child face. There was doubt in her voice about Felix knowing where the keys that would free her from the chains binding her to the cell were or that Felix would even be able to obtain them. However, her eyes were filled with hopefulness. Felix stared deep into those eyes. Felix knew that she trusted him and believed in him. Despite her size, he was still her big brother and she looked up to him for guidance, security, and assurance. It was a very strange thing to be looked up to by a giant naga that could easily carry him in one hand, but Felix was getting used to it, and Cillia already seemed to have no problems looking up to him already even when she thought he was cute at his small size from time to time. Felix sighed and looked down while shaking his head. \"Sorry, but I'm not sure where the keys would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" was all Cillia said as she looked further down beneath where he hands were raised with Felix atop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix felt as though he had let her down by the sound of that single \"Oh\". Wishing to cheer Cillia up, Felix quickly said, \"But, maybe we won't need the keys. Maybe there is another way out of them. And even if there isn't, I will do my best to find out where those keys might be, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia looked back up at Felix in her hands and raised those hands up to her face. \"I knew I could count on you, brother.\" Cillia turned her head, and Felix knew what she wanted to do. Felix positioned himself so that he was only on one of her palms. With the other hand, Cillia lifted it vertically and placed it behind Felix. Cillia then brought her cheek down against Felix while his tiny body was between it and her other hand. Cillia rubbed her cheek against her big brother's tiny body. They might not have been able to show the same sort of affection that normal siblings of similar sizes would, but Cillia still found many different ways to show that affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cillia was finished, she lowered her hands back down to about neck level and Felix sat down in her cupped hands. Cillia smiled happily down at him with new found hope and said, \"So, about these chains and cuffs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think we can count out waiting for you to grow out of them, because they've seemed to grow with you, at least the cuffs have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they have,\" Cillia replied with some sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the chains? Maybe you could pull them apart or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, these chains have kept me here no matter how much I've pulled. If I could have broken free from them, do you think I'd be here?\" Cillia asked. This time, a slight annoyance and frustration was in her voice, but Felix knew those emotions weren't directed towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you take me to the anchors that hold them in the wall?\" Felix requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia didn't know what Felix would possibly gain by doing this, but Cillia agreed to carry her brother to them anyway. As Cillia approached the wall at the other end of the cell, Felix instructed her to go a little slower. Cillia didn't realize it, but Felix was examining the chains on the floor as well. The chains, though very thick by human standards and big enough to hold a very large beast, never grew with Cillia and were their original size. One chain link was probably at least a four of Felix's size, but there might be a chance of Cillia to break free, or at least that's what Felix thought. Cillia was much stronger and bigger now. Felix hoped to find signs of weakness in the chains or the anchors. When Cillia reached the anchors in the wall, she lifted Felix to each on and let him examine them. While he did this, he didn't give any hints of his plan or why he was doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia was left in suspense the entire time. She wanted badly to ask Felix what was going on, but Felix seemed so focused on what he was doing and she didn't want to disturb him so that he might find a way out of this place. When Felix was finished, Cillia couldn't take the silence any longer and she asked, \"So?\"  </span></div></div>",

At least every single one of the chains holding her had, at one point or another, a rusted link somewhere. The anchors in the wall also looked like, while they could have held the Cillia of the past, they weren't meant to handle how big Cillia had gotten. \"So...we won't be needing the keys.\" Felix said. He watched as Cillia's head cocked to the side on confusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I already told you I tried to break free before.\" Cillia told Felix, wondering what it was that he was getting at. Since she had tried those few times, she had given up on trying it again. What had Felix seen that would have made him think otherwise? She couldn't understand the way Felix thought sometimes...which was understandable, even giving how close the two of them had gotten in such a short time, that didn't excuse the fact that even though that may be the case, they haven't really had enough TIME to really get to know each other. Not that Cillia cared. After she broke out of here with her brother, she was going to find a way back home. She wanted to see her mother again. However, Cillia then realized something. Even though Cillia saw Felix as a person and not prey, what would her mother think of him? However, Cillia's thoughts were drawn away from that thought when Felix started to talk. However, even though her attention was given to Felix, the thought that her mother may eat Felix was still unbearable, and wouldn't go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix has let her puzzle it out for a little while, but it seemed that, even how big she was, she still had something to learn. \"Yes, you tried before Cillia...when you were <i>smaller</i>.\" Felix said, putting emphasis on the word smaller. It was then that realization dawned on Cillia's face. \"Now you're getting it. I found along the chains some link in them that were rusted, and the anchors couldn't possibly hold you should you actually try to break free. I don't think Lord William or any of the other soldiers know about it, but we shouldn't take the chance and wait. Luck must finally be on our side for once...\" Felix said as he explained why. As it turned out, General Ethan's next hunting party was actually...</span></div></div>",

The 'little problem' he was mentioning was the fact that when Cillia did manage to free herself from the chains she had grown over the size of the actual EXIT of the dungeon. He had refrained from telling Cillia this however not wanting to crush her hopes of freedom. However after living a slave as long as he could remember Felix knew this castle better than anyone after being constantly asigned new jobs due the deaths of many slaves who had defied Lord William and had ended up as one of the many skeletons that now litter the dungeon. Felix stopped polishing as he remebered the looks of shock, anger and fear as one by one rebelious slaves had been dragged off and the sight of this had only mad his own confidence drop over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook away these thoughts and continued planning in his mind. The only thing that they could use to escape is the sewage lines that led from the castle all the way into the old forest two miles West from the castle. It was linked to the sewage system in the dungeons and the only thing standing between the duo and freedom was a few layers of concrete. Felix only had to figure out how to break through it. Of course Cillia could possibly break through the floor given the right amount of time but that was not an option and the remaing guards would realize something was amiss and though less of them remained there were enough to stop the escape with time to mobolize. He had to think of a way to break through the floor fast and ensure their escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour Thte guards inspected the gear and decided it was acceptable then let Felix fetch Cillia dinner (but only after giving a large fist to the ribs for taking so long). Felix however was not demoralized by this as if the fates were in his favour soon he would breathe fresh air of freedom and never look back at this place again.</span></div></div>",

He had made it right up  to the door when the guard that seemed to be posted there most the time stopped him abruptly as he blocked the door with his spear. Felix was taken back by the guard sudden hostility but regained himself and said \"I'm here with the naga's food sir please allow me in\" Felix said with a degree of nervousness in his voice for worry of the guards intent eyes analysing him as if he were choosing wether a pig was yet worthy of slaughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long pause the guard lent toward Felix and said \"I am not a fool boy and i know what you and that naga have been up to\" After these words came out of his mouth Feix was stunned. He had been discovered? His fate was sealed! The guard would take him to William amd his life would end at a hangsmens noose! The thought of his body lying there limp and Cillia being left alone at the hands of that monster was too much to bare. Felix was considering options when the guard lauged. But this was not a luagh of creulty as the guard so often used but a laugh of joy as if Felix was a God send he had been waiting for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- why are you laughing\" Felix aked lowering his guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it not obvious boy!\" The guard belowed inbetween laughter \"Its good to see i'm not the only one in this hell hole who wants to strike back at that foul pice of work William!\" Felix was amazed! This man was not an enemy but a possible ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" Felix said still nervous from the change in events \"Who exactly are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard stoped laughing suddenly aware that people may hear him. He reached for his left glove and took it off and upon it was a large black hand inorinted in his skin that Felix gasped as he saw. The guard chuckled \"You know this symbol lad?\" The guard asked \"I am a member of the black hand the group sworn to end the opression of our 'lord' once and for all. I have been spying on this fort for two years and i have a favour to ask of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix could hardly believe this was real. The tatoo was real and not faked, it even had the tiny details and imprints only leaders of the revolution knew. This man might be the key he was looking for to escape. Speechless Felix noded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good on ya lad\" He said while smiling \"I realize that you plan to spring that naga and what better way to distract the lord is that. I know the sewers is the only way to get that colossus out of here and with the right... tools... we can make entry easy\" As he said this he produced a large ball and a match from his puch. A hestblast! This was enginereed by the dwarves of the montains and very hard to get your hands on. Though small it had the pwer of a hundred dragons lurking inside waiting to be released at the light of a match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was beyond words after seeing such a thing of power and could only imagine what Lord William would give to get his hands on it. The guard explained that the black hand needed to weaken the defences and the trust of Lord William's forces for a final attack and this was the perfect opertunity to begin the uprising. All Felix had to do was blow the floor under the dngeon and escape leaving the castle in chaos for the black hand to send the message to Lord William. Felix was at amiss with his luck and was about to take the agent up on his offer but he realized this all seemed very suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so egar to help us?\" Felix asked and the guards face became very serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe becuase i've seen you suffer for two years, maybe because I see that girl no matter how big or monstrous she may be in pain and it hurts me as much or possibley becuase its my duty\" The spy muttered then looked directly at Felix and said \"Just know that at the end of that unnel you'll be within arms width of out of William's kingdom and freedom will be yours.\" With that he handed the explosived to Felix and began to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guard pushed Felix in the slave couldnt help but turn around and ask for the guard name. In reply the man called \"Its not imporant and chances are you wont see me again just worry about keeping your sister safe and good luck lad!\" With that the door shut and the light of hope shone brighter than ever before.</span></div></div>",

She reached out for him, but her hand caught onto the cuff around her wrist. \"Please brother!\" she shouted. \"Don't leave me!\" Tears were flowing out of Cillia's eyes like rivers. She didnt want to lose her brother, Felix was the only light in her dark world. Felixstopped but did not turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your brother, and I'm not your sister...\" Cillia gasped in horror as tears began to gush out. \"If there is no trust, we shouldn't even be friends...\" Felix continued walking towards the gate. He ignored every cry and plea Cillia made between the limit line and the entrance. The guards opened the cage and Felix left; without even saying goodbye. Cillia was left in the cage, her heart broken. She now lost the only thing she could care about at this moment in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few weeks were possibly the saddest for Cillia. Felix came three times a day, giving Cillia her meals. But she only placed them just behind the limit line for her reach. He said nothing else and left. Day by day, piece by piece, Cillia's heart and will were fading. The Lord was having an easier time controlling her. Cillia tried to fight it, but she lacked the will to do it. Felix was unfathed by her reactions. She wanted to eat him, after everything he has done for her. Cillia's heart was broken into pieces, but so was Felix's faith and trust.

Without the help of knowing he had a friend or anyone to trust, Felix had lost himself to Lord William completely this time. Each passing day, Cillia could see the life of Felix leave him more and more, each day. She didn\u2019t know what was more painful, the fact that she lost her one and only friend in this horrid place or the fact that she could see that same person hollow out each and each every day. As for Felix his mind has numbed as well as his body, he was becoming more and more like ever slave. No more hope, no more love, or anything. When Felix\u2019s mind became numb, so did his body. Whenever a guard hit him, sure fell to the ground from the hit, but he felt no pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felix returned day like every other day to feed Cillia, Lord William was walking out of the east cell. \u201cYou slave,\u201d Lord William called, \u201cwhy isn\u2019t the beast eating or drinking?! Don\u2019t you know what happens if it doesn\u2019t eat?!\u201d Lord William slapped Felix to the ground, but again, he felt no pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked up at Lord William and asked, \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForce it to eat. If it won\u2019t eat the food willingly then you\u2019ll force it to eat.\u201d When Lord William said this, something in Felix\u2019s mind flashed, was he suppose to act afraid of her? Sure to keep their friendship secret but now, why should he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Lord, won\u2019t it eat me?\u201d Felix asked. Why was he doing this? Sure he had no emotions when he asked but still why? He even knows that Lord William doesn\u2019t care about losing a slave, to master Cil\u2026 a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause to lose to lose a slave is better than losing a guard, didn\u2019t I already tell you this?\u201d and like that Lord William left. Felix walked the cart in like he does every day, but today he was surprised. Cillia\u2019s last few meals were just laying there in front of her. Her water was untouched. When Felix looked at Cillia, he was mortified. She looked like she hasn\u2019t eaten in days. She didn\u2019t look like she had any strength at all. And with her growing, her body would be too weak to move. But she was just laying there sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked at her in fear, but unlike the time they meet, Felix feared for her to life. Sure Felix may have numbed after all this time and still upset about what she did, but the shock of seeing someone as strong as Cillia to just lay there and look so weak made him realize he needed to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix pushed the cart right in front of Cillia and grabbed the deer He tried to pick it up but Felix was too weak to get pick it up. So Felix dragged it in front of Cillia and tried to wake her up. \u201cCillia wake up.\u201d Felix said, he would have yelled it if the guards weren\u2019t on the other side of the door. Come on Cillia wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCillia started to move around, but she didn\u2019t didn\u2019t wake up. She did however mutter, \u201cFelix?\u201d He voice sounded so weak and dry that it hurt Felix to see her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked at her and said, \u201cYes Cillia, it\u2019s me.\u201d  Felix was kind of worried he wasn\u2019t sure if Cillia would forgive him for leaving her alone in a place like this.</span></div></div>",

Cilia's tired eyes landed on Felix. The memory of his ignorant behavior flashed through her mind. She no longer wanted to see Felix like that. She began to roll her body, but it was hard for her. But she wanted not to see Felix in his current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cilla wait!\" shouted Felix. Cillia stopped at the sound of his voice. <i>Did he...did he just speak to me...? Is there concern in his voice?</i> she thought. Cillia turned back over to see Felix standing in the same position. Something was different about him. His eyes did not seem lifeless or drained anymore. They were filled with sadness and concern. A spark of hope and happiness lit inside of Cillia's heart. \"Felix...?\" she asked. \"Cillia, you need to eat...\" he said. Even more concern, Cillia was overjoyed. \"Lord William will punish me if you don't eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spark extinguished as quickly as it ignited. Felix only wanted to prevent his punishment, not to help Cillia. Cillia's eyes soon filled with sadness and she tried to turn away from Felix once again. Tears began to form and drip down her cheek. But, she felt something else on her cheek. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Felix hugging what he could of Cillia's cheek. Cillia stopped moving and focused what she could on Felix. He was really hugging her. She recieved more of a response in five minutes than what she lacked for over a month. \"Please Cillia....\" said Felix, \"I don't want to lose you again. I was too worried for my own life that I forgot yours. I never should have left you, I will never forgive myself. I'm not just your light in this dark world, your my light. I don't want you to die. Your my sister...and I'm your brother!\" Felix was now in tears. Cillia cried, but they were tears of joy. With what strength she had, Cillia grabbed Felix and placed him near her chest. She embraced him in a massive hug, \"I missed you so much brother...\"</span></div></div>",

There were some skeletons still hanging from chains on the walls.  He gulped and remembered why he was there.  He expected to attacked quickly, but there was no attack.  He looked closer to the ground and tried finding the naga, but in the dark corners, he saw nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he heard it.  A quiet rushed breath, like the being was scared.  Felix noticed then a thick chain coming from the ceiling dipped down to one corner.  He pushed the  cart towards the corner and when the contents stumbled, he saw it.  Or at least its eye.  A large dark blue eye stared before hiding again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix felt his heart race in fear and  realized he shouldn't be standing there looking at this creature.  It could realize Felix was nothing and eat him,  so Felix quickly put the food and water bowl on the ground and left as quickly as he could.  As he pushed the cart out, he heard the sadistic guard call to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you at dinner slave,\" the guard called, \"Or possibly for dinner.\"  Felix shook in fear and continued on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the dungeon, slowly the young naga unraveled itself.  It was a unique naga as its tail scales were solid obsidian, which let him hide in the shadows perfectly.  His human body was covered in scars from whips and swords General Ethan and his men used to capture him.  His black hair was the same color as his tail and he pushed it out of his way to look at the things the human left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never seen humans before.  One moment, he was hunting some small nekos, then the next thing he knew he was no longer in his home woods, when suddenly humans started attacking him.  The young, scared, confused naga never stood a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little human that entered, this naga knew he'd be hurt by him like the others if he got close.  But the human left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the naga slithered to the food and drink and sniffed.  It didn't smell poisonous and there were few poisons that could harm one of his kind.  So, it took the large cut of meat and put it in his mouth and drank the water.  But it was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be very hungry now my son, as you are about to grow to a large proud naga,\" he could remember his mother's words and a promise he'd taste his first human after wards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Once I grow, these humans will pay,\"</i> the young naga thought without much confidence.  His declaration was more to comfort himself than any serious promise.  He could only wonder how much longer until his first growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know it would be in a two days . . .</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two days past and the naga soon began to realize the routine of the humans who had captured him. Human soldiers came twice each being between meal times, and they tortured the naga brutally. The naga didn't know what the humans wanted as they beat him with strange and strong weapons, and the naga didn't know what he could have possibly done to them to deserve such a treatment. The torturers used many different and bizarre looking weapons and the naga was too busy trying to protect himself from the blows. The naga never fought back for many reasons. For one, he thought that if he stopped blocking to attack a human, he would be open for attack for another humans, because about ten humans came each time. Also, he feared that the attack on a human would provoke the humans to fight harder and hurt him more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, he was still five years old. He wasn't a proficient fighter and he still only knew the basics of hunting, let alone fighting. He was too young to do anything against the humans, especially when he was too scared to do so. However, he did know that when he becomes his real height of about seventy feet, he would have a better chance against the humans. One doesn't need too much strategy when one is large enough for humans to look like they're a few inches tall. Still, it would be a risk if the humans should swarm and fight with more powerful weapons. For now, the naga just had to wait and take the terrible hits from the humans<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the brutal torture secessions, the naga started becoming desperate within a day! The torture and the dark and gloomy cell the naga was forced to suffer was just too much for a five year old mind to handle. It was already starting to traumatizing him and put him in a state of hopelessness. It had been two and a half days he had been in the terrible darkness and it was becoming too much for the child naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was morning and the naga was coiled up in his corner with his human half lying on his coils. The naga was coiled in a spiral, but not an upward spiral. The spiral was on the ground and his whole tail was flat on the ground. His human half was lying on top of the coils with his chest and stomach on his tail. The naga had his arms crossed with his chin resting on his arms and he was staring at the human sized barred door. He knew that food would arrive soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The human will feed me, but it won't be enough. I'm always starving after wards,\" the naga muttered. It was true that he was still hungry after every meal now, but it was also true that the meals were filling his stomach. For some reason, Felaryan nagas can eat more food than they need to. They can survive off of filling their stomach, but there always seems to be room for more and they often eat more just to comfort themselves. Now that the naga was becoming a giant, he was starting to have those effects on his stomach. It's still unknown why Felaryan nagas have such a strange appetite. One belief is that eating is an enjoyment to them. They eat to make themselves happy and they hunt for fun. So, when a naga is feeling a little down or bored, they hunt and eat to make themselves feel better. They don't realize what's going on, but their stomach makes them feel as though their hungry to get them to eat and hunt for enjoyment. So, since the naga is trapped in a dark cell, being tortured by humans, it's no surprise to why he feels like he's starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the naga waited for his food, he began to think about his home. He missed the thick forests, the sunlight when it warmed his skin, the food from his world, and most of all his parents. \"I need to get out of here,\" the naga whispered, \"But how? I have to wait till I'm bigger to try and escape, but that could take month. Those monsters might kill me by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga began to cry, \"I wish I knew what they wanted of me. Maybe if I give them what they want, they'll let me go.\" The naga thought about talking to one of the humans, but he soon became frightened to do so. He began to worry that the humans might hurt him for asking. It seemed hopeless to the naga and he thought the only way out would be to escape, until he remembered that there was a human who didn't harm him, the young boy who fed him. The boy had never hurt the naga, he just ran in, gave him the food, and then ran out as quickly as he could. <i>\"It's as if he's afraid of me for some reason,\"</i> the naga thought to himself, <i>\"Maybe he won't hurt me if I talk to him and maybe he'll be willing to tell me what they want from me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy feeding him was only a few years older and seemed much more approachable to the naga. Plus, the human was still a person to the naga and not food. To a Felaryan naga, some one as a person if the person couldn't fit in their mouth, but if the person can fit in a naga's mouth, the naga categorizes that person as food and prey. Since a naga can swallow anything that fits in its mouth, because of its flexible throat, its safe to say that anything swallowable to the naga is prey and everything else is a person. The human boy couldn't fit in the naga's mouth yet, so the human was still a person. It sounds terrible to us that a naga could see something as a person one day and change its mind the next just because of the size change, but it was normal to the nagas. There have been cases when a five year old naga made friends with five year old human. They'd become best friends until the naga grew to seventy feed and ate the human best friend like it was no big deal. As cruel and heartless as that may seem, Felaryans don't see it that way and don't understand the cruelty of it because their too used to using size to judge whether something is a person or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy was still a person in the naga's mind, for now, and the naga thought it might be best to try and speak to the human and ask the human why he was here. So, it was decided, the naga would approach the human this time and try to speak to the human. He needed help and the human that fed him seemed to be the only possible help he was going to get. The naga waited in his coils for the young boy to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was heading for the naga's cell while pushing the cart of food and water. Felix began to think about the naga as he walked. He had been in the naga's cell eight times and it hadn't once tried to kill or attack him. This seemed odd to Felix because Lord William claimed the naga to be a monster. <i>\"Why doesn't it try to attack me when I go in there?\"</i> Felix wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Maybe it's because I go in and out too fast for it,\"</i> He suggested in his mind, but he soon threw that suggestion out of his mind. The naga was part snake and Felix knew how fast snakes could be. There had to be another reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix thought back to how Lord William told Felix the naga was only five years old. The naga was still a toddler. Felix knew the naga was being tortured, he had come early one time and saw the aftermath of the torture. <i>\"If that naga is only a child, what effects might be from that torture?\"</i> Felix wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix remembered the first day he was enslaved, the earliest memory he could remember. He remembered how terrible he felt in those first days. <i>\"It's a sentient being, so it must feel the same way I did when I came to Lord William's castle. It's scared, sad, and alone,\"</i> Felix realized. Felix remembered the feelings and the depression he suffered from the first few months. It was something no man could describe. <i>\"That must be the reason why it doesn't attack, its scared,\"</i> Felix realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felix walked down the corridor getting closer to the cell door, Felix thought about what he should do. <i>\"I know that Lord William said that Felaryan nagas see humans as food, but maybe I can reason with it. The naga is sentient after all. Maybe if I treat it better than the guards...\"</i> Felix wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But Lord William said they can't be reasoned with,\"</i> Felix's brain argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But I would never eat a fairy,\"</i> Felix argued with himself, <i>\"How can a sentient being be so cruel they'd eat another sentient being whose helping it just because it's larger than the second?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix made it to the cell and ten guards were stationed outside. They were ready for the naga in case it grew out of its chains. Felix was let in the cell and he pushed the cart in the center as fast as he could. Luckily, he spotted that something was off and he stopped the cart. Felix stood in awe as he saw the naga was free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the naga waited for the young human to come, the naga continued to feel an increasing pressure around where the chains were. Eventually, it became painful the naga examined himself. The naga's eyes widened in surprise as he noticed he was growing. The naga uncoiled himself and stood up straight. Excitement overwhelmed him as he was finally having a growth spurt. Soon, the old chains around him broke and he was free. He loincloth also ripped off as well, showing off his privates. (Yes, Felaryan nagas have a snake tail starting at the hips, but where the human skin and the snake skin start, it forms a fancy U. So, the front privates are on the human half and they have human reproductive organs. They don't have a human butt though because its all snake tail back there.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga eventually stopped growing and was now close to twenty feet tall from ground up and he tail was at least fifty feet long! \"Wow,\" the naga whispered as he looked at his hands. The naga slithered into what light it had in the cell and examined his new body. The familiar sound of the door slamming and the wheeling of the cart brought the naga back into reality. The naga looked and saw the human hurrying up to give the food so he could get out quickly, but the human soon stopped when he saw the naga and the human looked up in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga was just like Lord William had said, a fully human upper half on top of a snake tail. The naga even had a penis. The naga had a black snake tail with some red coloring like symbols, but it was just the coloring. The naga had long black hair and his human half looked just like a five year old human, except the naga was twenty feet tall now. The naga stared down at Felix and Felix was frightened beyond belief since he was a little less than one fourth of the naga's height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga was becoming desperate and the first thing he thought about doing was escaping. he didn't realize he still wasn't big enough to properly escape. He just wanted to get out. The naga ignored the human, who was still a person to him, and slithered around the human, he hadn't done anything wrong to the naga. Then the naga reached the large doors and tried to break them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, he wasn't big enough or strong enough. The guards entered quickly and began stabbing him with spear. The naga cried out in pain and just tried to protect himself. Suddenly, a guard blow a dart and the dart connected with the naga's neck. The naga pulled out the tiny dart and looked at it. The naga started seeing double and he became very dizzy. Soon, he collapsed and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the naga woke up, in his corner with new chains on him. The naga didn't recover quickly and had to wait a while before he could get up. Once the naga could, he looked at the chains and saw they were much stronger than the others. The naga didn't know it, but the chains were also enchanted so that they could grow with his body. The naga pulled and tugged at the chains, but he was no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga tried for many minutes, but he began to realize it was hopeless and he collapsed in a coil and cried upon his tail. <i>\"I'm going to be here the rest of my life. I can't escape!\"</i> the naga thought.</span></div></div>",

But something had come to replace that crying,  cry for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm soooo HUNGRY!\" the young naga cried as he held his tail, \"Why isn't the food here yet?\"  His breathing was heavy and his need for some food was increasing by the second.  His huge hands gripped the blades of grass to eat but there weren't enough coming between the dungeon's floors.  His eyes looked up at the skeletons and other bodies hanging and grabbed for them, chains and body.  He pushed the meek bones in and the metal and swallowed but it wasn't enough.  And because they were just bones or rotten flesh, he really didn't taste what a human tasted like, similar to how tasting sour milk is far different from normal milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I NEED FOOOOD!</i>\" the young naga thought as he grabbed his tail once more and cried heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, his usual beating came and departed and the young naga didn't even try to fight back because of his huge hunger.  He was just sitting there, holding his tail, crying about food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner came and Felix was inwardly happy as he pushed the cart to the cell.  First, it seemed there was more food for the naga.  Second, with the usage of those new chains he saw them put on the naga after it was put out, the guards had been reduced to two.  But the blow dart remained.  He walked past the guards as they opened the door and quickly closed it behind Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where is the naga,\" Felix said, his eyes instinctively looking to a corner, but instead saw him lying on his tail near the middle.  The eyes were closed tightly and the naga seemed to be crying.  Then the eyes suddenly opened and looked at Felix.  Felix, worried, started moving back, bringing the cart with him.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Soooo  Hunngrryyy,</i>\" the naga bemoaned in thought.  He was so out of it, he didn't hear the door open and close.  But then something came to his nose.  Blood.  Fresh blood not his own.  The eyes darted at the cart and the naga smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>FOOD!</i> the naga thought but saw the human leaving.  Quickly he released his tail and shot it behind Felix so he couldn't escape and grabbed the meat on the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was terrified when he looked back and saw a shiny black tail that wasn't there a moment ago.  As he looked forward he saw the the huge hand grabbing the meat and shoving it to the mouth.  Bits of meat dropped from the over stuffed mouth.  Felix quickly put the water down and moved away to get around the tail to the door.  But as he did, he saw the tail moving along with him.  But when Felix looked, the naga seemed too caught up in grabbing the bits of meat that he missed to notice him.  But then he saw the naga seem to rise up in the air and the chain that held him grew thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He's . . . He's growing again!?</i>\" Felix thought, watching the the naga gain about seven feet in body height and the tail another ten feet.  The tail now touched the wall and made it impossible for Felix to escape without possibly calling the guards.  But they would just beat the naga and Felix couldn't see that happening.  Not to someone so young and alone as this naga must be.  \"<i>Well I wanted to talk with the naga,</i>\" Felix thought meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the naga, not even noticing his growth, only his hunger remained unsated took a breath and</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the naga's despair, he completely forgot about the boy who fed him. The naga pretty much assumed that the boy left already since the boy usually left as soon as he fed the naga. The naga was too hungry and too depressed to realize the boy was trapped by the tail. The naga's upper body collapsed on the ground causing the naga's body to be in a C-shape. The naga crossed his arms and laid his face on his arms while he sobbed harder than he ever had before. The naga was tired, hungry, and depressed. <i>\"I'm never going to see my home and family again,\"</i> the naga despaired, <i>\"I'm going to be trapped in this place the rest of my life, or until I starve to death.\"</i> The naga feared there was no hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix could only stare at the naga as he cried uncontrollably. In that moment, Felix forgot the naga was some terrible and dangerous creature that had no remorse in eating humans. Instead, Felix saw himself when he was forced into slavery. He saw a young child that didn't deserve the unspeakable treatment it was getting. The naga, though about twenty-seven tall with an extremely long tail, was still only a very sad and lonely child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked to the door. He could still get around the crying naga by going around the upper body of the naga, but in Felix's mind, he couldn't. Felix just couldn't let the naga suffer anymore. \"Hey,\" Felix called out, still a little meek. However, the naga was sobbing too hard and oblivious to the world around him. Felix tried again and was louder. The naga flinched, able to hear Felix this time. The naga slowly lifted his head till only one large, blue, sad eye was staring at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga had thought he was the only one in the cell, and it was startled by the sudden voice. When he peeked from his wet arms, he saw the older boy who fed him was still there. The naga was in a confused state and didn't notice he had grown just yet. He was too busy wondering why the boy was still in the cell. <i>\"he usually runs off as soon as I eat. Why is he...?\"</i> the naga questioned, but soon saw his tail was in his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm blocking his way. He just wants out,\"</i> the naga thought. Because the human still was too big to swallow, the naga still viewed the boy as a person. The naga, no matter how badly he wanted help, couldn't bring himself to hold a person captive. The naga curled his tail away and then brought it into himself. The naga didn't coil the tail underneath him, but he still laid his upper body on his tail nevertheless. the naga then continued to cry on his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was a little confused by the naga's reaction. <i>\"Maybe he thought I wanted to leave,\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"I never stay that long and by the way the guards treat him, he probably thinks humans aren't capable of good deeds\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If I show him it is possible for humans to be good and I'm kind to him, I might be able to befriend him,\"</i> Felix reasoned, <i>\"He is a sentient being after all. And if he and I become friends, surely he won't eat me. I know Lord William warned me Felaryans can't be reasoned with, but no sentient being could be heartless enough to eat someone whose a kind friend, can they?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, naga,\" Felix called out. The naga peeked again and Felix slowly approached as he continued, \"I just wanted to...\" Before Felix could continue, the naga quickly lifted his arms and put them on top of his head as he laid his head on the ground as if trying to protect himself. The naga even hid his head behind his tail for the safe measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing the naga's reaction, Felix's fear quickly began to evaporate, and sympathy was replacing his fear. Felix couldn't believe something as large as the naga was afraid of him. <i>\"Those guards must have really traumatized him,\"</i> Felix realized, <i>\"Damn those heartless monsters.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may seem odd that the twenty-seven foot tall and estimated sixty foot long tail creature could be afraid of a ten year old boy. But the naga still viewed Felix as a person and since humans were still people to the naga, the naga couldn't bring himself to fight back if they attacked. If the naga was his normal five year old size of seventy feet tall, then the naga wouldn't be afraid of humans, because they would be prey. And if the humans were prey, the naga would just eat them like it was no big deal. As strange as that may seem, that was just how Felaryan nagas thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no reason to fear me,\" Felix tried to assure the naga in a comforting and inviting voice, \"I just want to talk.\" But as Felix got closer, the naga backed up. Felix stopped approaching the naga and began to worry the naga couldn't understand him. \"Can you understand me? Do you know what I'm saying?\" Felix asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnglish was the primary language for Felarya and the naga could understand and speak English. The naga just nodded his head. \"You just don't trust me, right?\" Felix asked. The naga nodded once more. Felix paused and wondered what he could say that would get the naga to trust him. Felix noticed the naga's back and got an idea. \"What if I told you I'm not like the rest of the humans you met?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga peeked over his thick tail and stared at the human in confusion. \"I think it's better if I show you first,\" Felix explained as he turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga was even more confused when the human turned his back to the naga and started lifting his shirt. However, when the naga was able to see the human's back, the naga began to realize what the human meant. The naga's eyes widened in shock and surprise and he lifted his head over his tail to get a better and closer look, though lifting his head over his tail was as close as he got to the human. The human was still two or three yards away. The human's back was full of scars both old and new. The naga couldn't believe it. The human had been hit by many whips as well. With his confusion, the naga found a voice and spoke for the first time since he had been captured. \"They whip you too?\" the naga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Felix replied, not entirely surprised the naga could speak, \"They whip me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you're a human, like them,\" the naga argued, \"Why would they whip you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They whip me when I do something that displeases them,\" Felix told the naga, \"Though I am a human, they don't see me as a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" the naga asked. The naga found it confusing that humans didn't see the boy as a human when he was clearly a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They see me as a slave,\" Felix answered, \"I'm in a class that is lower than the insects they crush under their boots. I'm nothing to them, not even an insect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga couldn't believe what he was hearing. It was so sad and unbelievable. <i>\"How can humans be so cruel?\"</i> the naga wondered, <i>\"They don't even see him as a human, just something less than a person. Has he done anything to deserve that treatment?\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix lowered his shirt and turned back around. \"So you see, I'm not like those other humans. I'm more like you than those monsters,\" Felix stated, \"That's why I'm not hear to hurt you, I don't think I ever could try to hurt you. I just want to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk? Why?\" the naga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I see what they do to you and I know how bad you must feel,\" Felix explained, \"I felt the same why when I was forced to come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They captured you to?\" the naga gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. I was five when I got here, but I can't remember anything before I got here. It's as if my memory was wiped of something,\" Felix replied, \"But I remember my first day here very well. I felt alone and sad. I felt hopeless, worthless, and powerless to do anything. I know that's how you must feel, right.\" The naga nodded and Felix continued, \"Because I know what it's like to be in your position, I can't just let you suffer. I thought that maybe there was someway I could help you so that you aren't sad and lonely anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you want to be my friend?\" the naga questioned, wondering if that was what the human was implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Felix answered.</span></div></div>",

He heard the large heart booming and the hands of the young naga pressing him against the chest.  \"<i>He's hugging me?</i>\" Felix thought realizing very quickly this was the first hug he could ever remember receiving.  He didn't know what to say or how to respond until a few seconds passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm . . . this is getting . . . a bit  . .. tight,\" Felix said as he felt the pressure increase.

The naga looked at him with confused eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I  . .grew again?\" the naga said, looking around.  And he noticed his tail was definently longer than it used to be.  He smiled.  \"I didn't even realize I grew!\" he said in an amazed voice, \"I was just really . . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?\" Felix guessed, watching the five year old naga nod his head.  Felix smiled at the young boy's happiness, depsite the young boy being over five times Felix's height, over ten if you included the tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he felt the hands of the naga around him, he recalled Lord William's harsh words about this creature, about how it would see him as prey and eat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But we're friends,</i>\" Felix thought, \"<i>How could he eat his friend?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Naga,\" Felix called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" the naga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see me as a friend, right?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the naga said, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you won't see me as prey?\" Felix asked.  Felix waited in hope the naga would nod, but no nod came.  A shake from the naga's head emerged instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once something is small enough for me to swallow whole, it is prey,\" the naga said matter-o-factly.  He watched his friend's expression change to one of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But . .

But that's like what the guards do to me!\" Felix said, \"I was a person forced to be a slave!  They see me with no value and once you're large enough, you won't either!\"  The words came out faster than Felix could realize he was speaking to a child, and a child who could harm him very very easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the naga's mind, Felix's words bounced around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He's my friend now . . .

As he tried to understand what the human meant, the naga could only think about the day he would have to eat his human friend. This made the naga sad and fell hungrier. <i>\"This is supposed to be a happy time, I just met a friend. I can't think about eating him, it will make me to sad,\"</i> the naga thought. So the naga changed the subject and assured the human, \"Don't worry, we can still be friends for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix just stared at the naga who was holding him with a hand under each of Felix's arms. The naga seemed to be telling the truth, but Felix was disturbed by the fact that the naga didn't say that he wouldn't eat Felix, just that they'd be friends for a long time. In truth, even when a naga eats a human friend, the naga still considers the human they ate a friend and still can't see the wrong in eating that friend. <i>\"Maybe I just need to keep being kind to the naga. Maybe then he'll understand how wrong it is to make a friend and then eat them just because their smaller. Maybe when the naga gets bigger, I can convince him not to eat me,\"</i> Felix hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga, wanting to get off the sad subject asked, \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Felix,\" Felix answered, \"What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash,\" the naga answered, \"I'm glad I met you, Felix. I've never had a friend before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's my brothers and sisters, but I never had a friend outside of the family. Though, I'm sure glad to have one now,\" Nahash explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad I finally have a friend, too,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears filled Nahash's eyes as he pulled Felix into a hug again. Nahash was more careful this time and it was a more pleasurable experience for Felix. \"I've been so alone here, but now I don't have to be anymore,\" Nahash cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you're willing to be my friend, I'll be your friend as well,\" Felix informed the hugging naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Felix,\" the naga replied as he continued to hug his new friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug lasted a little longer than the first and only stopped because Felix called up to Nahash, \"Um... Nahash, could you put me down please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Don't you like my hugs?\" Nahash questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that. It's just that I'm not used to being held by someone so large. It's a little uncomfortable and scary,\" Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I wouldn't hurt you, right?\" Nahash questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, but it's still a little scary,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash thought about Felix's claim and imagined being in Felix's position. Nahash realized how scary it must be to be held by a giant, even if that giant it gentle. Nahash had to get used to his mother holding him, after all, and she was a giant when he was only human sized. Naga's eat anything swallowable, except their own young. They'd eat other baby nagas, but not their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash ended the hug and carefully set Felix down on the ground. Once Felix was safe on the ground. Nahash coiled up his tail and laid his stomach on it with his head resting on his crossed arms. Nahash looked down at Felix, wondering what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Felix and Nahash talked for a long time to get to know each other better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Felix told Nahash that he has to go to the slave quarters to sleep, but Nahash didn't want Felix to leave.

He didn't want the guards coming in and finding them being friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, not so loud!\" Felix said in a loud whisper.

Most five year olds would do that, but Nahash was different. He saw Felix as a person and an older person he needed to obey. Nahash was taught to respect his elders and Felix, though much smaller than Nahash was older, around the age of an older brother. Because of this, Nahash still had to respect Felix since he was still a person and friend. Nahash sighed and moved his tail away from the door so that it was blocking Felix no more. Nahash looked at the ground in sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was surprised that the naga listened to him. Felix knew that Nahash had the power to do whatever he wanted with Felix and Felix wouldn't be able to stop Nahash. Felix was relieved to see that Nahash was going to listen to him and obey. <i>\"He must really want to keep my friendship,\"</i> Felix thought to himself, <i>\"He's large enough to force me to stay or do something terrible if he's mad, but it seems like he wouldn't do such things to me, not yet anyway.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was about to leave, but then he saw Nahash tilt his head to the ground. Felix approached the head and Nahash looked up, with his chin on the ground. Felix knelt down to try and be eye level with Nahash, because Felix was still taller than Nahash's head. Felix looked into Nahash's sad blue eyes and he touched Nahash's cheek. Felix rubbed the cheek and assured Nahash, \"It's alright, I'm not going to be gone forever. I'll still come here everyday three times a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the next time won't be till tomorrow,\" Nahash argued, \"I have to wait till night ends. I don't like sleeping alone in here. It's scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it must be, but it will be alright,\" Felix continued to assure the giant naga, \"I'm going to be here in the morning and nothing will harm you at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise?\" Nahash asked, \"You promise to be my friend and met me everyday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, and I\"ll try to stay here a little longer so we can talk and stuff,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cheered Nahash up and he picked up Felix up again with a hand under each of Felix's arms and then brought him into a hug. Again, Felix was a little panicked from the sudden grab, but he was comforted by the hug. After another minute of hugging, Felix said, \"Nahash, what did we discus about you picking me up without permission or a warning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash realized what Felix was talking about right away and set Felix back down on the ground. \"Sorry,\" Nahash answered, \"I forgot. It's just that I get so happy and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just automatically pick me up and hug me without thinking,\" Felix finished for Nahash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sorry. I'll try to remember to ask before I pick you up again,\" Nahash told Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Nahash,\" Felix replied, \"All be back tomorrow morning with your breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait, see you then,\" Nahash replied. When Felix left the cell, Nahash coiled up and laid his upper body stomach first against the coils. For the first time since he had been captured, Nahash felt happy. He felt like the situation was no longer hopeless and that he still might find happiness now that he had a friend. Nahash also noticed he wasn't as hungry as he had before. Nahash smiled and fell asleep for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The next day, Felix visited Nahash for breakfast and he learned more about Nahash and where Nahash came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: A week passed and Nahash was now fifty feet tall with a tail nearly one hundred feet long. Felix was still not swallowable and Nahash still treated Felix as an equal. Nahash started seeing Felix as an older brother who looked after him, despite him being much larger than Felix. Felix might have found a possible way out.</span></div></div>",

He knew soon he'd have to visit Nahash and feed him his lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This whole week has been strange,</i>\" Felix thought about how his relationship with Nahash evolved from friends to the young naga seeing Felix closer and closer to family.  Felix only hoped that being so close would protect him from being seen as prey once Nahash grew large enough.  After his second to last growth spurt, Nahash said once he was large enough he'd help Felix escape by eating Lord William and the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his desire to eat the evil guards wasn't all Felix knew of his Felaryan friend.  Nahash also had an elder brother, about Felix's age but according to Nahash, over 100 feet tall.  His mother and father had ruby and sapphire colored scales respectively.  They were both loving and caring towards their sons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I hope they are equally nice to his son's good friends,</i>\" Felix thought, knowing now that he did see Nahash as a younger brother who he had to protect.  It gave the young slave a little light in his life.  Nahash was someone who needed him and he could help.  It gave him a sense of accomplishment, of purpose and duty.  He couldn't stand to see Nahash beaten everyday, not as he was getting larger and larger, his beatings were actually getting worse and worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix shook his head, knowing it wouldn't be good to get caught day dreaming as his cleaning brought him close to Lord William's private chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just say?\" came Lord William's cold voice.  Felix froze, wondering if he was speaking aloud?  He looked and saw the door was ajar and Felix wasn't the intended target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was saying that the chain's magic is growing weaker.   It would be wise to apply another potion to it so the chain will stay strong enough to hold the beast,\" came a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said that it would last the two weeks, why the change?\" Lord William growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, I said it would last at most two weeks, depending on the strain the beast puts on it.  And the enchantment will probably last until the end of this week, however by the time we apply the potion, it could be too late,\" the alchemist replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did well to bring this to my attention,\" Lord William said, \"Prepare the remainder of the potion to apply to the chain when the monster's breaking session ends this afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me but the amount I have will not be enough for the current size of the chains.  I have a new batch brewing as I speak but it will not be ready until midday tomorrow,\" the alchemist said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then apply what you have!\" Lord William bellowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But sire, doing so would be dangerous and might cause the chains to weaken rather than strengthen, as mixing the old batch in with the new is very unwise,\" the alchemist said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, inform the guards when you are ready to apply the next batch,\" Lord William said in his dismissing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the the alchemist coming towards the door, Felix turned around and pretended to continue working as he thought about what he learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash's chains were weakening, but that didn't mean he would be able to break them.  If he got the old potion and applied it without them knowing it, it could also help his friend escape when they applied the new batch.  Of course it could strengthen the chains just as well, leaving Nahash stuck here even longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alchemist left the room, walking past Felix and Felix wondered what he should do next.</span></div></div>",

Felix also knew that the alchemist's quarters were on the way to the dungeons. <i>\"I can follow him and get the old potion that enchants the chains, because if Nahash can't break it now, we'd have to pure the old potion on so that it would weaken more when they put the new stuff on,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"And if I don't follow the alchemist, don't get the old potion, and Nahash can't beak the chains again, we'd have to wait till the new enchantments weakened which could could mean Nahash will be trapped in the cell another two weeks. Nahash will be his seventy foot height by then, he's about fifty already.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix grew worried when he thought about Nahash growing large enough to eat him. Nahash still hadn't told Felix he wouldn't eat Felix. So, it was still a possibility that he could eat Felix. <i>\"How could someone eat a friend?\"</i> Felix tried to assure himself that Nahash wouldn't eat him, <i>\"I've been so good to him and he's been extremely gentle and kind to me. He knows I'm older than him and Nahash admitted that I was like another older brother to him. I'm even starting to see him as a younger brother I need to protect, even if he's fifty feet tall and nearly one hundred feet long and could easily be protecting me, but I can still be emotional support for him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alchemist was about to turn down into another hallway, and Felix quickly got up and followed the alchemist at a distance. Eventually, Felix saw the alchemist turn into his quarters. Felix walked slower to the room and peeked his head in the doorway. The entire room was filled with bottles, potions, and chemistry sets, Felix had never seen anything like it and found it a strange site. Felix soon saw a large cauldron with a green substance brewing in it. He saw a smaller cauldron just sitting on a desk and the the alchemist was there and turned around. The alchemist noticed Felix and Felix thought he was in trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the alchemist didn't notice Felix had followed him and saw Felix as a good thing. \"Slave, take this!\" the alchemist ordered while holding out the small cauldron, \"I need you to dump it out somewhere. It is useless now.\" Felix carefully took the small cauldron. The alchemist saw Felix's nervousness and just assured, \"It's not a dangerous substance idiot, or I wouldn't trust a slave to handle it. Just dump it out.\" In actuality, Felix was excited in a nervous looking way. Felix took the small cauldron and walked away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Felix made it down to the dungeons with the cart with the meat and bowl of water on it. The small cauldron was on the cart as well. Felix noticed that there was only one guard by the door at the moment and it wasn't the man with the blow dart. Felix mad it to the guard and the guard didn't notice the small cauldron on the cart. \"Where's the other guard?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your business, slave,\" the guard simply replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knew where the other guards probably was. The blow dart guard was one of the guards that loved to rape the slave women by ordering them to have sex with them. The blow dart guard was probably doing that at the moment. <i>\"If Nahash can break the chains today, it will be the perfect time to escape with only one guard out there,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix entered the cell and saw Nahash coiled up and lying on his coils, crying. Felix slowly approached the giant naga and said, \"They really hurt you today, didn't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash looked up from his arms and looked down at Felix with tearful eyes. \"It's getting worse every session,\" Nahash informed Felix, \"I don't know how much I can take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't give up, Nahash. You know what will happen if you become their slave,\" Felix encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I don't want to become their weapon. Felix, could I...?\" Nahash started to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knew what Nahash was about to ask. Nahash was depressed with every torture and the was a sure way to calm him down. \"Sure,\" Felix answered. Nahash moved his hands and carefully picked up Felix with two hands. It was possible for him to pick Felix up with one hand, because Felix was about seven inches tall compared to Nahash, but Nahash wanted to be sure he was careful and gentle with his only friend. Nahash slowly picked Felix up and them pressed him firmly against his chest for a hug. Nahash bowed his head and cried while he hugged his friend. Felix just rubbed Nahash's chest to try and calm Nahash down. The hugs usually calmed Nahash down quickly. \"I don't think I'd be able to stay this strong without you, Felix,\" Nahash informed his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll always be here for support, Nahash,\" Felix told his large friend. Soon, Nahash calmed down and set Felix back down on the ground. Once on the ground, Felix stated, \"I brought food and water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Felix,\" Nahash replied before picking up pieces of meat and eating. While Nahash's fingers picked off the meat. Felix crouched down next to the cart to take out the bowl of water from the bottom level of the cart. When Nahash finished eating, Felix handed out the bowl to Nahash. Nahash took the water and drank it and handed it down to Felix. Felix took the bowl and put it back in the cart. \"So, what should we talk about now?\" Nahash questioned and he laid his body down on his coils once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking of talking about escaping,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't joke about that,\" Nahash replied, ready to cry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really,\" Felix quickly tried to assure Nahash, \"I heard Lord William and an alchemist talking. You know that enchantments on your chains? Well, they're weakening. You might be able to break them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Nahash gasped in disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you're unable to, we can dump the old potions on the chains and...\" Felix started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would that help?\" Nahash demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the old potion reacts comes into contact with the new one they'll pour on, it might weaken the chains even more,\" Felix explained, \"But if you can break those chains today, we can escape today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your tail is strong enough to bust through the large doors and the blow dart guard isn't outside, just one guard. The dungeons are made out of a cave system, and we might be able to find a way out of them,\" Felix informed Nahash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the other guard? I don't know if I can bring myself to kill a person, and if I don't break the door down in one hit, he'll run and get others,\" Nahash argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix took a bone and asked Nahash to break it. It wasn't too hard for Nahash to break the bone since he was so large. He handed the pieces to Felix and Felix said, \"I can stab him with the broken bone. If the chains can break, you should wait for me to go out of the cell, then you start hitting the door with your tail and I'll stab the guard before he get's help. He won't be expecting it. But first, we got to see if you can break the chains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash looked at the chains for a long time and looked worried. He was worried that the chains would still be strong. Nahash sighed and pulled on the chains.   </span></div></div>",

Do you want to risk being a slave here for another two weeks?  Or longer?\" Felix said, looking up at the naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I tried,\" Nahash said weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we wait for the next time, they could have found out about us and killed me for being nice to you Nahash,\" Felix said firmly.  He watched the fear and horror etch onto Nahash's face at the thought of those events coming to pass.  Taking a deep breath, he grabbed the dangling chain and pulled as hard as he possibly could and then some.  Felix was worried it would be for naught but then he saw some metal in links near where Nahash was pulling were starting to bend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going!\" Felix called until suddenly Nahash flew backwards onto the ground.  Where Nahash just stood hung a chain loosely in the air and on Nahash's neck was the clamp and some ten feet of chain, but still the young naga had broken the enchanted chains.  Nahash looked at the dangling chain that he had broken and was about to yell for joy when Felix waved for him to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Nahash said, happy he was free.  Felix nodded and proceeded to the next part of the plan.  He walked over to the door and knocked.  The guard opened and Felix went through.  The broken bone was hidden close to his body between his arm and torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done already slave?\" the guard asked, as Felix passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash watched as Felix left and the door was closing after a second hesitation, just as the door was to be closed, Nahash shoved his large tail through the door, nearly breaking it off its hinges.  He pulled the tail back and put his head towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix smiled as the guard laid on the ground dead.  When the door opened suddenly, the man was pushed back with it into the wall and his neck was snapped from the force of the impact.  Felix looked now at Nahash as the naga pushed out through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's lots of room,\" Nahash said, looking down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now let's get out of here before anyone comes,\" Felix said, dropping the bone in favor of the small sword the guard had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, I think you should ride on my neck,\" Nahash said, \"That way I can move quicker and protect you.\"  Felix nodded and moved towards the large neck, and got on, holding tight as Nahash started into the hallway.</span></div></div>",

He knew that if he went his fastest speed, he might accidentally knock Felix off his shoulder. Felix was already hanging onto the metal collar and the chain around Nahash's neck. \"Are you okay, Felix?\" Nahash asked, \"Do you need me to slow down for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was holding on tight, but knew he could manage his grip with the speed the giant naga was going at the moment. However, Felix was quite glad that Nahash was truly concerned about Felix's well-being. <i>\"He couldn't possibly eat me, could he?\"</i> Felix wondered. Felix answered up to Nahash's ear which was covered by his long black messy hair, \"I'm fine, Nahash, but thanks for the concern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have to make sure my friend is alright. That's what friends are for, right?\" Nahash replied, \"I have to make sure you're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're going to be the protector in this friendship,\" Felix stated, \"Even though I'm the oldest and it should be me protecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't help being smaller than me. It's just your species,\" Nahash informed Felix, not really understanding what he had actually said. \"So, these dungeons were made out of a cave system?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Lord William's men were digging the ground to make dungeons for the castle and they suddenly hit rock. They somehow broke through and found a large cave system underneath,\" Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the entrance to the dungeons isn't the natural opening to the cave?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not the natural opening,\" Felix informed Nahash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there is an opening somewhere. Don't worry, I think I can find it,\" Nahash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be so confident?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family lives in an underground cave system. My parents taught me about how to travel through them, how they work.

There was no light in the cave and it was completely black. \"Are you sure you can travel through darkness?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, humans can't see in the dark?\" Nahash questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A can't see anything through that darkness,\" Felix informed Nahash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I can see perfectly.

Finally Felix spoke about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing Nahash?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm smelling the air and listening for noises outside the cave, like birds or other creatures,\" Nahash said, before he started moving, \"I can't wait to get outside.  And once I grow again, I'll be rid of this collar.\"  Felix nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair continued traveling far into the darkness, Felix beginning to lose hope they'd be lost in it.  But Nahash gave his reassurances they wouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The path we're on will take us to freedom Felix.  I can smell fresh air coming stronger now,\" Nahash said, taking a deep breath, \"Yes, this scent is coming from outside.\"  Felix gave in and let Nahash continue on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat neither of them knew exactly was Lord William's castle was built at the foot of a range of mountains whose insides had made into catacomes once the volcano that once was there thousands of years ago died.  The system of caves connected one edge of the range to the other.  And so, as they neared the opening, they had put a great distance between themselves and Lord William's castle, well over a week's travel on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nahash gave a cry of joy, Felix saw the opening his naga friend found.  He felt Nahash pick up speed and race to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair entered into a range of green and brown.  Felix looked in awe of the old forest they had entered.  He had never seen a forest, let alone a tree this close before.  It shocked him to see just how big the forest was.  But he was also shocked by Nahash's next words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place has small trees compared to home,\" he said, seeing the small trees, compared to the giant ones in his homeland, \"I doubt once I grow any bigger, I could hide in them like mommy and daddy do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hopefully we can find a way to get you home then,\" Felix said, though a little sad as well.  He liked Nahash and didn't want to say good-bye to him but he knew the odds of him living safely in that place where he would be a bug to everything would be too dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then something troublesome occured as Nahash's stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's nearly dinner time,\" Nahash said, licking his lips as scents of animals came to his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll hunt then?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't think I can with you on me,\" Nahash said, looking over to a \"low\" branch, \"Why don't I put you there and go hunt?  This way you'll be safe.\"  Felix looked at the tree and the branch Nahash was talking about was the lowest one and was over thirty feet to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Felix said as Nahash moved over to the tree and put Felix on the branch.  \"Will you be eating your fill then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I haven't been properly full since before I was captured,\" Nahash said before departing, moving in a way that not even the chain bounced.  Felix watched his friend go, wondering how long until Nahash might see him as prey.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Nahash was no longer around, Felix began thinking to himself as he sat on the \"low\" branch of the tree. His mind was swarming with thoughts and emotions he couldn't recognize. The forest was nothing like the terrible castle as he looked around at its beauty. The forest was bright and colorful while the castle had been dark and bleak. The forest was full of browns, greens, and blues from the occasional blue bird that flew by. Felix had never seen so much of these colors, because he was much used to the grays and blacks Lord William's castle offered. Felix was glad to see a larger variety in colors. It made him feel better and more comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest he was in was a very old forest with tall and old trees and many of those trees. Though many trees looked like they were too old to stand, they were actually stronger than the new trees. Most people would have been scared of the strange formations the old trees made as they twisted through the forest, but Felix, having never seen trees up close before, thought they were large, majestic, and beautiful. (Wonder if he'd still think that at night.) The trees were very close together and it was a little crowded, Felix could even reach the longer branches of other trees. It was a surprise to Felix that Nahash was able to slither through such a crowded forest. However, it didn't seem as close and claustrophobic as the castle corridors. So, Felix wasn't bothered by the closeness of the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix thought he would never get outside the exterior walls of the castle. He was relieved that he was far away from the castle walls now. He \"responsibilities\" and \"chores\" he had to do for Lord William seemed to evaporate away from him. Felix was no longer worried about Lord William or his guards. He was no longer afraid of what might happen to him and the was finally excited about the world around him he wanted to explore. He also felt other strange feeling inside him he couldn't explain efficiently enough, but they were all great feelings. <i>\"Is this what it feels like to to be free?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"I feel alive for the first time. I feel great.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix felt peaceful and he scooted closer to the trunk of the tree where the branch he was sitting on came from. He had to duck under some branches even though he was scooting to the trunk in a sitting position the entire time. Once he was at the trunk, he leaned his back on the trunk and sat so there was a leg dangling over the side of each of the branch's side. Felix reclined as far as he could and sighed with relief. he had never had a brake before at the castle. His only resting periods there was when he had to eat and when he had to sleep. Other than those times, Felix had to be working constantly. In the forest, Felix could finally relax and it felt better than he could have ever imagined. Felix would have been more relaxed if he had put his legs on the branch as well, but he wasn't comfortable enough to do so. Heights and climbing trees was a new experience for him. He may have been a little more carefree being free now, but he wasn't reckless. The low branch was about half as high as Nahash which meant the height was close to twenty to thirty feet since Nahash was fifty feet tall. Felix knew falling from the height could seriously hurt him, or worse. He would just have to wait for Nahash to come back and pick him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat small thought about Nahash suddenly brought Felix's entire mind focused on Nahash. Nahash still hadn't said that he wouldn't eat Felix. So, there was still a possibility that Nahash would... <i>\"No, Nahash is my dearest friend and he cares about me as I care about him. We're like brothers. He couldn't really eat me, could he?\"</i> Felix wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I know that I would never eat a person just because their smaller than me, but Felaryans morality is much different from a humans. A person to them is something that isn't smaller than them, and Felaryan nagas start seeing things that are swallowable prey,\"</i> Felix argued with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But he should still understand that we're friends. he wouldn't change his mind just because he's bigger,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"I mean, he's much larger than me now, but he treats me like an older brother. Most five year olds would look at me and think I'm a plaything and wouldn't understand I'm a person. Nahash may be an exception to the naga views.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But he was taught that things swallowable are prey, no matter what. He's still only five years old and might not understand the complications of morals. He'd obviously be sorry and sad about eating me, but he'd still eat me because that's what he was taught to do,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But I might be able to convince him not to eat me. I could explain things in simpler terms for him and make him understand why eating me would be wrong,\"</i> Felix tried to assure himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But do I really want to take that risk?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"If he decided to eat me, I won't be able to stop him. He's far too big, strong, and fast for me to stop him. My words would be my only weapon. That's not a good scenario.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked down from the branch and looked around. He noticed he could try to grab some branches from a near by tree and try to climb down, but it was a risk since he had never climbed a tree before. <i>\"Should I try to escape?\"</i> Felix asked himself, <i>\"I might be able to get away, but it will break Nahash's heart if I run away. He also might suddenly think I'm prey and hunt me down. He may not have a snake's tongue, but his nose it just as strong as a snake's tongue and he might easily track me down. Plus Nahash is so silent as he slithers around. It seems impossible for something so large to be quiet, but he doesn't make a sound and could easily sneak up on me. What should I do?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash had found many small animals and filled his stomach up. Some of the creatures he came across he had never seen before and their taste was very strange, but just as good as the meat from his home. <i>\"I wonder if Felix is hungry now?\"</i> Nahash wondered, <i>\"I better bring back one of these creatures for him, just in case.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash caught a deer and snapped its neck so that he could carry it around without it squirming around. Nahash than began slithering to where he had left Felix. When Nahash got there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Felix was hanging from a branch, in danger of falling. Felix had tried to climb down to escape, but he messed up and was going to fall if Nahash didn't catch him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Felix was still on the branch waiting for Nahash. Felix decided it was too risky to try and escape from Nahash.</span></div></div>",

He watched the young boy beam at the praise.  \"But I can't eat it like that.\"  Nahash looked hurt and looked at the deer in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it bad?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's that I need to cook the food to eat it,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" Nahash asked, realizing he never once asked Felix about his eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's how my body is.  I can't usually eat meat unless it has been cooked by a fire,\" Felix said.  He saw tears form in the boy's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you don't want it?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just need to make a fire to cook it,\" Felix said quickly, not wanting to upset Nahash, for fear of what a temper tantrum from a large naga might do.  Nahash nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do we make a fire?\" Nahash asked, looking at the deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know how,\" Felix said, \"I once worked in the kitchen.  Would you set me down on the ground?\"  Nahash nodded, picking Felix up and setting him on the ground, the deer still in his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix worked quickly, finding some fallen limbs and enough kindling.  But he was still lacking two stones to make sparks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix looked around for the rocks he needed as quick as possible. He could tell that Nahash was still a little upset by the situation. Felix didn't want to see Nahash upset. Not only was Nahash only a five year old child, but seeing such a large creature cry miserably is something hard to witness. Plus, Felix didn't want to see what Nahash would be capable of when he was upset. Nahash has been nothing but kind to Felix, but Felix didn't want to chance hurting the giant naga's feelings. There was still a chance that Nahash could eat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked behind a tree and found something that startled him. Felix was so surprised by what he found, that he fell backwards away from the tree. \"What's wrong, Felix?\" Nahash quickly questioned. Nahash was still upset that Felix couldn't eat what he gave him, but Nahash still saw Felix as a friend he needed to protect for now. Nahash quickly slithered to Felix. Nahash snaked behind Felix till his body towered beside Felix and his tail formed a wall behind Felix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stared up at the giant five year old naga as the naga bent down to take a look around the tree. Nahash formed a nearly perfect J as he edged closer to the tree and Felix stood up, using Nahash's black tall as support. Eventually, Nahash saw what had startled Felix and gasped. Felix slowly walked beside Nahash's side till he was around the tree with Nahash's head. Lying against the tree was a dead body. The body was just a skeleton now and was dressed in clothing that was tattered and indistinguishable. The skeleton had a pack at its side and a few weapons with it. There was a knife on the skeleton's belt, a sword in its hand and a bow and quiver of arrows next to the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long has it been dead?\" Nahash questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I long time if he or she is only bones now,\" Felix stated, \"I'm surprised none of us noticed it before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can smell those who are alive or dead, but not when they're just bones,\" Nahash informed Felix. Felix walked closer to the dead skeleton. \"What are you doing?\" Nahash asked worriedly. It was quite clear that Nahash was afraid of the dead body. he was still a child and hadn't seen that much death. The dead was a scary thing for most children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, he's dead,\" Felix assured Nahash, \"I'm just going to see what he has I can use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful,\" Nahash warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was different from Nahash and Felix had seen much death in his life time. He was only five years older than Nahash, but Felix had seem many thing and did many things that made his mentality grow much quicker. He was much more mature than most humans his age. Felix approached the skeleton and knelt down beside it. The skeleton looked human, but Felix couldn't help but feel that the skeleton was different in some way. There was something about it that didn't seem right. Little did Felix know, this skeleton was actually an elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked in the pack and found all the supplies, except the food, was still in perfect condition. There were even supplies meant to start fires. Felix took those first and rushed to the fire. Nahash slowly followed behind Felix and saw Felix make a fire. \"Wow,\" Nahash said in amazement. As Felix made the fire bigger, Nahash asked, \"Now, do you just put the deer in the fire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm going to have to skin the deer first and then tie it to a large branch and rotate it above the fire,\" Felix explained as he stuck two of the larger branches in the ground which were fairly Y shaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't realize you had to do so much before eating,\" Nahash replied, \"Is my gift that bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're gift isn't bad at all,\" Felix quickly tried to assure the giant naga, \"It's great that you thought of me and I appreciate the food, because I'm really hungry. it's just that my body is different from yours. I need to cook meat first or I could git very sick. Please don't be offended by my actions, I truly am thankful of your gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash laid his body on the ground stomach first and edged his face closer to Felix. The giant child face was smiling and cheering up. Felix soon found one of Nahash's hands forming a wall behind him. Eventually, Felix was pressed against one of Nahash's cheeks with a giant hand firmly pressing him against the soft, smooth, and slightly wet from tears surface.When Nahash released Felix, Nahash apologized, \"I just wish I knew you had to do so much before you could eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault that you didn't know,\" Felix assured his giant friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix walked back to the skeleton and looked at the weapons. The weapons too were in perfect condition and were the more elegant things he had ever seen. <i>\"Surely these aren't from fighting,\"</i> Felix thought to himself. Yet when he lifted the sword, it was sharp and strong. However, the sword seemed lighter than it should have been and adult could probably use it with one hand though it was a two handed blade. Felix would still have to use two hands though. There were strange symbols on the sword that Felix had never seen before. (Elf language). Felix took the knife which was just as impressive and brought the knife to the deer with rope he found in the pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix skinned the deer and then tied it to a large branch. Nahash was happy to lift the deer and place it above the fire with the two Y branches supporting the deer. Felix cooked the deer and was eventually able to eat it. Felix was so hungry he was able to eat nearly all of the deer. Nahash gladly finished the rest and swallowed it whole, bones and all. Nahash liked the taste of the cooked meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were finished, Felix and Nahash looked at the sky to see...</span></div></div>",

He averted his eyes from the body, looking only at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Felix replied, \"It might be wise to put some distance between us and the cave if any of the soldiers should find the way through.\"  Nahash nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, is something wrong?\" Nahash asked in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just wondering about that skeleton and why it died here of all places,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could he have been a slave?\" Nahash asked.  Felix shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he was a slave, he wouldn't have had the weapons or supplies on him,\" Felix answered, \"And if he was attacked by bandits, he wouldn't have had the possessions on him either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Felix said, before seeing the fire die down.  \"Nahash, would you help me put out the fire?\"  Nahash smiled and moved his tail over the small fire and put it out without issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we'll be going?\" Nahash asked.  Felix nodded and made sure the weapons and supplies were on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's follow the sun until it sets,\" Felix said, as he saw Nahash reach out for him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nahash continued through the forest with Felix on his shoulder holding onto the metal collar around Nahash's neck. Felix was surprised at how quickly Nahash was traversing through the forest. Nahash was an impressively large creature for a five year old, having the upper body of a fifty foot giant child and a tail that was easily one hundred feet long or more. Felix stopped measuring Nahash from the ground up, because that size varied depending on how much of his tail he used as vertical support. Felix realized that he had to go with Nahash's upper body height which was close to twenty-five to thirty feet tall which meant he had the upper body of a fifty foot giant child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing so large, it seemed like it should be difficult for something like Nahash to move so easily through a dense forest. Grant it, Nahash knocked down some of the smaller trees to make some room and he had to slither sideways to get through some parts of the forest, but Nahash was still able to get through the dense forest with relative ease. Nahash even climbed on the trees and slithered through limbs. No matter how dense the forest was, he seemed to instinctively know a path through it. Nahash's upper body seemed to be made of the same bones and have the same structure of a human being, but he was extremely flexible, agile, and precise as a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis size should have hindered his speed and movement, because he weighed so much. However, what Felix didn't realize was that Nahash's weight and muscle ratio was the same as a human sized naga. This meant it would take the same amount of strength, or it would seem like it to them, for a giant naga to move his arm and a human naga to move his. Everything else about the naga was the same ratio which meant that a giant naga and a human sized naga were about the same average speed, relative to size, making Nahash's a dangerously fast creature. Something as small as a human wouldn't stand a chance against a giant naga's speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix began realizing that Nahash was extremely fast and agile. This worried Felix. (it would have worried him more if Nahash were to tell him he was making sure to not go as fast as he could, because Nahash was going slower so that Felix wouldn't fall off and get hurt.) <i>\"Nahash is fast, way too fast,\"</i> Felix thought as he sat upon his giant friend's shoulder, clutching the metal collar around his giant friend's neck for security, <i>\"If he gets his mind set on eating me, I wouldn't stand a chance. If he truly has no remorse in eating me, he could snatch me up and swallow me before I have a chance to blink! Maybe I should have tried to run.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, I can't,\"</i> Felix argued with himself, <i>\"He may want to eat me when he grows, but he's still my friend and he still needs me. He'd be heartbroken if I run away. Even if running away means staying alive, I just can't bring myself to leave a friend. The only hope I have now is that Nahash continues to see me as a friend and not prey or that he at least hesitated when it's time for him to eat me due to the size difference. That will give me enough time to talk to him and maybe convince him that eating people is wrong.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to stop thinking about such a subject, Felix asked Nahash, \"What do you think happened to that person we got the supplies from? How do you think he or she died?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still thinking about that? Can we talk about something different?\" Nahash requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Death is scary,\" Nahash told Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix remembered how uncomfortable Nahash seemed around the dead body. \"But you weren't uncomfortable with killing the deer,\" Felix pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deer aren't people,\" Nahash informed Felix, \"They're prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they're swallow able to you?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They weren't swallow able yet, but they can't talk,\" Nahash explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix realized that Nahash was first judging that people were considered people when they weren't swallow able and then out of the creatures that weren't swallow able, the ones with intelligence were people. Felaryan nagas judged with size first and intelligence second. Felix just had to convince Nahash that intelligence had to be the first judge. Felix placed that information in the back of his head and said, \"Well, I thought of two possible ways he could have died since we ruled out escaped slave and bandits. The person could have froze to death since he didn't have a blanket or anything to keep him warm, or he could have been poisoned, but I'd think a traveler would have know what he could and couldn't eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a traveler would know to bring a blanket too, right?\" Nahash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Felix agreed, \"This just makes the cause of death more confusing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Nahash and Felix came upon a large clearing. They looked at the sky and it was getting close to sun set. \"Do you think we should stop here?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was glad Nahash was being fair to him and he was asking for Felix's opinions. Felix was happy to know his voice still mattered to the giant five year old Felaryan naga, because Nahash could just as easily force things upon Felix or see Felix as a pet of a toy rather than like an older brother. \"I think this is as good a place as any to stop. So, let's sleep here,\" Felix gave his opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash agreed and put his hand up to his shoulder. Felix walked onto the giant hand and sat down. Nahash bent down and lowered his hand to the ground. Felix stepped off the hand and turned to look up at Nahash as Nahash laid his body down on his stomach with his arms crossed and his chin resting upon his crossed arms. Felix noticed that Nahash looked different. \"Nahash, I think you grew a few feet while we traveled to this clearing,\" Felix told Nahash. Nahash got up and looked at himself compared to his surroundings. Felix was very intimidated by the fact that he was so close to something gigantic standing at near full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right, Felix,\" Nahash replied. Nahash felt the metal collar around him which still grew with him. Nahash became worried and asked, \"What if this collar stops growing with me and ends up choking me when I grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The growing of the collar will wear off. I just hope it makes it weak enough to break before you start choking,\" Felix stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so too,\" Nahash hoped. Nahash's stomach growled and he automatically looked down at Felix. Felix grew worried as he knew that Nahash was judging if Felix was small enough now to swallow. Nahash growth wasn't that large of a growth and had the upper body of a fifty-five giant child as opposed to a fifty foot giant child. Felix's height still looked about five or six inches to Nahash, not small enough to swallow yet. \"Are you hungry Felix? I can get something for you as well,\" Nahash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am hungry, and thanks for the offer, Nahash,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what friends do. They help each other,\" Nahash informed Felix before slithering off quickly. Felix started the fire.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix watched the fire for a long time.  His mind wandered for the first time in his life and he didn't have to worry about being hurt for it.  His mind moved from the body and what could have killed that person to if some of Lord William's men had made it though the cave searching for them.  But mostly his thoughts drifted back to how Nahash was starting to see 'people' differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the fire,\" Felix mumbled, seeing it die low.  He rose and put some more wood on it, and blew for it to regain strength.  As it started to come back, an urge came over Felix.  He looked around to some bushes a little ways away and walked over to them.  He pulled open his pants and relieved himself, noticing as well the sky above the trees was very dark by now.  Many stars appeared above him.  It was a beautiful sight but once he was finished, his stomach growled, alerting him to another immediate problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope Nahash comes back soon,\" Felix mumbled, before walking back to the fire.  He was about to sit down when he heard heavy footsteps from behind him.  Turning slightly he saw a tusker, though he didn't know what they were called.  Felix did see this pig-beast stood well over him, his nose was level to Felix's head and from ground to the hump on the pig's back was well over the height of any man.  Tusks were on both sides of the beast's mouth as it sniffed the area Felix went on.  Now normally a tusker wouldn't have bothered with Felix, he wasn't anywhere the pig cared about.  But after smelling the urine, the tusker squealed and looked at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, what does it want?\" Felix wondered in fear.  When he heard another squeal  the tusker charged at the human, with Felix just  jumping out of the way.  Felix landed near the fire and picked up a burning branch and brandished it at the tusker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately this along with what the tusker thought was a challenge to his territory led the beast to charge once more, not caring if he was injured by the flames of the branch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the tusker never made it that far because a long thick snake tail shot between Felix and his foe.  Felix looked around and saw Nahash circling the pig-beast, smiling at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, are you all right?\" Nahash asked, turning a head to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fine.\" Felix said.  Nahash smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad.  I was worried when I heard the squeal of this pig,\" Nahash said turning about while keeping the terrified tusker contained.  Nahash placed another deer by Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you ate your fill?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I won't forgive that pig for attacking you,\" Nahash said, \"So while it's not prey, I will eat it.  Plus if I don't eat everything, I'll have food for breakfast right away in the morning.\"  Felix nodded and watched Nahash turn back to the hidden pig.  He saw the naga's hands reach down and one final squeal from the pig.  With the threat gone, Nahash moved his tail so Felix could get to the fire.  Felix cut the deer and started cooking the meat as Nahash took small bites from the beast.  It was so large Nahash had to use two hands to hold it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Felix finished his meal and Nahash about half the tusker, Nahash gave a large yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sleepy now,\" the boy naga murmured, \"Felix, will you sleep with me so I can keep you safe?\"  Felix was worried for a second, fearing what might happen if Nahash wanted a midnight snack while he slept.  But quickly he realized if he was away from Nahash he'd probably be very cold and unprotected from anything else in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Nahash,\" Felix replied in an equally sleepy voice.  Nahash put out the fire and reached down for Felix.  Felix stepped on and was brought to Nahash's chest and the naga wrapped his tail around them for warmth and safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to either, over this night, Nahash would experience one of his largest growth spurts during his growth period.  Felix would shrink to just over an inch tall compared to the young naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the two boys rested, unaware of what was to come.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was unfortunate for the two friends that Nahash would experience the growth spurt that would grow him to the size a five year old Felaryan giant naga should be. It would end the growth spurts and cause Nahash to grow with age from then on, but this growth spurt would make him large enough to be able to swallow Felix and unfortunately that would make Felix prey, despite their close friendship at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt may also be considered unfortunate that the collar grew with Nahash that night, as cold as that may sound. If the collar wouldn't have grown, Nahash would have woken up in the middle of the night choking, which would have also woken up Felix. If this would have happened there would have been two possibilities. Either Nahash would have choked to death by the collar, or Felix might have figured out a way to get the collar off. Either way would have been greater chance for Felix's survival. If Nahash would have choked to death, Felix wouldn't have to worry about being eaten by Nahash and Nahash wouldn't have to live with the guilt of eating a friend. Sure Felix would have been sad if Nahash had died, but it would have probably been the safest route. If Felix would have managed to save Nahash instead, Nahash might have become so grateful that probably would have forgotten about eating Felix and no longer see him as prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the collar grew with Nahash and none of those possible situations ever happened. Felix never noticed Nahash's growth while he slept and Nahash was never choked on the collar. In fact, the last growth that the collar was forced to do caused a crack which caused it to break in the middle of the night. Nahash and Felix didn't hear the crack. This would be the hardest scenario for both of them to overcome. Their friendship would be put to the test, but for now, they had a peaceful sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Nahash woke up on his back with his tail lying on him in an S-like shape and finally ending with the end of his tail under his head like a pillow. Nahash had never slept like this before, and it felt strange to him. Nahash was about to just slide his tail off himself, but he felt something lying on his stomach under his hand. The thing under his hand was moving slightly and felt alive. Nahash soon remembered why he was lying on the way he was, it was to keep his little friend warm and close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash could feel Felix under his hand, breathing steadily. <i>\"He's still asleep,\"</i> Nahash thought as he slowly and carefully dragged his tail off himself. Nahash made sure his tail didn't run over his friend since the thicker parts of his tail could easily crush Felix if he wasn't careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nahash moved his tail away, Nahash lifted himself where his stomach was slightly inclined and his chest on up was more vertical. Nahash has to support this position with his elbows while keeping his hands covering Felix. When Nahash got in this position, he felt his metal collar fall away from his neck and fall on the ground. Nahash was just able to turn his head around enough to see the collar cracked and destroyed. Nahash was extremely happy and excited to see the horrid collar off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was about to wake Felix up in his excitement, but then Nahash made a horrifying discovery. He realized that he had grown and when he lifted his hand off Felix, he saw how little Felix was now. Nahash let out a quiet gasp. Felix was now swallowable. <i>\"F-Felix is prey, now,\"</i> Nahash realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash looked down at Felix with eyes and mouth wide open in shock for the longest time. <i>\"What am I waiting for?\"</i> Nahash wondered, <i>\"He's prey now, and I'm hungry. I have to eat him. I can't back away from it. I'm supposed to eat prey when I'm hungry. I'm not a loud to let them go. Felix is prey now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But he's my friend,\"</i> Nahash argued with himself, <i>\"I can't harm him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He may be my friend, but he's prey now, I have to eat him. It's my responsibility as a naga to eat prey when I'm hungry,\"</i> Nahash reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I know,\"</i> Nahash sighed, <i>\"I have to eat Felix now, even if he is my friend. He will be helping me by giving my body nutrients. He'd become a part of me. He'd be happy helping me. Since he is my friend, I must make his death quick and painless by swallowing him while he's still asleep.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash stared down at Felix with tears in his eyes. No matter how many things he said to himself that would try to assure him, there was a part of him that didn't want to go through with it and didn't want to eat his only friend. But in his mind he felt as though he had to do it. The stomach underneath Felix, the final resting place for Felix, gurgled and Nahash saw Felix stir a little. <i>\"I have to make this quick,\"</i> Nahash thought, <i>\"For both our sakes.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash placed a hand back down on Felix and carefully wrapped it around his little friend. Nahash gently lifted Felix up and brought him to his awaiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had slept peacefully between Nahash's stomach and hand. The giant Felaryan naga's skin was soft, warm, and more comfortable that any bed Felix had ever been in, and Felix didn't want to wake up and have to leave the comfort. Nahash was still young, so his skin was still soft and smooth and the feeling of it only multiplied due to the size difference between Felix and Nahash. Nahash's body heat was also extremely warm because instead of being cold blooded, Nahash was much different. All of the giant Felaryan top predators either had the body structure of a human of the upper body structure of a human on top of another creature, because of this, the human bodies don't have fur. They need warmth for colder weather, but there is barely any clothes out there that would fit such large creatures. So, to survive colder climates, they have an inner heat that keeps them warm. It's unknown how they sustain the warmth with enough energy, but they can survive cold climates without clothes. In fact, they aren't in danger of freezing to death till the temperature is below freezing. Felix was kept extra warm snug between Nahash's hand and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the thing he was sleeping on was the most comfortable bed he had been on, it was a little disturbing that he was lying on a giant five year old he called his friend and calling him a bed. However, if it wouldn't have been for him sleeping on Nahash, Felix would have been cold at night. Felix didn't want to leave the comfort despite the fact he was sleeping on his friend. Felix suddenly heard the stomach growl beneath him. Felix shivered as he remembered that it was still possible that Nahash would eat him. Felix was lying above the organ that could end up being his prison. He could be sent into the large organ, digested in terrible acids, and then be absorbed into his friend only so that the giant naga would gain nutrients from what he called his friend. It seemed like a terrible fate to end up being nothing at all and be eaten alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix suddenly felt Nahash's hand wrap around him where only his shoulders and head weren't encompassed in the large hand. Felix then felt his body being lifted in the air. <i>\"Is he just waking me up?\"</i> Felix wondered. Felix opened his eyes to find a cavernous mouth wide open. Felix was extremely close to the mouth and could see all the disgusting and terrible little details. He could see some raw meat stuck between Nahash's teeth, strands of saliva , and the terrible black abyss that was Nahash's throat. Felix could fell Nahash's warm and humid breath swoop onto his face. Felix was utterly terrified at the sight and was too shocked to do anything. He couldn't believe that Nahash was already turning on him. Felix's body was getting closer to the mouth and soon it was all that filled his vision. The naga's tongue stretched out and before Felix was placed upon the large, moist organ, Felix yelled, \"Nahash stop! Please, don't eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash stopped his hand when he heard his friend cry out. Nahash closed his eyes, as if not seeing Felix would change the creature in his hand to something else. \"Go to sleep, Felix,\" Nahash muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that you can eat me?\" Felix screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you talking is making everything harder to do,\" Nahash informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's hard for you to eat me, then why are you killing me?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have to, Felix. You're prey now. I'm hungry and I have to eat everything that's small enough. It's how we nagas survive,\" Nahash explained, \"I'm sorry, Felix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call be by my name,\" Felix demanded, \"You're not my friend if your going to eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Felix, I have to,\" Nahash cried, \"I don't want to, but I have to. Why can't we be friends? You'd be helping me survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By killing me? Is that how you treat friends? By eating them for nutrition?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I...\" Nahash started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix interrupted, \"Friends don't kill other friends. It's wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're prey now,\" Nahash argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wasn't prey yesterday! Now I'm prey just because you grew over the night. Does that seem in any way fair to you? Would you like it if I was the giant and I grew big enough to swallow you and just decided that you were prey and eat you without hesitation?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wouldn't like it,\" Nahash cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you believe that small things are prey, why don't your parents eat you?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm their son. They wouldn't eat a son,\" Nahash answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what about the deer and the tusker? They were bigger than prey but you ate them, why?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't people. They can't talk and can't think like people. They were alright to eat,\" Nahash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you judge people by their size and then their intelligence? But what about the people that are small and intelligent. You think you can eat them just because their small? But they have feelings and intelligence like you. Are you willing to destroy people just to gain food?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, I...\" Nahash tried to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, I saved you from that prison. I helped you when you were sad and kept you company when you were lonely. I was there for you and helped you escape that dreadful place. We've become close friends and you said I was like a brother to you. Are you just going to throw that all away and kill me?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how can we be friend when I'm, so much larger than you?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always been smaller than you and that never stopped you before from being friends with me,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can eat you now,\" Nahash stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because you have the power to do something, it doesn't mean its the right thing to do it,\" Felix informed his large friend, \"No one is making you do this. You don't have to if you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to do,\" Nahash replied with tears streaming down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what you think is right,\" Felix replied, closing his eyes tight hoping that Nahash would make the right decision.   </span></div></div>",

Silence came in his mind as he realized what was the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix,\" Nahash said softly.  His eyes still shut, tight, Felix tensed a little at Nahash's soft tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Nahash,\" Felix replied, worried about his fate.  But then he felt Nahash's hand moving downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must leave Felix,\" Nahash said, dropping Felix to the ground.  \"I cannot be around you.\"  Felix's eyes opened up as he looked at the giant naga, seeing his full height for the first time this morning.  He truly was huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Felix asked, \"You aren't going to eat me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot eat you Felix,\" Nahash said softly, \"But that doesn't mean I might not on accident.  I want to see you safe, but I'm no longer safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you can control yourself, like this morning!\" Felix replied.  He looked hopefully up at his friend.  While he did not want to become food, he certainly didn't want to be left alone in the woods without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, you have no idea how hungry I may become,\" Nahash said, \"I could just pick you up and devour you without any thought because I'd be so hungry!\"  Felix didn't know what else to say.  \"Goodbye Felix.\"  Nahash said after a moment of silence.  He quickly turned and fled into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash wait!\" Felix called when he saw the boy naga turning around, but it did no good.  Nahash was out of there far to quick to hear the little human.  Felix looked down the path Nahash went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I try following him?\" Felix muttered to himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix stood there in the clearing staring in the direction Nahash had taken off in. Felix slowly recalled everything that had happened that morning. Felix had honestly thought that Nahash would actually eat him. Nahash was still young after all and it was quite possible that he didn't understand morality or be able to understand why eating people was wrong, even with Felix trying to explain it as simple as possible. Things such as morality and right and wrong were very abstract things for a child to understand. Felix only understood because he was mature for his age since he had to learn to grow up fast in the hostile environment of Lord William's castle. Nahash only know of what right and wrong was through his parents and they had taught Nahash that eating creatures that were small enough to swallow were okay to eat, despite the fact they could be intelligent of not. Nahash was taught the twisted version of morality through a Felaryan's eyes where if big things had the power to do something to a little being, it was alright to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it came of great surprise to Felix when Nahash didn't eat him and actually set him down on the ground. It seemed as though Nahash understood Felix, or at least understood Felix vaguely enough to realize he shouldn't eat Felix. Felix had been so surprised that when he feet touched the ground, Felix wasn't ready and feel down onto his butt without Nahash's large hand for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that Nahash didn't want to hurt Felix, but from what Nahash told Felix, it was also clear that Nahash wasn't sure of himself. Nahash wasn't confident that Felix was safe with him. Nahash didn't trust himself with Felix because even though he saw Felix as his friend, he still had the instinct as well as his parents' teachings in his head which both told him he should eat Felix and it was alright to eat Felix since he was small enough. Nahash made his decision and made sure to be as far away from Felix as possible, and there was nothing Felix could say to stop the giant five year old naga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked down the path Nahash slithered off to. Nahash wasn't being careful or trying to cover his tracks, he was just going as fast as he could. Therefore, Nahash had left an easy enough trail to follow. <i>\"I can easily follow him,\"</i> Felix thought to himself, but he started to contemplate whether or not he really should follow Nahash. <i>\"Nahash is my friend. I should follow him,\"</i> Felix told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But he tried to eat me. If I wouldn't have woken up in time, he would have swallowed me whole and wouldn't have even cared. I would have woken up in his stomach slowly dying and he would have just went about his day not caring that his \"friend\" was being digested alive in his stomach. How could a monster like that possibly be a friend?\"</i> Felix began to question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He didn't know any better. He's still just a kid and he was taught to eat smaller things,\"</i> Felix began arguing with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's no child. That's a damn monster!\"</i> Felix thoughts pointed out, <i>\"Even young humans children know hurting their friends is wrong. If this naga can even think of hurting me, let alone killing you, it must not think I'm a friend at all.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But I don't think he wanted to hurt me,\"</i> Felix realized, <i>\"I think he truly believed that if he would have swallowed me alive while I was asleep, I wouldn't feel pain. The only reason he was willing to kill me was because there were things conflicting his thinking. One part of him saw me as a friend, but he was also taught to eat things that were swallowable and I was not swallowable to him. Those conflict thoughts were giving him a hard time. He's not a human. He's a giant naga that was born and raised in that messed up world where it is considered okay to eat humans as long as they're small. Now he's been introduced to two different worlds and of course he's extremely confused.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I need to be there for him,\"</i> Felix continued his thoughts, <i>\"He's got to be feeling horrible and lonely right now. He needs me and as long as I show him I'm there for him, he'll see me more as a friend than prey. If he continues to see me as a friend more than prey, he might eventually forget about me being prey and only as a friend.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"But he's dangerous,\"</i> Felix thought of one more final argument, <i>\"He still has the urge to eat me and at his size, he could do anything he wants with me and I'd be powerless to stop him.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Honestly, I'm not much safer alone. It's better to be with something that still has the possibility of not hurting me rather than be in the forest by my self with creatures that only rely on their instincts and basic needs to make their decisions,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"Besides, the longer I'm with him, the more he'll realize I'm a friend and he will eventually not want to eat me at all.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that final thought, Felix ran into the direction Nahash had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Nahash didn't go that far and Felix was able to catch up with Nahash by noon. Nahash had stayed in a clearing and is crying when Felix arrives. Nahash hadn't eaten yet and is hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Nahash just kept going and there was no way that Felix could catch up with such a large creature going so far. Night approaches and Felix has to sleep alone. Luckily he was able to get some food along the way like berries and possibly a small animal.</span></div></div>",

Part of him even saw them as punishment for what he had almost done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I almost ate my friend,</i>\" Nahash thought once more, \"<i>I can't be with him anymore.  I'm too dangerous to protect Felix.  I have to keep going!  The further I am, the safer Felix will be.</i>\" before he ran into a large tree.  Nahash barely registered the fact he knocked the tree over the river he was about to cross.  He looked at the water and felt his stomach rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are no people in the water,\" Nahash muttered before dropping down and chugging down the river water.  He took in many fish that happened to be spawning up stream and felt his hunger sated, for now.  But he knew he couldn't wait there as Felix might be following him.  So Nahash tore across the large stream and continued into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix, despite the scars and bruises from being a slave, was not out of shape, ironically, because he was a slave.  So he had the endurance to keep a good pace following the broken trail of Nahash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He really isn't paying attention to anything,\" Felix breathed, watching the number of fallen branches on the trail and the silence of all other creatures in the woods.  No predator would come to Nahash's trail for a while, so Felix was safe from them, but not his stomach.  He heard it grumble for a third time since his run started and while he had worked under the pain of hunger before, it was never a pleasant experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black berries!\" Felix said, smiling as he came to a patch Nahash had literally slithered through.  Thankfully he didn't destroy every bush and Felix was able to eat a large amount to sate his hunger as well and pocket more before charging on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusk came to the woods about the same time Felix arrived at the stream Nahash has been at hours before.  Parched from the day's run, Felix drank from the river as well and saw on the other side, Nahash's continuing trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't follow him .  . .\" Felix breathed out, laying down.  He had spent so much energy, Felix knew he couldn't continue on without resting.  Looking around, Felix decides to climb to sleep near the fallen tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'll continue pursuing him in the morning,\"</i> Felix thought, feeling the cold of night come upon him.  He started a small fire with his tools and dozed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, far away Nahash was asleep in a clearing, having found a deer to satisfy his hunger.  He looked back, down his trail and cried once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Felix, I hope you're safe without me,\"</i> Nahash thought as he curled up and cried himself to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Nahash was too depressed and felt the lowest he had ever felt. <i>\"I may be far away from that monster and his wicked men, but I still feel the same way I did when I was all alone there,\"</i> Nahash thought to himself, <i>\"I was feeling good before, but I don't feel that good anymore. I shouldn't feel this way. I should be happy that I'm far away from my captures and that I'm free, but I don't feel happy. I feel sad.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash pondered about his situation carefully and wondered why he felt so terrible. <i>\"Felix!\"</i> Nahash realized, <i>\"I was happy when I was around Felix. He was my friend. He was there for me when I felt terrible in that cell. He took care of me, talked to me when I was lonely, and helped me escape. Now that I'm away from him, I feel sad and alone like I was still in the cell. Just being near my friend make my happy and keeps me from feeling sad. He was the best friend I've ever had and he's helped me so much. he's important to me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nahash realized that seeing Felix would make him happy again, he remembered what happened the other morning, what he had almost done to Felix. <i>\"I can't see him ever again,\"</i> Nahash told himself as he shook his head, <i>\"I'm too dangerous for him to be around me. Although seeing him will make me happy, causing him harm will make me feel even worse. If I did something to Felix, if I ate Felix, I would never be able to live with myself. I need him now, but I like him too much and I have to stay away to keep him safe from me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash hated the dilemma he was in. He could see Felix and cure his sadness, but that could endanger Felix if he gave into his hunger, or Nahash could stay away from Felix and keep Felix safe, but by doing so, Nahash would be left alone to suffer the terrible sadness and loneliness of not being able to see his best friend. Nahash decided that he could not see his friend anymore. He had to keep Felix safe, especially from himself. Weakened a little by his sadness, Nahash decided to lie on his coils a little longer. Nahash gave a deep sigh of sadness as he staying lying on his coils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a large net fell on Nahash. Nahash panicked and tried to get up, but the net tightened and didn't budge. Nahash looked around, barely able to move his head, and saw that large spikes were attached to the ends of the net. These spikes had penetrated the ground and penetrated them deep. The rope and the spikes were too strong for Nahash, especially in his depressed state. Nahash heard a cold and cruel laugh. Nahash looked in that direction. A laughing man came out into the clearing with nine other men. The men looked like monster hunters of some sort. \"Looks like we caught ourselves a big one, boys,\" the man who looked like the leader stated upon seeing the giant naga he had captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that thing? It looks like a naga, but its upper half is completely human. I thought nagas are supposed to have snake skin and snake heads,\" one man questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A naga?\" another man spoke up, \"Haven't there been rumors of a giant naga escaping from Lord William's castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There have been rumors, but is this monstrosity really a naga?\" the leader asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone told me the naga that came from Lord William's castle is a Felaryan naga. Whatever that means,\" one man stated, \"That must mean the naga that escaped is different from any ordinary naga and this is a different type of naga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though rumors said that the monster that escaped Lord William's castle is a very dangerous beast. This creature looks like a child and he seems to be scared and shivering,\" the leader pointed out, \"Could this really be the dangerous creature of the rumors? Besides, he's supposed to be traveling with a slave child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the naga ate the slave and only brought him along for a snack,\" one man suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is the real naga that escaped from Lord William, Lord William would pay greatly for his return,\" the leader said, already imagining the gold coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we don't have the means of moving him,\" a man argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll bring Lord William's soldiers to it and they can bring it to Lord William,\" the leader suggested. The leader turned to two men and ordered, \"Jeff, Harold, run to Lord William's castle and tell him what we captured. Bring the army back here. The rest of us will stay with the naga and keep it alive for Lord William.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men that were ordered to leave started running in the direction of Lord William's castle. However, they didn't get far, because they soon collapsed on the ground with an arrow in their back. The eight men were startled and looked around for the source. Four of the eight men had crossbows at the ready. An arrow came from the tree tops and connected with one of the bowmen's head. The thee remaining men with crossbows shot their arrows in the direction of wince the arrow came from. However, no corpse fell from the tree tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the bowmen became scared and started backing away without the knowledge of the other group. The man backed out of the clear hoping to escape. A mysterious man in with a green hooded cloak silently jumped down from the trees landing behind the scared man. In one fluid motion, the mysterious man covered the scared man's mouth and slit his throat with a knife. The scared man shook and convulsed as his vital fluids left his neck. Then the scared man was dead, the mysterious man set the dead man down gently as to not alert the others. Nahash stared at the man as he put two arrows in his bow and aimed them and the remaining two men with crossbows. \"Show yourself, you coward!\" the leader demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here,\" the mysterious man called out. When the two bowmen turned around, the mysterious released his arrows into their chest. Three men charged at the archer. The archer quickly pulled out a long, slender, and elegant blade and quickly disposed of the men was grace and ease. Nahash had never seen such a talented swordsman. The leader pulled out his claymore and yelled, \"How dare you...\" Before the leader could even finish his sentence, the mysterious man had charged at him and already had a his blade in the leader's gut. The man pushed the leader off his sword and muttered something. The blood on his blade fell freely off his blade and the blade was once again clean. When the blade was clean, the man sheathed his sword and turned to look at Nahash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash stared at the mysterious man with both fear and curiosity. The man pulled his hood back, revealing a handsome face, more handsome than any human Nahash had witnessed. The man had long brown hair that reached the back of his neck and green eyes. Nahash soon realized why the man had such handsome features when he noticed the man's ears. \"Y-you're an elf,\" Nahash gasped. The man was indeed an elf and not a man at all. (Well, he was a male, but not a man in the sense that he is human.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash became very weary of his empty stomach. It was craving substance and elves were supposed to be tasted even better than human and nekos combined! The elf had just saved Nahash, but Nahash knew that if he couldn't control his stomach, he would eat the elf as soon as he was freed. Even though he didn't want to hurt the elf because he had saved his life, the elf was still swallowable which made the elf was prey and not a person. Nahash could eat the elf without consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf stared at the naga child for a long time before he asked, \"You are the Felaryan naga that has entered our realm, aren't you?\" Nahash nodded as best as the net would allow him. \"Why have you come to our realm, monster?\" the elf interrogated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I didn't mean to come here. I was just suddenly here and William's soldiers soon captured me,\" Nahash explained with tears starting up. He didn't like the fact that the elf was calling him a monster, but after recalling what had almost happened the other morning with Felix, Nahash realized that monster was the best word to describe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the rumors from the elven winds are true,\" the elf muttered. (Some elves relayed messages using a magical wind that only elves and half-elves could hear.) \"They said that Lord William has captured a Felaryan naga and it escaped. So, when I stumbled upon you, I had to save you from ending up back in Lord William's grasp. It's dangerous enough having a Felaryan naga eating everyone it meets just because it's bigger and can do so, but it's worse if a Felaryan naga is being used as Lord William's personal weapon,\" the elf stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the reason you saved me? Just to keep me away from William?\" Nahash questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only reason I'd save a terrible monster like you,\" the elf replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I am a monster too dangerous for this realm,\" Nahash admitted with tears seeping out of his eyes as he admitted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say you're not a monster because... Wait. You admit being a monster?\" the elf questioned with surprise. All the Felaryans just viewed eating people as a natural thing and didn't think it was wrong to eat a person. They believed humans, elves, and nagas that weren't their size too small to be considered people and only could be there for their amusement and to fill their stomachs. Some Felaryans even thought it was their duty to eat such small creatures. So, it was a surprise to the elf to hear a Felaryan believe it was a monster for thinking this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I judge people by their size like all other nagas. If they are swallowable, I'm aloud to eat them without reason other then I'm bigger and hungry at the time,\" Nahash explained, \"This is what I was taught and I have troubles thinking any differently. I had no problems with that thinking until I met a human friend. He wasn't swallowable when I first met him, so he was a person and we could be friends. But yesterday, he became swallowable and now he's prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf remembered hearing that the naga had ran away with a slave boy. \"What did you do to him?\" the elf growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I tried to eat him, but I couldn't. He's my friend, he was once a person. How could a person turn into prey? Why should one turn into prey just because I grow?\" Nahash questioned, \"Part of me doesn't want to harm Felix and knows that my way of thinking is wrong, but the other part of me is used to that thinking and believes its what I should do. Want kind of person doesn't think its wrong to eat their only friend? I am a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf stood and watched at the Felaryan naga child cried under the heavy net. He never dreamed that a Felaryan could actually grow a conscious. Sure, there have been Felaryans befriending humans, but they saw humans as an amusement, not a person. Sure they treated them like friends, but in the back of a Felaryan's mind, the human is only an amusement allowing them the spare it. Even those Felaryans with human friends have no problems eating human strangers. They just thought human sized creatures were too small to be considered people and could only be food or objects of their amusement. However, this one seemed different. It actually seemed to be truly conflicted. <i>\"Maybe it's because this naga has met a human friend as such an early age or that it's in a different realm where the definition of a person is determined by intelligence instead of size. Maybe there is hope for this naga,</i> the elf thought to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to kill me?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to die?\" the elf questioned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but if it keeps my friend and everyone else in this realm safe from me, then I'd rather die than become a monster,\" Nahash sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf thought carefully before saying, \"I'm not going to kill you. In fact, I'm going to free you and we'll find your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You can't!\" Nahash yelled, \"I'm hungry. You're not safe if I'm free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to eat me?\" the elf asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. You saved me, even if it was just to keep me from William. I don't want to eat you, but me hunger...\" Nahash tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact that you're worried about eating me and that you don't want to eat me should be enough to keep me safe around you?\" the elf pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I could lose control of myself,\" Nahash replied, \"You may not stay safe around me. You're still prey, and you're supposed to taste better than humans. I might become too curious of your taste or eat you without thinking because I'm so hungry. You mustn't free me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be alright,\" the elf assured the giant naga child, \"I used to live in Felarya. That is where I was born. I know how to handle myself if you lose control, but I don't think you will lose control. You are very different from the other nagas I used to encounter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're from my world? Can you take me back home? This place would be much safer if I were to go away,\" Nahash told the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to get back, and I would never want to go back to that terrible place,\" the elf answered, \"I was a slave to the giant elves. That's not a life I would go back to. Besides, wouldn't you miss your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss him already, but he's safer away from me. If I have to stay away from him to keep him safe, I will never see him again,\" Nahash informed the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf began to cut the ropes of the net as he said, \"That compassion you have for protecting him is what keeps him safe around you. If you really feel that strongly for your friend, then you will never be able to bring yourself to harm him. He will always be safe with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm still worried that I'll try to eat him again and fail at stopping myself,\" Nahash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't there other dangerous creatures in this forest?\" the elf questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but what does that have to do with anything?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those other dangerous creatures are all around this forest, and your friend could stumble on to him. Do you think they'll show your friend mercy?\" the elf asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're animals, they don't have intelligence, just instincts,\" Nahash answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think he will be safer with someone he knew and someone who could protect him rather than be alone with dangerous creatures surrounding him?\" the elf questioned, \"I think he'd be safer with something that has a chance of not eating him rather than something that will not hesitate in eating him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash had never thought of that way. Though Nahash wanted to keep Felix safe, he had overlooked the fact that other creatures could eat him, and without Nahash to protect him, Felix would be vulnerable. Even though there was a possibility that Nahash could loose control, he had a better possibility of staying in control of his instincts more than an animal. Felix would be safer with Nahash. By the time Nahash decided to go back to Felix, he realized he was free from the ropes. Nahash slowly brought himself up to full height and looked down at the elf. Nahash's empty stomach called out to Nahash as it growled for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Nahash able to keep himself from eating the elf?</span></div></div>",

He saw his hand reaching down for the elf and the elf watched the hand approach him.  The elf watched the approaching hand, his own on the hilt of his blade, ready to strike back.  But when the hand was only a few feet from him, just outside the reach of his blade, the elf saw the hand stop moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No!  I can't eat him!</i>\" Nahash thought, finally controlling his hand.  \"<i>He isn't prey!  He helped me.  I cannot eat him!</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But we need food!  we're hungry!  Make the pain stop!  Eat the delicious elf!</i>\" cried part of his mind as his stomach growled in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Nahash yelled as his hand slowly receded towards his body.  His chest rising and falling from deep breaths.  The elf kept his hand at the ready as he watched Nahash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you will not try to eat me,\" the elf said, his tone gave no accusation towards what might have happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are prey . . .

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix walked down the path of destruction that Nahash had left. Nahash was too busy trying to get as far away from Felix as he could and didn't notice knocking down the weaker trees. Felix looked down at one of the trees. <i>\"In this world, Nahash is a very large and powerful being, and he's only five years old. I can only imagine how much stronger and bigger he'd be if he were older.\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother worry came into his head, <i>\"Will I even be able to catch up with him? He's very fast as well as large and could have traveled a great distance the other day. If he goes the same pace he did the other day, I will never catch up with him. And if he slows down to his normal pace, he'd be able to hide his trail. I saw how he traveled through the forest when I was on his shoulder, for a big guy, he can be very sneaky and quiet if he wants to be. I may not ever find him again.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No,\"</i> Felix thought as he shook his head, <i>\"I mustn't give up. Nahash needs me more than ever and I need him as well. We're friends, I can't just leave him to his fate.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a man walked out from behind a tree and into the path Nahash had made with his tail. The man faced Felix and was in his way. Felix stopped and looked behind him to see another man behind him as well. Felix turned to face the man in front once again who just stood there and watched. It looked like neither of the men were going to start the conversation. So, Felix asked, \"Wh-Who are you? Are you bandits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men laughed and the man in front replied, \"Bandits? Do we look like bandits to you, kid? We're hunters. I think we should be asking you what you're doing in these woods all alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't alone. My friend is missing and I have to find him,\" Felix informed them. Felix knew it was not best to tell the hunters that his friend was a Felaryan naga. For one, if the hunters were caring people, they might take Felix away from Nahash, believing Nahash was dangerous. But if those hunters were evil, they might force Felix to tell them where Nahash was, wanting to claim a lot of money for capturing a Felaryan Naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A boy your age shouldn't be wandering alone in a forest like this, too dangerous,\" the man in front informed Felix, \"Maybe you should come with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't understand. I have to find my friend. He needs me,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duncan, do you see what this boy is wearing?\" the man in the back called to the man in front, \"He's wearing rags like one of those slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" the man in the front, Duncan, agreed, \"He is wearing slave clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't Lord William lose a slave not to long ago as well as a giant Felaryan naga?\" the second mean asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix's face turned pale. The hunters had found out that he was a slave of Lord William. Duncan asked Felix, \"Are you Lord William's escaped slave? You match the description.\" Felix's hand reached for the sword. He knew he wouldn't know how to use it properly, but maybe it would scare the hunters away. The sword was large, but much lighter than it should be. If they saw Felix being able to pick up, what they thought was a heavy sword, it might scare them. \"Hold up, kid. We're not here to hurt you. We're not the kind of people that turn in slaves. There have been slaves who have escaped Lord William's castle before and many have come to these woods. If any of the rumors about what goes on in that castle are true, we can never bring ourselves to bring a slave back there,\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix studied the man's face. Felix had learned how to tell when a person was lying or telling the truth, and this man looked sincere in what he said. Felix took his hand away from the hilt. \"Then if you're not going to turn me in, then please let me pass so I can find my friend,\" Felix pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the word friend, do you mean the giant Felaryan naga?\" Duncan questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... yes,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what Felaryan means, but I know the words giant and naga. You shouldn't be looking for that beast. I think it will be best to come with us and let hunters find and kill the beast,\" Duncan suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't understand. Nahash is not a monster. He is a good person. Felaryan nagas are different from our nagas, because they're from a different world called Felarya. Their upper bodies are completely human and they are intelligent creatures,\" Felix tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me that the giant naga is sentient?\" Duncan questioned in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and he's my friend. But he ran off and I have to find him. He needs me,\" Felix informed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why did this naga run off?\" the second man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He... he...\" Felix tried to come up with something, but he couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's hiding something Duncan. We should bring this boy to the village and find the naga and kill it,\" the second man suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience, Jacob, let the boy explain himself,\" Duncan ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He... he left to protect me from himself. Felaryans view people differently. They believe that if something could be swallowed, it is not a person at all and only prey. Yesterday, he grew large enough that he'd be able to swallow me,\" Felix explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sentient or not, this thing sounds like a monster,\" Jacob added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not a monster. He's very kind and gentle. He's only five years old. He doesn't know any better,\" Felix explained, \"He only knows what his parents taught him and they taught him that things that are swallowable are just prey and nothing more. However, when we were imprisoned, he wasn't as big as he is now. At that time, he viewed me as a person and we became friends. We helped each other escape. When he tried to eat me, he remembered that we were friends. He couldn't bring himself to harm me and had to run off to keep me safe. I need to be there for him. If I can help him understand that humans are people and not prey, then maybe he will never think about eating a person ever again. He can be reasoned with. I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duncan, you can't be thinking of letting that naga live. It's a monster and will be a danger to our village. It...\" Jacob began to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough, brother. If this boy speaks the truth, than it is possible to explain to the naga that humans aren't prey. If we can change this naga's mind about people, think of all the help he can be for our village,\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think we should kill the naga and be over with it,\" Jacob added.</span></div></div>",

He was just in a hurry to leave me and keep me safe.\"  Duncan said nothing in response as they began walking down the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in the woods, five men were on horseback riding through the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see anything?\" the leader asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Captain Marcus,\" one man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's keep moving,\" Capt Marcus commanded, \"Our Lord wants that naga back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have every hunter who could be reached told of it and the reward we'd give for it.  Won't that be enough?\" another asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to tell that to our Lord?\" Captain Marcus asked darkly.  Before the man could respond, the rider riding a head called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found the naga's trail!\" the voice came.  The captain and the others moved out and came onto Nahash's trail and looked at the damage in both directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way Captain?\" one man asked.  Marcus bit his lip.  He was an able warrior, no question.  He could best many men in armed and unarmed combat.  He knew battle strategies to outwit even the smartest forces.  His only weakness, though no one knew this, was he could not read an animal's trail if his life depended on it.  And right now it did, for if he went the wrong way and they missed a chance to finding the naga..... He did not consider the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way!\" Captain Marcus yelled, pointing in a specific direction, not knowing it would lead him and his men to</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One didn't have to be a great tracker to realize which way the giant naga had gone. In the giant five year old Felaryan naga's rush, he had broken and bent branches, flattened the grass and made an impression in the ground from the weight and force of his large tail, and even tipped over a few trees. It doesn't take too much logic to figure out that if the naga bent the branches or knocked over those trees by running into them, then the branches would be bent and the trees and most of the trees would have fallen in the direction the naga was going. The injured and dead trees were practically pointing to the one responsible for their pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Captain Marcus didn't think about that. He might have been considered a genius in war, battle strategy, and fighting, but those were the only categories his intelligence was found. In any other category in his brain, he was either of average intelligence or a complete nincompoop. This was why he was one of the most revered captains in the army. Lord William knew that he could be controlled easily and still serve a great purpose in his army. Lord William had run into subjects too smart for their own good, but he didn't have to worry about that from Captain Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Marcus didn't take much time in making a decision. He didn't want his soldiers to realize he wasn't good at tracking. So, Captain Marcus made a rash decision and pointed in a direction. He ordered him and his men in the wrong direction. His men didn't question his orders. Most had seen how excellent of a strategist and how good of a fighter Captain Marcus was. They assumed he had a well rounded intelligent in all other categories. Besides, it was never a good thing to question a superiors orders, especially in Lord William's army. Little did they now, they weren't heading in the direction of Nahash, but would end up encountering Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you actually were able to befriend a giant naga?\" Duncan questioned as they walked down the easy trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was big, but nowhere as large as he is now,\" Felix explained, \"Since he was sentient and still saw me as a person, it was actually pretty easy to befriend him. Once I got past the fact that he's a giant naga, I realized that he was just a very scared child. He's only five years old and he's been brought to a strange world and had been captured by strange people who chained him in a dark cell. He reminded me of myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was five years old when I was made Lord William's slave. I know what it was like to suddenly be in an unknown place being forced to do things you don't want to do,\" Felix answered, \"Hell, being a slave is all I can even remember. I understood what kind of things Nahash was going through and I guess that's what helped use become friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes sense. Let's just hope his friendship for you is stronger than the rules of his world,\" Duncan replied, \"You really don't remember your past life before Lord William's castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember anything. I was told my parents sold me into slavery, but I'm not sure what to believe,\" Felix told Duncan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan thought about what Felix must have gone through. He had never known what it was like to be cared for or to have a family. All Felix knew was being a slave and living in the darkness of Lord William's world. <i>\"Sarah and I have been unable to make a child. We have tried, but nothing has happened yet. We've tried recommended herbs, medicines, and healers of God, science, and magic, but nothing has worked.\"</i> Duncan thought, <i>\"Maybe, this former slave child could be willing to be adopted by us. Then we could finally have a child.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there were more pressing matters at hand, like finding the giant naga. Duncan placed the thought in the back of his mind and pressed onward. Eventually, Duncan heard the distant sound of galloping hooves coming closer. Duncan stopped and put out his arm to stop Felix as well. Felix didn't hear the sound, but Duncan heard five horses getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Felix asked in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five horses, coming this way,\" Duncan answered. Before Duncan and Felix could hide, five horses appeared in the horizon. Nahash's trail was going straight forward at that moment so a far distance could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're from Lord William's army,\" Felix recognized the armor and symbols on the chest plates. He could also tell one of them had a captain's armor suit on. \"What do we do?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic and act natural. Follow my led and don't say anything unless you have to,\" Duncan ordered. Duncan began to walk again and Felix followed. Duncan knew that the soldiers had probably seen them already and stopping to wait for the soldiers to reach them would probably seem too suspicious to the soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, their paths met. The soldier slowed their horses and Duncan and Felix had to stop since the soldiers were in the way. Captain Marcus stopped in front of Felix and Duncan with two soldiers beside him and the other two on either side of Felix and Duncan. \"Good afternoon, hunter,\" Captain Marcus greeted, \"How long have you been out in this forest today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been out here with my son ever since the sun rose this morning,\" Duncan lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Marcus glanced briefly at Felix and them back at Duncan, \"We are looking for two things that has escaped from Lord William. Surely you've heard that a giant naga that Lord William has been holding captive has escaped with one of his slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have heard of such news,\" Duncan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are looking for the naga in these woods. The slaves isn't as important to Lord William and he was probably eaten by the naga by now. Have you seen the naga?\" Captain Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have not seen the naga with my eyes, but I do believe this is a naga trail we are standing in,\" Duncan replied, knowing he couldn't just say no and not talk about the naga trail they were on at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You best keep moving away from the naga's trail,\" Captain Marcus suggested, \"This is not a giant naga from our world, but from a more savage and vicious world. This naga wouldn't think twice about eating a human and usually enjoy swallowing them whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will be careful,\" Duncan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Marcus took another glance at Duncan and then back at Felix. \"This you're son?\" Captain Marcus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Duncan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't look very much like you,\" Captain Marcus commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He takes most of his looks from his mother,\" Duncan lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His clothing is also in shambles,\" Captain Marcus pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are just poor and simple hunters,\" Duncan argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet you seem to be able to afford enough to get yourself decent huntsmen clothing and leather armor. Can't you give your son more than these rags?\" Captain Marcus questioned, \"His clothes are in just as bad a shape as Lord William's slaves. if I were to base my guess just on looks, I would believe he was the escaped slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assure you he is my son and not an escaped slave,\" Duncan tried convincing the soldier, \"He only wears this clothing for hunting. Once he's proven himself to be a worthy enough hunter to spend money on, I'll get him the hunting armor he needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Marcus eyed Felix carefully and remembered that Lord William branded all his slaves on the bag. Captain thought about asking the boy to lift his shirt so that he could see if there was a brand on his back. If there was, than this was the escaped slave and the hunter might know where the naga was. But, the man could be telling the truth and Captain Marcus would then only have wasted more time in finding the naga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Captain Marcus decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Captain Marcus ordered Felix to lift his shirt. They found the brand on Felix's back. However, Nahash and the elf arrive at that moment and see Felix and Duncan in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Captain Marcus decided their telling the truth and there was no time to waste in finding the naga. Captain Marcus even tossed a few coins for Duncan so that he could buy Felix some clothes. The soldiers then kept going in the wrong direction</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<i>I best be safe than sorry,</i> Captain Marcus thought, knowing full well Lord William had no trouble promoting lower rank soldiers should the officers fail and need to be removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, remove your cloth,\" Captain Marcus ordered firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you order?\" Duncan asked, moving in front of  Felix.  Marcus eyed Duncan before looking back at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crossbows,\" Captain Marcus ordered.  Two soldiers quickly pulled out their cross bows and aimed then at the pair.  \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"  The remaining two placed their hands on the hilts of their swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The men are apart from each other, so I cannot take both of them down at once.  The others would join in right away.  And each is probably a decent fighter.  I wish I hadn't sent Jacob off.  He could have at least gotten Felix out of here,</i>\" Duncan thought as he eyed the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remove your shirt boy,\" Captain Marcus repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't David,\" Duncan ordered, looking back at the Captain.  Captain Marcus looked at Duncan again, their eyes drilling into the other, trying to make the other yield.  Had this been any other place, a bar, on a town street, or even if it was on this path but Marcus was not a soldier, things might have turned out differently.  But once these two strong willed men locked eyes, two dams were built and the resivoir between was filling quick.  And with the weaponry and numbers favoring Captain Marcus, even if he cracked slightly, he would still likely have Duncan shot and Felix knew he would remove his shirt in the end or be killed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He's lied to them and is willing to die for me,</i>\" Felix thought as he saw the others grabbing their weapons.  Things were esscalating without orders.  One slip of the finger would mean an arrow would be let lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your weapons down, I'll remove my shirt,\" Felix called out.  He watched Duncan flinch visibally and turn to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David!\" he said, eyes in shock.  He looked at the small sad eyes in Felix's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't let them kill you,\" Felix whispered as he moved from behind Duncan's protection.  Slowly he lifted his shirt.  The mark stared Captain Marcus in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the naga slave?\" Captain Marcus growled.  He had felt sympathy for this boy and with the truth know, hated himself for that sympathy.  He also feared what would happen if one of his men spoke of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Felix replied, turning back around to face the soldiers he once feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me or the hunter dies,\" Captain Marcus said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill me if you want,\" Duncan said, \"Run Felix!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where he is,\" Felix said, \"He was going to eat me, since he is that large now, but chose to spare my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Captian Marcus asked, \"You expect me to believe that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saved his life.  He spared mine.  We became even,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why are you on his trail?\" Captain Marcus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it was easy moving on it,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was taking him back to my village,\" Duncan said, \"I used the trail so he could move quicker.\"  Captain Marcus looked between the two.  Captain Marcus snapped a finger and an archer fired a shot at Felix's leg.  It grazed the leg, causing Felix collapse in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me the truth,\" Captain Marcus repeated, \"Where is the naga?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'll tell you,\" Duncan said, moving in front of Felix once more.  His eyes moving past the soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" Captian Marcus yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Duncan said as a large shadow came over the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes prior, the unlikely pair pushed through the woods.  As they pushed on, the elf noticed on the path some thing had come onto the trail, something on horses.  He made no word of it, as Nahash had a single focus to getting back to Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the young naga stopped, looking down the path.  Five soldiers were talking with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Nahash asked, not wanting to be seen by anyone and be attacked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those soldiers have Lord Willaim's crest on the back,\" the elf said, \"And they're talking to a boy and a man.  Can't you hear it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" Nahash said, but he pulled back when he heard someone say Felix.  \"Felix!\" whispered Nahash.  The elf shot an arrow past the young naga's face, making him look at the elf.  \"Felix needs me!\" Nahash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then use your mind when it comes to attacking,\" the elf said, \"Don't come right at them from behind.  They could kill Felix.\"  Nahash bit his lip, but his eyes looked around.  Carefully, he climbed into the canopy.  The elf moved closer and stayed hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>One more test given by the spirits,</i> the elf thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash moved quietly closer until he was over the man talking.  He saw Felix fall to the ground and felt an anger rise inside.  Quietly, he lowered his upper body and reached out for two of the men.  He heard nothing as he was focused soley on the hunt.  He saw the men tense up and looked around.  The men with crossbows saw Nahash first and those were the ones Nahash attacked, grabbing the men and threw him into the woods, where they wouldn't rise again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horses bucked in fear of the predator they sensed near them, allowing Duncan to move Felix out of the way.  The ones with no riders ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swing of his powerful tail, Nahash slammed into each of the remaining soldier and their horses.  The horses fell on their riders, baddly hurt, injuring the riders as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the enemies defeated, Nahash looked around for Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix?!\" he called out, looking where the remaining human had taken Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He took out those soldiers with no effort,\" Duncan murmured, as he held Felix on his back.  When the naga called for Felix.  Felix smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He does care about me,\" Felix said, as Duncan went back onto the trail  Nahash's large face looked down on the hunter and his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hurt Felix?!\" Nahash asked, his eyes growing cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, those soldiers did,\" Duncan said, \"It's a minor wound.  He'll survive if given treatment for it.\"  Nahash smiled relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash,\" Felix called up, \"Are you all right?\"  Tears came to Nahash's eyes as he looked at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Felix,\" Nahash said, \"I'm sorry I tried to eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fogive you Nahash,\" Felix called out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Duncan wanted to start questioning the giant naga child right then and there. He wanted to see if this giant naga child could really be reasoned with and trusted. He had never seen a naga like the one before him before. The naga was fully human from the waist up with a snake tail replacing its legs. The human part looked like a child of about five years of age, but much larger. The naga was a giant after all and could swallow a human whole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan just started at the giant naga as it bent its body down and stared directly down at Felix in Duncan's arms. Questions swarmed through the confines of his skull, but none of those questions entered his throat so that he could speak them. Instead, it was the giant naga boy who asked the first question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this man, Felix?\" Nahash asked. Nahash looked over the man with suspicion in his large eyes as he brought his enormous head closer to ground level. Of course Nahash was suspicious. The only kind human Nahash had come across was Felix, and there were men trying to capture him and Felix to bring back to Lord William. Nahash knew that he had to be suspicious to survive. Plus, this man had Felix, his best and closest friend who was like a big brother to the giant naga, in his arms. Though Nahash was the younger of Felix and himself, Nahash was bigger and he felt it was his duty to protect Felix. So when there was a stranger holding his best friend and a lot of people trying to capture him, it was right to be suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Duncan,\" Felix informed Nahash, \"He was helping me find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why was he doing that?\" Nahash questioned, more suspicion growing within Nahash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan began lowering Felix to his feet and Duncan supported Felix as he stood on his good leg. Duncan saw the uneasiness in the naga's expression. The naga didn't like Duncan carrying Felix, as if the naga was very protective of Felix. \"I understand you not trusting me right away. There are many hunters and soldiers searching for you, but I'm not one of them. I am in charge of a small village as well as one of their hunters,\" Duncan began to explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was trying to keep those soldiers from taking me. He made up a story that they almost believed. He's not one of them,\" Felix added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You were trying to keep them from taking Felix, why?\" Nahash asked. This time, Nahash had a look of shock and confusion in his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard the stories about what kinds of things happen to slaves in Lord William's castle. I wouldn't wish that sort of treatment on any creature,\" Duncan explained, \"I couldn't let this boy end up Lord William's slave again. We shelter slaves who escape Lord William's castle. However, very few ever escape and soldiers don't usually even chase after them. You and Felix are the first they've actually chased after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you were going to run away from me forever. What made you change your mind,\" Felix asked, limping a few steps away from Duncan and getting closer to Nahash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash moved one of his large hands and positioned it sideways. Nahash moved his hand next to Felix and Felix held onto the large hand for support. Nahash giant child-like face was nearly level with Felix, yet Felix was no longer afraid of the giant naga. \"Someone helped me see that you are safer with me,\" Nahash informed Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you still afraid of eating me?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but he said that worry is what will keep me from eating you,\" Nahash replied. Nahash's fingers wrapped around Felix and he lifted Felix up as he stood up himself. Nahash pressed Felix against his chest and held him there with both hands in a strange hug only giants could do. \"I don't ever want to be away from you again,\" Nahash cried a little, \"You're my best friend. I want to protect you and keep you safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my friend too, Nahash,\" Felix informed the naga and hugged whatever he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan looked up in amazement. This giant naga and former human slave were actually friends and cared about each other. The naga actually wanted to protect Felix and didn't see him as just a snack to be saved for later. <i>\"This naga is just like Felix had described. It is sentient and can be reasoned with. If it can be befriended by a boy, then it can be reasoned with,\"</i> Duncan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a green cloaked figure stepped into the destructive path Nahash had made the other day. \"Who are you?\" Duncan yelled out, causing Nahash and Felix to look down and see what the matter was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm not an enemy,\" the cloaked man said as he removed his hood, revealing he was an elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An Elf?\" Duncan gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" Nahash called down to Duncan, \"He was the one who talked me into coming back. He also saved me from hunters wanting to turn me in to the soldiers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite my better judgments, I save this Felaryan naga,\" the elf stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Felix questioned who was now sitting in Nahash's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am originally from Felarya. I know what Felaryans are like and know they should not be trusted and killed because they're monsters,\" the elf informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you save this one?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's different from all the Felaryans I've ever met. He seems to understand that eating people is wrong and seems to be struggling against his Felaryan morality. I don't know if it is because he is still young, or because he befriended a human before he was big enough to eat humans, or something more. Whatever the case is, this naga has the potential of becoming a person and no longer a monster. He has the potential of understanding that people are people no matter their size,\" the elf explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An elf hasn't been in these parts for hundreds of years, why are you here?\" Duncan questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for something, and it's not the naga,\" the elf answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking for?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is elf business. I'm not aloud to speak about this mission to anyone except elves and friends of the elven kingdom,\" the elf replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you told us, we could help you find whatever you're looking for,\" Felix offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, little human, but I...\" the elf's words stopped when he looked up at Felix in the naga's hand. \"Wh-Where did you get that sword?\" the elf questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked at the sword and answered, \"Nahash and I found it on a dead body, why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The elf needs to know where the body is. Nahash has to take the elf to the body while Duncan brings Felix to the village to help heal his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The elf demands Felix give him everything he had taken from the body and point the elf in the direction of the body. Nahash, Felix, and Duncan head back to the village.</span></div></div>",

Nahash pulled Felix towards himself instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We needed the tools to survive,\" Felix replied, \"When I was a slave and another slave died, those who were close might have taken his footwear if it was good or maybe a shirt to help survive the cold.\"  The elf took a breath and understood.  Sometimes the place you lived in changed what you felt was right and wrong.  And most elves would have given Felix some aide in surviving, though surely not what he ended up taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then return them to me,\" the elf said, \"As you will probably be accepted into Duncan's village, you will not need those items for much longer.  Return them to me.\"  Felix nodded and pulled himself out of Nahash's grip.  He walked over to the elf and handed him the pack with the rope and lighting stones, the dagger, and most importantly the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, as you're probably wondering, the body is across the river, towards the mountains.  If you follow Nahash's trail, you'll come to a spot where he left me.  From there, head towards the mountains.  It's behind a tree near an entrance to a cave,\" Felix explained.  The elf picked up the gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, young Felix,\" the elf said, \"May fortune smile upon you.\"  \"<i>For your own sake and Nahash's as well.  I pray he finds more friends soon, otherwise I may need to kill him in the end.</i>\"  \"I may see you later,\" the elf said, before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan waited a few minutes until the elf was a distance away before speaking, \"You handled that very diplomatically, Felix,\" Duncan said.  Nahash was smiling as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, should we be going?\" Nahash asked.  Felix looked at Duncan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still mean what you said before?\" Felix asked.  Nahash blinked in confussion.  Duncan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Nahash is safe for you to be around,\" Duncan said, before looking at the giant naga.  \"But are others safe around you, Nahash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix is safe with me,\" Nahash said, still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but what about me?  Or better to say another human the same size as Felix.  Is such a person prey or not?\" Duncan asked.  Nahash went silent for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his mind, part of him was saying yes, they were prey.  But another part asked what the difference between that one and Felix was.  The predator inside him countered that Felix was his friend, the others weren't.  But Felix's words came back to him, silencing the predator.  If they had met that person before his growth, he would not have been prey.  But now he was.  And Felix would have asked \"<i>There's nothing different between us Nahash.  If one of us is prey, then the other must be prey as well!  Am I prey to you Nahash?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix is not prey,\" Nahash answered, \"As Felix is not prey and you are intelligent, not like a deer, then . . .then you should not be prey either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's a start.  If he does believe that, then the village will be safe around him,</i>\" Duncan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, before we met up with you, I offered Felix a chance for you two to stay in my village.  But first I needed to see what you thought of me,\" Duncan said.  Nahash looked confused once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Felix and I won't be leaving here for my home?\" Nahash asked, his face filled with hurt at the thought of never seeing his mother or father again, not even his big brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, how would your family see Felix?  How would they see anything smaller than them?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'd be prey,\" Nahash answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you think that's right?\" Duncan asked, \"You said it yourself:  'Felix is not prey'.  And you also said anyone intelligent is not prey either.  From what little I know of your people, these two views go against everything they believe.  Who do you believe is right?\"  Nahash closed his eyes once more.  Tears came to his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're . . . wrong \" Nahash said as he cried.  Felix moved close to his friend and Nahash picked up the small Felix, holding him close as he cried over this revelation.   \"You're all I have Felix,\" Nahash mumbled. Duncan shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He really is young.  I hope he can forgive me one day for doing this,</i>\" Duncan thought, \"<i>He'll also be much more protective of Felix.  Will that be a blessing or a curse?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here for you Nahash,\" Felix said, pressing himself against the strong chest.  Duncan waited quietly until Nahash had finished crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, as I was saying, I am offering you a new home to live in,\" Duncan said, \"A home for you and Felix where you can live together.\"  Nahash's eyes widened a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I sleep with Felix near me?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Felix doesn't mind,\" Duncan said, figuring if he said otherwise there would be trouble.  Nahash smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to go to it?\" Duncan asked, \"It's this way.\"  Nahash looked at Duncan for a moment.  His tone, his demeanor, his kindness, these traits reminded Nahash much of his own father.  Nahash bit his lip as he realized he might never see his family again, but he knew they were wrong.  Anyone who said it was right to eat Felix was wrong.  Felix was his family now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Only Felix, but maybe . . . .</i>\" Nahash thought in some yearning for a father figure as he looked at Duncan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duncan,\" Nahash said softly, causing the hunter to stop and turn around.  \"Would you like me to carry you?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Duncan quickly thought about the situation. His consciousness was a little hesitant and cautious of letting the giant naga child carry him. Not only was Nahash a giant naga, but he was also still only five years old, a very young child. Who would normally trust their lives, literally, in the hand of someone so young. The possible dangers were endless. However, Felix trusted his life in Nahash's hands and didn't seem to be worried about what could happen. Felix looked as though he felt safe in the five year old boy's hand. Plus, Nahash seemed to handle Felix with great care. It was clear that Nahash paid close attention to his actions so that Felix wouldn't get harmed. Duncan already learned that Felix was very important to the giant naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If Nahash feels just a pinch of what he feels for Felix, and if he truly sees me as a person, then I should be safe. He will be just as careful with me as he is with Felix,\"</i> Duncan thought to himself, <i>\"I will be safe with Nahash. Plus, there are some other advantages to letting him carry me. For one, we'd get to the village much faster due to his size. Also, if I show him that I trust him, he might see me as a friend, and it might even evolve into a father son-like relationship if I'm the one that has to take care of him. Nahash already seems to see Felix as a brother. Finally, if I come to the village with him carrying me, the village will see that he's friendly, or at least he'd seem more friendly to the village.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those final quick thoughts, Duncan made his final decision. \"Yes, Nahash, you may carry me, as long as you are careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be very careful,\" Nahash promised. Nahash bent his human half over and lowered a hand with the palm facing up. Duncan walked onto the giant hand and sat down on the soft skin. Duncan didn't have nearly as much room as Felix had on Nahash's other hand since Nahash was still young. However, there was still enough room to sit down. Plus, Duncan was about six inches tall relative to Nahash. Nahash slowly and gently lifted the hand with Duncan in it to chest level, glad that the human trusted him. \"Would you two like to be on my shoulders?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix and Duncan agreed and Nahash lifted each one to a shoulder. Felix and Duncan climbed onto the opposite shoulders and Nahash stood perfectly still as they did this. Duncan was surprised that the five year old would have enough control to stay still. Despite being a giant naga, the boy seemed to be well behaved. <i>\"This actually might be able to work. We might be able to keep Nahash and Felix in the village and everyone will be safe. He also might actually be behaved enough for two humans to be his parents,\"</i> Duncan thought since he had been worried about being able to take care of a giant naga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way is your village?\" Nahash asked while carefully turning his head towards Duncan. Duncan gave Nahash directions and they were heading for the village Duncan lived in and ran. Duncan was impressed by how fast and silent the giant Nahash was. Despite his size, he truly was quiet and didn't leave a huge trail to follow. Duncan was very impressed. Nahash was clearly built to be a great predator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Duncan remembered something and looked down from over Nahash's shoulder as he sat upon it. Sure enough, what he had thought he had seen was there. Noticing that they were getting close to the village, Duncan spoke up, \"Nahash, could you stop for a moment, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash stopped as soon as Duncan asked him to like a very obedient child. \"What's wrong?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you don't have any clothing to cover up your... private,\" Duncan informed Nahash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash looked down and saw that Duncan was right. \"I've barely noticed. My cloth ripped off when I had my first growth spurt. Is this a problem?\" Nahash questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think a five year old she be going around naked. Especially if he's going to be presented to an entire village,\" Duncan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my mother did say that she would make a cloth for me until I was old enough. She said when I'm an adult it's alright, because my parents are naked all the time. She said it helps capture prey, whatever that means,\" Nahash added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in our village, we were clothing in public. Since you'll pretty much be in the public a lot. We're going to have to get you something to cover that up,\" Duncan informed Nahash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Felix asked, \"There's no clothing that would fit a giant like Nahash, especially since he's a naga as well as a giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All we need to do is make a loincloth. My wife, Sarah, makes clothes for the village. She should have enough cloth to make one and I should have enough rope to wrap it around you,\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're close to the village right now. I can go there and get Sarah while you and Nahash wait here for us,\" Duncan said. Felix and Nahash agreed, and Nahash lifted his hand to his shoulder where Duncan was. Duncan got on and Nahash lowered Duncan to the ground so that he could get off and head for the village. \"I will be back shortly,\" Duncan told the two boys before running off to the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash slithered over to a tree and leaned against it. Nahash then picked Felix up from his shoulder and leveled with two hands chest level as Felix sat on the palms. The two boys waited for Duncan and his wife's arrival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan made it to the village where Jacob was waiting near the edge of town. \"You took a long time, where is it?\" Jacob questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safe with the boy not far from the village,\" Duncan informed his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it like the boy described? Is it safe?\" Jacob continued to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Nahash can be reasoned with and he is safe to be around,\" Duncan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you positive this... Nahash... is really safe?\" Jacob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Nahash is safe. He truly cares about Felix like a brother and sees him as a person. Nahash reasoned that if Felix is a person, then all humans are people. We can befriend him,\" Duncan tried to assure his brother, \"Now, did you tell the village anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not tell them about your plans or about what we found,\" Jacob told Duncan, \"However, people found it odd that I came back alone without food, since we usually come back with a good amount. They questioned me, but I just told them that they will know more when you arrive.\" Duncan was relieved that Jacob kept his mouth shut. He was a great brother and even when they might not see eye to eye with certain things. Jacob knew when it was best to keep things secret. Otherwise, there would have been a large panic. \"What's the plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first, I need Sarah's help to make Nahash a little more presentable. When that is finished, we will call a town meeting and then bring them to the edge of the village where I will explain everything and introduce them to Nahash and Felix. I just hope I can explain everything in a way to keep them from panicking,\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you do whatever you and Sarah have to do, get me and I'll go to the town hall and ring the bell. Once everyone is there, I'll bring them here and you can do what you need to. But whose going to take care for Nahash and Felix? Whose going to want to take care of a giant naga?\" Jacob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah and I will take care of them,\" Duncan informed his brother, \"I just hope the village accepts Nahash and Sarah is fine with it. Do you still have doubts about Nahash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Jacob replied, \"But I have not met him yet and I respect your decision. You usually have a good judge of character.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, when you see Nahash, most of that doubt will disappear. He is just a child and very gentle,\" Duncan informed Jacob, \"Now, I will get Sarah and speak to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan ran off to his house, which was on the edge of the village, the same edge they were on now. Normally a leader of a town or village would live in the center of town. So, it seemed odd that Duncan would be on the edge of his village. Now, they did have a town hall in the center of town, but Duncan preferred to live on the edge since he was also one of the village's best hunters. Now this seemed to help if he was truly going to care for a giant naga. if he would have lived in the center of town, the giant naga wouldn't have been able to live with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan entered his home where his wife was waiting. \"Where have you been and what's going on?\" Sarah questioned as soon as his foot entered the house. Sarah was a beautiful women with long red curly hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that Jacob had come to town before you and that something was going on, but no one knew what, because Jacob didn't say what it is,\" Sarah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rumors spread like wildfire in this village, but what do you expect when there is only about forty families in the village,\" Duncan commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on, Duncan?\" Sarah questioned her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob and I came across another runaway slave from Lord William's castle. The boy was only ten years old,\" Duncan started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only ten years old?\" Sarah interrupted, \"The poor child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He escaped with a friend, but his friend is a giant naga,\" Duncan continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A giant naga!\" Sarah gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the naga is sentient and has a human upper body. The naga's about 75 feet tall, but its only a five year old boy,\" Duncan said. Duncan saw the fear in Sarah's eyes and face upon hearing how large the naga was. \"There's no need to worry about the naga,\" Duncan explained, \"The naga is gentle and sees humans as people. Felix, the slave boy, has befriended the naga and they act like brothers. The naga is safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you planning to do?\" Sarah questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want the Felix and Nahash, the naga, to live here,\" Duncan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want a giant naga to live in our village!? Sarah screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash isn't evil. He would kill anyone. Plus he's only five years old, he can be raised to be good. Trust me, Sarah, everytings going to be okay,\" Duncan tried to assure Sarah, \"Also think of what Nahash could do for the village once he's older and bigger? He can protect the village from almost anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is this Nahash now?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the forest not far from the village,\" Duncan answered, \"Before he can come to the village, I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of help?\" Sarah wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to make a loincloth for him. He doesn't have clothes and his... well... you know is showing,\" Duncan informed his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much cloth do we need?\" Sarah asked, blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a 75 foot tall naga. He needs quite a bit,\" Duncan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Duncan and Sarah felt they had enough rope and cloth for Nahash, they began bringing it to where he was. How would Sarah's reaction to seeing Nahash be?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Duncan had departed, Nahash laid down on the ground.  Despite his size and strength, it had been a long day for the young boy.  Felix sat on Nahash's hand in front of the boy's face.  The pair was silent for a time until worry began to fill the young naga's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, will you stay with me even if this village won't accept me?\" Nahash asked, looking pleadingly at his only friend in the world.  Felix turned to Nahash's large eyes.  The question held a lot of weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Would I stay with him if Duncan's village won't accept you?</i>\" Felix thought, \"<i>He must really be worried about being alone.  Of course he is.  He has realized a truth that goes against his parent's way of life.  He chose me over that life, over his own blood.  I owe him too much to leave if they won't accept him.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, let's not doubt things before they happen,\" Felix said, \"After all, you see Duncan as a person and you saved him and me from those soldiers.  Those are good reasons for them to accept us.\"  He felt the plural would show Nahash they were in this together, win or lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't kill them to save Duncan,\" Nahash replied, \"I did it to save you.\"  Felix smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you still saved him in the end,\" Felix said, \"That is something they will take into consideration.\"  Nahash nodded.  He turned his head quickly at the sound of approaching people.  He rose upward and brought Felix to his chest.  Duncan and Sarah appeared on the trail and Nahash relaxed a little.  He notied them slow down a little as they approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>My God, he's huge!  And he's only going to get bigger?!</i>\" Sarah thought, freezing for a moment when Nahash came into sight.  Duncan was pushing a cart with the clothes for the young boy and noticed his wife's fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, I promise you, he will not hurt us,\" Duncan affirmed.  Slowly she nodded and began walking slowly towards a creature her every instinct was telling her to flee from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Duncan,\" Felix called from Nahash's hand.  Duncan waved back at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on down so we can dress Nahash,\" Duncan said.  Felix looked at his brother and Nahash slowly put Felix on the ground.  Nahash looked carefully at the human woman with Duncan.  Despite his time in Lord William's castle, he had never seen a human woman before.  So he took in her features and noticed the differences between her and Duncan were like the ones different between his own parents.  But the thought of his parents, once again realizing he would never see them again, though it was their own beliefs of Felix not being a person that made it so, did not make the pain any easier to bear.  Tears started to form in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need me to do?\" Felix asked as he limped off the hand, unaware of Nahash's pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need Nahash to tie this around his waste to cover his . . . you know,\" Duncan said, looking up at the tear filled eyes.  Sarah and Felix looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, what's wrong?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking about my family,\" Nahash whispered, before sniffing and rubbing away the tears from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is he crying though?  Are they dead?\" Sarah asked quietly.  Felix shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they view humans as prey, so they aren't a person,\" Felix answered, \"Nahash doesn't think that way and knows he can't anymore.  So he can never return home again.\"  Sarah didn't realize her mouth was open from shock for a few moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Nahash, when you're ready, would you take these ends of rope and tie them around your waist, covering you . . .\" Duncan coughed and blushed a little, \"Area.\"  Nahash nodded and took the rope in his hands.  It was no thicker than one inch thread to the naga and he reached behind him.  His face contorted with discontent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tie it,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a lift on your tail and I'll do it for you,\" Duncan said, moving towards Nahash.  The boy nodded and grabbed both ends in one hand and with his free hand brought it forward for Duncan to stand on.  Duncan got on and was taken to Nahash's tail.  Nahash leaned forward, so Duncan would have an easier time standing and his gaze went back to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Nahash said, looking down at the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I am Sarah, Duncan's wife,\" Sarah replied, happy this naga's friend was near her for protection.  But as she looked into the large eyes, she saw his youth and innocence.  If he would always be like this, maybe he would do well at the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Duncan tied the ropes, so the cloth made of a few sheets covered his naga-hood, Nahash took in Sarah's features interesting features more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Her hair is like mother's.  And her face looks like mother's as well,</i>\" the boy thought.  She could be a double for his mother, minus the ruby colored tail.  He bit his lip at this realization.  But this did not go unnoticed by those in front of Nahash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, is something wrong?\" Felix asked.</span></div></div>",

However, it's hard to speak quietly to one person when one's a giant naga who\u2019s bending down close to two humans. As Nahash shifted his eyes back to Sarah, it was clear that she had heard his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked away from the giant head near her. <i>\"He thinks I look like his mother?\"</i> Sarah gasped in her mind. It was a very surprising statement to make to a person one didn't know. Especially if it was a giant naga saying it to a human it had just met! Sarah began to wonder if Nahash really meant what he said and she looked like his mother, or if Nahash's mind was playing tricks on him and made Sarah look like his mother because he missed his mother a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Sarah looked away, Nahash believed he had offended her in some way. \"I'm sorry,\" Nahash apologized, \"I didn't mean to upset you.\" Nahash was still young and didn't understand the full impact and complications of his statement, but he was a very bright young naga and understood a good amount. He knew how his comment could have been misinterpreted and makes it sound like he wanted Sarah to be his mother. He knew it must be odd for a giant naga to ask a human he had just met to be his parent. If she still believed he was a monster, it could have offended her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just miss my mother so much, and you look like her a lot,\" Nahash tried to explain, \"If you were a naga I would have thought you were her twin or something.\" Nahash continued to explain, but it seemed like he was digging himself in a deeper hole, \"I wasn't asking you to be my new mom. You don't have to if you don't want to. I am a giant naga after all. But if you do want to be my mom, you can. I just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah cut Nahash off and said, \"It's alright, I understand what you meant.\" Nahash sighed and remained quiet. <i>\"He does want me to be his mother, though,\"</i> Sarah realized, <i>\"But how can I raise a giant naga. How could something so large ever listen to me? So far as I can tell though, this giant naga seems to act a lot like a normal child. He also seems to be well behaved and considerate of others. Maybe it is possible to raise a giant naga. Maybe this really can work out. He seems gentle enough.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm finished, Nahash,\" Duncan broke the silence. Nahash reached his hand back and Duncan hoped on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Duncan was set on the ground, Nahash stood to his full height and looked down. After being naked ever since his first growth spurt in Lord William's castle, it felt odd to have a loincloth again. It felt strange, yet comfortable. Nahash looked down at Duncan and Sarah and smiled. \"Thank you Sarah and Duncan. It fits nicely,\" Nahash informed the two humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you continue to grow, we're going to eventually have to add more rope and possibly more sheets,\" Duncan replied. Duncan turned to Felix and said, \"Unfortunately we don't have the time at the moment to make you knew clothes, but we should take a look at that wound before we reach the town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded in agreement and was told to sit down. Duncan and Sarah had brought some things to deal with cuts from there home. Duncan brought over what he needed to disinfect and cover up Felix's wound. Nahash lowered himself down on his stomach to get a closer look. Sarah noticed the pure concern in Nahash's eyes. \"How much do you really care about Felix?\" Sarah questioned the giant naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is like a brother to me. I would do anything for Felix. I will protect him from anything,\" Nahash answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was surprised that a giant naga would care that much about a human. Due to Nahash's personality as well as her inability to have a child of her own, Sarah was becoming more certain that she could raise Nahash and Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to sting,\" Duncan warned Felix as well as Nahash so that Nahash wouldn't do anything drastic when seeing Felix in pain. Duncan poured some disinfectant on Felix's wound and Felix hiss a little in pain. It took all of Nahash's effort to resist doing something about it. Duncan then wrapped up the wound with a clean cloth before putting Felix pants leg back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happens now?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time for the hard part,\" Duncan replied, \"We're going to go to the edge of the forest, but you and Nahash will have to stay in the forest a bit longer. Sarah and I will get my brother and he will gather everyone close to the edge. I will explain everything that happened and try to calm them before showing them you and Felix. When it's time we will introduce the two of you to the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think the village will accept me?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's uncertain, but I hope so,\" Duncan answered truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if Nahash is accepted, what will happen to us?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be raised and cared for by new parents,\" Duncan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan looked to his wife. It was clear that she wanted to raise the two boys, even the giant naga. Sarah had seen to good in Nahash and she knew she could never have a child of her own. Sarah nodded, almost begging Duncan to agree with her in taking care of Nahash and Felix. \"If all goes well, we will be your new parents,\" Duncan told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd really be my new parents, even if I'm a naga?\" Nahash questioned in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Sarah answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash was overjoyed by that answer as he asked, \"Can I pick the both of you up? I want to hug you both.\" Duncan and Sarah agreed to the request and Nahash carefully picked Duncan and Sarah up in each hand. He then brought them to his chest after standing up again. Nahash gave them a firm, but gentle hug. When he was finished, he placed Duncan and Sarah back down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should start,\" Duncan said, \"We're not that far, and we can walk there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I still carry you, Felix?\" Nahash requested. Felix agreed and Nahash picked up the human he saw as his brother. They began heading for the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do things go?</span></div></div>",

Father,\" Nahash said, looking down at the small man.  Duncan stopped for a moment as shock came over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'll need to get used to that,</i>\" Duncan thought.  Sarah gave a nod, knowing just what he was thinking.  Long had they wanted to hear someone call them those words.  And now someone was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan and Sarah moved to the edge of the village where Jacob was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything all right?\" Jacob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, our adopted children seem well behaved,\" Sarah affirmed.  Jacob blinked but said nothing in response to that, just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'll go ring the bell,\" Jacob said, before departing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan and Sarah waited, glancing between the inner of the town as they heard the bell's ringing and the forest, where Nahash was hiding.  Soon Jacob was seen walking towards them with many people behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some won't like this even if Nahash is gentle,\" Sarah muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'll just have to convince enough so there won't be too much trouble,\" Duncan said as he got on a cart.  He waited for everyone to arrive and quiet down before beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, in the woods today while hunting, I found two escaped slaves from Lord William's castle,\" Duncan began.  His eyes scanned over the group.  No one liked the man they sent tithes to for so called \"protection\".  \"They are both young boys, not brothers in blood, but brothers in experience.  So, Sarah and I have chosen to adopt them as our own.\"  He paused and heard murmurs amongst some of the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" called out Ben, one of the more cynical villagers, \"Why the big call and making us walk here?  There's something wrong with them, isn't there?\"  There were voices in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of them is a boy of ten years named Felix,\" Duncan answered, \"He is as human as you or me.  His brother, however, is not.  That's why I called this meeting here.  So you can all meet him.  He is a kind, gentle spirit who has no one else he can look towards.  He will not harm us, despite what you may first think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but what is the thing?\" Ben cried in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's now or never,</i>\" Duncan thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, would you come out here please?\" Duncan called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the woods, Felix was sitting on Nahash's hand and patted his large chest when they heard Duncan's request.  He nodded in affirmation and Nahash took a breath before slithering out into the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many gasps and cries of shock upon seeing the giant naga.  Ben stared in silence.  He had heard of nagas before, but never had he thought he'd meet one.  Nahash visibly flinched from the shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A naga?!  You want to adopt a naga that can devour one of us with as much ease as we breath?!\" Ben cried out over the shocked people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash is no threat to us,\" Duncan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horseshit!\" Ben answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear I won't!\" Nahash said, silencing everyone for a moment.  \"Felix is my brother, not prey.  He is human like you.  So you must not be prey either.  I won't eat something that isn't prey.\"  Many blinked in confusion at the young boy's logic.  Ben stared with scrutinizing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash is just a young boy far from home,\" Sarah called out, getting up on the cart next to her husband, \"I care for him because of his kindness and innocence.  I will not let you harm him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but will you protect him from his own hunger, wench?\" Ben shot back.  Nahash's eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you call my mother names!\" he screamed, shocking everyone again.  <i>'My Mother'</i>.  The words echoed across the group and between the ears of many present.   The adults realized he said those words instantly, without thought put into them.  His emotion behind them was rage for Ben insulting Sarah, like any child would defend his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Nahash,\" Sarah said softly, blushing from the amount of emotion Nahash just spoke with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you see, Nahash cares for us like his own family.  He will not harm this village,\" Duncan said, bringing attention onto himself once more.  \"What say you?  Do you believe me?\"  There was silence.  It seemed to drag on further than the length of Nahash's tail. Finally, one person screamed \"Aye!\"  And many more followed, until well more than half agreed to allowing Nahash to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young naga, however, only looked confused by their response, but as he saw his new mother and father smiled, he smiled as well, realizing this was a good response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.  As you would guess, given his size, he will not sleep in the town.  But the woods will be a place for him to sleep and hide when merchants come to town,\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Lord William?\" Ben called out, \"I doubt he will like losing such a slave.  There could be bad consequences to allowing him to stay.\"</span></div></div>",

I know other nagas won't accept me because I don't see humans as prey, and I was worried humans wouldn't accept me because I'm a naga. If this village is able to accept me as a part of it, and this becomes my home, I will do everything I can to protect it and everyone in it, because I'm grateful that I won't have to live on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will you protect this village from Lord William's men?\" Ben questioned with skepticism, \"You may be a giant naga, but you're still just a child. How can you protect this village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've killed some of his soldiers to save Felix and my dad,\" Nahash informed Ben, proud of his accomplishments and saving Felix and Duncan. Nahash also came from a world where it was kill or be killed, a world where one had to fight to survive. Defeating adult humans, no matter how small they were compared to him, seemed to be one of Nahash's greatest accomplishments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've killed humans!?\" Ben yelled, jumping at the opportunity to show the village that Nahash was a monster, \"You've heard it from this beast's own mouth! It killed humans, and it seems proud of that fact. This naga is a child and it has already killed humans without being affected by the fact it had killed someone. If it can kill that easily as a child, it could become a devastating and blood-thirsty monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I...\" Nahash tried to argue, but he didn't know what he could say to counter the mean human's argument. Instead, Nahash blurted out, \"But those men were evil, and I didn't know them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think it is okay to kill someone just because you don't know them?\" Ben yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough, Ben!\" Duncan ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Ben didn't listen and continued, \"They may have worked for an evil man, but did that make them evil. They were just following orders. They could have had families and friends that will never see them again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I,\" Nahash began to tear up, finally realizing the gravity of what he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you ate those men to,\" Ben accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't,\" Nahash cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't stop to think or regret killing a person on a battlefield,\" Duncan argued from a top the cart, \"There are things that have to be done for the good of others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not a battlefield, this is a village. If he thinks it's alright to kill people he doesn't know, what's stopping him from killing again if someone makes him mad or doesn't give him what he wants. He's a giant; he'll have the power to do whatever he wants and...\" Ben continued to try and rally others in the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" yelled out a voice. Everyone turned their attention to the small boy in Nahash's hand. The voice had come from Felix as he stood on Nahash's hand while it was level with the giant naga's chest. The large head of the naga above him was crying from Ben's words. \"Nahash did it to save Duncan and I,\" Felix explained, \"Those men were going to kill us, but Nahash stopped them because of his love for his brother within him. Despite what you think, Nahash is a kind and caring kid who would do anything for the ones he loves. If you are kind to him, he would never harm you. He knows humans are people and he will treat everyone as equals despite his size and power. I'm sure Duncan and Sarah will raise Nahash to be good and he will listen to them because he sees them as his parents since he can no longer be with his own. This village and everyone in it are safe with Nahash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole village went silent and Felix turned back around to look up at Nahash's giant face. Nahash sniffed and wiped away a few tears with his other hand. \"Thank you, Felix,\" Nahash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what brothers are for, right?\" Felix replied. Nahash smiled and hugged Felix against his chest which helped Nahash's cause by showing how gentle the giant naga really was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now unless there is any more objections, This will be Nahash's new home and Sarah and I will be the Nahash and Felix's new parents. They will both be citizens and will have equal rights. Is that understood?\" Duncan informed the crowd. No one spoke up. If there was still any shred of doubt in people, none of them spoke up. \"This meeting is dismissed,\" Duncan finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd began to disperse and Sarah approached Nahash. She placed her hand on the underside of the vertical base of Nahash's tail. Nahash looked down while still hugging Felix. \"Are you alright, Nahash?\" Sarah asked in a caring and sincere voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That man's word hurt me,\" Nahash sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise that I will do my best to make sure that man never hurts you again,\" Sarah told her giant son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash began to cheer up. He bent down and picked up Sarah with a different hand and pressed her against his cheek as he rubbed it against her. Sarah was relieved and happy at how affectionate Nahash was. She kissed his cheek as he showed her his affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash!\" Duncan called up. Nahash looked down and saw another man standing beside his new father. \"Nahash, this is my brother, Jacob. Whether he likes it or not, his is yours and Felix's uncle now,\" Duncan introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Nahash replied sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you please put Felix and your mom down, Nahash? I'm sure Felix is eager to have some real clothes that Sarah can provide,\" Duncan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have some clothes at home that should fit you. I own a clothing shop after all,\" Sarah informed Felix. Felix thanked his new mother and Nahash obeyed his human father and set the rest of his family down gently. Sarah led Felix to their home and Nahash followed behind. He wanted to take a look at the house as well, even if he could only look through windows. He also wanted to stay close to his \"big\" brother Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this happened, Duncan and Jacob spoke.</span></div></div>",

Jacob nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need more time to trust him.  I doubt with all the able men in this village, we could take him down.  Until I know he cares for those in this village like family, I won't fully drop my guard,\" Jacob answered.  Duncan nodded.  Their father, now passed, had taught them to see this village as a family.  They cared for everyone and made sure there was enough food to go around, especially in the harsh winters that they had here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.  Just keep an eye on Ben as well.  I don't want him causing trouble when there is none,\" Duncan answered.  Jacob nodded as they started moving to Duncan's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want to go back out to hunt for the storage unit?\" Jacob asked, \"There was deer sign before we ran into Nahash's trail.

Felix touched the clothes he was wearing in a reverent manner.  His old idea of \"new\" clothes was either clothes another slave out grew or a guard had damaged beyond repair and tossed them to him by chance.  To wear something no one had used before, something that was so warm and fitting, it was almost as wonderful as his new family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're wonderful mother,\" Felix answered softly as tears came to his eyes.  Sarah was quick to hug Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, what's wrong?!\" Nahash asked, seeing his brother cry through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Felix replied, \"I just can't stop crying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix,\" Sarah said softly, \"You're probably just happy, that's all.  After such a hard life, it is over.  And you are safe.\"  Felix nodded and hugged his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan and Jacob saw Nahash looking into the building when they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, how do you like the home?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix is crying,\" Nahash replied.  Duncan and Jacob froze for a moment before Sarah and Felix came outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just overjoyed, that's all,\" Sarah answered Duncan's unsaid question.  Duncan nodded, before looking at his younger son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, I would like to ask you a question,\" Duncan said.  Nahash turned from Felix, looking down at his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you hunt, do you eat everything of your prey?\" Duncan asked.  Nahash nodded.  \"I thought so,\" Duncan commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that wrong?\" Nahash asked, wondering if eating everything was as bad as eating a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, well, not for where you grew up probably,\" Duncan answered quickly.  He took a breath.  \"You see those new shoes Felix is wearing?  Those came from the skin of an animal we hunted.  We use more than just the meat to survive, we use their skin and sometimes the bones in cooking.\"  Nahash nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you don't want me to eat the whole animal?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pelts are either used to make clothes or trade for other goods,\" Duncan said, \"And we don't always eat all the meat.  We store some for later if food is scarce.\"  Nahash nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should I do father?\" Nahash asked, before feeling a familiar grumble in his large stomach.  He blinked, realizing with all the commotion today, from being attacked by hunters, to meeting the elf, to finding Felix and his new family, he hadn't eaten once.  The adult humans stared in silence when they heard the loud rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Duncan said before coughing a little, \"I was going to say you could hunt with either your uncle Jacob or me and we would skin the animal, saving the pelt and you get the meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could do that,\" Nahash said, as he felt the hunger in his stomach again.  \"Can Felix come with us?\"  Duncan looked at the pleading eyes of his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, Felix's leg was injured and needs to heal,\" Sarah said, drawing her large son's attention, \"It would be best if he just rested for the rest of the day.\"  Nahash nodded.  He didn't want Felix hurt anymore and he trusted his new mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" Nahash said, looking back at his uncle and father.  \"May we go now?\"  Duncan smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was my hope,\" Duncan said, inwardly laughing.  He had never though his first father-son hunt would be with something like Nahash, but he was happy none the less.  Jacob smiled a little and nodded as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The elf followed Felix's directions and eventually came upon the body. The skeleton was sitting down, leaning against the base of the tree. The elf stopped upon seeing the skeleton and at first, all he could do was stand and stare in disbelief. There was a long moment of silence where not even the forest made a sound. \"This can't be happening,\" the elf whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf slowly took a step, and then another. He repeated this at a slow and hesitant pace, but he eventually made it to the body and knelt in front of it. The elf step the pack down as well as the weapons that Felix had taken from the dead body. The body had no belt or sheath. \"The sword Felix found definitely came from this body,\" the elf said aloud, \"And this is an elf's body.\" To the human eye, the skeletal frame of a human and an elf's looked similar, but to an elf, a difference could be seen. This elf knew that this was the remains of an elf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf turned and saw a cave entrance. \"If that's the cave system Felix and the naga used to escape Lord William's castle, it could eventually lead to the dungeons if one takes the right paths,\" the elf realized. He turned back to the dead elf and said, \"You're the one who was sent to spy on Lord William. If that's true, you're the one I've been searching for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf bowed his head and collected himself. He placed his hand on the body's chest and felt something under the coat. The elf opened it up and found a book underneath. No, not a book, it was a journal. The elf took the journal and opened it up. He glanced at the later entries and noticed that the elf that was once alive had written down all of Lord William's suspicious actions. The elf speed though the last entry which was cut off at the end. The sentence wasn't even finished. There was also no indication in the entry that he was in danger of being discovered. \"What killed you?\" the elf asked the dead body, \"Judging by this entry, you died recently. You've even talked about him capturing a Felaryan naga. How can you be this far in decay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the skeleton couldn't open its mouth and tell the elf what he wanted to know, but the skeleton didn't have to. \"Tell, me what happened to you,\" the elf said before placing his hand on the skull. The Felaryan elf had a gifted power that very few had. He was about to see the past of an object or a living thing by taping into his magic and touching the object of being. Well, it didn't work all the time, but he had to try. This situation depended on it. The elf tapped into his magic and focused on the date of the last entry, hoping he would see how the elf was killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, night covered the sky and stars dotted the heavens. The elf saw a fire and saw an elf sitting by the fire writing in his journal. He knew this was the elf that was now dead, and elf named Melldor. The Felaryan elf walked over to Melldor and sat beside him. He stared at Melldor, hoping he would be seen, but The Felaryan knew that the magic didn't work that way. He touched Melldor's shoulder, but his hand phased through. The Felaryan elf sighed and listened to Melldor as he spoke a loud. \"Lord William is becoming more dangerous. He's captured a Felaryan naga. I haven't seen the naga, it came in this afternoon, but I heard that it is a child. Still, Felaryan nagas could be considered the most dangerous creature around, even when it is a child. I don't know how Lord William plans to train that man eater, but whatever he wants with it, it can't be a good thing,\" Melldor said as he wrote the words quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the elves tend to stay within themselves and stay out of human affairs, but I'm sure that the elders will agree that Lord William is a dangerous individual and is gaining too much power. He's an evil and ruthless man. This could be trouble for the future of elves and humans. The elders have ordered assassinations of humans who they believed could become a danger of the balance of the world. Hell, they've done it to any sentient being who could gain the power to shape the world to their evil purposes. I'm afraid Lord William would someday become such a power and needs to be stopped before he can,\" Melldor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelldor continued, \"If that's bad enough, I fear that something worse is happening. I believe that Lord William is practicing black magic. I have very little proof, but there is something very wrong about this place. I can feel the presence of dark magic and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Melldor dropped his writing utensil and grabbed his heart. Melldor wheezed and screamed in pain. The Felaryan elf didn't understand what was happening. He tried to grab Melldor and help him, but again, his hands pasted through. he wanted to help, but he had no way of doing so. This was the past he was seeing and there was no way of changing it. Melldor stood up, but backed into a tree and slid down the trunk. His body began to deteriorate and his muscle and fat shrunk away leaving skin and bones. Melldor let out a final breath before a black mist escaped from him and left only bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Felaryan elf knew this was dark magic a foot. It was a spell that drained beings of their life and magic to sustain someone else\u2019s body, but Lord William wasn't even around. \"He could have just taken the life and magic of anyone at random. The spell must have sensed Melldor and used him,\" the elf concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he was back in the present. The Felaryan elf spent a lot of time digging a hole and burying Melldor with his bow and arrows. The Felaryan elf kept the sword and sheath and examined his sword and the sword of Melldor's. He read the words on both swords. The elven language on these swords doesn\u2019t translate well in English, but the closest translation was this. On Melldor's sword it said \"Blood Brothers\" and on the Felaryan's sword, it finished, \"always stand together\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelldor was the Felaryan's brother. They had been through a lot together in Felarya and had somehow survived it. They had survived its giant predators and their lives as slaves to the giant race of elves in Felarya. They had made it to a world that was safer, but now he was alone and Melldor was dead. The Felaryan elf's name was Belgnir, and he vowed that he would find a way to avenge his brother's death.</span></div></div>",

Felix stared for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it looks good to me, but I really have never considered fashion much in my life,\" Felix answered.  Sarah put down the cloths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, I know you were a slave before this, but I would like to know what sort of life you lived, if you don't mind talking about it,\" Sarah said softly.  Felix said nothing for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind,\" Felix said, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath.  \"I was a slave since I was five years old.  I don't remember any of my life before then, but I do remember waking up in the castle, being told I was a slave.\" He paused for a moment.  He was alone when he changed into the new clothes, so she didn't see it.  Slowly he pulled up his shirt.  A long thin mark was across his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a scar from then?\" Sarah asked.  Felix nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the first one I remember receiving.  I spilled some food I was ordered to carry.  Even the kitchen staff were hard on us slaves,\" Felix said, \"I was alone for many years, having to survive on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you and Nahash meet?\" Sarah asked, moving close to her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was brought in and I was ordered to feed him.  But I didn't try talking with him until my third day with this task,\" Felix answered, \"I was too scared to try and approach him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What changed your mind?\" Sarah asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He kind of trapped me in with him,\" Felix answered, looking at the shock on Sarah's face.  \"He had just started his growth spurts.  When I met him he was only like fifteen feet tall.  Then he started to grow when I was feeding him and his tail blocked the door.  I had to approach him to get him to move and I realized he wasn't a monster, just a scared boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you two became friends?\" Sarah asked.  Felix nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  So for the next week, I would spend a few more minutes talking with him, comforting him and he came to see me as his big brother,\" Felix replied, \"Then I caught a break, overhearing Lord William and his alchemist talking about Nahash' chains that grew with him.  They were weakening and could weaken even more if I added an old batch of the potion to it.\"  Felix took a breath and recanted the tale of following the alchemist and the subsequent escape into the mountains and finding their way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like you two were very lucky and ran into little trouble,\" Sarah said.  Felix shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it wasn't,\" Felix replied, \"The night after we escaped, I slept on Nahash.  We had no idea he would grow to the height you saw him today.  When I woke, I was a few feet from his mouth, feeling it was a good thing to eat me, to keep me safe.\"  Sarah gasped in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  How could he?\" Sarah spoke quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of what his birth family taught him.  I was able to break the view and he realized what he almost did.  He dropped me on the ground and ran off.  I froze for a moment before chasing after him, but he was going too fast.  Come nightfall, I hadn't reached him.  I fell asleep and this morning I ran into father,\" Felix finished.  Sarah said nothing.  She wrapped her arms around Felix and hugged him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix felt the hug come on.  And he had been hugged by Nahash.  But this hug was different from any time he was hugged by Nahash.  Sarah's warmth was easing to him, his inner worries and fears seemed to go away.  This motherly hug was the most wonderful thing he had ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the woods, Nahash was following his father and uncle.  He felt excited.  He was never allowed to hunt with his family.  He was too small and weak in Felarya.  But here, he was stronger and could protect his family while they hunted and helped them hunt as well.  And now his abilities helped find the deer they were hunting earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was both in awe and unnerved at how quiet his \"nephew\" could move behind him.  Something that large shouldn't have that ability, but yet Nahash did.  He stopped when he saw Duncan stop and looked around.  A young fawn was standing in the woods a distance away.  Next to it was a large powerful buck.  Jacob could count more then 10 points on its horns.  He watched his brother draw an arrow and string it up.  He loosed it and struck the buck in the neck.  It fell soon and the fawn ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash watched his father kill the buck, and as the breeze was moving towards them from the deer, the buck's blood now filled the air.  He looked where the fawn went to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I hunt the young one?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jacob said sternly, \"We do not hunt the young.\"  He and Duncan moved to the deer carcass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, would this deer help sate your hunger until later?\" Duncan asked, looking up at his son.  Nahash nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need remove its skin first?\" Nahash asked, his eyes hopeful they would say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Duncan said, \"It won't take us long.\"  Nahash held in his dislike and watched them work quickly.  A few minutes passed and Nahash felt good with the deer in his gut.  In his arms was the skin of the buck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I could do with another deer, though,\" Nahash replied.  Jacob said nothing.  The same buck could have fed a family of four for one whole day.  To Nahash, it was a snack.  And he was only going to get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see what we find,\" Duncan replied, \"If you eat too much, the forest will suffer and we will have hard times for the village.\"  Nahash nodded.  He couldn't eat just for himself, but had to be weary of others now as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Nahash said.  The men nodded and moved further into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1:  They come across a large creature Duncan would have never tried to kill if he was just with Jacob, will they try now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2:  They meet up with the Elf, Belgnir, once more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Duncan walked ahead, Jacob walked farther away from the back where Nahash was till he was beside his brother. \"Brother, you saw how much Nahash ate, right? That was a very large deer that could feed a family for many meals. Yet, he ate it as if it were a snack,\" Jacob whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan didn't bother to turn his head and glace at Jacob's head which was very close to his ear. \"Nahash didn't have breakfast. He just needs a bit more food. In the future, one deer may be able to sustain him a meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize how much deer he'll need even if that's true. I know that deer a numerous in this forest, but adding a large predator like a giant naga could easily and drastically change the situation. Besides, he's only five years old. What will happen when he grows bigger? Soon, he may need two or tree deer a meal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand this situation seems very grim, but I can't bring myself to turn Nahash and Felix away. I know that it would be two if we were to throw Nahash out, because they wouldn't stand to be separated from each other. But throwing two children out and away from possible safety and making them leave to another forest to fend for themselves, doesn't seem right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it doesn't sound right. Believe me when I say I wouldn't want to do that either. Despite being a giant naga, Nahash seems to be a nice and gentle kid,\" Jacob informed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan was surprised by the fact that Jacob found it bad to throw out Nahash and that he had said that Nahash seemed to be a nice kid. Duncan couldn't believe these words came from his skeptical brother who had found it hard to trust strangers and from the same man that had began judging Nahash as a monster before even meeting him. Nahash's meeting with the town must have affected Jacob's view of the giant naga more than Duncan had realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was equally surprised by his own comment. He knew that there was good in Nahash and he knew that he was starting to like the giant naga. He also knew it would still take time to fully trust him, but he was really starting to like Nahash quicker than he would normally trust a potentially very dangerous stranger. Maybe there truly was a chance that he would eventually mean the word \"nephew\" when talking about Nahash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do about his hunger?\" Jacob asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we'll be able to find larger prey. There are much larger animals in this forest that could be enough to supply Nahash with a healthy food source. There are creatures out there we are unable to bring down, even with most of the townspeople helping,\" Duncan suggested, \"With Nahash's size, he could take down most creatures he'd come across in the forest, and when he gets bigger, he'd be able to handle absolutely anything lurking in the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's large enough now that he could take down a giant boar. Plus one of the largest boars could last him more than a single meal,\" Jacob stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash didn't like the fact that his new family was whispering, and the fact that Uncle Jacob walked farther ahead for speak with father meant that they were most likely talking about him. <i>\"They're talking about me, I know it.\"</i> Nahash told himself, \"But what are they talking about? Are they still unsure about me and still think I'm a monster? No, my new family wouldn't do that. They're human and I'm a naga, but they should know that if they love me, I'll love them. I won't harm my new family and never will. Maybe, they're upset that I eat too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash's fear and concern for what his new family thought of him drove him to slither closer to quite maybe hear the conversation between his new dad and uncle. Nahash just wanted to be accepted by people again, even if the only people he had a chance of befriending were humans that were very small compared to him. Nahash didn't hear all of the words, but he could understand that it was an argument about how much he was eating. His naga body demanded a lot of food and the humans were worried he could tamper with the food supply of the forest. Tears formed in Nahash's eyes, because it was something he didn't think he could change about himself. \"I'm sorry that I eat too much, but I can't help it,\" Nahash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan and Jacob stopped and turned around to see Nahash had yet again approached them silently. Despite his size, he could really sneak up behind people efficiently. Duncan saw how sad Nahash and he knew that he'd have to be the one to comfort his new son. \"Could you bend down closer, Nahash?\" Duncan asked of his son. Nahash did as he was told. He backed up a bit and laid down flat with his arms crossed and his chin rested upon those arms. Duncan climbed up the arms and Nahash stayed as still as he could while he cried silently. Duncan placed his small hand, well, small to Nahash, on Nahash's cheek and rubbed it. Nahash could feel the hand and was comforted by such a simple touch. There was a lot of caring intentions in that small hand. \"We don't blame you for being big. That is not your fault. I will do what I can to figure out a food source for you so that you can stay with us, because I don't want you to go. You and Felix are the first children that I've been blessed to take care of, and I don't want to fail as a father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash thanked Duncan and began to cheer up. Still standing on the crossed arms of his giant son, Duncan asked, \"Now, are you able to eat fruits and not just meat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I haven't had any in a very long time, and many of the fruits I see here look different from the ones in my world,\" Nahash answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to look for larger creatures, but knowing that you can eat fruits will help in the future,\" Duncan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will we hunt for now?\" Nahash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan carefully climbed down to the ground before answering, \"Giant boar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I liked that meat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've killed one before?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. When Felix had set up camp after we escaped Lord William's castle and the caves, a giant boar attacked Felix, but I saved him and killed it before it could even harm him,\" Nahash answered with a sense of pride in his voice due to his accomplishments in protecting Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, killing one will be much easier now. I know where we might find one.\" Duncan led the way to a place he knew.</span></div></div>",

He grinned at the thought of helping his entire family through the woods as they sat on his shoulders.  He shook his head and focused on the hunt a head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob and Duncan lead Nahash towards the river, upstream from where Nahash crossed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The water is shallower and slower up here and the boars use it to bathe in and drink from,\" Duncan explained, \"They also eat the shallow grasses.\"  He didn't mention that it was also a natural crossing place for anything trying to cross the river, assuming the boars let the people across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you need to be very careful.  They have a powerful sense of smell and if we come from the wrong direction, they will either scatter or attack,\" Jacob added.  \"We lost a few foolish men who made that mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think such a small animal could hurt me Uncle Jacob,\" Nahash answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but if there are others with you, you should remember them as well,\" Jacob replied.  Nahash bit his lip and agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are there parts of these boars you want as well?\" Nahash asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the skin can be used to make leather and the bones make good weapons when ore is low,\" Duncan answered.  He stopped suddenly.  The area was almost completely quiet.  He expected Nahash to be the cause, but then he heard loud grunts and squealling coming towards them.  Nahash heard these noises as well and was unsure what to make of it.  He saw his father and uncle looked confused before moving ahead very carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind was blowing gently towards the hunting party.  Scents from what lay ahead came to Nahash's nose.  His eyes widened and his arms shot out quickly picking up both his uncle and father at the same moment as two large male tuskers came out of the bushes, fleeing past Nahash as quickly as they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hunters were shocked when they felt the large hands encompass them and lifted them from the hard earth.  Their heads spun quickly but did hear the crashing of the boars as they came through the bushes.  Both knew if it wasn't for Nahash's quick action, they would be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they sat in Nahash's hands recovering from the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would make boars flee like that and not even notice Nahash?\" Jacob asked his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something we should avoid,\" Duncan replied, \"Maybe it's come out of the mountains for hunting.\"  Jacob nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What came down?\" Nahash asked.  Duncan looked at his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A powerful beast that thankfully has never attacked our village,\" Duncan responded, \"It's called a hydra and it ...\" But he realized Nahash was no longer looking at him, rather he was looking up and away.  Duncan turned to see three serpent heads looking around and soon another pair was added to them.  They stood tall and moved slowly.  Before Duncan could tell Nahash to flee, the heads spotted the group.  The hydra paused for only a second before charging at them.  Nahash, fearful for his family turned and fled quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, how do we lose this thing?\" Jacob asked as the hydra gave pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Duncan answered, looking up at Nahash's worried face.  He watched as Nahash glanced over his shoulder to see the hydra.  But what none saw was a branch from a tree was in Nahash' way, causing the boy to slam into the branch and the humans flew from his hands, landing on some bushing that cushioned their impact.  But the delay was enough the hydra to catch up with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hydra saw the large beast on the ground and moved quickly to stomp on it.  Nahash cried out as the large, flat feet stamped into his chest.  He tried striking it, but the skin was too tough and the punches were ineffective.  Duncan and Jacob rolled off the bushes and looked at the scene before them.  The hydra was covering all of Nahash's torso and part of his tail as it stood over the boy.  The two hunters glanced at each other before grabbing their bows and got ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hydra started snapping its minor heads at Nahash when arrows flew at its face.  It paused to see the Jacob and Duncan firing arrows at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the distraction at hand, Nahash swung his tail around the hydra, coiling around it only twice, but it would be enough.  He started squeezing the hydra, making the hydra remember the other thing attacking it.  It once more started biting into Nahash's flesh, as other heads bit the tail.  But Nahash would not let go.  The hydra screamed in pain as arrows landed in some of its eyes.  Nahash glanced at his family helping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, bash the middle head!\" Duncan yelled to his son, \"You kill that and it will die!\"  Nahash nodded and looked to the one head not attacking him.  He pushed his hand through the defending head and grabbed the middle neck while squeezing tighter with his tail.  He felt something give in the chest cavity and grinned as the beast roared in pain once more, focusing its heads on the tail.  Nahash took this moment to pull the main head closer and slammed his skull into the hydra's, causing it to cry in pain as the minor heads froze in their actions.  With the hydra stunned, Nahash looked to see a large rock and grabbed it, slamming that into the hydra's skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crack like a clap of thunder ripped forth and the hydra collapsed.  Blood spilled from the rock wound as Nahash uncoiled himself from the hydra and moved away.  He clutched his chest as he moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right Nahash?\" Duncan asked, moving to his son.  Nahash shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My . . chest . .  hurts, father,\" Nahash said, wincing with every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lay down slowly,\" Duncan ordered.  Nahash nodded and laid on his back.  Duncan moved onto Nahash's body and looked were his bloodied hands lay.  As he approached, he saw his son wince more with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Jacob asked, staying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it hurt his ribs, but I don't know if they're broken or not,\" Duncan answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you make the pain stop father?\" Nahash asked.  Duncan shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sorry son,\" Duncan answered, glancing at the dead hydra.  Not even with the entire village would he have tried killing that monster.  But Nahash had been able to kill it so quickly.  He knew Nahash would be a good force protecting the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I run back to the village and get the herbalist?\" Jacob asked.  Duncan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and bring her back here quickly,\" Duncan agreed, \"But don't say what Nahash has done to everyone.  I think this should be a prize he brings in himself.\"  He knew Ben might argue to try and kill Nahash in his weakened state or maybe sell him back to Lord William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back as soon as I can,\" Jacob said, running off to the town.  Duncan looked at his son's face as he held back tears of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did really well this hunt Nahash,\" Duncan commended, \"You did what no one else in our village could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you . ..  father,\" Nahash said, smiling and wincing at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Belgnir was in the process of leaving the forest to find an open field of meadow. He had to give the Elders the message. He had tell them what Lord William has been planning, that Lord William has be toying with dark magic, and he had to tell them of his brother's death. However, Belgnir didn't trust putting all of it in a letter. There were no elves or \"friends\" of the elves in the area. Belgnir couldn't trust them with such a letter to bring to the Elders. He also didn't want to spend more time traveling the Elven Domain and then travel all the way back here. Belgnir had already decided that he needed to send his message through the wind. It was a magical gift the elves possessed. They could use magical winds to send out a message only elves could hear, but that ability worked best in open planes otherwise the message might not come out clear. This was why he was heading out of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a terrifying shriek pierced his sensitive like a needle digging at it from the inside. Belgnir stopped and winced at the sound that tormented hi. Luckily for him, the creature seemed to be a good distance away, but not far enough if it harmed his ears to that extent. When the sound seized, Belgnir turned in the direction of wince it came. Belgnir knew that sound. It was a hydra. Back in Felarya, he had heard creatures called negative hydras. These creatures were extremely rare and lived in deep and forgotten negative planes. Those creatures sent in avatars to different points of the universe to get its food, because it never leaves the negative plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the hydras of this world were much different from negative hydras. The hydras of this world weren't avatars, but a different species of hydra. They were large creatures, but not as big of creatures as the Felaryan top predators. So for Belgnir, killing a hydra by himself wasn't an outlandishly impossible thing, since he had killed adult nagas and such. The only hard part about hydras of this world was that one had to kill the main head to truly kill it and the shriek the hydras emitted could do serious damage to elves and other creatures with heightened hearing. Belgnir had even heard stories of elves' heads exploding from shrieks of a hydra. For other beings with normal hearing, the shriek had the potential of putting them into shock if they didn't have a strong enough will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelgnir contemplated on what to do. A hydra living in this forest was a dangerous. If he had to stay in the forest until the Elders replied back, a hydra would make this difficult and would have to be dealt with as soon as possible. Belgnir had enough strength still to deal with the hydra now, and he deemed it best to take care of it at that moment while he knew where it was. Belgnir hurried in the direction of the shriek but his footfalls were light and silent as an elf's steps should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Belgnir closed the distance between himself and where he had heard the shriek, he began hearing something else. It sounded like something was making a lot of noise, almost like two very large beasts were fighting. <i>\"It sounds like the hydra is fighting something large. But what could be large enough in this forest to fight a hydra...? Of course, the Felaryan naga, Nahash was his name. He must be fighting the hydra, unless there is another large beast that could take on a hydra.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelgnir quickened his pace more. <i>\"If Nahash is fighting a hydra, he might need help. The Felaryan naga might be large and one of the largest species of naga, but it's still a child and could have troubles fighting a hydra.\"</i> Belgnir growled. <i>\"I can't believe I'm helping a Felaryan top Predator, and a naga of all creatures, but this naga really seems to want to change. It's hard to believe, but this naga might actually become a force of good. Such a power could come in handy, and it might actually be best for the naga to stay alive, for now. I know that the Elders might want this naga to be watched to make sure it doesn't become a danger, and make sure this naga truly sees humans as people when it's being raised by them.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Belgnir began crossing the river at a shallow point and before he reached the battle raging in the distance, the battle seemed to stop. Only silence could be heard in the distance. <i>\"Did the naga fail?\"</i> Belgnir couldn't believe his own thoughts; he was actually slightly worried for the well being of a Felaryan naga. Then again, this naga was only five years old and saw humans as people, for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelgnir drew both the blades. His own blade was in his left hand and his brother's was in his right. Belgnir was ready to fight a hydra to the death and would gladly do it with the two swords acting as one. Belgnir came upon the place where the battle of two giants had been fought. There he discovered a dead hydra lying on the ground. The hydra's main head was cracked open and leaking blood. A large bloody boulder about the size of the hydra's head was settled beside it. Belgnir's eyes soon spotted the second giant and it was indeed Nahash the Felaryan naga. Nahash was lying down on his back with Duncan positioned on top of the naga's shoulder. There were bit marks along Nahash's tail as well as some marks on his human half. There were fewer wounds on Nahash's human half, but they seemed more serious since that skin wasn't as tough as the tail. However, no vital parts seemed to be bitten. The naga looked like it could still pull through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelgnir looked back at the hydra. The hydra was an adult male and one of the large ones. The beast was much bigger than Nahash's human half but wasn't as long as Nahash if Nahash's tail were to be included in the length. The hydra of that size should have overpowered the naga, but Nahash still seemed to have managed and defeated it. <i>\"This is unbelievable. If Nahash can kill a hydra as his age, he's sure to be a very powerful force as an adult. I can only hope that's a good thing.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did really well this hunt Nahash,\" Duncan commended, \"You did what no one else in our village could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...Father,\" Nahash said, smiling and wincing at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelgnir was very surprised to hear the naga call the human hunter \"father\". It had to have been a great surprise for the Felaryan elf that showed little emotion to widen his eyes slightly and paused for even just a moment. However, he did speak up, \"Actually it's quite a feat for him to kill a hydra. Even if he is a Felaryan, something of his age with a slight height disadvantage against a hydra should have not survived against a hydra. That was quite a feat indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan, still kneeling on the horizontal plane Nahash's shoulder made while he was lying on his back, looked in the direction of the voice and found that it came from the elf from before. Nahash turned his head as well. \"You?\" Duncan said mostly out of confusion for the sudden appearance, \"Did you find what you were looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have. Then I heard the shriek of this hydra and the battle. I came to investigate,\" Belgnir answered. Belgnir notice Nahash wincing every time he breathed. \"Is he hurt?\" he asked Duncan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I'm sure whether some of his ribs are broken or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I look at the area?\" Belgnir this time addressed his question to Nahash, \"I may not have healing powers, but I will still be able to tell whether they're broken or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Nahash<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it a particular side that hurts more of both sides?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My right.\" Nahash didn't want to say too much. More talking meant he'd have to breath sooner and breathing in hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelgnir approached Nahash's right side. \"Could you pick my up with your palm and position me close to where it hurts the most? I may still have to touch the spot, but I don't want to stand on it if it's really broken,\" Belgnir requested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash answered by turning his right hand palm up. Belgnir stepped onto the blood covered hand and Nahash lifted him to the spot. Belgnir examined the spot and would discover that... </span></div></div>",

This close to the chest, he could see the impressions the hydra's feet made.  \"But none are broken.\"  Nahash smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" Nahash said, wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Duncan said, looking at the stoic face of the elf.  \"I imagine it will take a week or so for his chest to heal.\"  He glanced at the large dead hydra.  \"At least he'll have enough food to sustain him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be quicker, if he doesn't move too much and just rests,\" Belgnir noted, \"Nagas have strong healing rates.\"  Duncan nodded, absorbing this information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the body you were looking for was near the cave Nahash and Felix departed from, does your business in this land involve Lord William?\" Dunan asked, glancing at the elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot confirm or deny that question,\" Belgnir answered quickly.  Duncan nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only ask because when Nahash is discovered living in our village, Lord William will come for him.  My village lives in fear of that man and would be glad of his removal.\"  Belgnir remained still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fear is understandable,\" Belgnir replied curtly.  Duncan realized straight answers would get him no where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know much of farming when the land is sick?\"  Belgnir glanced curiously at the human hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know some things of cleansing,\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be wise to remember a rotten tree would not have just one root that needs to be burned.  There are deep roots in this land which would still brink sickness to others, if not removed,\" Duncan continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a fact I am aware of,\" Belgnir answered.  \"I must be off.  I ask you not to have Nahash try and track me.  You will find it ... troublesome.\"  Before another word was said, Belgnir leaped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNahash had tried to follow the conversation, but had trouble focusing because of the pain in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, what was that last part about?\" the boy breathed out in a pained voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just good farming tips, son,\" Duncan answered.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob raced through the woods.  He smiled as he reached the village once more.  He quietly moved across the outside, not wanting to be found.  Eventually he came to a large garden owned by the town herbalist.  It was a father and daughter duo:  Andrew and Bethany.  They had moved to the village some years ago and were quickly accepted into the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I hope they know how to mend bones on such a large being,</i>\" Jacob thought as he moved to the small cottage that doubled as an office and home for them.  He felt his face flush a little as he moved to the door.  He always did when getting close to Bethany.  Though she was a few years older than him, he still cared for her deeply and just wished he had the courage to tell her directly.  He reached the door and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed and the door opened.  An wrinkled face with a long gray beard and long gray hair looked out.  \"Ah Jacob, what may I do for you?\" Andrew asked, moving aside, to let the hunter in.  The old man was accustomed to treating hunters who hurt them selves while in the woods.  Jacob walked into the room and heard the door shut behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your knee hurt again?\" came a soft voice from another room.  Bethany walked out.  Her black hair fell flat and strait, so she had it tied into a braid, reaching her waist.  Her soft pale skin and blue eyes contrasted her hair perfectly.  She wore a dress Sarah made that complimented her body perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my nephew is hurt,\" Jacob answered.  Both herbalists stopped in their motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The small one or large one?\" Andrew asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash,\" Jacob answered, before explaining the ordeal with the hydra.  Neither healer said anything until Jacob was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, first sit down,\" Andrew ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But .. . \" Jacob replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts,\" Bethany said, taking Jacob by the arm.  \"By your own story, you were flung from a fast moving ride from a lot higher than a horse's back.  We need to make sure you are unharmed.\"  Jacob learned long ago not to argue with Bethany about her craft.  So he sat down and felt Bethany start rubbing his head and asking if it hurt or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quick exam and both ruled he was well, feeling he was damn lucky the bush broke the fall, otherwise he would probably be dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as for your nephew, if the bones are broken, there might not be much we can do,\" Andrew stated.  \"We do have some powerful pain killers used for knocking out horses, so that might help him move, but that's only if it was just a bruising and nothing more.\"  Jacob nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to go with you when you take the medicine,\" Bethany added, \"I will be able to tell if it was a break or not.\"  She moved away to get her bag, considering the conversation over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, for this and not fearing him,\" Jacob said rising up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father let us in with little issue fifteen years ago, my boy,\" Andrew replied, \"You and your brother inherited his kindness there.  So we trust you when you say Nahash is not dangerous.  Well, to the people of this town anyway.\"  Jacob smiled as Bethany returned and led Jacob to the stables.  She got onto her horse and pulled Jacob on behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way?\" she asked, taking her horse out into the open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the crossing of the stream,\" Jacob replied.  Bethany nodded, knowing the water grass there made a good plant to use on upset stomachs.  She pressed her horse's side and it started to gallop into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelgnir thought, as he moved, on the hunter's words.  Considering the stance he took, protecting the slave and naga from his Lord's soldiers and the talk of \"trees\", it was clear he would welcome a new Lord.  He would need to add this into the message and make the Elders.  Maybe they could use the help of the humans of the village for the assault on the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And how close Nahash has come to his new family will also be needed to know,</i>\" he thought, shaking his head in disbelief.  If he had not heard the words himself, he would have called someone mad for thinking a naga could see a human as a parent.  But he did and he hoped it would not change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*******</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan watched as Nahash's massive chest rose and fell with his breaths.  Nahash had learned by now slow breaths helped ease the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, how large will you become?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know father,\" Nahash answered, \"Maybe only thirty more feet or possibly a hundred, if I end up like my father's father.  He was really really big.\"  Nahash paused as memories of his old life came back and tears filled his eyes.  He pushed back the pain, remembering why they would never accept his brother and would kill his new parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nahash, I'm sorry for bringing up your old family,\" Duncan said.  \"I was just thinking of what you would look like as an adult.\"  Nahash nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right father,\" Nahash replied, as the sound of horse feet came towards them.  Duncan stood up, preparing his bow in case it was an unfriendly encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob and Bethany appeared in view, waving at Duncan.  Nahash glanced and was happy to see his uncle back.  The horse did not move closer than ten feet to Nahash, so the pair dismounted and moved closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a visit from the Elf from before,\" Duncan commented, \"He said Nahash's ribs were not broken, only sprained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you trust this Elf?\" Bethany asked as Nahash opened his hand for them to stand on.  He gently lifted them to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do in this matter,\" Duncan replied.  Bethany said nothing in response, instead moved to where the bruising was starting to show.  After a minute, she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he was accurate,\" Bethany said, \"No breaks.\"  She pulled from her bag, large balls of herbs.  She turned to Nahash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.  I'm Bethany.  These balls should stop the pain in your chest for a short time,\" she explained, \"Open your mouth please.\"  Nahash nodded and opened his large mouth.  Bethany moved in and tossed the two balls in.  Nahash swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will they take?\" Duncan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few minutes, if they're effective,\" Bethany answered.</span></div></div>",

With their great feathered wings on their backs, they are truly awe-inspiring. They often have long hair and passionate, fiery eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSphinxes can be surprisingly emotional, and are known to quickly switch from from mood to another. In spite of this, they are intelligent and think very logically, albeit rather rigidly. They tend to see themselves as superior to everyone else, and can be quite self-righteous at times. They are often used as symbols for justice because Sphinxes seem to hold that particular value strongly. They often act as a self-appointed judge, jury, and executioner, in matters that they see fit to preside over. Sphinxes are prone to defend causes with great passion, which can sometimes lead them to being fanatical about it. They are very prideful, and a sure fire way to commit suicide would be to insult one of them or their ideals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSphinxes of Felarya come in a range of sizes from 8 feet (head to ground) to 100 feet or more. They often have golden fur, hair, and eyes, and walk with a self confident swagger. They are skilled warriors and many make a living guarding places, people, and things that they feel is worthy of their protection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of their size, larger specimens are not as voracious as one would expect. Most sphinxes like hunting alone and will, if possible, get their prey from a group rather than cornering a single victim, as they feel it is more of a fair contest if the prey is allowed to counter their physical weakness with larger numbers. They also strongly despise sneak attacks and will always openly announce themselves before engaging an enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSphinxes store food they eat first in their human stomach, but once it becomes full, the contents are transferred to a second stomach, much larger, situated in their feline part. Sphinxes are dangerous on both the ground and in air, and some of them master a powerful healing and protective magic. They tend to live near mountain ranges and open fields, where they can make good use of their great, majestic wings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He watched as it stood taller and taller, until it looked like it was about fifty feet tall by his guess. The sphinx turned around so it faced Felix, and he could see its full body as it turned. He saw the powerful lion part, with big paws lacking any claws and a long fur-tipped tail that swished back and forth lazily. He followed the lion part from that tail to where the lion's head should be, but there, the fur ended and was replaced by skin. The sphinx's body turned into that of a human, apparently a young girl due to her lack of certain feminine features on her chest. He could tell the sphinx was female mainly due to her face. She had ragged tan hair and freckles, and glowing green eyes, with a single fang jutting from the top of her mouth. Instead of human ears, she had feline, lion ears covered in fur, and a wilted flower held behind one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphinx looked down at Felix as he stared at her with a sort of awe. He'd never seen such a huge creature, and although he hated to admit it, she actually looked a bit pretty to him. But he noticed that her eyes were very sad, and her arms were crossed in front of her stomach; she was shivering, and looked on the verge of tears. Felix couldn't help but feel sad for her, but stopped himself from walking up to her. The guards were still watching, and wouldn't let him do anything but feed the beast and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphinx pleaded at him with her eyes, and Felix felt overwhelmingly sad for her. He started stumbling forward, in a trance, and the guards shouted for him to stop. But he wasn't able to hear them, and was lost in the sphinx's green eyes....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the eyes turned red, and the sphinx bared her teeth (which meant little considering they were all human-like except for her two longer fangs). Felix stood still, unable to move, as the sphinx's left hand reached down towards him. He had walked well into her arms' range, and she was easily able to reach him. Her fingers wrapped around him, and he couldn't resist as she lifted him from the ground without any effort, bringing him close to her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he wasn't looking at her eyes, he suddenly felt able to move. He started struggling, shouting for help and kicking the sphinx in her stomach. She didn't react, though, and simply brought her other hand to start stroking his head. He was stunned with surprise, and stopped struggling for a bit. He was being held facing away from her, and he could see a group of guards coming into the cell. The sphinx stopped petting him and squeezed him tighter. He decided not to squirm, and see what happened. After all, the sphinx had him, and the guards were his only chance to get away....</span></div></div>",

I've always wanted to escape, but I've never been able to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphinx smiled slightly. \"Well, maybe we could help each other with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked up with a somewhat surprised expression. \"Wait, do you know how to get out of here?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphinx began to look nervous, and said, \"Actually, no. But maybe we could help each other find a way to escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked up at the grate covered hole in the ceiling, and remembered something. \"I thought Lord William said you have wings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said that, the sphinx looked away. \"Well, sphinxes are supposed to have wings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me you don't?\" he asked, slightly annoyed and worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphinx moved her hand a bit, letting Felix take a better look at her lioness half. He saw two small nubs behind her front legs' shoulders, and realized what it likely meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was born like that,\" she explained. \"My wings never grew in. So, we can't fly out of here, even if we could break the chains they have on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix sighed, running a hand through his hair. \"Okay, we'll have to think of something else. But, I think I should get going now. The guards might come back and attack you again, and that wouldn't be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sphinx nodded, setting Felix down gently on the ground. He began walking away, but stopped and turned around, looking way up at her youthful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more thing,\" he began. \"Do you have a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"Zahra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Neat name,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means flower,\" she explained. \"But, shouldn't you get going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded and, with a wave, ran back to the door, hoping to make a plan the next time they met.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Felix left the cell, he surprised everyone. They thought he was dead by the sphinx's hand, and having found he was not, they took to calling him \"the sphinx tamer\".  He liked the attention, but knew he should probably keep secret how he and Zahra were actually starting to be friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William knew something was up, though. The sphinx and Felix had something between them. The beast was deadly, as he intended it to be, and so it must have befriended the slave. Such an alliance could only lead to rebellion, with the slave using the beast, and he couldn't allow that. He was interested in how such an alliance was created, though, and hoped he could create something similar between himself and the sphinx, as it would help him reach his goal. He thought he might ask the slave at any point about this, though, so he could act now with breaking their alliance so he might forge one for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to test their alliance by sending in a group of guards and a wizard, with the task of wounding the sphinx severely. He would then have the wizard use his spells to spy on them, and see how the slave reacted to the sphinx's injuries. Perhaps copying the slave's reaction to the sphinx's pain would help lord William form a bond with the sphinx, and help him control it easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, when Felix came to feed Zahra again, he entered her cell to find her crying, lying on the ground. He checked to see that the door was closed, and rushed over to her, leaving the cart behind. He sat down next to her face, which was almost as big as he was, and asked what was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZahra wiped her eyes and glanced over at Felix, her red eyes turned even more so with tears. \"They.., hurt me... With magic,\" she stuttered. \"Hurt so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stood up and awkwardly tried hugging her face. She smiled slightly and pushed herself off the ground with her hands, leaning over Felix. She pushed more, until she was sitting with her lioness half lying down and her human hald upright, and held out a hand to Felix, her palm facing him. He knew what she wanted, and walked into her hand, raising his arms so the would stay free to move. She wrapped her fingers around him and lifted him to her face, wiping more tears from her eyes with her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix...\" she started. \"We need... To get out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" he said, patting her wrist, one of the only things he could easily reach in the position he was in. \"Is this the first time they hurt you like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, crying still. \"Yeah, it... It hurt... He used magic, and... And it hurt a lot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix just hung there, held in her gentle hand and surprised that such a big creature could be so hurt. He also got angry at lord William and his men for hurting Zahra, realizing in that moment how protective he was of her. She was many times his size, and was easily able to overpower him, and was even holding him in her hand right now as an example of her power over him... But even so, he saw she was still weak, and he felt like he was what she needed for protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I've lived here my whole life,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this cell?\" Zahra asked, cocking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not!\" Felix said, laughing. Zahra giggled, wiping tears from her eyes. She seemed to be recovering a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've lived in this castle my whole life, and I know some secret ways in and out. Ways lord William doesn't know about, and if he did, would wish I didn't know about. I can explain two ways to you, and maybe we could work out a way to escape....\"</span></div></div>",

However, there is one fact about succubi that is universally agreed upon: they are extraordinary beautiful. Their features are perfect and their alluring body is made to make mortals, both males and females, fall under their charms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lesser known fact about succubi are their true size. When they appear in peoples dreams to lure and tempt them, they usually show themselves human-sized. However, most succubi are actually about 80 feet tall on average! This lesser known fact remains so because few people come back alive to report the succubi's true height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccubi are very dangerous and deadly beings. Their alluring bodies hide their martial skills; they are good warriors and excellent spell casters. Even an average succubus is a master of her element and knows the basics of dimensional magic. Succubi are also extremely voracious, and their large magic-proof stomachs can digest just about everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all demons, succubi show no mercy to their enemies or to their prey. They are deceptive, prone to anger and they have a temperament that can only be described as chaotic. But contrary to Heaven's propaganda, not all succubi are innately evil, nor are all demons. Indeed, it is easy to find some friendly and amiable succubi. It's very difficult to fully earn a succubus's trust, but once you do, they usually makes excellent friends, loyal to the death. </span></div></div>",

He sighed at the slave's question, and then continued. \"A Succubus is a demonic woman. Their most distinct features are the horns on their head, and large bat wings on their backs. They are very dangerous and violent. Imagine a Succubi tamed under me, and under my control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix rolled his eyes after the Lord made a comment. Felix hated it when the Lord constently talked about getting more power. That is all he ever cared about, power. Lord William led Felix to a cart with a large amount of meat and water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are here slave to feed the Succubus\" said Lord William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...you said that..\" started Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Succubus is still young.

Succubi are sentient beings, but they block all reason. Also, due to its young age, it is still small. But it will continue to grow with growth spurts that could tower a human easily. Once the Succubi has grown full size, it will be able to eat a human with no trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix trembled after he heard those words. Lord William laughed at Felix's reaction, and shoved him and the cart in the cage. Lord William shut the cage quickly and laughed. Felix had no choice but to go in the cage. The cage was nearly 100ft tall, and 300ft wide. The cage was dimly illuminated by torches. A pile of bones were scattered all over the floor. At the end of the cage, stood...</span></div></div>",

She appeared to be only 12 years old, but she was easily a full head above Felix's height! He instantly made out the shapes of her horns and wings, as well as a tail that came to a pointed triangle shape at the end. Despite her young age, however, this girl had a flawless figure that would make most older women jealous. She had full D-cup breasts, and her body had curves in all the right places. Since succubi have bodies that are naturally designed to seduce men, her voluptuous figure wasn't much of a surprise despite her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felix continued to look at her, his eyes began to adjust to the dim torchlight that illuminated the cage. As his eyes adjusted, he immediately noticed 2 more things about the girl's appearance: She had skin that was bright red like the flames of the torches around her, and she was standing there with nothing on but a black bikini. He then noticed that she was glaring at him with an irritated expression, her arms crossed over her chest. Felix began to get nervous when he saw this, and took a step back. The succubus was getting annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me, human?! Are you planning to taunt and make fun of me like that overweight oaf that put me here did?! I swear, if I ever get out of here, I'll-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please Miss, I have no intention of doing anything like that. I've simply been given orders by Lord William to bring you food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord William? Oh, you mean that fat creep with the crown! He's the one who brought me here and locked me up in the first place! For no reason! What does a jerk like him want me for, anyway?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... Well, I really don't know exactly... He really doesn't do much other than sit on his throne and bark orders, but I'm willing to assume that he wants to use you as a weapon or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe irritated look on the succubus's face quickly shifted to one of pure rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! I'm not gonna be some royal tub of lard's war tool! Listen you worthless human, let me out of here right now or I'm gonna-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Miss, calm down! I'm in the same position as you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?! You're not the one in this stupid cage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm still forced to be Lord William's slave...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down, a confused expression overtook the succubus's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? You have to serve that jerk against your will?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's just stupid!

You must have been through quite a lot if you've had to serve that creep for your whole life... In fact, I think that it's high time for you to be free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Scarlet, little human, and what I mean is quite simple: I'm going to break out of here, and I'm taking you with me! We can escape from this rat-hole together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! You'd do that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet simply smiled at Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, human! We're in the same boat, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... Thanks Scarlet... I don't know what to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just tell me your name for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I completely forgot! My name is Felix!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then Felix, hand me that food you brought! I'm gonna need all my strength if I'm gonna bust us out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix simply nodded and began to hand Scarlet the various food stuffs that he brought with him. By the time Scarlet had finished eating, she pat herself on the belly and let out a loud belch. She quickly placed her hand over her mouth and began to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh heh... Excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix simply stared at her for a moment before bursting out into laughter. Scarlet frowned for a moment before sighing and beginning to laugh herself. After the pair of new friends stopped laughing at Scarlet's tomboy moment, Felix began walking out of the room. Scarlet began to look sad as she saw her new friend leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going, Felix?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Scarlet, but I've got other duties to attend to... Don't worry, I promise that I'll be back by tomorrow morning to feed you your breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Alright...

When he saw the guard grabbed her wrist and pulled her back. \u201cWhat she do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe dumped so poison in our soup. And like I said since that slave was eaten we need a replacement,\u201d his look was cold and made Crystal shiver, she did hear what he said but now she thought she was going to end up like the other slave. The guard looked at her, \u201cLooks like you\u2019ll replace the other slave with all of his tasks, cleans the stables, cleaning our armor, and his last task, feed the beast.\u201d<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal has been storing that poison for months and now her plans to free herself and the slaves have failed all because of one stupid guard. Now she can\u2019t sneak any food for herself, she\u2019d have to work 24/7, but worst of she\u2019d had to feed that beast. No one but Lord Williams and the guard that makes sure it\u2019s locked up know what it is. Rumors are so wide they say it could be a live hydra skeleton, the thought of some undead beast severing the Lord \u2026 the thought made her shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard looked at her and smiled once he let go of her. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at lunch, hopefully you won\u2019t become lunch.\u201d She sighed a little she had a couple of hours until lunch, she need to think of what to do. If the beast was still being tamed then she had hope it might understand her and help her escape. <i>No I can\u2019t it already ate a slave,</i> Crystal thought. She went to do the chores trying to thinking of how to escape, or how to avoid the beast.</span></div></div>",

The Succubus had her dark-purple wings curled up around herself, blocking all view to her body and face. She was crying very loudly. Felix stopped the cart, and grabbed the meat. He placed it in the reach of the Succubus. The creature did not react to him, she just stayed there and cried. Felix grabbed the water dish and placed it within the Succubus's reach as well. He walked to the cart, but still stared at the Succubus. She was crying continuously. Felix made his way out of the cage, and still pulled the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What did they do to her?\"</i> Felix thought. <i>\"She sounds miserable.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix returned the cart to the kitchen, and went to do his other chores. But, no matter how much Felix tried, he could not get the Succubus out of his mind. All of the crying she did while he was in there, was unnatural. He went back down to the cell for her dinner.The Succubus was still crying, still covered up by her wings. The food and water from earlier was still in there as well. Felix now grew worried, as the words of Lord William's orders went through his mind. <i>If anything would happen to it, you will go with it.</i> Felix slowly approached the Succubus, hoping for her to even move. She sat on the floor, in the corner, crying. Felix let go of the cart, and then slowly walked over to the creature. Lord William said that the Succubus was young, but these did not sound like tears of a young child. More like the tears of a young teenager. Felix was now within inches of the Succubus. He stretched his hand out and gently touched the girl's wing. She stopped crying for a few seconds, but her wing hit Felix. Felix hit the wall behind him, and then the Succubus got up. She grabbed Felix by the neck and forced him into the wall. Her long claws wrapped around his neck, preventing him from escaping. Felix tried to get free, but the Succubus's hand prevented it. Felix looked at the Succubus, who was now visible. Her skin had a blue tint to it. She had small horns coming out of her head. Her eyes were purple, with tears pouring out. She had an expression of fear, anger, and sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" she asked. \"What am I doing here? What do you things want with me? Why have you inprisoned me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery question she asked forced more tears out. Felix tried to say something, but her hand was preventing anything from coming out, or in. Eventually, she saw the fear in Felix's eyes, and let go. Felix fell to his knees, coughing and gagging. Felix slowly looked up, to try to get a better view of the Succubus. She was about 12' tall. Her body was curved, with a very skinny waist, D-cup breasts, and wide hips. The Succubus was wearing brown rags that covered her chest and her waist area. The rags looked similar to what he was wearing. The Succubus also had white claws at her feet and hands. A metal cuff was around her neck, wrists, and waist; each  chained to the wall.She slowly raised one of her feet, and placed it over Felix. Felix was now forced on the ground. The Succubus was crying even more, some of her tears were now dripping on the ground, and some landed on Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this to me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not doing anything!\" said Felix. \"I am only here to take care of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know you are telling the truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am inprisoned as well as you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see you chained up to a stone cell wall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a slave to Lord William! That is the human's name that has captured you. Lord William orders me to do whatever he wants me to do. If I don't, he punishs me for it. I am just to bring you food and water so you can survive! I know what it is like to be like this. If you don't believe me, lift the back of my shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDew looked at the human strangely. Lift his shirt up? she thought. What does he have on his back? Dew raised her foot, and placed it back down beside her. She expected the human to run, but it stayed put. She reached down, and slowly lifted its shirt. Dew nearly fell back looking at his back. all over the human's back, were many scars and bruises. Some looked older than others, but they covered his back completely. Dew started to cry some more, and backing up slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix felt the Succubus raise his shirt. He could hear her make a small wimper, and slowly step back. He slowly got up, not trying to make the creature angry again. Felix got up, turned around, and faced the Succubus. Tears were still coming out of her eyes. She muttered something under her breath, but Felix could not hear it. He started to walk away, but the Succubus grabbed his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" she said. \"There's a lot of stuff that I don't know. I am also so lonely down here. Could you please stay here with me?\"</span></div></div>",

Tears were forming below her eyes. She slowly released her grip on his arm, and walked back to her corner. She turned away from Felix, covering herself with her wings. Felix looked at her the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That creature is no monster. She is just a scared girl. She may be bigger and older than I expected, but she is just scared. Who knows what Lord William has done to her already. She showed me that she is not as dangerous as what I have been told. I should trust her. But, I should also keep an eye on her. Just because she isn't a monster, does not mean she will not try to eat me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix walked over to the Succubus and placed his hand on her shoulder.

I'm Dew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Felix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passed through the cell. Dew asked a lot of questions while she ate, but Felix answered all of them. Felix did not bother Dew to ask any questions about her. After Dew asked her last question, she busted into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that Lord William wants me for that!\" she exclaimed. \"I would never want to hurt anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Dew?\" Felix asked. \"Aren't you a Succubus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what!\" Dew yelled back. \"Just because I am a Succubus does not mean I should be one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I knew I should not have said that\"</i> Felix thought. <i>\"Now what is she going to think of me?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why would Felix say that!\"</i> Dew thought. <i>\"Is Felix still afraid of me? Maybe, he doesn't fully trust me yet. I was always the odd one in Feralya. I want to show a difference here!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix just stood there as Dew stood up with her back facing him with her arms crossed. He made his way to the cart. \"I'll see you tomorrow morning Dew,\" he said. Felix pushed the cage out of the cell. The guard let him past, but stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long in there slave?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...Succubus gave me some trouble,\" replied Felix. \"I had to beg her to let me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the one guard owes me some money now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix walked away with the guard chuckling. He was mad that the guards would bet on him. He dropped the cart off at the kitchen, and went to the slave's quarters. He quickly fell asleep in his rough makeshift bed. The next morning, Felix was up even earlier than he was before. The chef gave him trouble when he came earlier, but Felix made it past him.

She was definitely bigger. Felix was stood just above Dew's knees yesterday. Now, Dew towered over him easily. She glanced at the food, which Felix then brought closer to her. She quickly ate her breakfast, then sat down. She was a lot bigger than before, so Dew had to bend down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we talk about today?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" started Felix,\"I was wondering about you. You now everything about me, I know nothing about you or your kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDew looked down sadly. Felix was about to leave, but Dew finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lived in Feralya for most of my young life\" she started. \"My parents were much bigger than me, so it was hard for them to take care of me. Some friendly humans took care of me instead and taught me about them. That's why I wear these rags. Because unlike mist Succubi, I have a sense of privacy. But, my parents did take care of me the best as they could. Still...\" Dew went silent afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still what?\" asked Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing\" replied Dew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I tell him the truth, he wouldn't want to be around me anymore.

But, I will try to keep that out of my mind as I grow.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix still stared up at Dew, who was silent for a while. Felix said his goodbyes and left the cage. He was thinking about Dew's childhood as he left. He knew that Dew had something else to say, but he did not let that get to him. Over the past few days, Dew had some small growth spurts. Eventually, Dew got so big that he could fit in one of her hands. After some days overhearing Lord William, Felix found out that Dew was soon reaching her maximum height; 80 ft. Nearly a month has past. Dew and Felix has soon became close friends. One day, however, was not as fortunate. Felix was going in Dew's cell to give her her dinner. The chains around her grew with her, so she still remained attached to the wall. Felix also convinced some of the other slaves to give him their old rags to sew a new material fir Dew's clothing.

He had messy black hair and freckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bruce,\" said Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Felix,\" he replied. Felix sat down right beside Bruce. Thankfully, they were the only ones there for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I heard that Lird William assigned you to feed his Succubus,\" Bruce continued. \"Did she try to eat you yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the Succubus is kinda what I wanted to talk to you about,\" said Felix. \"I am trying to plan an escape with me and her, but she has these chains around her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me to get the key from Lord William's personal quarters so you can escape with the beast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stopped talking. He knew that Bruce would be unwilling to do it, but it was worth a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked at him in complete confusion, \"You will!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you ask me, Lord William has enough power.

It was around dinner time for adew, so Felix made his rounds to the kitchen. He noticed that the cart had a bigger portion than before. He ignored it, and headed down to the dungeon. On the way, Felix passed Bruce with a wide smirk on his face. He handed Felix a small bronze key as he walked past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, Bruce is such a nice guy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix passed through the gate, and nearly sprinted to Dew.

The bars of the cell were frozen, with Dew right behind them. She sliced the bars to pieces with her claws. Knights came into the room, bur Dew froze them on their tracks. Lord William looked in fear, but Felix managed a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step away from Felix!\" yelled Dew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William back away, and she gently grabbed Felix. She ran to another end of the dungeon without thinking. Lord William ran out of the dungeon to get more knights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we go now?\" asked Dew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dungeon was created from an underground cave system\" replied Felix.

The tags that were covering him did not protect him well enough from the cold. He was shivering like crazy, but assured Dew that he was alright. Dew spent almost an hour playing in the snow. Although Dew was around the age of twelve, she playing through the snow like a ten year-old. Afterwards, Dew realized the sutuation they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\" he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we fleed the prison, where are we going to live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I d-don't k-k-kn-know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure your alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDew wrapped her hands around Felix gently.

Almost immediately Felix felt the chill go away, to be replaced by embarrassment and relief, in equal measures. \"D-D-Dew?! W-what a-are y-you d-d-doing?!\" Felix asked her, his face starting to flush. He may only be ten years old, but he was mature for his age, thanks to having been a slave for the majority of his life. \"I'm trying to warm you up Felix, I'm so sorry! I forgot that you were a human, and humans can't really stand this kind of cold, not like you are at the moment.\" Dew responded, and Felix saw where it was that she was coming from. He would have to try to deal with his current position at the moment, at least until he got some furs or something. He hoped that would be soon. \"Are you feeling better Felix?\" Dew asked him after a little, and he nodded his head. He wasn't too terribly cold now. \"Y-yeah. I'm n-not as cold a-as before. T-thank you Dew.\" Felix said, trying not to think about where he was at the moment. \"We should get moving. Um...\" Dew said before she started to look around. \"I see two possible places at the moment Felix.\" Dew said, and Felix asked what they were. \"Well, I can see a good sized cave in the mountain side, and I think there's a forest that can hide me inside it.\" She said, and Felix was stunned. Just how good was her vision? But now he needed to think, which would be better? In the mountain cave, there was less of a chance for William to follow them due to it being up on the mountain. But there wouldn't be that many animals that Felix and Dew would need. For food and furs. In the woods, there would be a greater chance at coming across animals that they would need, but then any hunters that William would send after them would have an easier time tracking them. Either way, there was something good, and bad, about the two choices. Now that they had their freedom, things would be much harder. Of course, there was also the option of moving further away, perhaps to another kingdom, but still, they would need at least a temporary shelter until then.</span></div></div>",

Her couldn't hang onto anything. He was in-between two large mounds of blue skin. Although, he took Dew's advice. He slightly moved deeper in-between her breasts, which made him more embarrassed and made Dew giggle. Dew's wings opened to their fullest. With one large flap, Dew and Felix rose into the air. Dew was enjoying the breeze, but Felix felt all of the cold. They soon reached the cave, where Dew landed. The entire cave looked made of ice. The light that was reflected seemed to glow like an aurora. Dew and Felix gasped in amazement. Felix felt his body beginning to sink in, and turned even more red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Dew...\" he said. \"Could you...take...me...out now...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDew gently grabbed Felix and placed him on her shoulder. Felix slipped on the fabric on her shoulder, but managed to stay on. For sone odd reason, Felix felt warmer than he did outside. He gestured Dew to walk in deeper, where they both found a surprise. A large spring was underneath the cave's dome-like ceiling. The spring was emitting steam into the air, and small bubbles came up from the bottom to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" asked Dew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be what they call a hot spring\" replied Felix. \"I read about it in Lord William's library. Water that is near lava or some underground heat source is heated to produce a hot spring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDew gently placed Felix down, and he got in. Felix let out a large sigh and went further in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in Dew!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The area down there looks deeper. Try it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDew slowly walked over and gently got in. To their surprise, the water was in fact deep enough for Dew to slip her entire body in. Dew let out a large sigh as she went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels nice...\" said Dew. \"They never have this in Feralya.

She didn't need the heat as much as he needed it, but it did do wonders for her, relaxing her muscles. Felix was the one that took a bit longer. However, as he started to step out, he noticed something felt different. A certain breeze down south prompted him to look before he quickly went back into the spring. Dew noticed this out of the corner of her eye, and turned to look at him with a worried look. \"Felix? What's wrong?\" Dew asked him, her worry apparent in her voice. \"M-my clothes...\" Felix mumbled before his voice drifted off. Dew rose an eyebrow as she tilted her head in a confused fashion, before she noticed that he was holding them up. It seemed that being soaked in the water didn't help them stay together. \"Can't you tie them around you?\" Dew asked Felix, who shook his head. To demonstrate his point, he tugged lightly at the cloth, and it ripped without much force being applied to it. \"T-this...could be a problem.\" Dew said after a long drawn out pause between the two. She had two ideas come to her just then, but she didn't know which Felix would prefer. Unless she asked him. Which she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, I could tear some cloth off of my rags if you want, or I could try to find some kind of animal with fur or something and we could go from there.\" She said, and Felix went thoughtful. If she tore of cloth from her rags, then he wouldn't have to wait nearly as long, but then she would have less clothing herself. That could cause...problems. Especially if she had another growth spurt, he didn't even know if she was done growing yet or not. However, on the other hand, she wouldn't have to do that, she could find some animals and get food and clothing at the same time. However, that would mean he would have to stay in the hot spring. That might mean he would catch a cold. There was only a small chance, but even then it would be deadly if it wasn't handled properly, and Felix was less the certain that Dew would know what to do should he fall sick.</span></div></div>",

It felt almost as if all of the bruises and hits Lord William made were now gone. Dew was able to step out freely, but Felix took a little longer. As soon as he got out, Felix saw a large piece of fabric on the floor. Several more pieces led a trail. Felix followed it to the end, and instantly became warmer than when he was in the hot spring. Dew's rags were damaged from the water, which fell off of her body. The cloth around her waist was slightly holding on, but her top was off. Dew turned to Felix, and looked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix...what's wrong?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDew saw Felix's blood-red face. He seemed too embarrassed to say anything. He slowly moved his hand and pointed at her body. She looked down, and had a similar color come to her face. The bottom piece of clothing fell off, which made Felix almost faint. Dew quickly covered herself with her wings. A long moment of silence passed through the cave. Dew darted for the hot spring, which made a big splash when she entered. Felix lost all of his embarrassment and went to the edge. Most of Dew's body was hidden; only her head and top proportion if her chest was above the surface. She looked very ashamed. One for making her friend almost faint, and two for her being naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry Felix!\" she exclaimed. \"The water must have damaged the rags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you still use them?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDew reached out her hand and grabbed the torn pieces. She examined them closely without getting them back in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can still use them, but I only have enough cloth for one piece. Which means I won't be fully clothed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix's face turned to a light shade of red. Imaging Dew without clothes is one thing, but only having only enough clothes for one half is something else. Still, it would be better to have her semi-covered. Dew slowly rose, but kept her breasts covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you turn around Felix?\" asked Dew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix complied with no response and no argument. After about five minutes, Dew was done. Felix slowly turned around, not knowing which half she covered. He turned and saw her arm blocking her breasts, but the cloth around her waist. Felix's face was still red, but he let out a small sigh. Dew kneeled down, still trying to cover her massive mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I make the right choice?\" she asked Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix didn't exactly know how to answer that question. However, he did answer something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my choice\" he said. \"But I am more comfortable now, if that's what you're asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you found the hot spring\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix and Dew turned to see...</span></div></div>",

Felix walked towards her, but Dew blocked his path with her wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if she's with Lord William?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont think she is Dew\" replied Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly woman walked all the way to them. She looked at Felix and then at Dew with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In all my years living up in these mountains\" she said, \"I never have seen a creature like you. Where did you two children come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief moment of silence throughout the cave. No one would say anything else. Eventually, Felix spoke up, \"Miss, we are from Lord William's castle. We escaped his castle and came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prisoners?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a prisoner\" replied Dew, \"Felix was a slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lived most of my life as a slave there. I never enjoyed any of it, from the poor clothing to the usual beatings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were beaten?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman walked up and gave Felix a hug. Dew smiled and lowered her head to properly see the elderly woman. The woman looked over and chuckled, \"Now I remember. You are a Scubbus am I right dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Jeraldine. Now then, would you two like to come with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to?\" asked Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my cottage dear child. You two need to get warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, miss\" said Dew, \"I wouldn't fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you will dear. If I remember correctly, aren't Scubbi allowed to change their size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked up at Dew in confusion. Dew looked confused at the moment, but her eyes went wide for a second. \"Yeah, I think your right. But I haven't learned how to yet. I wasn't old enough before I was captured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old are you?!\" shouted Felix. He knew she could probably hear him, but he wanted to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In human terms, I would be about tens years old right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you try anyway?\" asked Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDew nodded and closed her eyes. She didn't know what to concentrate on, so she just focused.</span></div></div>",

Later that day, he was led to its cell, and entered it, pushing the big food cart he had been given.

They can be found in many of the seas of Felarya, especially in the abyssal depths of the Topazial sea and in their underwater city Ryzelm\u2019oire. However, roaming chlaenas have been known to go closer to the surface and even onto land. A chlaena\u2019s body is made up entirely of muscle and soft tissue; they have nearly no bones or other rigid internal structure, which means that they have unparalleled flexibility and contortion abilities. They are capable of greatly compressing themselves into tight spaces, or expanding their body to swallow a creature nearly their own size. While this helps a lot when it comes to large prey, a chlaena\u2019s compressibility can also work against them, and relatively smaller predators might be able to stuff a chlaena down their throat and swallow them! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a chlaena must stay wet to survive, as long as they have ready access to water, they are able to traverse land much more ably than one might expect. A mermaid who climbs up onto shore for safety from aquatic predators is often rudely surprised when a chlaena merely follows her, dragging themselves onto land with their tentacles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrestrial beings often find chlaenas disturbing, for reasons they just can't put their finger on. Maybe it\u2019s the eight tentacles extending from their octopus-like lower body, or their large, staring eyes. Or maybe it\u2019s the fact that they seem to be unnaturally cheerful, all the time... and the way that their boneless, \u2018unnatural\u2019 way of moving (particularly on land) tends to make intelligent vertebrates shudder. A chlaena is capable of turning their head nearly 360 degrees around, so if they want to look at you, they will typically not turn fully around to do so... which can be somewhat unnerving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChlaenas, like the other cephaloid races, have odd mindsets; they simply do not think the way the \u201cnormal\u201d races do. Their logic is pretty much the only kind they are really capable of following, and their behavior can often be frustrating or frightening to those incapable of understanding their motivations. However, one thing you can rely on is for a Chlaena to be cheerful and honest, even when obviously inappropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChlaenas are capable of squeezing into very tight spaces, by compressing their flexible body and shifting their organs around inside their body. This allows them to pass through an opening only 10-15% the size of their entire body. Most chlaenas possess a mild paralytic venom, which can help take some of the fight out of large prey. In all but a few subspecies, this venom is non-lethal, as it affects only the voluntary muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to millions of specialized cells in their skin called chromatophores, chlaenas are able to rapidly change the color of their entire body, or select parts of it. They use it either to match their surroundings, or for communication and to display their mood. Nearly all chlaenas have ink glands located somewhere in their bodies, which they can use to squirt a pressurized spray of ink into the water, quickly creating an underwater \u2018smokescreen\u2019 to cover their escape or give them the advantage in an attack. Some chlaenas can even mix their venom into the ink, creating a cloud that dulls the senses of predator or prey.</span></div></div>",

With its brute strength under my command, I will be able to destroy any navy in the world. And when it reaches its full age, I shall begin my conquest. And everyone shall know of my name.\" Lord William gloated as he watched the regiment of men pushing a large cage down to the end of the prison quarters. Clearly, he had awaited this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, master? What is a chlaena? Sir.\" Felix remembered to keep his head facing the ground as he asked this question. The king spoke in a rather fearsome voice to most likely increase the fear in the young boy's heart. \"It is a hybrid possessing a human's top half while having an octopus's lower torso. Including the eight tentacles it uses to catch its prey. Powerful enough to crush a tree's trunk.\" For emphasis, he pulled a twig from his robe and snapped it in two pieces. \"Just..like...that.\" With a devilish grin on his face, Lord William began to walk away before raising a finger. \"Oh, yes. If it dies, you will follow after it.\" His final statement made, he ventured back to his private quarters, pleased at the fear he installed into the slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was left shivering as though he was standing in a blizzard stark naked. A creature with eight powerful tentacles that could crush a tree like a toothpick. And he had to watch over it. Or die. As the young boy ran these thoughts through his head, a silver gauntlet fell upon his shoulder, causing him jump him in fear and surprise. Turning around, he saw a knight dressed completely in white. \"Come. We will not want it to starve. After all, you would like to keep you head, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slave boy nodded his head quickly as he continued to face the ground. He was amazed the knight hadn't raised a hand yet to punish him for looking at him. But he wasn't about to risk it. Their footsteps echoed loudly as they went through the dungeons. Down the spiraling staircase, Felix could've sworn he heard water down below. Risking a question, he inquired. \"Sir, why is the creature this far down here?\" The knight continued to walk his steady pace before answering in a light tone. \"Sir Williams had the lower dungeons flooded in order to provide an environment for it to live in. And for now, I can only allow one more question from you before I must chastise you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy rustled through his thoughts before deciding one his final interrogative. \"Why are you being so nice to me, Sir?\" The man in armor stopped and took a deep breath before responding. \"I don't know. Maybe it's because I assisted in capturing an infant. Maybe I'm just trying to redeem myself for my sins. But regardless, I don't feel happy anymore ever since I began to working for him. Felix listened intently as the knight explained. As he was about ask once more, he remembered what the man said earlier and remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while of traversing the curving stairs, they finally reached the door to the beast's cell. \"Alright, this is as far as I go. Feed it the fish and toss the watercress into the water. It'll know what to do with it. And good luck.\" The man pushed the cart closer to the boy before leaving, trekking back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering up his few traces of bravery, Felix opened the door to the chlaena's chambers and pushed the cart in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Felix, two beautiful red eyes sensed the movement through the vibrations.</span></div></div>",

It was huge and rock-walled, like a cavern, which was likely what it originally was before being integrated into the dungeons. There was a bit of land past the door, and a small wooden dock starting at the edge of the land and the pool and sticking out over the water. The boy pushed the cart closer to the dock before pausing. He felt like he was being watched, but the room was too dimly lit to really make out much of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking slightly in fear, he continued pushing the cart, reaching the dock and continuing along it until the end. There, he reached around and opened up the hatch on the side opposite him, and carefully tilted the cart to dump out its contents into the water.

He covered himself with his arms to try to block the water flying at him, but it didn't help much. Soaking wet, he wiped his eyes to see better, and immediately wished he hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying on the dock, just feet in front of him, lay a thick tentacle, emerging from the pool to the left and sinking back in on the right. It was about the width of the boy's torso form waist to chest, and blocked hi way completely unless he wanted to try climbing over it. He had no intention of doing that, though, remembering how powerful a chlaena's tentacles were according to the small amount of information he'd been told about them. Unfortunately, that also meant he was stuck on the dock, surrounded by water on three sides and a chlaena's tentacle on the fourth. There was nowhere to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy began to shiver even more, partly from being drenched  in cold water, but mainly from fear. He was trapped. He screamed for help, but there was no response. He stood there for a few moments, trying to figure out what to do, but quickly realized that he'd been ignoring something. Namely, the fact that he wasn't dead. The chlaena's tentacle was feet away, but it wasn't coiling and crushing him. If the chlaena was hostile, it would have done so by now, but it hadn't, so... maybe it wasn't hostile?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought crossed Felix's mind, one that he immediately thought was crazy. What if the chlaena really wasn't hostile, and was actually friendly? What if it revealed a tentacle as an invitation for Felix to approach it, and allow himself to be picked up by the chlaena? But the what? Would it turn hostile then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knew he had to choose something fast, in any case. He could trust the chlaena and approach the tentacle, or try to avoid it, perhaps by jumping into the water and quickly swimming to the shore. It could be risky, but it could work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, he decided to...</span></div></div>",

The boy, still shivering, called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... I know you're there... chlaena,\" he said, voice shaking. \"I'm... I'm going to walk towards your... your tentacle...

Clearly, the boy was terrified, and it made the creature sad. It began to worry that it had been too sudden in its appearance, but it wanted to ensure the boy trusted it completely, even enough to willingly walk into its deadly grasp, so it needed to reveal itself in this way.

It was time to find out, though, since he had reached the tentacle. He raised his arms high so they'd be free of the giant creature's grip, and walked into the limb. The chlaena's suction cups, each very small for a creature of its size, stuck to the boy, and let the chlaena know that the boy had indeed walking into its grip. Felix watched as the tentacle moved, its tapered end emerging from the right side of the dock and curling around towards him. He began to grow scared as he watched, and tried to back away, but the suction cups held him in place, so he could only watch as the chlaena went to work wrapping him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tentacle coiled around, making a few circles around the boy's body, and surrounding him from ankle to chest in wet sliminess. He continued to shiver, since the tentacle was quite cold, but he realized that the coiling was very gentle, and not at all crushing him. It wasn't entirely comfortable, but it wasn't painful, so he did his best to remain calm and still. Eventually, the tentacle finished wrapping around him, leaving a short distance towards the end to hang free, and then the boy felt it all tighten. He suddenly panicked, squirming in the tentacle's grip, but it did nothing. The grip continued to tighten, but before it could get painful at all, the boy felt his feet leave the ground, and realized that the chlaena had finally picked him up, and had just been getting a tighter grip so he wouldn't slip at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as he was raised up many feet off the ground, then slowly brought over the pool. He was quite scared now, as he could easily be dropped into the pool from this position, where he'd be at the chlaena's mercy. However, the chlaena seemed to be very merciful, and the boy simply allowed it to move him, refusing to struggle at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time, the tentacle stopped moving, and the boy glanced down as he heard noise coming from the pool. The tentacle blocked a portion of his view downwards, but he could still see enough to tell that something very big was rising out of the water. As he watched, there was a second explosion of water, covering his face and blinding him for a few moments.

Nonetheless, something about it seemed feminine to Felix. The chlaena had long golden hair covering its chest and reaching almost down to its waist, where the humanoid part ended and the octopus part began. The hair was messy despite being wet, and a few strands seemed to always stick up from the top. The chlaena had large, bright blue eyes and light freckles, and seemed to have tribal marking on her. There was a red stripe running over her nose from cheek to cheek, and other red stripes and abstract markings on her torso and arms. The chlaena's arms were held in front of it, hands clasped together right in front of her chest, and she stared at the boy intently while he stared back, filled now with surprise and awe more than anything else. He'd never seen a living thing so huge before, and especially not something that looked like a human for the most part. The human part of the body wasn't absurdly large, though, and though he couldn't estimate its size very accurately, she seemed big enough to hold him in a single hand, as if he were a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was startled from his thoughts when the chlaena suddenly spoke. Her sex was pretty much confirmed when she spoke, as she had the voice of a young girl, no older than Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... trusted me,\" the chlaena said. \"I am... surprised... and happy.\" With that, she smiled gently, although doing so revealed a large fang in the left side of her mouth, making Felix slightly worried for his safety again. Nonetheless, the chlaena continued, without making any hostile moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy paused for a moment, still stunned at the whole situation he was in, but was able to stammer his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chlaena continued to smile. \"Ah... F-Felix... Hello, Felix. My name is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chlaena proceeded to make a few noises that were clearly not form any human language. Felix stared, and the chlaena blushed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... sorry... is of my... own language... much... easier to... to understand than... than yours, but I can... speak some of yours too. Have heard people call me... Chlegigrasni. Do not understand... but is easier humans to... to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nodded. \"Hello... Chlegigangr... Chlesniga... Chlegasnigra...

He never would have guessed that this situation would lead to him and a giant half-girl-half-octopus laughing together. In the end, though, it certainly was a good way for it to go, considering all the other bad ways it could have gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chlaena repeated her name, and the boy said it a few more times to memorize it.

The Lord had flooded both stories of the dungeons to provide the cell for the creature. Extending out over the water was a boardwalk so he throw the fish and grass out to the chlaena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked around, checking to see if the cellmate was around. Satisfied that it wasn't around, he slowly pushed the cart onto the path. The wheels trudged over the pathway, causing small ripples to spread on the water. Deep below the waves, something was watching him. To the eyes underwater, it was a strange sight to it also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slave threw in all the fish onto the wider areas. He was afraid that the creature might come up and destroy the boardwalk he stood on. Turning his attention to the watercress, he touched it before retracting his hand. Watercress was very slimy and slippery like soap but tough like rubber. Picking up a bushel, he threw them onto the water. As he did, he noticed that none of the fish were gone yet. Stopping his task, Felix slowly tiptoed out to the edge and peeked over the surface. A pinwheel of large green lights slowly twirled in a tornado-like fashion as the creature slowly came closer. Stepping back, he slowly shuffled back before running to the entrance. He didn't want to still be on the boardwalk when it surfaced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he reached for the door ring, he stopped and listened. It felt as though a little girl was whispering into his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....lease....ait. on't......go. Plea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy took his hand away from the large ring and looked back. Now the lights were a deep blue and close to breaking the surface. Walking back to the end, he kneeled. \"Are you talking...to me?\" He felt a little foolish asking it but he had no reason to as the chlaena replied. \"Yes I ...as. ...ank..ou...for coming...ack.\" The neons underwater turned a bright yellow as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix understood most of what it said but it was still a pain to decipher. \"You're welcome, I guess. Why are you speaking that way, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe received what sounded like a sigh. \"Well, the water acts as a constant disruptor and messes up some of my words. I could surface so we could talk face-to-face but...would you run away from me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try not to. But if I do, it may be from just being nervous. After all, I don't know what you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBubbles rose to the surface as the chlaena came at a sluggish pace. The first thing that Felix saw was....</span></div></div>",

As the waterfall of crisp dark blue rose, he wonder if it would stop soon. Finally, as it towered at least 18ft, it stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chlaena was clearly a young girl, approximately the age of a 9-year-old. Her complexion was very pale, as though she was constantly sick, but in reality, she was very healthy. The cascade of raven hair effectively hid most of her body from view. A ghostly hand reached up and removed the hair from her face to reveal her beautiful crimson eyes. One of the main points of her body were the various orange tribal markings across her body. Especially the one that looked oddly like a sun around her right eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix tried to pry his mouth open to say something but he was too busy wallowing in shock and bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ ===========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo I scare him? Maybe I should speak first? Hmm... The chlaena ran through a number of options before choosing one. Just say hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n============================================================================ =================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl slowly moved her hand in a wave. \"Hi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her speak first, Felix snapped out of his thoughts as well. \"Oh, hello.\" An awkward silence took over the air for a few seconds. Both of them were looking at each other carefully; examining one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy decided to speak first. \"My name is Felix. Nice to meet you.\" He offered his hand to the chlaena, who was almost taken aback by such a gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing extreme caution, she took his tiny hand into her pointer and thumb and proceeded to shake it very gently while introducing herself. \"Greetings. My name is Sun. The pleasure is all mine...somewhat.\" She giggled. Felix was amazed that she could smile, dare say laugh. It was such a harsh environment to live in and yet she still could smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sun? If you don't mind what I say, then doesn't your appearance somewhat contradict your name?\" Felix spoke in a soft tone, as not to show he was poking fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name isn't based on appearance, silly! Where I came from, they were named on personality. My mother always said I had a sunny, bright smile. And she said I'm outgoing, cheerful...\" Sun went on to list hundreds more adjectives that seemed to describe her rather well.</span></div></div>",

Felix tried hard to pay attention to his newfound friend during the adjective-naming, but he found it difficult. The chlaena looked around at her rather poor home. \"Where are we, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy bit his lip as these words left her mouth. He wasn't so sure if she would still be so cheerful after the explanation. \"Well, you see, we are now property of a mean king. He's called Lord William but his servants, including me, have to call him Lord or Sir. Usually, if we don't obey his directions or rules, he whips us or beats us. It's very painful. Awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since her arrival, Sun didn't look as cheerful. \"Well, why don't you leave? If a person is that mean to you, you shouldn't stay near him. Let alone obey his orders! It's like you want his punishment, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix let his head drop as he sat at the edge of the boardwalk. \"That's the thing. I can't leave. I'm not allowed. If I do try to leave, he'll probably...\" He took a deep gulp of air as he let the next words from his mouth. \"Kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix would find Sun's face close up to his as she slammed both her hands on the boardwalk behind him, almost destroying it. The boy fell back in surprised shock. Was her anger also like the sun? \"Why?! That's not fair! It's cruel and mean and! And! It's not fair!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer powerful underwater octopus tentacles slammed into two of the support beams, causing a section of it to be destroyed. Also propelling Felix into the dark water as though he were a ragdoll. Sun realized her mistake and swam over to Felix as she scooped him up in her hands. \"Felix! I'm sorry! Are you OK? It was an accident! I didn't mean it, I swear!\" Thankfully, one of her drifting tentacles had cushioned his fall, being more beneficial that the octopus half had nearly no bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy inhaled and exhaled rapidly as he lay resting in her large palms. Such power! Just like Lord William said! Sitting up slowly, he began to feel himself. He recalled falling on something slick and slippery. Holding a hand to his head, Felix recovered from his dizziness. \"It's OK. It's OK, Sun. I'm not dead or injured. Just slightly dizzy. But what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun sighed relief as she drifted through the water. \"My other half. The octopus half. Where I came from, it was somewhat natural to have strength like this. But regardless, I shouldn't have lost myself. But it just makes so mad that your species would treat each other so harshly!\" Large tears began to flow down her pale cheeks as she spoke. Spreading her tentacles out so her lower half was like a parachute , she set Felix down upon it before bursting out in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of crying, she regained her posture. \"Alright, I'm better. I'm going to make you a promise, Felix. I'm gonna spend every second of my days here trying to find a way out. For both of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked up at the vermilion eyes of Sun. Her eyes burned with determination and strong-will as her lower body turned a deep shade of crimson. \"If you could do that....that'd be nice, Sun.\" Thinking of a resolution of his own, he stood up to say it only to slip on the slick surface of the slippery body-made platform. \"And I promise to bring you food to boost your brain power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chlaena clapped her hands together in joy. \"Deal!! Once we get out of here, we can go back to my world! And you can meet my family! And maybe......you'd like to join my family. You would be my big brother. And you'd have a big sister. Literally big.\" Felix fantasized about what she said. A family. He'd forgotten what it was like to have a family. \"Umm, Sun? I need to get back to my chores. I'll see you at lunch soon, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrifting over to the partial boardwalk, she deposited her passenger onto it before watching her new friend leave. Once Felix left, Sun slowly sank back into the murky depths, thinking of one thing. Freedom with Felix.</span></div></div>",

Sun set about exploring her prison. It appeared that the dungeon had indeed been two levels before its flooding, and diving down, Sun passed by submerged cells, ancinet bones littering the floor, and in some cases whole skeletons shackled to walls.She felt her anger flare. She would not be stuck here, would not let Felix suffer it either. The chaelana continued on, arriving at what seemed to be an old stair case. Curisoity piqued, she swam down it, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second floor of dungeons was similar to the first, save that it had a large chamber at the end of its hall, full of strange and grisly looking devices. She didn't know what they were for, but small as they were to her, they still carried an air of menace. She gave an involuntary shiver. She'd ask Felix what the cruel looking devices were for next time he came. Sun was about to leave and return she felt an odd current in the water. Pausing, she followed the flow until she came to a section of the wall, stone and mortar filled with cracks. Here, it was definetly coming from here. Water was flowing through the wall, and into something behind it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWIthout a second thought, the chaelana began to pull at the stones and soaked mortar, latching tentacles onto loose stones with their suckers and pulling with all her strength. At last, one of the stones fell from its place, sending a cloud of dust up in the water. The current only grew stronger. Emboldened by this success, Sun wormed several of her tentacles in through the newly made hole in the wall's center, latched them on to the other side of the wall, and pulled once again. This time, nearly the entire section of the wall came down, throwing up more dust, but it was quickly sucked away by the now fast moving current.Swimming through the hole,Sun found herself in a small cavern, and found the currents source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive iron grate ad been laid over a hole in the floor, beneath which water rushed by. Sun smiled. It was an underground river. And with Lord William's castle so close to the shore, it could only lead to the sea. This was her and Felix's way out. Grinning, she wrapepd tentacles around the grate, and pulled. It didn't budge. Somewhat flustered, but far from discouraged, Sun pondered way to get around it.She recalled bits of magic she had learned back home. Dangerous stuff, and mostly forbidden, she cast such thoughts aside. This was a situation that warranted the danger. Then again, she was sure that if she were bigger and stronger, it would be a imple matter to rip of the grate. Finally, she decided to ask Felix......</span></div></div>",

I'm positive that I can do one to let Felix breathe under here, but stuff to get the grate off could backfire pretty bad. Guess I'll just have to get bigger,\" she concluded with a slight grin. \"No one will be able to push me around any more back home, and I can take care of my new brother better.\" Her thoughts then invariably turned to Felix. \"I hope he comes back here soon, we've got a lot to talk about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix hurried through the rest of his day's tasks, eager to return and see his newfound friend, but her was careful to mask his optimism around the castle staff. Sadistic guards took pleasure in crushing anything that brought the slaves joy, and the boy feared what would happen if they discovered the source of his hope. So he kept it hidden, keeping his head down whenever one of the armored thugs stomped by. Soon enough though, it was time for dinner, and the slave hurried down to the kitchens to retrieve the cart, once more filled with fish and aquatic plants, before descending down into the dungeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cart wobbled slightly as he rolled it out over the rickety wooden platform, and as he reached the end of the pier, Felix stepped aside and looked down at the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sun!\" he called, \"It's me, Felix. I'm here with dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, the water began to bubble and ripple slightly as a large shadow formed beneath its surface, and Sun slowly surfaced, smiling widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy, I got some news!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix smiled weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great Sun. Why don't you have dinner first, you look pretty hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis giant friend smiled sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am a little bit.

How? Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun's grin persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Below us, in one the one flooded floor. There was a weak wal, and behind that, there's an underwater river that can take us straight through to the ocean. I know a spell that'll let you breathe underwater for the trip, but, uh there's one slight problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see, to get to the underground river, there's a metal grate in the way.

Never were.\" Felix felt an aching pain in his heart grow and expand. <i>So this was all a trick, huh? Figures about proving Lord William wrong...</i> \"Then......Then what are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're family. From the minute we met, I was your younger sister and you my older brother. And family sticks together, through thick and thin. Am I right, brother?

It's just...been so long since I remember having a family.\" With those words, he began to let loose a new onslaught of tears. Gently using her pinkie, she began to stroke her brother's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while of releasing tears, Felix regain his posture. \"Thank you, Sun. Those were kind words to say. Anyway, I'll find a way to persuade the chef to give me more food.\" The chlaena smiled and picked up the boy in her hand before giving him a peck on the cheek. \"Don't overexert yourself, brother.

Rousing himself from his bed, the young slave smiled while looking at the rays of yellow flowing through the window. Sun, I made you a promise, didn't I? Stretching his limbs, Felix began to prepare for his daily chores. He'd have to be careful not to suffer any wounds for fear of angering his little/bigger sister becoming angry. \"Well, sister, wish me luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning and afternoon passed by quickly, the numerous slaves rushing to take care of the various jobs and tasks assigned to them with the guards watching their every move with avarice-filled eyes. Felix was finally done polishing the royal armors of past kings and queens before looking at the stained glass window of the throne room. The sun had fallen quite low into the green land, announcing the arrival of evening. Evening meant it was time for him to feed Sun. But today, it also meant it was time to persuade the chef to give more food up to his sister. Drying his hands on his ragged shirt, Felix took a deep breath before heading down to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching his destination, the young boy would find his target slicing apart pieces of healthy meat into thin slabs. Looking hungrily, Felix licked his lips before remembering what he came to do. Walking into the room, Felix spoke in a soft voice. \"Mister, I'm here for the beast's food...\" Wedging his blade into the wooden chopping board, the bulk of a man turned around, treating Felix to a resolve-abandoning sight. Being a butcher as well as a chef, the meat he chopped up often ended up on his apron he wore, leaving no wonder to what the red stuff on it was. Not only that but he was also ridiculously burly. \"Already, huh? Fine, then.\" Loading up the cart with the meat and watercress, the chef was about to go back to his business until Felix spoke up. \"Sir, it'll need a little more than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vein of anger appeared on the butcher's head as he turned around. \"A little more, huh? Listen here, you mangy boy. There ain't enough food to go around for everybody in this here castle. Certainly not enough for a boy and his little pet. Or maybe...\" Grabbing the frightened Felix by his wrist, he dragged him closer. \"You're trying to get more food for you and ya friends. Well, how about I serve you to them?!\" Raising his knife above, a deadly glint in his eyes.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chef, stop this instant! If you kill him, I will have to report you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the doorway, Felix saw the same white knight waiting. \"Lord William's orders. The creature is to receive more food to speed it's growth. Here's the paper if you need it.\" Taking the outstretched parchment from the knight, the burly butcher read the paper, slowly letting go of the slave's arm. Mumbling to himself, he loaded more fish and cress onto the cart before leaving to continue cutting up his meat. Taking the cart in his hands, the white knight beckoned Felix to follow as he began to lead the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a question. I can sense it.

You've served Lord William longer than I have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes... The <i>original</i> white knight... He wasn't very difficult to remove from the equation... After that, I simply took his place and slipped in undetected!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean that you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A necessary sacrifice... Taking over his high ranking position was the only way that I could have snuck in successfully...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were sent here by Sun's parents? How long ago did you arrive here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the time the soldiers had transported her here, Her parents had already been informed of it and hired me. I arrived the next day. I've been here for but a day less than the girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... So does that mean that you're going to help Sun and I escape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was only hired to rescue the girl. If doing that allows you to escape as well, then so be it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to say... Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix then ran off with the food cart and headed toward Sun's cell. When he arrived, he was greeted by Sun's usual \"Hi Felix!\"... But something about her seemed... different...</span></div></div>",

As she finished her chant, Felix's body began to glow for a moment. When the glow faded, nothing seemed to be different. He looked up at her confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened sis? Did the spell work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Now let's get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSun then dove under the water, and Felix quickly jumped in after her. He soon realized that the spell had in fact worked, and he was able to breath without any trouble. The self-proclaimed siblings soon reached the bottom of Sun's massive tank. Sun used her tentacles to remove several bricks from the floor, revealing the underground tunnel that would serve as their escape route. The pair swam down the tunnel, and came to a stop when they reached the massive metal gate. Sun looked over at Felix, who simply nodded his head at her. She took a deep breath to prepare herself for what she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then reached out with each of her tentacles and wrapped them around the sturdy metal bars. She then began to pull at them with all of her strength. At first it was a bit of a struggle, but the bars slowly began to yield to the force being applied by Sun's powerful tentacles. Eventually, Sun managed to rip the bars right off of the gate, and smiled at seeing the fruits of her labor. Now that the only remaining blockade had a huge gaping hole in the middle of it, Sun and Felix smiled at each other again before they continued to swim through the tunnel to their new freedom. Eventually, however, the tunnel came to a 2-way fork. The pair of escapees stopped swimming and looked at each other again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now, bro? Which path should we take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... It looks like either one could lead us out of here, but who knows... I suppose it really doesn't matter that much which one we choose, since we're already home free...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I agree! How about we take the _____ path, then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their behavior tend to vary a lot; you can find Nekos who are very used to live in human cities and behave just like them, and some specimens who are much wilder, run on four legs and can climb a tree in the blink of an eye. Most nekos are used to swallowing small, living prey when eating, such as Tinies, just as a giant Felaryan predator would eat humans and nekos.

Felix had grown worried when he was told he had to care for a monster, because he was worried that it was a dragon or something monstrous in the cage, not a neko. Nekos weren't monsters, they were intelligent like humans. Felix was relieved that there wouldn't be in danger like he thought there would be. His master had just been trying to scare him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there have been nekos that have visited the castle before. They look like humans except they have cat ears, tails, sometimes whiskers, and some other cat like features. But, they're sentient and just like humans,\" Felix answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem relieved to know you will be taking care of a neko,\" Lord William observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was worried I'd be taking care of a monster, not a neko,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know that there are more savage nekos out there? There are some that live in the wild, and although they still have intelligence, their feline instincts are stronger. You have only seen the civilized ones that are ruled by their intellect and not their instincts. There are even some that look entirely like a cat, but walk like humans. You've heard the term anthro, right?\" Lord William asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix shook his head and asked, \"Is this a wild neko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William smiled upon seeing Felix's fear return once again. \"This is far worse than a wild neko. This is a Felaryan giant neko,\" Lord William stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-giant neko?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are very rare, even in the realm of Felarya which is full of giant creatures. However, they are still possible and they gain the same twisted moral system of the other top predators of Felarya,\" Lord William explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, master?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felarya is a beautiful place, and the women there are all breathtakingly beautiful as well. However, it is the most twisted and cruel realm to go to. In Felarya, the large eat the small without hesitation. No mater how sentient the giant predator is, they will not hesitate to eat a human if they should cross paths. Hell, there are species that have a giant version and a regular version where the giant versions eat the smaller version despite being of the same species. In Felarya, the word person is defined by how small you are. If you're smaller than the giant creature, than that creature wouldn't see you as a person and wouldn't feel any guilt for eating you,\" Lord William said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this neko thinks like the other monsters in Felarya. It will eat people despite it being intelligent?\" Felix gasped, \"But how cruel can it be to eat a person only because they're smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To a Felaryan, it doesn't seem cruel at all. In their realm and in the giant predators' cultures, it is morally permissible to eat a smaller being. Most find it impossible to find any other use for a being of human size and feel they're too small of anything but a snack. A top predator in Felarya might be the kindest creature ever when it comes to creatures of their own size, but it would still eat smaller people just because they're too small to defend themselves,\" Lord William informed the slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I have to feed this giant neko, and make sure it is taken care of?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. The soldiers are probably chaining it up in the cell as we speak. As long as you keep out of the creature's range, you will be fine. You will have to watch your own safety. No guard will save you. If you die, I'll just replace you with another slave, understood?\" Lord William asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't want to be caught by a giant neko. Not only will this creature eat you, but it will play with you and torture you a bit first. You know how a cat plays with its food, right? All nekos still have that feline instinct. Do you remember that neko that caught the mouse and played with it before devouring it?\" Lord William asked. Felix just nodded. \"That mouse will be you if the giant neko captures you. Felaryan giant nekos love catching smaller prey and play with them first. No matter what species the prey is or what level of intelligence, the nekos will be overwhelmed by its instinct to capture and eat smaller creatures. They would even do this to human sized nekos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuards exited the cell and began pushing the cage away. \"Looks like the neko has been dealt with. It's time for you to feed it, slave,\" Lord William stated, \"The food you are to give it is right behind you on that cart.\" With that, Lord William left and Felix approached the cart. The guards who stayed already had the gate open for Felix to enter. Felix took in a deep breath and pushed in the cart full of food. The gate clanged shut behind him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat gender and species will the neko be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: This Felaryan giant neko is a more anthro like. This one basically looks just like a giant anthro cat, though it is still sentient. This neko, like an anthro, has fur covering its entire body and has the fur of a wild cat. (You know a lion, tiger, leopard, or etc. Next adder gets to choose.) This creature is a male and is about five years old, but is about forty feet tall (It had to sit in the cage the whole way). However, it hasn't finished it's growing for that year and will still reach seventy feet. The adult size is 120.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The Felaryan giant neko is a traditional neko with human body and cat ears, tail, etc. This one is female and is about five years old. It too is about forty feet tall and will eventually grow to about seventy feet by the end of the year. Its adult size would be about somewhere between 110 and 120.</span></div></div>",

A gigantic body curled up into a ball.  The back was to him.  Pale pink skin covered the back but as he looked in one direction, black fur appeared.  And at the other end was also covered in black fur with a tail emerging from the body.  On the head hidden from him, Felix saw a cat ear move up and twitch slightly.  But nothing else moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>All right Felix, nothing to worry about.  They would have chained this thing up....I hope,</i>\" Felix thought as he began pushing the cart forward.  His eyes focused on the path before him and didn't know the twin ear twitch as well.  Slowly Felix moved closer, then he saw it.  On the large back, muscles began twitching and Felix instincts screamed for him to jump backwards.  As he pushed backwards, the giant neko uncurled in a flash and leaped at Felix, until the chains around her neck choked her and held her back.  The neko fell to all fours, glaring at Felix with silver-colored cat-like eyes.  Felix then noticed shackles holding the neko's hands chained to its feet, guessing it was to prevent the creature from utilizing its full jumping ability.  The neko arched its back and hissed revealing several sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release me tiny!\" she ordered, \"And return my clothes!\"  Felix stared at the large face glaring hatred at him and noticed a large gash on her cheek.  An ugly mark on what would have been a cute youthful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I\"m sorry, but I'm can't,\" Felix stammered out, \"I don't have the keys or your clothes.  I'm here with food.\"  The large nose began to twitch and the eyes looked to the cart  near her.  Reaching out, she was just able to pull the cart towards her and found the raw meat and water.  She growled deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did this happen?  Where's my mommy and daddy?!\" the neko growled.  She stared at the unmoving meat.  She hadn't eaten still food since the days she was still being nursed by her mother.  Ever since she could crawl, she had been given live, sometimes injured, tinies, who would scream and run from her.  She would laugh as she toddled towards them batting them around before finally enjoying their wonderful taste in her mouth.  And now, here she was in some cold stone room chained up by tinies and made to eat still food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix watched the sadness grow on the young girl's face.  He knew that look.  He remembered those words from his own mouth five years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it means anything, I am sorry,\" Felix said, \"I'm stuck here as well.\"  The neko looked at Felix for the first time, briefly remembering he was still with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away if you can't help me!\" she hissed, her ears flat on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't,\" Felix said, \"I need that cart your holding.\"  The silver eyes looked at the cart.  A dark smile formed on her face, one universally recognizable to any slave as a sadist's smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need this?\" she replied, lowering her hand, \"Then come and get it.\"  Felix watched the cart being held just over three feet above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I come you'll move it and play with me,\" Felix said, before gulping, \"Maybe even eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do that,\" the girl replied, her smile unchanging, \"I promise.\"  Felix bit his lip.  He knew he couldn't leave without the cart.  But he also knew what was in store for this young neko.  And it wasn't very nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those men who brought you here,\" Felix said, \"They'll hurt me if I don't have the cart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my problem,\" the young neko answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they will also harm you.  That's what they're plan is, to hurt you over and over and over again,\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?  What do they want with me?\" the neko asked.  Felix was about to speak when a thought came to him.  He could try and barter for the cart using the information.  Of course this neko may not like him for it, but he needed that cart or it was his hide.  But another part thought if he was nice to her, she might give him the cart freely.

Taking a breath, he started explaining. \"They want to turn you into a weapon.\" At the neko's blank look, he decided that a more in depth response would be needed. \"They think that you are just a mindless animal that Lord William can tame to use as a weapon in order to get more power and land.\" Felix said, trying his best to say everything that was needed to be said, in the shortest amount of words needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I was taken?\" The neko asked in disbelief. How could any tiny hope to tame her? She was beginning to think that this tiny was lying, and she didn't like to be lied to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, lord William has ways of making anyone bend to his will. He's done it before, and will most definitely do it again, especially on one he thinks will help him gain more power.\" Felix said, looking down and away from the neko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that remark there that the neko paused what she was doing. She had heard of some tinies being able to use magic, but she only thought that it was just a rumor, to get children to behave. But then again...he could be lying. \"Why are you telling me this?\" She asked in a suspicious tone. \"What do you get out of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had to think on that one for a bit. He wasn't prepared for her to ask that kind of question. Of course, she had every right to think he could be lying. \"Because...What do I gain from hiding anything from you? We're in the same situation...I'm a slave, I have no where to run to, and I have no hope of escape by myself.\" Felix said, hoping that the neko would start to view him in a friendlier way soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neko tilted her head in confusion. \"What's a 'slave'? Why can't you just leave?' This tiny was beginning to confuse her, but she had lost any thought of trying to play with him. He was probably the only one she could talk to...if he was telling the truth. She still wasn't sure if he was lying or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A slave...well, in the simplest terms, it means that I belong to someone...I don't have any freedom of my own, I have to do what I am told, or I get punished for it...\" He decided to show her what he meant. Turning around and lifting what passed as a shirt for him, he showed her his back. It was laced with scars from previous beatings and whippings, of which there were a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tiny turned his back to her, she wondered what he was doing. Taking a closer look, she found scratches around his back...no, not scratches. To her they would be, but to the tiny, it must be a lot bigger, so they were scars. She had no idea what he did to do this, but she did know what it meant to not have any freedom. She decided that he wasn't lying to her, but she wondered what to do about him. She could give him the cart, but what then? He would just leave, meaning she would be by herself. That thought sounded good to her, but she also wanted someone to talk to, and she doubted that any other tiny would be willing to talk with her. So she started to think. She could make him promise to return and talk with her as much as possible, or she could just wait until he came back to see what he has to say. If she was nice to him, maybe he would let his guard down...but then what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the neko was thinking to herself, Felix had lowered his shirt, grateful that he was able to take it off, if only for a little while. He saw that she was deep in thought. He hoped that he had managed to get through to her, but it was probably a little to soon for that. \"...I'm sorry, but I really do need that cart now...\" Felix asked the neko, startling her out of her thinking. Looking between him, and the cart, she was about to put it down when she said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The neko put the cart down, but kept her hand over it. \"You have to promise that you'll talk with me.\" She said in a voice that she hoped didn't give away her true feelings. She was just a child still, and, whether or not she was willing to admit it, she didn't want to be alone in this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise...I'm the one that has to bring you food and water after all, so it's an easy enough task to accomplish.\" Felix said, though he thought he heard a bit of a plea in her tone when she told him her request. Perhaps she was just trying to act tough? He had seen some nekos do that before. It was probably a cat thing, he had seen an odd stray here and there before. Whenever they got spooked they would puff out their fur and hiss, trying to make them seem bigger and scarier. Depending on the cat, it was rather affective, but sometimes it just made them look ridiculous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing those words, the neko let go of the cart, but made no move to push it towards Felix. That meant he would have to go get it himself, and she had set it within her reach, which would mean he would also be within her reach when he went to get it. The neko seemed to be watching Felix as he looked between the cart and the neko, wondering if he would really go and get the cart, despite it being within her reach. Felix finally started towards the cart, surprising the neko a bit. After he got the cart and got out of her range, she finally spoke up again. \"Why did you enter my range willingly? What if I had only been playing with you?\" The neko asked him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix paused as he turned back towards her. \"Because I trusted you not to do anything.\" Felix said simply as he turned and left, leaving the neko stunned by his words. That tiny, despite having an obvious fear of her, still trusted her not to do anything to him? Now she was perplexed. She needed to think about his actions. Thankfully no one else would come in to disturb her that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Felix had left the neko and was out of range of any guard, he let out a loud sigh of relief. Despite what he had told her, that neko still scared him senseless. Just walking towards her took everything he had. After he put the cart back where it belonged, Felix left to go attend to his other duties, but he still thought about the promise he made to her. Perhaps with some convincing, he could get her to view humans not as food, but people? It would probably take some time, but he hoped it would work. If they could become friends, perhaps escape wouldn't be just a dream after all. But first, he would have to befriend her...hopefully that won't be a dream in itself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After dark, Felix came back to the neko's cell with another cart, full of food.  The catgirl sat with her back to him again, and didn't turn to look when he entered.  Felix stood still for a bit, watching her and taking in the sight.  He knew the neko was dangerous, but he still couldn't help but feel a bit awed by her.  She must have been ten times his size, maybe even more.  He hadn't taken as good a look at her before as he was now, but it only made him a bit more scared.  Even so, he walked forward, making sure to keep out of of her arms' range, and shoved the cart closer towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neko turned her head, staring at Felix.  She seemed confused, but then she noticed the cart.  Reaching out, she grabbed a chunk of meat from the cart and looked it over, sniffing it.  She began eating, but spat out the food after the first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This tastes bad,\" she complained, looking down at Felix as if it was his fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, my food's not much better,\" he told her.  \"I wish we could eat better, but we can't unless we get out of this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neko kept looking at him, as if she was trying to decide whether or not to believe him.  She sighed and tried to eat another piece of meat, choking slightly as it went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never eaten food this old before,\" she said.  \"Back in Felarya, we usually ate food fresh.  Most of the creatures there could swallow their prey whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Felix, who had sat down on the ground facing her, and noticed he looked scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you do that, too?\" he asked her, worried about what her answer would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin passed over her face, revealing her fangs.  \"No, I was too young,\" she said.  \"I still am, I think.  Besides, I never really liked the idea of swallowing live prey.  Wouldn't they kick and struggle a lot?  Seems like that'd hurt your throat or something....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept eating her food, staring off at nothing.  Felix watched her, slightly worried she might decide to try and eat him next.  But he knew that if he stayed far enough away, he should be safe.  Besides, the fact that she was talking with him like this probably meant she was getting a bit nicer, for some reason.  Maybe she liked his company?  Or maybe she just wanted to eat him too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neko just kept eating, reaching down for a bucket of water and drinking it in one gulp.  She coughed, and complained again about how bad it tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure that's not clean at all,\" Felix said, sadly.  \"But like I said, it's what I drink too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neko looked down at the boy, with a different look in her eyes.  She felt different, like she realized this boy was in the same position as she was, trapped in this bad place.  She suddenly felt like she wanted to help him, so that they could both escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could say anything, they both heard the door to the cell open.  A guard stepped inside, and asked why Felix hadn't come back yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix got up, stumbling back in surprise.  He'd almost forgotten that he was on a time limit with feeding the prisoner.  But as he went towards the door, he heard scraping behind him, and the sound of metal snapping.  He looked back in surprise, and saw that the neko had managed to free her left arm, ripping the chain from the wall.  He shouted, and the guard grabbed his axe and shouted for help.  Felix started to run away, but the neko swung her tail around, tripping him so he landed on his face.  He looked over his shoulder, too hurt to stand up, and saw her hand reaching towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't do anything as her hands reached him, her fingers closing around his torso.  Her hand could barely wrap around him, but she was able to pick him up off the ground and bring him closer to her.  By now, she had moved around so she was facing the door, sitting with her legs curled up under her and her tail wrapped around her privates, her other arm supporting her.  She held Felix close to her stomach, and he looked up in fear, too scared to even squirm..  He saw she wasn't paying attention to him, and was just staring at the guard by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard stepped back, frightened.  \"I'm not going in there,\" he said.  \"Not with that thing i there with you.  Sorry slave.  I'll tell the boss about this.  Maybe he'll care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard ran off, slamming the door behind him.  Felix kept watching the neko, and she raised him up to her face.  She looked him over with her bright yellow eyes, glowing in the dark like a cat's, and he was worried she might try to eat him....</span></div></div>",

The cart itself may have weighed the same weight as him, seeing that it carried the amount of food needed for a creature of her size, albeit being borderline to enough.  The guards watched him struggle to pull it, and laughed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've worked here long enough, boy.  Aren't you strong enough by this point?\"  one of them retorted.  Felix shrugged it off, and they laughed again.  He used his back to open the door, and when he did, the guards pushed the cart in with him and shut the door.  He could vaguely hear them laughing a third time as he turned to look at the neko.  She had just woken up from the slam of the door, and she was a tad groggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five... more minutes...\"  she said, eyes closed and half-asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Felix.\"  Felix replied, and her eyes snapped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... came!\"  she said, smiling, then quickly wiped the emotion away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have your food and water.\" he replied, pushing the cart just within her range.  She snatched it and gobbled it up quickly, setting the cart back down where it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there anything you wanted to say before I go?\"  he told her.  The neko looked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Argh!  I forgot my questions...  Great.  Maybe I should tell him my name before I go...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just my name.  You can call me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off when she saw that he wasn't paying attention to her; rather, he had his ear to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Why aren't you paying attention to me?\"  she asked, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!  The guards are talking...\"  he returned.  Outside, the guards were talking about a new arrival to the fortress.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n\"Hey, did you hear?  Lord William had decided to run a recruitment drive because of the search for the big cat thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that.  Didn't they say that only one person applied?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.  Do you think he was accepted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously so, he was the only one who bothered to sign up.  We lost so many men on that Felaryan expedition, we really had no choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard some people say he's a special person... rumor has it he's gone to Felarya and back just on his own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out.\"<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n\"A new guard?\" Felix said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another one?  Aren't there enough of them already?\"  the neko complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I willing to bet he's a stuck-up jerk like the rest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix shook his head.  He didn't want to think about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what was it you wanted to say?\"  he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I forgot,\"  she started, knowing that wasn't true, \"so can we just... talk for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I might be able to stay in here for a little while.  At least, until I have to go sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you be allowed to... sleep here?\" she asked, trying to hide any emotion showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix detected it, but said nothing.  \"Unfortunately, Lord William will beat me to an inch of my life.  Let's just talk, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the guards came in at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking you, boy?  It doesn't take this long to deliver food.\" one of them retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was cut off as they grabbed him and lifted him into the air.  The neko hissed and clawed at them, and they quickly ran out with him.  When they left the room and barred the door, they threw him in the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to bed or something, boy.\" they commanded.  Felix sighed, and walked away.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nThe neko sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had told him my name... I want him to call me by it so I can feel less lonely... but I can't.  I just... why can't I just think of him as a friend?  That's all he wants of me.. the same that I want from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, the neko held her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... that's what they want.  He's working with them, I know he is... I can't tell him my name unless he helps me escape.  I refuse to give my trust to some random tiny!\"<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nFelix lay his head to rest on his arm; the pillow he had may as well be stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what that new guard will be like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and tried to fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

We believe it should be easy to rear, as the males are more short tempered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix gulped, but there was nothing he could do but agree to feed the giant bird. Soon, he was walking through the door to its cell, which was dimly lit through a grate covered hole in the ceiling. In e back of the cell, chains wrapped around its legs and neck, stood the roc. The bird was at least twenty feet tall, maybe even more like thirty at most. Felix noted the two large catlike ears on the sides of its head, and the light brown feathers covering its body. Its wings were pale white, and he noticed its talons we're tipped with very sharp black claws. The roc had bright yellow eyes, and was staring at Felix with a look of interest. Longer feathers coming out from around the eye looked like long eyelashes, actually giving the female roc a feminine appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix walked forward until the guards told him to stop, and pushed the cart towards the roc. The giant bird didn't react, still watching Felix. The boy looked back at the guards, and they told him to stay for a bit. He just sat down, feeling a bit safer knowing the roc was restrained, and waited for her to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the roc was staring down at the tiny creature that had entered her cell. Ever since she was captured during a flight one day, she had been sulking, hoping to find someone to help her get away. Though a child in her kind's years, she was mature beyond her age for human standards, and she realized the boy might be different, and able to help her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the cart full of food and the bucket of water hanging from it, and reached out with a talon. She dragged them closer to her, but atill didn't eat from them. Felix looked worried, and the guards shouted that they needed the cart if it was possible to get it back. Felix told them the roc had it, and it was over the line of its range, but the guards didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you die, there are others to take your job,\" one said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing personal,though, honest,\" the other said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix sighed and got up. He really didn't want to get hurt, or worse, but he had no choice. He didn't know why the guards cared about keeping the cart from the beast, but he assumed they actually just wanted to see him try and avoid the roc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved towards the cart. The roc watched him carefully, and Felix noticed her talons twitch slightly....</span></div></div>",

The boy turns around, and the roc takes her chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a screech, she lunges forward, her beak open and head tilted sideways. In an instant, the two halves of her beak are on either side of the human's body. Before he has a chance to react, the roc bites down, gently, and lifts the boy off the ground easily!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix doesn't even scream as the roc grabs him. He's too shocked at what just happened. Apparently, the roc's reach was longer than the line! The roc straightens her head so that Felix is now held parallel to the ground. The boy looks towards the door, and sees the two guards standing there, weapons ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It grabbed him!\" one shouts. \"Let's get in there and stop it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roc suddenly drops the boy from her beak, and he lands on the ground painfully. He's only lain there a moment, though, before the roc lifts up a talon and slams it down onto his body, making him shout in pain. The giant bird slowly curls her claws around his body, lifting him off the ground and holding him close to her body. The roc then opens her mouth and roars loudly at the guards, making them run away and slam the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the guards gone, the roc still doesn't release her grip on the boy. She instead raises her leg towards her face, angling her talon so she can see the boy's face clearly. The small human gazes up at her, his eyes wide with fear....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix stared at the large cage that resembled a large wooden crate with a large door at on end and a barred window on that door. The door was only meant to open by unlatching it and it would fall to the ground. The cage was still in the hallway close to the cell the amarok was supposed to go into. The cell had two doors leading into it, a human sized door made of iron bars to look through them, and a large door like the gates of the outside wall that could be opened and easily fit the amarok through them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amarok had apparently been asleep during the trip to the cell, but now Felix could hear movement in the cage. The amarok was awake which made Felix nervous. <i>\"If this creature is an infant like Lord William said it is, maybe it can't break out of the cage,\"</i> Felix tried to assure himself. However, when Lord William had told Felix of the creature's abilities, Felix couldn't forget the image of a giant wolf bursting through a stone wall with ease and devouring the village outside the castle hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix wanted to get out of there badly, yet the cage was near the stairs and exit of the dungeons. Felix was frightened to go that way. He was also frightened of what Lord William might do to him if he should leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Felix heard whimpering from within the cage. Felix was surprised by this and stood very still at first. The whimpering was very sad like an injured puppy, a big injured puppy, because the whimpering might have been high pitched to an amarok, but the size difference between a human and an amarok made the whimpering sound a little deeper than it should have. Felix stood up on his feet slowly. The whimpering made him very curious. It almost sounded familiar to him for some reason. However, he didn't know why it would be familiar when he had never seen a monster before, let alone even hear of an amarok. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix found himself walking towards the door of the cage to look through the barred opening that was slightly past eye level with him. The amarok must have heard Felix's approach, because Felix heard it move around in the cage and the cage even rocked a bit as it moved around. Felix approached the opening and brought himself on top of the tips of his toes and looked in. It was true! the armarok was just an infant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how did you capture the monster again and where did you find it?\" Lord William questioned General Ethan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Ethan replied, \"We were in the vicinity of the small village called Littown. A villager found our campsite and explained that an amarok was attacking the village. We followed him to the village, but the monster had already destroyed most of the village and eaten many terrified people. We were going to kill it, but Alex noticed this creature was an infant. I remembered you, my Lord and thought that if we captured it, you would be able to control the infant easily and it would be very useful to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something that could already use such aggression would be a useful weapon once I could wield it. Very good. Get your men and get the creature in the cell by any means necessary, without killing it, of course,\" Lord William ordered General Ethan and Alex. Lord William turned to a servant and said, \"Get the meat and water and bring it to the boy. The amarok is probably very hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant hurried away and Lord William walked away as well. General Ethan turned to Alex and saw a bit of anger in Alex's eyes. \"You're still not mad about the amarok, are you?\" General Ethan questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know as well as I that the amarok was not attacking the village. We found traces of dead amaroks in the forest near the village. The creatures parents must have died by hunters and it wandered around not knowing what had happened,\" Alex informed General Ethan, \"It must have accidentally came upon the village. You know how it acted when it arrived. It wasn't harming anyone. It had accidentally crushed a few huts, but it wasn't harming the villagers. It looked like it was looking for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet, the story of it attacking would please Lord William much more, which is why we told him this,\" General Ethan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only you didn't have to make that order to make the story believable,\" Alex commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will speak nothing of that event. No one needs to know how the villagers truly died,\" General Ethan whispered while grabbing Alex and pinning him to the wall, \"If you or anyone else gets the idea of telling...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't tell,\" Alex interrupted General Ethan. Alex hated having to keep such a terrible secret. He never even taken part of the mass killing. He tried to convince the others to stop, but he promised not to tell so that he could live. Something Alex still dreaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's think of a way to get that creature in the cell and in its chains,\" General Ethan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was still astounded by what he saw. The amarok was the size of an elephant, yet it look exactly like a puppy, with the large head, short legs (relative to its body), little ears, the short muzzle, and little tail. The amarok had to have been born a few days ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also surprised Felix that the amarok was whimpering and cowering in the corner of the cage, afraid of Felix. <i>\"This is the monster Lord William was talking about? How could this be a monster? It looks scared and defenseless, despite being the size of an elephant.\"</i> Felix thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix remembered that he could be able to tell the gender of a wolf by the color of its fur, if it was like the gray wolves. Gray wolf females had gray fur and males had black fur. What fur did the amarok have?   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The amarok's fur was white, Felix wouldn't be able to tell it's gender by fur color. Felix became very curious of this creature, never having seen one in his life and now there was an infant amarok before him, cowering in fear. It was quite a paradox that such a massive creature was scared of a small boy such as Felix, who now found himself lifting the latch of the door. Once the latch was gone the door was drawn to fall to the floor, but Felix tried to ease the door down, as not to scare the amarok more than it already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very difficult for someone as small as Felix to open such a large door by himself. He struggled under the weight, but he managed to slowly lower the door to the ground. Nothing stood between him and the amarok now, but it was still scared, not moving from the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix wanted to assure the infant that he meant no harm, but as he moved closer, the amarok tried to move further away. It's back pressed against the wall as it realized that there was no escape and began to whimper uncontrollably. Felix quickly lowered himself to the ground, hoping to calm the amarok down. He figured that if he made himself look smaller the amarok wouldn't be as frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amarok stopped whimpering when it didn't hear the sounds of the human moving around, but it could still smell him. It slowly removed it's paws from it's eyes to see the little human in a submissive pose. The amarok was only an infant, but it understood what these beings were capable of, it had seen it's entire pack die and one of their own villages slaughtered. Then it was brought here. It was scared and vulnerable, but it now looked on in confusion as this one human had submitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like hours had passed to Felix. He lied still on the floor, looking down the whole time. Felix suddenly became scared again. He didn't know how the amarok would react to it's new surroundings once it became bolder. It might even become angry and attack anything in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Felix felt something move above his body. The amarok had quietly moved towards the boy, very curious. It was a new experience to the infant to be so close to a human, but something about this one seemed familiar. Felix felt the air move above him and the sounds of the amarok smelling him. He looked up to see the amarok towering above, it's puppy eyes staring at him. The amarok must have overcome it's fears, but Felix stood slowly, cautious not to scare it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amarok's head slowly reared back as it extended it's tongue. Felix was knocked back down as the mass of wet flesh collided with his body. The amarok was probably not aware of how fragile he was. Felix got up and wiped the saliva from his face, he remembered the collar about his neck. They were bound to each other by their souls, or so said Lord William. But he wasn't a man of humor, he most surely meant what he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked up at the amarok covered in white fur, kneeling above him, now with a friendly expression, but Felix could only guess. There was still much he didn't know about this creature, the amarok also had curiosity in it's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What is Lord William planning?\"</i> His mind wandered back to the collar, now he saw the same collar attached to the amarok's neck, only larger in scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why he want me to be bound to this...\"</i> Felix realized how lonely the amarok must be. If it was just an infant, it must have been taken away from it's family. Now it was in this dark dungeon. It really needed a friend down here. It also needed a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix looked at the large cage before him. It was made of some very strong and powerful wood, but had small holes so whatever was in their could breathe. It was also very big, huge even, almost as tall and wide as the hall he was in, and the dungeon halls were very wide and tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked through the holes, it was very dark and hard to see. He saw what he thought was the amarok, but it was too big,  to oddly shaped, to be a mere infant which is what Lord William claimed. It must be a fixture to the wall or something, but Felix couldn't find the amarok cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix wondered if he should go into the cage and check if the monster was even in their. But if the creature really was in the cage, and wasn't chained, it could attack Felix and kill him. <i>\"Maybe this is some sick joke,\"</i> Felix thought to himself hopefully, <i>\" Maybe right now my horrible master is laughing that the gullibility of his slave.\"</i>   Embarrassing, but at least he wouldn't have to tend to a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix approached the cage door. The door was latched to the cage in a way that it could be unlatched and it was simply fall to the ground. If he unlatched the door, there would be no way for him along to lift it up and latch it again. <i>\"It must have been designed like that so they could just push the cage in the cell through the giant doors, unlatch it and then quickly escape before the amarok could get out of the cage,\"</i> Felix thought. It seemed too well planed for it to be a joke and though Lord William loved to torment his slaves, he had never seen Lord William play a joke on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix saw that the large door had a square hole with bars running down through the hole. Felix had to get on his tip toes to peek through the hole. Felix grabbed the bars to keep him up as he looked through the hole. Everything was black inside and he couldn't see anything. He saw no movement and nothing that seemed like the outline of a creature. \"Hey, anything in there?\" Felix shouted out, but there was no reply and no movement. It truly looked like all of this was some sick joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knew their was only one way to know for sure. Fighting his fear, he walked up to the latch, and unlatched the latches. The heavy door began to fall due to the gravity and Felix caught it. The door was very heavy for the ten year old slave and he had troubles setting it down gently. It didn't work at well though because his hands slipped halfway and it dropped to the ground hard. Felix wouldn't be able to close it again. There was no turning back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his eyes adjusted to the dim light in the cage, he looked everywhere, and just when his eyes were fully adjusted, his heart stopped cold. The huge shape he saw earlier was the amarok, and to his horror it was slowly getting to it's feet. The creature must have been sleeping and the large door hitting the ground woke it up.  The massive, jet black furred (which was probably why Felix couldn't see it well) looked... strangely confused, like someone who was jumped, beat up, then stuffed in a huge dark a cage, which was probably what happened in the first place. Felix stayed completely still as the amarok scanned the cage still looking very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the eyes aimed toward the light coming from the hallway outside the cage and unfortunately, its eyes fell upon the poor ten year old slave that was Felix. Felix held his breath when the amarok started to walk forward. Felix tried to back away slowly as the humongous dog-like creature approached, but he fell backwards and fell on his butt. The Amarok had gained too much ground now, since it was so large, and Felix realized there was no point in running. Felix could now easily tell the amarok was a cub, but it was still at least twenty-five feet tall which did not comfort Felix as the creature looked him up and down, sniffing at him.

He had no doubt in his mind that once the amarok was done sniffing him, it would eat him. What else would such a creature do with humans. It was a giant wolf that more than likely eats humans. It is a mind-less beast that just so happens to be a carnivore after all. With it being just a cub, it might even be worse. Cubs know little about the world and this creature probably would only see Felix as a tasty treat and nothing more. Felix felt as though he was doomed and nothing could save him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Felix felt something large and wet drag across his chest and face. The object felt strange to Felix due to its largeness, but Felix knew that it was the amarok's tongue. The amarok was surely tasting him and continuing to judge whether it should eat Felix or not. The tongue continued to lick Felix and when the tongue began to lick more rapidly, Felix thought that the amarok had grown fond of Felix's taste. <i>\"This it is,\"</i> Felix thought to himself, <i>\"The amarok likes my taste now. It's not going to give me up. I'm going to be eaten and there's nothing I can do about it.\"</i> Felix closed his eyes tighter. Felix shook with fear and a few tears were beginning to fall down. The tongue stopped its constant barrage of licks. Felix tensed up, knowing it was the end for him. However, that's not exactly what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the jaws of the wolf could clamp down on him, Felix heard a high pitched whimper. Felix opened his eyes and could only see the massive pup's head filling his view. This startled Felix and he dragged himself backward a little. The pup didn't try to stop him, like Felix thought would happen. Instead, the pup let out another whine. Felix stared at the amarok pup, and was very confused. He examined the amarok's face and sure enough, it actually looked sad, completely with the irresistible puppy dog eyes. <i>\"The amarok is sad? But why is it sad?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"What does it want from me? I thought it was going to eat me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix just continued to stare at the large infant amarok who continued to whine and give Felix the sad puppy dog face. <i>\"It shouldn't be sad. I has me as a meal. Sure it's just been captured and it's far from its home most likely, but it's just an animal. Could it really understand such things?\"</i> Felix wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amarok took a step towards Felix and Felix had to take a few crawls back to cover the same distance covered by the amarok's leg to keep the same distance from the infant that there was before the amarok took a step. The amarok whimpered in response. Staring into the amarok's eyes, Felix saw desperation and sadness. <i>\"Why has it become sadder when I backed away from it? It must want something else from me other than use me for its meal. If it simply wanted to eat me, it would just eat me and not become saddened about me backing away. What the hell does it want?\"</i> Felix questioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix decided to think about all the facts to try and think of a conclusion. <i>\"This amarok is an infant and William's soldiers have taken this amarok against its will to use as a weapon. The amarok is probably far away from is family and also homesick as well. Maybe even animals can feel that way. And infants need love and care from their family, especially the animals that care for their young. I'm sure the soldiers didn't treat the amarok too well,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it suddenly hit him. <i>\"Could the amarok want comfort from me?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"That would explain why it's sadder when I back away and when I'm afraid of it, but why would an animal want comfort from something that's a different species and prey sized? Is it just because its an infant and desperate? If this is all true, then maybe I can make it out of this alive. If I can give comfort to this amarok, it will see me as being more useful to it other than being its meal. Maybe I can befriend this creature. If I can, it will make my job much easier.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that he didn't have any other options except to give it a try. Felix sat straight up and he reached out his hand. Felix did this slowly, and the amarok's eyes were transfixed on Felix's hands. Felix gulped and hoped that the amarok wasn't planing on biting his hand, which would probably take off nearly his entire arm. When Felix's arm was nearly straightened out, the amarok began stretching out its head. Felix became frightened and back his hand away, which caused the amarok to pause and whimper. After a few moments, Felix began reaching out again and the amarok did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the skin on Felix's palm came into contact with the black, soft fur on the infant amarok's muzzle. Felix saw the amarok's eyes close and it let out what sounded like a sigh. Felix was in shock. He couldn't believe he was actually touching an amarok and it was allowing him to do so. Sure the amarok was an infant and adult amaroks were larger and more intimidating, the infant was still the largest creature Felix had ever seen. Felix noticed that the amarok looked as though it might back away. So Felix snapped out of his shock and began stroking the fur on the amarok's muzzle. It was clear the amarok liked this as its tail wagged , like a domestic dog. However, this was not domesticated dog. It was a wild animal, a wolf, and Felix still needed to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stood up and the amarok laid down on its belly. Felix walked to the side of the amarok's head which was probably larger than Felix's body. Felix tried petting and scratching the top of the amarok's head and its large ears. The amarok's reaction was leaning it's head against Felix. It didn't know its own strength and pushed Felix back a bit, but other than that, did not harm Felix. Felix pet under the amarok's neck with one hand and the top of the head with the other. The amarok rubbed its head against Felix as if trying to nuzzle him. The amarok was clearly happy with Felix's actions.\"I guess you're not going to eat me, are you?\" Felix let out a relieved laugh. The amarok just continued to gratefully thank Felix by rubbing its head against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you like this, I think I know something else you love,\" Felix said as he pushed away from the amarok's head and walked to the amarok's side. The amarok whined and looked at Felix with confusion. \"Relax, I'm not leaving,\" Felix tried assuring the amarok, but he didn't know if it could understand him. If he were to guess, he would guess that it didn't. Felix crouched down and put his hand under the amarok and started scratching its underbelly. The giant wolf pup's tail wagged faster than Felix had ever seen and looked like a blur. The amarok turned on its side for Felix and Felix was able to scratch more of the underbelly. The underbelly's fur was the same black as the rest of the amarok, but much softer. The only white fur the wolf had was a small tuft of white fur on the chest area. Felix looked at the amarok's head and saw its muzzle opened and it tongue sticking out with pleasure. <i>\"I hope I made a friend,\"</i> Felix thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix then began to wonder if the amarok was a male or a female. It the amaroks were anything like gray wolves, then black furred wolves were males. Felix looked to his left and saw that the wolf was... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix's eyes came across a large sheath and pair of lightly furred orbs by the Amarok's large hind legs. Felix looked away back at the pups large head. ''Your a boy'' he murmured. Felix kept on stroking the Amarok's soft underbelly. The giant pup continued to wag his tail furiously and pant merrily. ''If he's a male, then he'll be very large when he grows. Male wolves tend to be dominant and aggresive. Will he be like that when he's older?'' Felix could see why his evil Lord would want such a creature. ''Maybe he'll not be aggresive unless raised to be so? Maybe if I care for him he will not be that aggresive'' Felix thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thought came across Felix's mind. ''Maybe I could escape with him. I'll gain his trust and break out of this place, after all he's an Amarok and can plow through walls. Thats if my Lord was not lying as usual'' Felix was so busy thinking of escape he didn't spot the Amarok had fallen to sleep. He stopped stroking the wolfs belly and stepped away from the sleeping beast. The Amarok snored loudly, the Amarok's loud snoring echoed off the walld in the small cell. Felix was not sure what to do next, he could wait for the wolf to awaken or leave the cell. He couldn't work out why, but he felt like staying with the wolf. Sure it was large, powerfull and only an infant yet it was caring towards him. Felix sat down and looked at the wolf, which black fur blended in with the poorly lit cell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix heard voices from the door. A guard opened it and looked around, not seeming to spot the wolf in the darkness. ''Slave! come here now!'' he hissed. You slowly got up and approached the guard. ''The lord orders you to clean out the stables at once'' the guard sneered looking down at the ten year slave. Felix sighed and headed for the stables. He glanced back at the cell, the wolf was hidden in the darkness. The guard followed Felix to the yard. Felix was suspisous, the guards rarely follow slaves to there duties. Felix didn't dare say a word. He entered the stables to be greeted by a fat lady, who was paid by the lord. She smirked at Felix. ''Now little twerp you shall clear out all the hay and muck and lay fresh hay. No slacking, i'll be wacthing you'' she sat down and looked at you expectantly. ''Where's the shovel?'' you ask. ''Shovel? Ha! use your hands!'' laughed the lady. Felix sighed and got to work. The guard stood in the entrance, the lady nodded at him and he left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix couldn't help but think something was going on... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the cell, the Amarok peacefully slept. Ten guards and the head guard approached the cell, carrying four large shackles. The head guard carried a bottle of sleeping gas. ''Right, first smash the bottle by the beasts nose. Once it passes out, put the shackles on and connect the chains. Don't slack, those who do will become slaves!'' ordered/threatened the head guard. The ten guards nodded and entered the Amarok's cell. ''Good, it's asleep'' said a guard relieved. The head guard stayed by the door, ready to run most likely. He passed the bottle of sleeping gas to a guard. ''Don't fail'' he growled. The guard gulped and approached the Amarok. His hands shook with fear. He pulled himself together and threw the bottle. It smashed by the wolf's great nose. The smashing woke up the wolf. It yelped and rose to its feet. The sleeping gas taking immediate effect. The wolf walked forwards, towards the nearest guard.  It whined and fell over with a loud thud. one of it's legs flew out into a guard, throwing him into the wall. A loud snap of his spine breaking filled the air. The remaining guards gluped. The head guard shook his head ''Fools''. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amarok passed out. the guards quickly attached the shackles and chains to the pups legs. They quickly ran to the exit, also collecting the dead guard on the way out. The head guard grinned ''His lordship will be pleased... with me of course. Now get back to your posts!'' The guards nodded ''yes sir and quickly headed back to there posts. The head guard took the dead guards body to the store room. He had an idea on what to do with the body. He went to the lord to tell him his little plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix groaned as he finally finished clearing the stable. The fat lady got up ''About time!'' she dismissed Felix hard work and walked off. Felix sat down, tired. ''I wonder how the wolf is doing, I hope they have not hurt him'' Felix can't beleive it, he actually cares about the Amarok. Despite his thoughts about the Amarok eariler, actually being with it changed his opion. Felix got up and went to return to the slave quarters when a guard approached him... <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Felix moaned in protest ''I'm tired!'' the guard raised his hand and smacked Felix across the cheek, sending him to the floor. ''Disobient little runt! Do as your ordered or you'll be killed!'' roared the guard. Felix rubbed his bruised cheek and slowly stood up. ''Y-y---ees... I'll feed it'' he lowered his head and walked silently by the guard. He was taken to the kitchen. He could smell all the food being cooked for Lord william of course. He drooled at the smell, he wish he could eat proper food not the miserable dry bread and water given to the slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen Felix noticed a cart with a coffin atop it. He was taken over to the coffin. In it was a body... ''You don't want me to feed him that?!'' gasped Felix. ''Yes I do puny slave. I want MY amarok to get a taste for human flesh. It will make him a lot deadlier when he's older!'' Lord william said from behind Felix. Felix face went white. ''I can't do it! Feed a human to the wolf... no'' he thought to himself. Felix was forced over to the cart. ''Take it now and feed the beast! Fail and you'll regret it deeply!'' ordered lord William. He shoved Felix  into the cart. Felix hit it hard, bruising his stomach. He hid the pain and started pushing the cart down to the cells. Lord William watched him leave. ''Puny slave'' he yelled after Felix and walked off to enjoy his luxorious meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was followed by two guards. ''Little Felix gotta feed the big doggy!'' mocked one guard. The other guard, not to bright just laughed. Soon Felix made it too the cell the dumb guard opened the door and Felix entered. ''Make sure the doggy eats it all!'' laughs the other guard as he slams the door behind Felix. Felix stopped pushing the cart and waited for his giant four legged friend to come up to him. Nothing happened. ''Wolf?'' asked Felix. A loud whine filled the cell followed by rattling chains. Felix gasped ''No! They've chained you!'' He walked into the cell and finally saw the wolf. Four large shackles and chains held it down. The poor thing could hardly move. It tried to approach him, but was unable to do so. Felix came, shocked right up to the Amarok. It lowered it's head and licked him. Felix petted it's muzzle. ''Alright boy, calm down.'' he said quietly. The wolf licked him a few more times then laid down. It looked awkward thanks to the chains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stroked the wolf head, it leaned it's head against him, gentler this time not to knock Felix. ''I bet your hungry, but what they want you to eat is bad'' says Felix to the wolf. He didn't expect it to understand him. ''The Lord wants you to be his weapon, if he does break you he will use you to kill many people. I can't allow that to happen'' Continued Felix. He sat down and sighed ''But what can I do?'' The wolf whined and looked at Felix, sadness filling it's large amber eyes. ''My god! You understood me didn't you?'' gasped Felix. The wolf whined and licked him. Felix hesitated then asked ''Can you speak?'' The Amarok snorted, shaking it's head. ''No, you can't oh well but at least you understand me... I think. We need to get out of here, but I have no keys to free you. I suppose you can't break the chains either''. The wolf whined and nudged Felix towards the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix could see the door was open, the guards looked in. ''Have you fed the mutt yet little boy?'' barked a guard. Felix sighed ''No, i'm not going to feed the 'mutt'!'' he walked nearer to the door and crossed his arms defiantly. The guards mouth dropped. ''What! Insolent little brat!'' The smart gaurd turned to the dumb guard ''fetch the master guard at once! Notify lord william of this!'' the dumb guard quickly ran off. Felix stayed put, arms crossed. The guard stormed up to him and punched him. ''Pathetic child! I'll give you a good beating! take this!'' The guard kicked Felix, sending him flying across the cold stone floor. The Amarok watched, eyes locked on the guard. It raised it's lips and growled, fangs bared. The guard jumped. The wolf tried to go for him, but was held in place. ''Aww doggy wants to help little Felix eh? Well you can't! Watch this! The guard turned and kicked Felix yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix groaned in pain, he was in agony, yet nothing felt broken. The guard went to kick him again when he heard footsteps and voices from the stairs. He looked down at Felix then the door. ''Stupid slave. Now you'll get whats coming for ya!'' he turned and walked back to the door. The Amarok growling angrily at him. The guard found this unsettling, but felt safe because of the chains. ''Stupid dog!'' he murmered. Finally the master guard appeared along with lord William. ''Whats the meaning of this! Slave won't feed my pet and has disturbed MY dinner! Bring him to me!'' snarled the Angry lord. The master guard fetched Felix and brought him, moaning up to lord William. Felix was barely concious, he looked down at the Lords fancy shoes. ''Look up at me, slave!'' roared Lord william. Grabbing Felix's collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked at his master, smiling. ''How dare you! Right I can't kill you... but i'll torture you for the rest of your life! Right here so the beast can watch, see pain, hear pain and want to bring pain! Tie him to the walls then flog him, twenty times! I'm off to eat my dinner, I expect to hear the boys screams echoing throughout the corridors as I head back!'' Lord William turned and stormed off. The master guard pulled out a long whip. ''You heard the lord! Tie him to the wall and let him squel!'' the guards forced Felix up against the wall and tore off his ragged top. Felix was to weak to resist. The master guard prepared to whip Felix. The wolf growled viscously from behind. The guards cowered in fear. ''Fools! The beast is chained! It can't get you so stop cowering... or you'll all be slaves as well!'' yelled the master guard. He turned to Felix. ''Take this, puny kid!'' CRACK!! ''Arrgh!'' yelped Felix, as a gash opened up along his back, blood poured out the wound. CRACK!! again CRACK!! The wolf watched, rage building from within... It pulled and pulled at it's chains... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He couldn't stand here and watch his friend be beaten by those evil men! He was an Amarok, he may be young but he was still stronger than a hundred humans! Another crack filled the air followed by his frinds groans of agony. The Amarok pulled again and with a loud snap a shackle broke off! His growls covered the breaking noise and clatter of metal. The guards had not spotted him breaking free, thanks to the poor lighting and there poor eyesight... The Amarok pulled again and another two shackles went. The guards heard that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''The beast! it's breaking free! Run!'' yelled one guard the others followed. A loud howl filled th air. The master guard turned around ''huh?'' he said, so focused on whipping Felix to notice the commotion behind him. He turned to be greeted by great white fangs! ''Argh!'' He screamed as he was picked up by the angry wolf. It may of been a pup, but it still had sword like fangs. It bit down into his armour and into his belly the master guard screamed madly. Felix could not see a thing, he only heard the howl, then the screams followed by a crunch and silence. He felt warm air blow over him, the wolf sniffed him. ''Don't hurt me!'' cried Felix. The wolf let his anger go, he whined and licked Felixs back. ''Good boy... can you untie me?'' asked Felix weakly. The wolf carefully used its fangs to bite through the ropes holding Felix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix dropped to the floor, worn out,  and in agony. ''We must get out of here, they'll surely kill us now!'' The wolf licked Felix then scooped him up with its tongue. Felix gasped as he was lifted up into the air by the wolf's large wet tongue. It placed him upon its back, near it's collar. The wolf whined. Felix sort of understood it, ''Yes, i'll hold on'' he said. He grabbed the collar tightly as he could. ''How are...woah!'' yelped Felix as the Amarok suddenly burst into a sprint! It growled. Felix closed his eyes. There was a loud crash. The Amarok had ran right through the large door! It didn't seem to be harmed by the ramming. ''Wait.. lord William did say that Amaroks can plow through walls! That was just a door! This guys going to be very strong when he's older'' though Felix to himself. The Amarok charged down the corridor, knocking aside startled guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the grand hall. Skidding to a stop the Amarok looked around. Many shocked people stared up at the large black wolf. The wolf &amp; Felix looked around the hall, it was well lit, great tapestrys lined the walls. There was a fine carpet upon the floor. ''Shocking how pretty parts of this castle can be'' thought Felix to himself. ''Stop the wolf!'' yelled a guard, as many came running at the fugitives. people started screaming and fled, the wolf growled and turned, heading for the large entry doors. They where at least three times the wolf's height and made of the finest wood and gold plates... The Amarok lowered it's head and growled. Felix lowered his head and closed his eyes. There was a mighty crash as the wolf plowed right through the doors, leaving a great big hole. Felix looked back and laughed. The wolf ran on,  throught the forecourt towards the tall castle walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn angry lord William watched 'his' pet run through his castle forecourt. ''Someones going to die for this!'' he roard and stormed back inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amarok ran right at the wall. Felix once again closed his yes and braced for impact. ''He's only a pup, will he make it?'' he thinks to himself. A loud crash and rushing air confirms that the wolf indeed has. Before them streches a great town. The streets are full of people. ''Carefull boy'' shouts Felix. The wolf growls and slows down, to a trot. People scream and leap out the wolfs way. He can just make it through the streets. He occasionly scraped past the odd building, raining debris onto the streets below. Felix sat up, now the wolf was not going as fast. He looked around amazed at the sight. ''I'm free!'' he shouted out to anyone who could hear him. The wolf whined in reply. ''Allright.. We're free!'' He yelled. The wolf howled, breaking windows and making you jump. He had a loud, deep powerfull howl. It was amazing to listen too. ''Wow'' Felix said aloud. The wolf whined in response and kept on making its way through the streets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot one person had been crushed by the wolf. He made it out of town and into the forest. The trees where taller than him and helped hide his great body. Once far enough in the forest. The wolf stopped and sat down in a clearing. You slid off his back and walked around to between his forelegs. The wolf looked down at you, panting happily. He lowered his head down to you and licked you. ''Good boy, now what shall we do. We can't stay here for lord William will come for us.'' The wolf laid down and muzzled Felix with its head. A paw wrapped around him and dragged him into it's chest. ''okay we'll stay here for a while and rest. It's getting dark so we should be safe for tonight. We'll get some food after we've slept'' The wolf whined, licking Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix closed his eyes and fell to sleep in the wolfs soft black fur. The wolf soon nodded off. The forest was very dark. The sky was cloudy. So no moonlight got through. The gods were smiling down on them both  tonight....</span></div></div>",

Despite the fact it was pitch black - Lord William threatened to execute any guard refusing to search for 'his' pet monster. Five groups of ten to fifteen guards patrolled the area. Luckily the guards in particular where very poor trackers. The Wolfs prints where barely visible thanks to the darkness. All the guards had where buring torches, pretty much useless. A group of guards approached the forest. ''I bet they are in there...'' said the lead guard of the group. Another spoke up nervously ''B-b-but it's so dark in there, not just that all the wild animals...'' The lead guard sighed, he didn't want to go in the forest either ''Err... we'll patrol the outskirts of the forest, but not enter.. we can go in once the suns back up'' The guards turned and circled the forest. Luckily, the other search parties that came near the forest where put off by the darkness and wild animal threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was safe, no beast would dare attack a Amarok, not even a Pup. With a good peacefull nights sleep the Amarok woke up at dawn. The sky was starting to lighten and sunrise had not occured yet. Felix was still fast asleep against the Amarok's chest. The wolf whined softly and rested his head beside Felix. He would wait for Felix to awaken and keep guard. It was nearing Sunrise when the Amarok could hear voices in the forest... He listened closer and could hear the clattering of armour! It was the guards! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf nudged Felix awake, Felix groaned ''Leave me alone!'' he rolled aside, going back to sleep. The Amarok whined and with care placed it's mouth around Felix's body. It wrapped it's large tongue around him and once having hold of him. The wolf started to run from the approaching guards. Felix obviously woke up when he was lifted up into the Amaroks mouth, the powerfull wet tongue wrapped around his body. ''Hey!'' protested Felix, being sileneced when the wolf started to run. Felix couldn't only watch as the Amarok ran through the trees, it was very disorientating fo him. ''ohh! i'm going to be sick!'' whined Felix. The Amarok growled softly and kept on running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look! Wolf tracks!''  shouted a guard. His unit came over. ''They lead into the forest! Let's go!'' ordered the lead guard. This unit where on horseback. They followed the tracks into the forest. It was pretty eerie, the horses and guards where pretty nervous.They complained/told stories of the forest to each other. The lead guard grolwed ''Silence.. it'll hear us.. fools!'' The guards finally shut up. They approached a clearing ahead and the lead guards just caught a large black fluffy tail disappear into the forest the opposite side. ''There it is! pursue! Don't kill it but stop it at all costs! don't kill the boy either!'' yelled the lead guard. They charged after Felix and the Amarok...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amarok could see the guards rapidly approaching from behind, they where on horseback and were gaining on him. He couldn't run at full speed in the forest. He could fight but then his friend could get hurt... The Amaraok growled and slid to a stop. Felix gasped ''what are you doing?! Run!'' the Amarok dropped Felix onto the ground and pushed him back under his belly. Felix stepped back right under the Amarok as the guards stopped before the giant canine. ''Men get ready!'' yelled the lead guard, throwing a spear. The Amarok smashed it with his large left paw, he then let off a loud growl and bared his razor sharp fangs. This scared the horses and guards as well. The horses reared up and dropped there riders. Only the lead guard had managed to keep control of himself and horse. The remaining guards fled, leaving the lead guard alone against the Amarok. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Damn cowards.. you will all die! I've faced dragons before! I'll kill you damn oversized dog!'' the lead guard roared and charged at Felix, he knew that the collar between the two meant he could slay the boy and bring down the giant wolf... The Amarok wouldn't allow that however. With one swift swipe of his paw his claws ripped into the horse, killing it instantly the lead guard was thrown off the horse. He quickly got up and charged at Felix. The Amarok was caught off guard and could prevent the guard form charging at Felix. The Amarok growled as Felix had to leap aside to avoid being impaled on the guards sword. Felix ran out from under the Amarok.  The lead guard was now under the wolf's belly... The Amarok simply laid down on the guard, crushing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stopped near the Amarok and look at his belly ''you squished him!'' The Amarok whined and got up off the guard.. who was pretty flat right now. Felix threw up at the sight. ''eurgh! oh, Crap we must get out of here! Those other guards will reveal our where abouts!'' The Amarok whined and laid down beside Felix, waiting until he was on his back. The Amarok stood up and walked on out of the forest....</span></div></div>",

If the slave was going to be taking care of the beast, he would need to know about it first. \"A kitsune is a spiritual fox that has multiple tails. The most one can have is nine, and it is said that these so called Nine Tailed Foxes have enough magical power to be considered a god. This one is still in it's infancy, luckily for me, otherwise it would have been impossible for General Ethan to have captured it as easily as he had. It is still relatively weak, to the point where my mages are able to keep it's powers subdued.\" Lord William said. At another blank look on Felix's face, Lord William had to resist another urge to hit the slave. It was more expensive getting another slave to replace a dead one than it was to waste a few moments warning the slave so he doesn't die in the first place. \"A kitsunes basic and most powerful power is it's Fox Fire. The kitsune can make it appear anywhere near it's body, and can throw it at anything it deems as an enemy. A kitsune may also have a separate power depending on how many tails it has.\" Lord William said before he turned around and started to walk away. \"This is the cart that holds the beast's meal. You will feed it three times a day, and then return to your other duties.\" Lord William said as he pointed towards the cart before he left without another word. After all, why should a lord say goodbye to his slaves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stared at the cart and the door, and waited until the guards that were forcing the kitsune into the other cage. After the guards all left, one of them jerked his thumb towards the door, signaling Felix that it was time for him to do his job. Felix gulped, and started to push the cart into the cage. Felix was looking everywhere for the kitsune, and his eyes fell on what seemed to be a giant lump of white fur. Felix stopped dead in his tracks as he stared at the giant fox lift it's head and look at Felix. It snorted, causing Felix to jump in fright. Then it was making a weird noise. It took Felix a little while before he figured out that the kitsune was laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Entirely different from the earlier humans.

That startled Felix out of his trance at studying the creature before he shook his head to clear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I...I'm to give you food and water...during...during your...um...\" Felix started to say before he came to a problem. Obviously this kitsune was intelligent. What would be the best word to use here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My imprisonment?\" The kitsune said, finishing Felix's sentence. Felix nodded and the kitsune started to laugh again. \"Well hurry up, I won't bite you. You haven't tried to harm me anyways.\" The kitsune said as it uncurled and stood up to it's full height, around ten feet, twelve feet tall. Felix just sort of pushed the cart close to the kitsune, not wanting to get any closer. \"What's the matter? Are you...afraid of me?\" The kitsune said to the young boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-truthfully? Y-you are kind of...well...\" Felix started to say before the kitsune finished his sentence again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intimidating?\" The kitsune said, causing Felix to nod his head. The fox glowed suddenly with a light, and within that light the kitsune started to shrink until it became roughly the size of Felix himself, and sitting before him in appropriate bits of cloth covering certain areas sat a young girl with white fox ears and two tails swinging back and forth behind her. \"This better?\" The girl said to a dumbfounded Felix. The girl laughed a little at his reaction. \"You humans are so easily amazed.\" The girl said before one of her tails shot out towards Felix and gripped his arm tightly. It took Felix a little while to react and started to try and pull the tail off of him. \"Come on! I want to talk!\" The girl said as the tail dragged Felix closer. Once he got close enough, the girl's other tail tripped his feet from underneath him, causing him to fall on his rear, and before he could react, a wall of blue-white fire appeared behind him. \"Now you won't be able to leave!\" The girl said as she used some of the same blue-white fire to sear the raw meat till it was cooked and bit into it. Felix stared back at the girl before she looked back up at him and held out some of the cooked meat. \"Want some?\" The girl said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix didn't see what could go wrong, so he reached out and took the piece of meat from her and bit into it. It tasted better than the scraps they were fed! Felix began to rapidly eat the piece he was given. Felix and the other slaves were only fed enough to survive, and that was once a day. Seeing this the girl laughed, and Felix looked up at her. \"S-sorry...about earlier...it's just...\" Felix started to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never met another creature before that wasn't going to hurt you?\" The girl said, again finishing his sentence for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do that?\" Felix asked her suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what? Finish your sentence? Easy, I'm just guessing!\" The girl said with another laugh before cooking another piece of meat with her fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...um...miss kitsune?\" Felix started to say before the girl looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know that by human years alone I may be older than you, but compared to my race I'm about your age anyways. My name is...well...hm. How would one pronounce it in the human tongue?...Well, I guess you can just call me Inari for now, until I can figure out a way to pronounce my real name in the human tongue.\" The girl, wanting to be called Inari, said to Felix, and he nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inari...how did you...well...get captured?\" Felix asked her tentatively. The girl paused before she said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then she opened up her mouth. \"It was because I...\"</span></div></div>",

For some reason she felt like she could trust this human. Which reminded her... \"You never introduced yourself.\" Inari said suddenly, looking pointedly at Felix. Her two tails had began to wave about behind her as well. It wasn't like she couldn't find out herself, she just wanted to know who it was that would be her talking companion for the next few days, or weeks, depending on how fast she found the person it was that she was searching for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was a bit stunned from her earlier statement. \"<i>She let herself be caught? Just to search for someone? Why would she do that?</i>\" Felix thought to himself before Inari pretty much demanded a name. Felix shook his head to clear it. \"S-sorry. Me name is Felix.\" Felix said, introducing himself to Inari. Felix was inwardly glad that Inari wasn't some mindless beast like what Lord William made them out to be.  Although that begged the question, who exactly was it that she was searching for? \"Um...you said you were searching for someone...who were you searching for?\" Felix asked Inari curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInari knew what it was that Felix was thinking. It was kind of obvious from the reaction he had on his face after she said what it was that she did. But she refrained from answering his unspoken question as the boy introduced himself to her. His name was Felix. \"Felix...that's a nice name.\" Inari said, pausing after she had said his name before she committed it to memory. Then Felix got the look like he was about to ask a question, and she payed full attention to him. His question turned out to be who it was that she was searching for. Inari thought about it. She wondered if she should tell Felix the answer. Even if she did feel like she could trust him, if she told him, it would probably put him in danger if he let it slip. \"I don't know if I should tell you Felix. I mean, if I do, it might put you in danger. I need to know if you can keep your mouth shut, and not say anything about it accidentally.\" Inari said, the worry in her voice apparent. She was worried, but not about telling Felix oddly enough, she was worried for Felix himself. Odd that, as she had only just met the young boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked at Inari as she said his name. A strange feeling came over him when she said it as well. He couldn't quite understand it either, and before he could even begin to, Inari was already answering his question. So, the person she was looking for was either extremely dangerous, or extremely important...if not both. \"You don't have to worry Inari. I know how to keep my mouth shut...I never talk to anyone anyways.\" Felix said, a little bit of sadness in his voice as he did so as well. In a sense, he was alone. All the other slaves were long since broken, their spirit gone, so Felix couldn't really talk to anyone about his dreams of freedom. All that would do would be to get him lashings, as a slave who told Lord William about anyone hoping to escape got whipped, and the slave an extra scrap of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInari looked at Felix as he talked, and his assurance lifted the doubt that she had in her. However, she also heard the sadness in his voice when he said he didn't talk to anyone. This, more than anything, caused Inari to suddenly bring Felix into a hug, shocking him at the gesture. Not once had he been hugged by anyone, and he couldn't remember anything from his before five years ago. \"Well, you have me to talk to now.\" Inari said before she released him and smiled at him. \"The person I am trying to find...\"</span></div></div>",

I was sent here by an elder kitsune, one with the power to foretell the multiple paths of the ever changing future. She told me that within these walls, lay someone that will one day be able to overthrow the tyrant trying to chop down our forest.\" Inari said in a hushed voice, and Felix had a dim awareness that Lord William was also attempting to chop down a forest, but some type of mystic energy was scaring the soldiers away. 'Could it be kitsune magic?' Felix thought to himself, but pulled himself out of his thoughts to listen to Inari. \"The only problem with this person is that the elder kitsune couldn't see who it was. I have no idea if it is male or female, young or old, slave or free. The only thing I DO know is that I am supposed to guard this person with my life, and bring them back to the elder kitsune, or if that is impossible, try to get into contact with another kitsune.\" Inari said, and Felix nodded his head. So, essentially, she was searching for any number of people in this building. \"I doubt you can search as you are. Why don't I help you out? No one suspects a slave, and I have to go about this castle to do my duties.\" Felix offered, and Inari smiled at Felix. \"I was hoping you would do that. It's great to know that there are still nice humans out here.\" Inari said as she scooted back and transformed back to her original, rather large form. \"I'm done eating for now. Thanks for not running away Felix.\" Inari said in his head, and he smiled sheepishly at her. \"You didn't really give me a chance you know.\" Felix said as he pointed to the wall of fire behind him. \"Oh!...Uh...sorry?\" Inari said, and Felix could just imagine a sheepish expression on her face. With a quick wave with one of her tail, the fire vanished, and Felix was free to go. \"I'll be coming back around night time with dinner, so we can talk more then.\" Felix said to Inari as he started to push the cart out of the room. As soon as he walked out of the door with the cart, the guards just looked at him. \"Well I'll be, looks like you didn't become lunch for the beast!\" One of the guards said, and Felix just kept quite. He already knew that they had made a bet, and this was confirmed when a few coins exchanged hands, and Felix just pushed the cart back to where it belonged before he hurried off to continue with the rest of his duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Inari was sitting in the cell, thinking about Felix, and wondering if he was the one she was supposed to guard. It would be great if that were true, but she would need to have proof before she jumped to the conclusion. Just because he was nice didn't mean that he was the one she was searching for. She was certain that she could handle anything these dumb humans could throw at her, but she would like it if she were able to complete her mission soon. Maybe she could also bring Felix with her when she and the person she was searching for escaped from this place.</span></div></div>",

During this time, the only thing that had changed was the Felix. Because of Inari giving him some of the food, he looked fitter than before, though one would have to look closely to make sure of that, and no one took notice of the slaves, so why would anyone take a closer look at one? Inari had come to the conclusion that it was indeed Felix that she was searching for, as there had been nothing new happening inside, or outside the castle. During one of their talks, Felix told her that he had no memory of his parents, nothing from before he was five years of age at all. He had been a slave since then, and Inari could tell that this saddened him, so she was always quick to give him a hug to bring him out of his loneliness. At first whenever she hugged him, Felix was surprised, but he grew to like the hugs, though he wished she wouldn't try to hug him in her kitsune mode. Those usually ended up with him being tackled to the floor, something he could do without. So all Inari had to do was tell Felix of the conclusion she came to, about him being the one she was searching for. It was just a quirk of chance that they had met on the first day, but it was a good thing. Because of Inari being there, Felix had regained some of his fire, and had started to formulate new plans of escape, some of which he told Inari, just to amuse the two during their talks. It was getting close to time when Felix was to bring Inari her food, and she waited at her usual spot, curled up with her eyes looking towards the door, and she watched eagerly, though she hid that well, as it opened up and a familiar cart rolled in. Felix followed it soon after, and something seemed a bit different than usual about him.</span></div></div>",

Think of everything I could accomplish with such a powerful beast once I control it,\" Lord William replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you going to control it?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same way I keep all you slaves in line. Soon it will know that I'm its master and it will obey me or it will suffer a terrible pain each time it disobeys,\" Lord William informed the slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't that just make it mad at you? Don't you think it will want to kill you if it ever got out and realized you were causing its pain?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William looked down at the boy and said, \"Is it you're job to question my actions?\" Lord William asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but...\" Felix began to argue, but when he saw the Lord's hand raise, Felix shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are to feed and clean up after the basilisk,\" Lord William ordered, \"It will need feeding today, and once the chains are set up, you are to come down here with food and water and feed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Felix could say anything else, the Lord left the prison chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix came back down to the prison chambers. Felix was carrying a large bowl of water and one of the guards helped him with the deer. The guard helping him with the deer was Henry and he was one of the few guard fair and nice to the slaves. Felix was glad that Henry would be one of the guards guarding the basilisk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were down, Henry nodded to the other guard and the other guard began to fiddle with the locks. Henry saw Felix was shaking, but luckily none of the water was splashing out. \"Felix, it will be alright. There is a chain wrapped around its neck. It will only be able to reach the light. As long as you don't pass out of the lite area, the snake won't be able to harm you,\" Henry tried to assure Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the eyes? It could turn me into stone,\" Felix argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The eyes have been blindfolded. It can't turn you to stone,\" Henry informed Felix. The door was opened and Felix entered. Felix set the bowl on the ground and Henry handed the deer while saying, \"If you need help, all you need to do is scream for it.\" With that, Henry closed the door and Felix turned around with the deer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cell room was large, but it was hard to tell because the torches on the other side weren't lite, this was probably because they didn't want to go near the torches that were in the basilisk's reach. There was a barred opening at the top of the cell at least a hundred feet up which shined a light from the outside that created a circle in the middle of the cell. Felix walked to the circle with the deer and set it on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix then left to get the water and when he turned to walk back to the circle, the basilisk's head was in the light. The head was far larger than Felix's body and it had the combined looks of a dragon and snake. The mouth was large and was probably full of razor sharp teeth, in actuality, it only had the two fangs. The snake head was on the ground and it was about the same height as Felix when it was on the ground. The basilisks eyes were blindfolded with a large red cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix suddenly became very fearful of the basilisk and didn't move for the longest time. The basilisk kept darting its tongue out and it seemed to know exactly where Felix was. Felix didn't know it, but the basilisk were getting Felix's scent from the air when it darted its tongue out. Instead of that truth, Felix thought the basilisk wanted to eat and taste Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It has the deer right next to it. Why does it want me?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"Maybe it enjoys human flesh more than deer.\"</i> Felix shivered at the thought of dying slowly and painfully in the stomach of an over sized snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix began walking to the basilisk and he kept muttering to himself, \"It's alright Felix, as long as you keep out of range, it can't eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix held out the bowl in front of him and the snake's tongue hit the water first and the tongue began to lap up some of the water. Felix was a little relieved, because it seemed like it only wanted the water. Then as he started setting it down, the tongue darted out of the bowl and ran across his arm. Fear came over him and stood very still with his eyes closed. He thought the snake would wrap its tongue around him and bring him in, but the snake only licked him a few times and then went back to the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix set the bowl on the ground and the snake seemed to loose interest. The snake went to the deer and began licking the deer. During that time, Felix noticed the chains around the basilisk's neck were rusty. The chains could break off with the right amount of force. Felix thought about telling the guards, but all that was forgotten when the basilisk opened its mouth and sent two fangs into the deer before dragging into into the shadows. Felix freaked and ran to the door and pounded on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards opened the door and Felix ran out of it and the prison chambers. \"Felix, what happened?\" Henry asked worriedly, but Felix kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid kid, scared of a baby basilisk whose chained up and blindfolded,\" the other guard commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That basilisk may only be slightly older than a toddler, but it is bigger than any of us, Jensen,\" Henry commented, \"I'd be scared if I was his age as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky for him he doesn't have to feed the thing every day,\" Jensen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The basilisk like most other snakes digest their food slowly to only gain the energy when needed. They only need to feed about twice a week, but since this basilisk is just going to be lying around the whole time, it might only need to be fed once a week,\" Henry told Jensen, \"However, that water needs to filled more often than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix never told them about the rusted chains and Felix forgot about it because of the basilisk eating the deer scared him. The basilisk had enough to strength to break the chains. It was only a matter of time when it would happen.</span></div></div>",

He was still very much frightened of the basilisk. The basilisk, on the other hand, felt different about Felix. The basilisk had licked the air to get the scent of all the humans that entered the cell. Felix was the only human that came in and fed it and gave it water. Because the basilisk was still a child and it didn't understand the complexities of humans, it thought that because the human was feeding it and taking care of it, the basilisk thought that it would find comfort from the human. Over the weeks, it became less frightened of that particular human and decided to try and find comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix finished setting the deer down and filling the water when he heard something snap. Felix looked up and saw that the basilisk's head was much closer than usual. Felix saw the rusted chains and realized it had broken free. Felix backed away, hoping the basilisk would eat the deer like it usually did, but the basilisk slithered past the deer and towards Felix with its tongue darting in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix quickly ran to the door, but the basilisk slithered past him and blocked the door with its tail. Felix thought about calling for help, but the fact that he was scared out of his mind and the fact that if the door opened the guards would have to climb over the snake's tail made it hard for Felix to scream out for help. The basilisk's head edged closer to Felix and Felix fell flat on his butt. The snake's tongue began licking Felix and Felix thought it would be the end for him when the tongue wrapped around his waist and started lifting him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix closed his eyes, not wanting to see the gaping mouth, but when he felt his feet touch ground and the tongue let go of him, Felix opened his eyes. There wasn't a gaping mouth waiting for him, only the head of the basilisk looking in his direction. Felix didn't understand what was going on. All he could do was stand there wondering what the basilisk wanted with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the basilisk began rubbing its head against Felix's body. Felix didn't understand it, but the basilisk seemed like it was trying to show its affection or something. <i>\"But that's impossible,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"It's a giant snake! But then again, what else could it be doing?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basilisk then began pushing Felix closer to the rest of its body. Felix suddenly became worried and thought that the basilisk was going to squeeze him to death, but that didn't seem likely, because it could swallow Felix whole. However, Felix was too scared to realize this fact and he began trying to push back, but the basilisk was much stronger and it pressed Felix firmly against its body till Felix stopped freaking out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Felix was a little calmer, the basilisk stopped pressing Felix firmly and it just formed a small circle around him while nuzzling Felix affectionately. The basilisk did this for a while before it seemed to fall asleep. It had been awake for many days, because it never felt comfortable sleeping in the strange place with evil humans. But now that the basilisk had Felix, it felt comfortable enough to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Felix was still frightened of the snake and he hoped that the guards would do something about it. He remembered that there was only one guard at the moment and it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Jensen. Jensen realized that Felix was taking longer than usual, but he didn't care and didn't check on him. Felix ends up being in the cell all night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Henry. Henry gets worried that Felix was still in there and checks it out. He helps Felix get out without waking the basilisk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice3: Jensen, but Henry comes soon and checks in the cell with Jensen.</span></div></div>",

I am going to go get me something to eat and ended up completely forgetting about Felix. Meanwhile Felix was still stuck in the cell with the basilisk sleeping on top of him. The basilisk head was resting on his chest too heavy for him to move off him but not so heavy that it was crushing him. Even if it wasn't too heavy he was to afraid to move anyway because he was scared of what would happen if he woke it up a giant snake that could eat him whole. Speaking of that why did it did not eat him when it had the chance. Maybe it decided that he made a better pillow then prey, that's why it was nuzzling him instead. Since he was clearly not going anywhere he had no choice then to reflect on his situation, despite the fact he was trapped he was not uncomfortable. The basilisk body was warm, soft, plus his bed in the slave quarters wasn't nearly as good as this if you could even call it that. As the basilisk slept he could have sworn it was hissing but upon closer inspection it was snoring which Felix found adorable. It was one of the few times he has smiled ever since he became a slave. Felix thought that maybe the basilisk wasn't as bad as he believed at first before he followed the basilisk lead and fell asleep himself. As morning came Felix woke up a realized that...</span></div></div>",

After removing the final lock, he opened the door and saw the basilisk wrapped around Felix's body, well outside from the chains' limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...H-help...\" Felix said, tears streaming down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix!\" Henry whispered urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Henry saw no one else nearby. So he carefully entered the cell and climbed on top of the basilisk's body. The creature twitched slightly, but seemingly fell back to sleep. Henry worked his way until he was right next to Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, don't cry. I'm here now, don't worry. Just listen very carefully, and do what I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nods his head as Henry helps him out of the basilisk's grasp. It took several minutes to squirm out of the coils, but Felix manages to be set free as the two exit the cell. Henry reinserts the locks to the door as he faces the boy, sitting on the floor, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, are you alright? You're unharmed, aren't you? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...I'll be alright. Just, shaken is all... T-the chain was rusty, and...It broke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix, why don't you go back to the slaves' quarters. Get some rest, and I'll report about the broken chain to Lord William tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded as he ran as far away as he could to the slaves' quarters. Henry just looked back at the basilisk's cell. It was coiled around Felix, but didn't harm him in any way. It was intriguing for him, but he knew better than to question anything at the moment. It was not his place to question the basilisk's intentions, or its odd behavior. But if he had to guess, then it may have taken a liking for Felix. Henry chuckled at the thought as he resumed his watch.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nIt was on the next day when they attached a new chain on the basilisk infant. Felix would still get very frightened when he saw the snake-like head move into the light. But then again, nothing bad happened the last time. Hopefully, nothing bad will ever happen to him. Felix refilled the bowl of water as he looked back at the basilisk. It was reaching out until the chain tugged it's head back, preventing the creature from moving any further. It began lapping up the water, then tried to move towards Felix. Felix was still scared though, but the sound of the chains did make him feel better. He quickly got out of the cell as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the following weeks, it became routine for Felix to feed the basilisk, along with the other chores he had to do. Work, work, feed the creature, work, rest, torture, work, sleep. But the more time he spent with the basilisk, the more he began to feel less fear, and more sorry for the creature. This caused him to think back to when he was first 'captured' by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just nuzzled its head to me...Even though it licked me, it didn't eat me...Was it...Was it really just trying to show affection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix sat up on his bed, which was nothing more than a dirty blanket on the cold stone floor of his room. The idea of the basilisk showing affection kept bothering him, refusing to leave his mind. Maybe tomorrow, he could try and find out more about the basilisk himself.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nAs Felix entered the cell, he refilled the water as usual. He waited as the basilisk emerged from the dark and lapped up the water. Felix gulped, thinking he has finally lost his sanity for doing this. He walked closer to the basilisk. The creature darted its tongue in the air, sensing Felix walk up closer to it. Felix walked up to the side of its head and gently placed a hand on it. The basilisk flinched at first, but seemed to calm down as it didn't feel any pain from Felix's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have been hurt badly, haven't you?\" Felix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently rubbed the basilisk's head as it laid down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you must be really lonely in here. And scared. Is that...Is that why you tried to get closer to me?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response as the basilisk stayed still on the ground. Felix continued to rub the creature's head, feeling some kind of comfort being able to talk to someone. He looks up at the basilisk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm a little lonely too. That Lord William is no real Lord, but a tyrant. He's tortured us, trying to make us his slaves. But at least we have Henry. He'd never hurt us. He understands us, unlike most of the other soldiers in this place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix began to feel stupid, talking to the giant creature. He turned to walk back out the door. The tugging of the chains caught his attention, and he faced the basilisk again. But what he saw clearly surprised him. The red cloth the blinded the basilisk was wet...And tears were streaming down the side! Felix just stood there, watching the giant basilisk cry in front of him. Felix looked back at the cell door. He was happy that Henry was on guard again today. He could perhaps share this to him. But he looked at the crying snake on the other side. He was just as miserable as he was, until he came into his life. Should he just leave him all alone again? But then again, maybe Henry could share some insight on this...</span></div></div>",

Henry was much nicer then most of the other guards that worked there, he even had a habit of sneaking Felix sweets when no one was looking once in a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix thought to himself \"Maybe Henry might know more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix walked out of the cell and asked Henry\" What do you know about Basilisks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry ponders the question for a moment before saying \" Well, I know that the can grow to be over100 feet tall give or take, are carnivores, and for the most part are solitary creatures. They generally live with other Basilisks until they are strong enough to live on their own, after that they tend to make their homes in caves where they live alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix asks \"Wait, if basilisks live together for a while how do they keep their gaze from turning each other to stone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry answers \" I don't think the gaze works on other basilisks but some people have claimed they have survived their gaze but I don't know if its true. As much as I hate working for Lord William believe me being a guard under his employ is not much of a step up as you think but it beats being another stone statue in the courtyard if Lord William doesn't smash me for fun first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix armed with the new information in hand tries to piece together the basilisk's behavior. sense Felix took care of it primarily it seem to like him that why attack him when it had the chance, it liked him. Another thing is that people have survived looking into a basilisks eyes maybe, just maybe they could choose who they petrify. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix says \"Thank you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry says \" your welcome and please don't tell anyone what I said about Lord William I could get in a lot if trouble for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix smiles \" your secret is safe with me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry \"Thank you Felix, ooohh that reminds me my that daughter birthday is two weeks need to get her something good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix decides too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Lord William wanted to break the beast by torture but little did he know that Felix was going to turn William's whole plan against him. The men started to stab at the basilisk causing it to bleed. <i>\"Why are they doing this to me?\" </i> Thought the basilisk. Afterward one of the soldiers stayed behind to check on the chains. He immediently saw the rust and he ran toward the throne room. \"I need to see lord William\" said the solider, sweat running down his face. The guard gave him a questioning glance and asked \"Why do you seek audience with the king?\" <br>\r\n\"The basilisk\"s chain is lose and rusty!\" <br>\r\n\"You may enter.\" The soldier carefully walked down to Lord William and bowed. \"What is it? Can't you see i'm busy right now?\" Felix was shining Lord Williams crown when the soldier answerd \"The chain that hold the beast in place is loose and rusty.\" <br>\r\n\"Felix! Give me my crown and get me my magician! And you soldier what is your name?\"<br>\r\n\"Jenson.\"<br>\r\nJenson I here by give you a spot in my council and a promotion.

The basilisk was sleeping so as long as they were quite they would be fine. Kulper muttered the magic words and smeared the pre-made elixir on the chain.

Lord William continued, \u201cYou are to make sure that this creature survives its time whilst it is being trained.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster, may I ask as to what a Naga is?\u201d Felix chose his words carefully as he watched the Lord keeping his eye on the cell that the shrieking Naga lay within. Lord William smiled at Felix\u2019s lack of knowledge. It made him look all the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Naga is a creature that has the body of a snake from the waist down. Basically, it has a snake\u2019s tail. From the waist upwards, it has the body of a human but with the head of a snake as well. It is completely covered in scales that act as an armour.\u201d Lord William looked down at Felix from the corner of his eye. \u201cI hope you understand what that means towards the difficulty of this beast\u2019s capture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfectly well, Master.\u201d Felix replied, inclining his head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now as I said slave, you are to bring the Naga both food and water to ensure its survival. The cook has been informed and you are to take any leftover or stale meat that has been given the go ahead. This creature will learn that it will not get much decent food until it starts to show signs of progress.\u201d The Lord explained. \u201cThree times a day, you will fill up the cart with food and water from the kitchens and bring it to the Naga. If you neglect or forget, the Naga will be given yours. Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix nodded his head once in response. \u201cHow long do I have to perform each trip, Master?\u201d Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how long it takes you ,slave!\u201d Lord William spat, \u201cJust as long as you get all your other tasks completed before you retire to the slave\u2019s quarters. The Naga could have torn your arm and leg off, for all I care.\u201d Felix shuddered at the thought. \u201cOtherwise, it\u2019s ten lashes for every task that you haven\u2019t completed past midnight. If you are tired, you will carry on and won\u2019t get to rest until you complete all your tasks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, Master.\u201d Felix nearly whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord William turned and glared at Felix, who could not look away even if he tried. Lord William approached Felix and bent over to stare him in the eyes. Felix froze as all he could see was the darkness that was Lord William. The Lord lowered his voice to a more menacing growl. \u201cRemember this, slave. If the Naga dies whilst it is being trained, whether it is your fault or not, you will die along with it. If you are killed whilst looking after the Naga, you can be replaced. The Naga\u2019s life is worth more to me than your existence.\u201d Lord William straightened back up and turned on his heel before marching out of the chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix watched as the hated Lord made his way out. The chains from the cell were rattling as screams of pain could be heard from both man and creature alike. Felix was knocked to the ground by a heavy blow to the back. He turned to look and saw a cart full of meat and water behind him. As he pulled himself to his feet, Felix saw a guard smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter keep a better eye out there boy.\u201d He stated. \u201cElse, you won\u2019t last five minutes in there with that thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal cell door opened at some bruised, battered and bleeding soldiers clambered out. Felix\u2019s blood turned cold as he saw several bodies being dragged out also. The guard laughed at Felix\u2019s expression and beckoned for him to enter. Felix took a tight grip on the cart and pushed it into the cell. The metal door quickly closed behind him and was left in darkness, save alone for a few torches along the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix made his way deeper into the cell, fighting the urge to run back to the door and beg to be let out. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be allowed until he had fed the Naga. So all he could do was brave it out for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix heard the chains rattle from the distance and saw them glint in the light. One around the Naga\u2019s neck and one around each wrist. Felix reminded himself to be aware of the tail; he could not see any form of restraint glinting from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felix approached, he saw that the Naga was...</span></div></div>",

The main head combines the likenesses of a hydra and a kitsune. The creature's back is completely furred but has spikes along its spine as well.

It has no true title, but the beast is the off spring of a hydra and a kitsune,\u201d Lord William said with a large grin on his face. Though, Felix didn't know what either of those creatures were and before Felix was able to ask, three men came in. They were soldiers, not just the castle guards.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSir, the beast is starting to awaken! Three of its heads are up and trying swipe at our men! Some of our mages have tried to put the sleep spell back over the beast, but it looked them in the eye with the kistsune head and they started to yell like mad men!\u201d the lead soldier yelled out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIs it in the cell?!\u201d Lord William asked, hoping the beast wasn\u2019t loss in the castle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWe were able to get its arms and hide legs chained in the cell. We were also able to get everyone out without an injury, but some of the men are saying disturbing things. My Lord, it might be best to have a healer take care of them before their assigned any new work.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cFine, fine.\u201d Lord William then dismissed them. \u201cNow seeing as how it\u2019s affected my strongest mages, I might need to gather more.\u201d Lord William then looked back at Felix. \u201cIt is your job to feed the beast. Your first assignment will be tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAlright Lord William, but-\u201d Lord William back handed Felix while wearing three gold rings, each with different jewels of varied sizes, leaving a nasty mark on Felix\u2019s face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No buts. Now get!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix bowed, so he wouldn\u2019t get hit again, and left the room. The rings cut Felix\u2019s face making it sting. Walking down the hall he saw two guards sitting in front of the old prison cell. Beyond them, was roaring, hissing, and yelling. Felix keep walking, not stopping to be late to his next chore, when he saw the travel cage, being pulled away from a larger set of doors that lead to the beast\u2019s cell. It had bite marks, and bent bars.  A new monster was in the castle, and he had to feed this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe beast was fully awaken, roaring at the walls in the cell. Its ten heads were mixed: nine hydra heads, attached to long scaly necks, connected to a large furry body. It used to have five heads, four of them being hydra heads, but after the run in with Lord William\u2019s knights they were cut off. The hydra kitsune regrew one head in the battle, but if got cut off again. The head in the middle was different; it was a kitsune head with a large furry neck, thicker than the others. The forelegs were fox legs, but the foot hand a slight resemblance to a fox paw but with long finger-like claws sticking out of it, there was also an extra claw on the side of the paw making it seem more hand like. The hind legs were still covered in fur, but were more muscular then the front. The feet were scaly and seemed to be able to hold the whole body on them, if needed. Two tails came off the body, both large fox tails. The fur was a red that had a darker red tiger strips all over. The scales were a dark version of green that turned red, at the base of the necks.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe beast cursed itself for not having enough tails to distort reality, it needed five tails. With two tails, it was able to move things, and could use some spells that it\u2019s never tried to do before. <i>\u201cDamn these creatures!\u201d</i> the young hydra kitsune thought. <i>\u201cAnd damn those sleeping arrows! If I ever get out of here, I\u2019ll tear this whole place down!\u201d</i> The young beast tried to break the chains with pure muscle, but that didn\u2019t work, neither did trying to chew, pull, or anything. The beast was full of rage for what the humans did, and with the hydra blood, it needed to go on a little rampage before it would calm down. Minutes turned into hours. By then, the hydra kitsune lied down regaining its strength. It muttered to itself, \u201cDamn creatures. They probably put a spell on these chains.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small light came from another smaller set of doors. A large cart filled deer and a bowl of water came into the room. Four of the hydra heads came up at the sight of this, but what was pushing the cart was what got all the heads to come up and start growling. It was another one of those foul beasts. Though this one was smaller than the others, the hydra kitsune knew it was still the same creature due to its scent. All the heads watched, seeing what this one would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix walked into the beast\u2019s cell, wanting to run out instantly, but the door shut and locked behind him. One of the guards had said that the beast wouldn\u2019t reach him for a distance, but there was no determined measurement to its reach. Felix kept walking closer, hoping to be able to push the cart- That\u2019s when Felix heard growling. Felix looked up to see all of the beast\u2019s heads all staring him. Taking a close look at them Felix realized that the creature could eat him in one gulp, if it got a chance. Felix just stared at the heads as he walked forward. Felix thought of all the things this monster might be able to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the hydra heads lashed out at him. Felix wasn't quick enough. All he saw was a blur of white and red erupt from the darkness. Luckily, (though what could be considered luckily when the end result is a trip in a monster's mouth?) the beast didn't bite down on his body, but instead clamped down on him with mostly its lips. Felix's stomach summersaulted as his body was whipped upwards. The lips released him and his flipped in the air blindly grabbing for anything, but nothing was around to grab onto and even if there were, he would have been too disoriented. Before his body could hit the stone floor below, he heard a single snap of teeth and with that snap, his body hit the soft, saliva coated tongue of the beast and slid as its head tilted. He tried to grab onto the creature's teeth, but he couldn't get a grip. He kicked wildly, trying to stop himself, but the rags wrapped around his feet weren't good stoppers. If it weren't for his wild kicking, Felix would have been swallowed whole, because one of his kicks just so happened the hit the thing that dangled above one\u2019s throat. It was extremely lucky of Felix, because he really didn\u2019t even know what it was or what happened if he hit it. He was just trying to stop himself from sliding down the beast\u2019s throat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small human kicked the kitsune hyrda\u2019s uvula. It had no control over what happened next, the head snapped forward, opened up, and spit up the bile and the human out. The human fell from about twenty feet, and if he wouldn\u2019t have landed on the dead deer in the cart, he might have had at least a broken bone, or maybe he would have fallen to his doom. The hydra head was still coughing up a terrible taste the drenched its tongue. The creature had enough control over the head to move it away from the food. The creature left it to its coughing and focused back on the human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix didn\u2019t hesitate, he rolled off the cart and ran for the exit. The kitsune hydra lashed out. The first head strike fell just a few feet short, making a loud thud sound. The second head came down right next him. Felix heard the thick chains and the beast yelp, but he did not looking back, still determined to get out of the beast\u2019s cell. Felix reached the door and pounded.  \u201cLet me in! I\u2019m done! I\u2019m done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only needed ten more feet. Ten more feet and it would have had the wretched human. It clenched all of its eyes shut and growled wanting to pound all of his head on the stone floor they were lying on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and the human escaped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature stopped growling when it heard yelling just outside the door. Using its kitsune hearing, the beast heard what was being said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe beast tried to eat me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think Lord William will care if the beast tried to eat you? That cart is worth more than your excuse for a life!\u201d The creature heard a loud smack. \u201c\u2026\u201d </span></div></div>",

Felix\u2019s eyes immediately moistened with tears from the pain. He kept his head bowed in submit, because the worst thing that he could do was to look directly into their eyes and make the guards even angrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone is going to get the cart. How else is Lord William\u2019s <i>little</i> pet going to be fed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix continued to look at the floor. He hoped that he misheard the guard\u2019s words. He hoped that when the guard said that someone had to get the cart back it didn\u2019t mean him. He wished that he wouldn\u2019t have to go back into the cell and face that monster anytime soon, or ever again for that matter.  But Felix knew that these were only wishes and dreams running through his head. He knew what the guards were really saying to him and he knew that no matter what happened, even if he didn\u2019t have to retrieve the cart, he would still have to go back in to feed the creature. He was a slave and he had to do what he was asked to do. He didn\u2019t have any choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard\u2019s boot kicked Felix\u2019s side.  Felix had felt harder kicks, but he knew the kick wasn\u2019t meant to cause him serious pain. The kick was meant to just get his attention, but that didn\u2019t make the kick painless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you hear me, slave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet up and get the cart back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe?\u201d Felix still wished that he was mishearing the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault the cart is still in there. It\u2019s your problem, slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, I,\u201d Felix looked at the other guard for help, but the other guard just stood there with a blank face that didn\u2019t care and wouldn\u2019t help. \u201cBut the monster tried to eat me. If I go in there-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will eat me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain, not our problem. Why else do you think Lord William chose a slave to feed that monster? Because no one would care if you are killed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard grabbed Felix\u2019s wrist as tight as iron cuffs and pulled Felix onto his feet. With the force of the pull, Felix thought his arm was going to pop out, but luckily Felix only received a brief minimal amount of pain from the pull. But it didn\u2019t end when Felix got up; the guard pulled again, but this time pulling Felix to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Felix would have started obeying the guard with the fear of being punished even more. However, this wasn\u2019t a normal situation. He knew that if he obeyed and went through with what he was told to do, he would die. He would have no chance against the giant beast and it would swallow him whole. For the first time in Felix\u2019s five years of slavery, Felix said, \u201cNo!\u201d Felix pulled back, trying to escape the guard\u2019s grasp, but no matter how far he leaned back, the guard didn\u2019t release him. He just dragged the young slave towards the door while the other guard unlocked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! You\u2019ll kill me! It\u2019ll kill me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting that cart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t make me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Felix could see the large fox head staring back at him. Felix pulled and thrashed, looking away from the terrible monster and towards the only way out of the dungeons. But he just couldn\u2019t break free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard twisted Felix\u2019s wrist. Felix\u2019s legs buckled and he screamed. The guard twisted it more. Felix continued his pleas, but the guard twisted till there was a crackling sound. Felix\u2019s whole world became blurry and watery due to the tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet in there and this time, bring back the cart!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard threw Felix in the cell and locked the door back up. Felix stumbled and fell on his broken wrist. Felix rotated onto his side and curled into a fetal position on the cold, rocky floor. He cradled his wrist against his chest, but of course, the pain didn\u2019t go away. He felt nothing else but the pain. He couldn\u2019t see anything but the blackness the pain caused. It drowned out all his other senses until it filled his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only kept his eyes shut and wished that the pain would end soon, because he knew that he was well within the beast\u2019s range. He knew it would eat him now and that he could do nothing about it. He just hoped his pain would go away once he died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hydra kitsune heard and saw the whole thing. The smaller human, the one that escaped, couldn\u2019t escape the bigger human\u2019s grip. The smaller human didn\u2019t want to go back in the prison cell, it was absolutely terrified. The hydra kitsune heard the crack and knew it was the sound of a bone breaking. The bigger human threw the littler one in the cell and within the hydra kitsune\u2019s reach. The hydra kitsune moved one of its hydra heads to look at the cart full of already dead deer and water which sent images to the main head.  <i>And all of that for this cart?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hydra kitsune focused its main head on the small human. It was curled up and shivering on the floor. Not only was it smaller than the other humans, but the hydra kitsune noticed that the human appeared to be even more different. The human wore dirty rags for clothes. It had long, greasy, tangled hair. The human\u2019s skin and hair were just a dirty and smelly as its clothing. <br>\r\n<i>I put that thing in my mouth?</i> The terrible after-taste of the creature kicked in and the hydra head tasting it had to spit the taste out as best as it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something else other than disgust for the small human. The hydra kitsune felt\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even though the hydra kitsune was a mix between two creatures, both sides respected their love and joined the two clans together just to let the hydra kitsune live with both sides. While it grew up, it saw the joy of both sides living together, two different species getting along perfectly. Now watching the humans with their argument, and heard the bone break it was confused. <i> \u201cWhy would two creatures, of the same species, hurt each other?\u201d </i> Once the foul taste of that human was less noticeable, the hydra kitsune wondered how to approach the small human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was still curled up, letting the pain take over his thoughts, letting him only hope that the beast would eat him quickly. Even if the beast wouldn\u2019t eat him, Felix couldn\u2019t do most of his chores with one hand and would most likely be punished for not being able to do it. With so many chores, they wouldn\u2019t even bother to heal him, just cut him to bits for the hounds, or just give him back to the monster and they would go on with their day. Felix\u2019s hope to live was all gone, because now he was useless, all he was, was dead meat. Felix looked up with his blurry vision at the hydra kitsune. It was spitting, most likely remembering how Felix tasted, Felix gave a hollow chuckle and said, \u201cI guess I\u2019m not even good enough to be food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something caught Felix off guard, \u201cYes you are. You\u2019re the dirtiest thing I have ever had in my mouth.\u201d Felix looked to where the voice came from and saw the hydra kitsune looking down in digest. \u201cWhen was the last time you were cleaned?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201dFelix wasn\u2019t sure what to say. He thought it wasn\u2019t an intelligent being. It seemed to be a wild animal, but now it could talk? Felix then heard a snort a looked up to sees the beast getting irritated. \u201cTh-they don\u2019t let sl-slaves bath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSlave? Aren\u2019t you a human?\u201d the hydra kitsune asked. Sure the hydra kitsune never saw humans this close, or at all, but after all the negative things the hydras and kitsunes said about them and their savage ways, the hydra kitsune was able to guess it was caught by them. But now to hear that the dirt thing in front of him was a slave, what\u2019s that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am human, but a slave is\u2026 uh\u2026 a title I guess. A slave is a person that is owned by some else. Slaves have no rights\u2026 we are either sold into slavery or stole from our families. We are forced to do things or we are punished if don\u2019t do them.\u201d Both Felix and the hydra kitsune stared at the broken wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I here? I\u2019d take it must be your owner that wants me, but for what?\u201d The hydra kitsune asked. The beast knew that this slave had no power to have it captured, but if someone owns this slave that person must also own this castle and knights that have captured it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are here because Lord William\u2019s knights have captured you. Lord William hasn\u2019t told me why he captured you, but I would guess it would be-\u201d Felix said trying to get comfortable or as comfortable as he could with a broken wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsual human wants and needs I\u2019d take it. My clan leaders say you humans only want to beat each other, become more powerful then everything else,\u201d the hydra said coldly, remembering how the clan leaders talked about humans. \u201cIf you had any power, you would take your owner\u2019s power and rule as the new lord?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever,\u201d Felix said without any hesitation, \u201cIf I had power, I would get away from here and try and figure out how I became a slave. Lord William said my parents sold me, but I\u2019ve know he has some men kidnap some children from local villages and towns.\u201d Felix\u2019s only real wish was to meet his parents and learn how he became a slave. If he had the power to leave, he would, but with his broken wrist, that day may never come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the hydra kitsune was now curious about his human. It wanted to give Felix a test. \u201c Well slave I have a deal for you. I do know some healing spells that can heal your arm, but what you need to do is to find a way out of here. If we both escape then we go our separate ways. I can return to my clan, and you can find your parents.\u201d Though the hydra kitsune didn\u2019t want to make any deals with any humans, this one is most likely his best bet to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Felix this deal seemed too good. If Felix would tell this monster one of his plans to escape and they both could separate from each other? How did Felix know the hydra kitsune wouldn\u2019t eat him, or do anything else? Felix had to try and build some trust with it, but how? \u201cUh, Sure, but before I make deals with anyone I would like to know a little about them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrange, but understandable, I\u2019m\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She\u2019s a girl.\u201d </i> \u201cI\u2019m Felix, nice to meet you Marciana.\u201d Felix said, trying to be polite. The last thing he needs to do is insult a something that could kill him without even noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarciana noticed this but pretend it was nothing. \u201cNow Felix, do we have a deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knew that if he didn\u2019t take the deal he would be dead because he couldn\u2019t do his chores, but he still didn\u2019t trust Marciana \u201cAlright, but I\u2019m going to need to find a way for you to escape too. I don\u2019t know of any way for you to escape, but the front door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I see where you\u2019re coming from, grr if only I had more tails,\u201d Marciana growled at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Marciana, what would happen if you had more tails?\u201d Before Marciana could give her answer there was a load knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarciana then turned all her heads to the door, and listened, \u201cAre you still alive in there slave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had forgot that he was suppose to get the cart. He had to think quick, but instead Marciana cover for him. Using some of her kitsune powers she made her voice sound like Felix\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m trying to find it. I think the monster destroyed it.\u201d Felix looked at Marciana amazed; he never would have thought that she could mimic his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do we know you\u2019re not lying?\u201d When the guard said this Marciana got an idea. She used one of her hydras head to eat everything off the cart, another one to remove the water bowl, and a third to pick up the cart itself. Once the head with the water put it down, Marciana threw the cart at the door Felix came in. it shattered into small pieces of wood, but the sound it made echoed throughout the cell. \u201cWhat was that?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarciana, picked Felix up and put him as close to the door as possible, and said, still in Felix\u2019s voice, \u201cI found the cart, but I don\u2019t think Lord William will want it in pieces.\u201d Felix looked back at Marciana, as she went back into the cell. He wanted to thank her, but the guards opened up the door to see the destroyed cart in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guards said, \u201cShit, how the tamers are suppose to get in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one looked at Felix and smiled, \u201cLooks like you\u2019re not going to get to do your other chores until this mess is cleaned up.\u201d Felix then went in shock, behind the guards, was Sir George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the leftover of the broken cart, then back at the two guards laughing at Felix\u2019s situation. George then said, \u201cDo you two think this is funny!? If you think this is so funny then the both of you do the slaves chores, as he cleans up this mess!\u201d Both the guards jumped out of their skins. They looked at George before they bowed and walked away. \u201cSlave, clean this mess and when you finish, tell the guards they are dismissed.\u201d Lord William then walked away, closing the door. Felix looked over at Marciana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was he?\u201d Marciana whispered, making it impossible for anyone other than Felix to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was Sir George; he is the leader of the knights. He doesn\u2019t care about anyone really. He just wants to get things done quickly.\u201d Felix looked at Marciana and asked, \u201cCan you heal my arm now?\u201d Marciana lowered one of her hydra heads next to Felix and wrapping Felix\u2019s arm with her tongue. Felix\u2019s arm started to feel better; he could move his arm again. Marciana removed her tongue and Felix moved his arm around. This was the first time he had magic done to him. It was so strange and now his arm is so slimy. He looked at Marciana and saw her panting a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow what did you ask me?\u201d Marciana asked, hoping to restart the conversation they had earlier and get her breathe back. Felix may not know this, but that took a lot out of. She is luck that all she just has to regain her breathe; she usually needs to take a nap after doing something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Felix was still looking at him arm and wondering about magic. \u201cI think I asked you about having more tails.\u201d Felix then turned and started to work on removing the broken cart piece by piece. Marciana got the idea that if Felix didn\u2019t want to be beat, and then he would have to start working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, with one tail, I could do weak spells like healing cuts, making sparks for flames, that kind of stuff. Two tails and I can heal broken limbs and make strong flames. I can somewhat control lightening, but only if there\u2019s a storm outside. I have seen three tailed kitsunes make small illusions like frog and rabbits and trick some hydras. I\u2019ve never seen what four tails do, but a lot of kitsune have five tails. They can cast stronger spells, and do weird things with reality. Our grand elder have eight, but never uses any of his stronger powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was now about half way thru, \u201cI was wondering, how where you born? I don\u2019t want to sound rude, but Lord William said you were a mix of two creatures. How does that happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarciana knew what Felix was asking. \u201cFelix I was born like every other being on this world. My parents loved each other and had me. But I understand what you\u2019re saying, but just because I\u2019m made of two different creatures doesn\u2019t make me alien, it makes me unique.\u201d Felix finished clearing out the broken cart. Marciana was sad, she was enjoying talking with Felix, and she also wanted to ask Felix some questions.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix nodded, heading into the cell. He wondered if it was important that the beast was a girl. He decided to think about it later, and focus now on finding it, or her, and avoiding eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding her was easy, mainly because she was about five times his size. She stood in the middle of the room, her head hung low. Felix stopped and took in her features. Her scales were green, and her feathers were white. She did indeed have a chicken head, but the beak was longer and hooked, and there were two stubby horns growing from the back of her head. She also had a small, sharp horn on her beak, and Felix had heard from guards' discussions earlier that such a feature on things like dragons meant the were young, because they used such horns to break their eggshells. So, despite her size, Felix thought the cockatrice must be young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought all this as he walked onward, pushing the cart. But what he failed to notice was what the creature lacked: a blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked close to the cockatrice, until he realized he had accidentally stepped over the safety line drawn by the guards earlier. Thinking little of it, he stepped back over while checking if the beast had woken up from her apparent sleep, and found himself staring right into her fiery orange eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was frozen solid, paralyzed all over by the cockatrice magic, unable to move back from across the line. The cockatrice stood up tall, all twenty or so feet of her, and stepped forward, examining the tiny creature that had entered her cell. As it was, she was actually more afraid of Felix than he was of her, because she was so young, eveything about this new place scared her. She seemed to sense that he was different, though, and began to feel an odd sort of desire to be with him, as if he meant safety. Felix, meanwhile, was terrified, and thought he was going to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fear escalated when he saw the cockatrice move her head down to his level. Her piercing orange eyes still gazed into his, but he began to feel an odd sort of sadness in them. The cockatrice looked at him for a bit, but then the guards opened the door to ask what was taking him so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the cockatrice moved her head sideways and opened her beak wide. Felix got even more scared, and saw the cockatrice grab him in her beak. She held him by his torso, her beak only big enough to cover from his chest to his waist, and lifted him up. He began to gain control of his body when she took her eyes off him, but decided not to struggle. He was dead anyway. He just let his arms and legs hang limp from her beak, as he looked at the door, hoping the guards would help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the guards took one look at the cockatrice, holding the boy in her beak and glaring towards them, and decided not to try and help the slave. One of them got paralyzed, though, and had to be dragged off by the second, luckier one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cockatrice, and Felix in her beak, watched them close the door. The cockatrice stayed still for a short while, during which Felix simply dangled his arms and legs, looking around the cell and wondering why the cockatrice hadn't killed him yet. Suddenly, the cockatrice began stepping backward, still holding him in her beak, and sat down at the far edge of the cell, away from the door. She lowered her head and gently released Felix, and the boy stood up shakily, looking away from the cockatrice. He noticed her curling her tail around, and simply watched as it looped around him and squeezed him gently, holding him in place. </span></div></div>",

One of the few in the world.\" Lord William stated rather smugly as he watched his soldiers roll the giant cage to the dungeons. Clearly, it was his new pride. \"It's a bit...wild but in due time, it will learn who the dominant one is. A few lashings here and there and it'll listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix wondered in his mind why William would need a spider. A giant one at that. It was perplexing but he knew questioning the Lord's motives would earn him either another slap across the face or a long whipping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his questions would be answered for him as William continued. \"We've had an unruly surge of thieves and such in the nearby forests and it's become such a pain to punish them. Once it begins to obey me, I'll order it to patrol the forest to catch them. At the same time, it'll enjoy earning it keep and prey by devouring them. And seeing that you're only a sad slave, your knowledge is mostly likewise so I'll inform you on the feeding process. Be grateful, slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix knew well enough how spiders obtained their nutrients but he kept his mouth closed to prevent further punishment from his master. Bowing his head, he spoke through his pursed lips. \"Yes, master.\" Rubbing his knuckles upon his robe casually, the cruel leader began to explain. \"When the spider bites down upon an edible object caught in it's large web, which is as strong as steel itself, it inject a poison into the being. Slowly, the insides of the prey will dissolve into a juice in which the tarantula will suck through it's lethal fangs. Soon, all that's left is a husk of the unfortunate victim. A slow and painful death.\" Lord William grinned evilly as he took his time to explain the process in grotesque details and adding emphasis at certain points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpin-tingling shivers traveled up the length of his body as the words reached ears of Felix. Sure, he knew how spiders ate their food but hearing who it was coming from and the totally unnecessary details made it even worse as gruesome images formed in his head. But that was only the tip of the iceberg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I want you to take care of it, slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny courage Felix had left instantly evaporated into nothing. Feeling his knees wobble, he struggled to regain control of them. He was in charge of a giant tarantula?! How would he manage that?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soldier trudged over to the Lord. \"Sir! The creature has been secured, sir!\" William chuckled darkly as he spoke. \"Excellent...Your duties begin now, slave. If the spider dies, you will also.\" With that final statement, he left Felix, who had finally fell upon the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching them both leave, he saw the soldier \"draw\" a cross over his body. Regaining his composure, Felix approached the door to the cell. \"Food's already in the cell. In you go.\" The guard shuffled out of the way and opened the door for Felix. The boy shuffled into the dimly lit room before the door closed behind him. In the middle of the room, there were two recently deceased deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he turned his attention to the opposite side of the stony walls. The torches allowed him a slight view of silvery webbing in the corner. The web extended into the dark side of the large cell. Taking a step forward, Felix heard the shuffling of a chain, followed by soft steps. Hearing it come closer, he saw a shy hairy leg hover above the ground before stepping forth. Up to the joint, it was easily taller than Felix. Soon, it came closer. In the torches' light, he could easily see the eight glassy eyes of the spider which were a....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix was led by one of Lord William's \"kinghts\" down a long corridor to where the dungeon of the creature that Lord William had captured. Along the way Felix collided into someone, because he wasn't paying attention, Felix had a tendency to look down at the ground while he walked amongst Lord William or his men. Felix fell backwards onto his butt and looked up at the person he ran into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix soon became very frightened as he saw that the man he had bumped into was one of Lord William's best soldiers. The soldier's arm moved and Felix quickly covered his face with his arms, thinking he was going to get a beating. However, the man just held his hand out to Felix to help him up. Felix eventually stopped blocking his face and stared at the hand, it was just so odd for someone to help him up for a change and Felix feared it was a trap. Felix was uneasy and took the hand of the soldier, still fearing a beating, but to Felix's surprise, the soldier helped Felix up and then walked away as if it was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was a very simple act, Felix felt overwhelmed by the soldier's actions. It was the first time in his life that someone actually helped him and didn't treat him like a vermin. \"Who was that?\" Felix questioned the knight with much curiosity and amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That man is a weird one. He is a complete monster in battle, yet he is the gentlest and kindest out of battle,\" the knight answered, It's like he is two separate people in one body.\" The knight reached a door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix thought for a moment and then asked, \"What is his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight stepped into the room, motioning Felix to follow. \"His name is odd,\" the knight replied, \"He doesn't know his real one, so he has named himself after the thing that his foes see last, just before they die.\" The knight lead Felix down some stairs to an ancient and huge chamber that used to be an old underground tunnel system before being sunken, it was at least 300 kilometers below where they where to the bottom.  But the 300 kilometers where submerged below water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeading from where the knight and Felix stood, which Felix noticed was the remains of a balcony, was a long wooden walkway that led to a larger wooden platform further along where the food was to be put for the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight left and returned with a deer carcass. \"Take this to the platform,\" the knight ordered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked to the water, noticing some movement far below. \"Wh-what's d-d-down there?\" Felix asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knight laughed slightly as he answered, \"A seventy foot long sea serpent. You will be feeding it the times a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix gulped, but he merely nodded, knowing what punishment was for him if he refused. Felix dragged the deer over to the large platform, it took him about ten minutes to do so because the wooden walkway was so long. When Felix had placed the deer on the platform, he quickly looked about to see if the serpent was going to attack, but he saw nothing. So, Felix ran back to the knight who led him upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep below the surface, two soulful sapphire eyes watched...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: A few weeks went by without Felix ever seeing the serpent. The serpent noticed how Felix was treated more like a possession than a creature, and due to the serpent liking Felix and liking to have possessions, The serpent decided to destroy the walkway next time Felix was on the platform and take Felix to its undersea cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The next day, the serpent showed itself.</span></div></div>",

Felix held a blank look, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, what is that, milord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lord seemed to roll his eyes, but stayed his hand. If the slave was to be responsible for the creature, he should at least know something of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An elemental is a being with great ties to a field of natural magic. They are very powerful, and very dangerous.\" The man grinned wolfishly before continuing. \"We have captured a young fire elemental,and it will be harnessed for my army. These are highly magical beigns, but they require physical substenance just as anything else. That is your job. You are to feed and maintain the creature. You will enter to feed it three times a day in addition to your regualr duties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face darkened, eyes cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this being is to die while under your care, you will join it swiftly, and painfully. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix swallowed hard, and nodded wordlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" William siad, before his face contorted into a mask of disgust. \"Now get out of my sight you worm. Your additional duties begin tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was sent scurrying away with a swift, painful kick, and, satisfied , the lord turned and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************** *************************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, Felix was glad he had been assigned to clean the library. Lord William's collection of musty, dusty tomes was extensive. Felix could remember his parents, if only barely. They had been travelling traders, and keeping logs and inventory was vital to any merchant. He had been learning the basics of literacy when his family had written him off as a poor investment and dumped him off at the nearest slave trader for a fatter purse. It was a painful memory, but the minimal skills he had acquired in reading and writing were now serving him well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slave had found a tucked away corner to pry open the ancient book, and in the dim light he had flipped through until finding his desired entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"El-em-ent-als,\" he muttered struggling through it. Most of it was words he had no hope in understanding. But the accompanying illustration was more than clear. It showed a humanoid figure, though covered in flames, or spiked rocks, or ice, gazing fiercly at the reader. Felix gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what he's got in there?\" he though to himself, quietly putting th ebook away and hurrying to the sleeping quarters as the sun began to sink behind the horizon, las t glimmers of light pouring through the castle window, facing the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************** *************************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix awoke wordlessly at dawn, just like very other slave. He reported to the kitchens, as per his instructions. Waiting there was a cart, which the head cook loaded up with a stale loaf of bread and a couple slabs of putrid looking raw meat. Felix was confused. It looked a bit of a paltry meal for a monster, but he recalled Lord William saying it was young. Eventually, a mixture of courage and fear of the whip kicked in and the slave grabbed the cart and headed down to the dungeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed down the halls, drowning out the howls and moans of the dozens of suffering souls. A pair of guards passed him, conversing idly as if he didn't exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you Bert, I got a peek in there and that thing just looks like a red-headed kid! Not this monster everyone keeps making it out to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second guard, Bert apparently, shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I saw the group of soldiers who captured it coming back in. Only half them were there, and just about everyone left in the company had scorches or burns on em'. And Jakobs had to help unload the thing, he opened the door and got roasted like a pig on a spit. If it weren't for the mages, they all would've been killed. That thing is a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir opposite paths soon distanced Felix from the guards, and he had begun to sweat, his hands shaking slightly. Finally he came to the end of the hall, the biggest cell in the castle. A grim faced guard stood there, and wordlessly let him in. Trembling, Felix pushed the cart in, and peered into the gloom. The guards had been right. Off in one corner, chained to the wall, was what appeared to be a child his own age, a blazing mane of red hair atop their head. Steppping closer he saw it was.......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix soon saw that it was a girl, close to his age if he had to guess, in physical appearance anyways, he couldn't read the text in the book he had seen the pictures in to see if the elementals aged like humans, or if they aged faster, or slower. But all he saw was her eyes, filled with what he had to assume was fury, before a stream of fire shot towards him. Just having barely enough time to shove the cart in one direction, and himself in another, he barely avoided getting singed. \"The next one won't miss. Let me go!\" The girl yelled at Felix, who was suddenly a lot more afraid than when he had just entered the room a few seconds ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't...I was-\" He was about to say he wasn't the one who captured her, but he had to roll out of the way from another stream of fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lie to me human!\" The girl continued to yell at Felix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not!\" Felix snapped at the girl. It was one thing to try to kill him, but to insinuate that he was lying was a bit much, especially coming from someone in the same situation as he was. \"I'm like you, a captive!\" Felix yelled right back at the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither she was too surprised at him, a human that had hardly any protection or any sort of weaponry in sight, yelling at her, a fire elemental that could more than likely roast him very slowly and painfully, or she had decided at that moment to calm down. Either way, Felix didn't get another stream of fire thrown at him. The girl didn't say anything to him after that, and just stared at him. The fury had never left her eyes, but then again, he couldn't tell if that was just how she always looked. For awhile, there was silence, then the girl sat down cross legged, her back against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph...If you're expecting an apology, don't hold your breath.\" The girl said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Oh great...I have to feed her every single day now? I may as well say my prayers now.</i>' Felix thought to himself, holding the very top of his nose, the spot right between his eyes, as he forced himself to calm down. He had a nasty temper that he only managed to keep under control thanks to his very...imaginative mind. He always thought of ways Lord William and every other person that had hurt him for no other reason other than that he was an easy target, being a slave and all, dying a varied, and gruesome, death. Of course, he has to be careful when he thinks these thoughts, thanks to his mages. But for the most part, he was able to keep himself calm and obedient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna apologize for roasting that guard so you can just go ahead and leave already!\" The girl said, her voice getting louder again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix held up a hand. \"That's not why I'm here.\" Felix said bluntly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm supposed to believe you...how?\" The girl asked Felix, though Felix probably didn't want to know why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...for one, I don't like most of the guards that work here, never have.\" Felix said, hoping that he wouldn't have to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it then.\" The girl said, a smirk forming on her face, as if he couldn't. Felix really wanted to bring the palm of his hand up to his forehead...but he resisted the urge to do so. Sighing he slowly lifted his shirt up, and turned around, so she could see what it was that he meant. On his back were various scars, from whippings, to burn marks. \"Hmm...those burns look like they are about...two months old...some of them anyways. A few of the other ones look to be a bit more recent. Those...guards did that to you? Hm...\" For once, the look of fury had disappeared from her face, and a thoughtful one was on it instead. \"Tell ya what. First off, tell me your name...assuming you have one of course. Might as well get the introductions over with, especially if you are going to listen to what I am about to tell ya.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix just looked at her with a confused look on his face when he turned back around with his shirt on and covering his back again. He was currently trying to wrap his head around the sudden change of attitude that had just happened. \"Well? You have a name or what? You should know that making a lady wait is considered rude in most parts of the world.\" The girl said, looking a bit more annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix. My name is Felix.\" He said, though wondering why he said that was beyond him. He just assumed that she only wanted his name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felix huh? Well, normally I would say nice to meet you, being polite and all, but I think we can skip that. My name is Tonya.\" However, to Felix, it felt as if there was something else behind that little exchange of names.</span></div></div>",

We need to finish it, or did you want whoever captured me to know what we are doing? I'm sure he wouldn't like it if a captive like you entered in a pact with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe caused Felix's blood to run cold. He didn't really know what a pact was, but he had an inkling as to what it was. If Lord William found out about it, he was sure to be killed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hurry up and come over here, we need to officially seal the pact.\" Felix had no other choice, he walked over towards Tonya, and stood in front of her. She was a bit taller than he was, but he was certain that the cage that had been used to transport her was a lot bigger than he was. Maybe it was just for the extra room so they could dodge her flames? \"Now hold out your hand, like mine is, and grasp the forearm.\" Felix did as was instructed. \"Repeat after me. In accordance of the ancient treaty, I pledge a part of my soul unto the other.\" Felix did so, and his right arm, the one he had held out, felt like there was a strange warmth building up in it. It wasn't hurting him, it felt...strangely soothing. Tonya let go of his forearm, and Felix did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now we are pact mates. Whatever happens to me, happens to you. However, it also happens in reverse, so don't go getting yourself killed!\" Before Felix could process what it was that she had just said, she started to pull him with her. \"Now, there are some things that happen because of the pact. One of the most important is that you are able to use my powers as if you had them as well, which means you need to learn how to control it, so that they don't realize what has happened. Easiest way to do so is through watching and doing it yourself.\" Tonya said as she finished pulling him towards the cart that had the water and meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now, while I can create a flame out of no where, you aren't able to do that...yet anyways. As such, you will be needing a source of fire first. Those torches should be able to do just fine. Now, hold out the hand that you made the pact with, you should be able to move the flame. It all takes concentration.\" Tonya explained first, she demonstrated it, then had Felix do the same thing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It's a kraken,\" Lord William told his slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix had heard about krakens from the tells of the sailors and military. Lord William's city and castle was near the ocean and those who would seek the city by either shipping supplies or a pit stop would tell tales of sea monsters. Felix didn't need to be out of the castle to hear the tales and he had heard of krakens. A kraken was a giant octopus that terrorized ships. They would often destroy ships and devour the occupants just because they could do so. Felix didn't know what a octopus looked like since he had never seen one, but he knew it had eight tentacles and a beak for a mouth. Those were the two main things sailors talked about when describing them as well as them having square pupiled eyes and being able to grow large enough to devour a whole ship, (but those were rare extremes. Usually krakens didn't live long enough to become that big.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix's face turned pale upon hearing a kraken was in the large cage that was being wheeled down the dungeons. \"From your expression, I can tell you've heard of krakens,\" Lord William stated while smiling at Felix's fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master, but only sailor stories and they tend to embellish...\" Felix started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't embellish when it comes to sea monsters,\" Lord William interrupted, \"The kraken in the cage right no could coil its tentacles around the high tower if it wanted to, and it is still not fully grown yet, not even close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it's s-s-still g-growing?\" Felix questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and once it is grown and loyal to me, no navy would ever be able to defeat me. With a kraken at my command, no conqueror would dare attack by sea,\" Lord William said. The cage shook violently again and those pushing it stopped. \"Don't stop pushing!\" Lord William demanded, \"Hurry up and get it water or it will die and it will be no use to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men continued to push the cage only so they wouldn't make their lord any angrier. \"It needs water to live, like fish?\" Felix asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does need water to live, but it can also go on land for a certain duration of time. However, this one can't stay out of the water too long since it is still young,\" Lord William answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will it survive down here?\" Felix asked. It wasn't that he was concerned about the monster's well being, he was just wondering what Lord William's plans of keeping the creature alive were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Underneath this castle, deep in the dungeons, there are underground rivers. The caverns are filled to the brim with water and there are many miles of tunnels under this castle, the city, and the ocean floor. When making the dungeon, we came across a large cave with the water system. The room is large enough that the water is an underground lake. This is where the kraken will stay, and the exits and passageways out of that cavernous room will be blocked off, until we need it to head for the ocean to fight. We know one of the paths that leads to the ocean,\" Lord William explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord, you know that krakens can squeeze through very small places, right?\" a person pushing the cage said. It was true that krakens like other octopus had no bones and could squeeze through very small places if it had too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All small places are barred and each bar has dagger edges. It won't won't try to escape,\" Lord William told the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they came upon a room that was deeper than Felix had ever gone in the dungeon before. The room was an extremely large cavern with a rocky ground. The rocky ground eventually dropped into a large and deep lake that filled the rest of the cavern up to the ground with still close to a hundred feet of air still left between the ceiling and water. Felix could see other pathways halfway filled with water and with daggered iron bars guarding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the cage,\" Lord William ordered. The men hesitated and Lord William explained, \"The kraken will be more concerned with trying to get to the water than trying to kill us. Now open the cage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men released the hatch and the kraken bolted out and ran right into the lake and disappeared in the depths. The kraken had moved so fast that it was a blur to Felix and he couldn't get a clear image. The men pushed the cage out of the room and Lord William ordered, \"Go get some barrels of fish for the kraken, slave. It is your job to look after the kraken and make sure it doesn't die. Otherwise, it will be your head, do I make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my master,\" Felix replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will feed it now. Go get some barrels,\" Lord William ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix did as he was told and left to get the barrels of fish in a cart and back to the cavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Felix was able to feed the kraken without any troubles and the kraken never even came to the surface for many months. The kraken would only raise its tentacles out of the water to grab the floating fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: When Felix feed the kraken, the kraken came to the surface and tried to grab him. Felix dodged it though and was cautious when feeding the kraken. </span></div></div>",

However he went slowly and cautiously because he didn't see the kraken and he had no idea how long its reach was. Felix stopped the cart a yard or so away from the edge and watched the water which was level with the edge. There was no movement in the dark waters and Felix didn't see the kraken anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix waited for a long time, but the kraken was still nowhere to be found. Felix took out a barrel and rolled it across the floor to the edge. The barrel hit the water and continued to float into the lake. The only movement was the ripples in the water from the floating barrel. Felix waited for a tentacle to shoot up and grab the barrel, but none came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Either its a trick, the creatures escaped, the creature is dead, or it doesn't know its food,\"</i> Felix thought. Felix became worried once more not for the creature's sake but for his own. <i>\"If the creature doesn't eat and dies because of that, it will be my head. But what do I do.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix took another barrel and opened it. He took a fish out and tossed it close to the floating barrel. Felix stood and waited for a minute before and long tentacle came out of the water. The tentacle was just like the sailors told. It was thick with large suction cup like circles the size of Felix's head. (Actually in the stories that much larger, but this was a young kraken.) The only difference was that sailors would say that krakens were dark red, black, or brown but, the tentacle was dark purple. (Felix didn't know this but the kraken could change colors due to its emotions. The kraken was sad which made it a dark purple color)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tentacle slapped its tentacle on the fish and sucked it down with the tentacle to bring it to the beak in the center where the tentacles were. Another tentacle soon came up and grabbed the barrel before bringing it down. Felix rolled the rest of the barrels down into the water and the kraken took every one of them without coming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Felix was glad it never came up or got closer. Felix didn't want to be anywhere near the monster if he didn't have to and he left once the barrels were no longer floating. Felix didn't stop walking and just kept going without looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix fed the kraken every day and he would roll the barrels in the water without getting closer. The kraken never once came to the surface other than the tentacles and it never once came closer to the edge. It just stayed in the same spot when Felix rolled the barrels in. In all honesty, Felix was glad the giant octopus never came to the surface. Months past and it became routine to Felix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one day would suddenly change that routine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Felix decided to get a little closer to the edge and the octopus ended up surfacing. The kraken was scared making it a yellowish green color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Felix entered and saw the kraken on the surface. It had tried to escape by crawling up the wall to an opening, but now it was dying on the surface, too weak to get back to the water. Felix had to help it, his life depended on the kraken living.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During the weeks the kraken had been held captive, it tried to find ways of escaping. Like octopus, kraken were very intelligent creatures and great puzzle-solvers, even at an early age. So, even if this kraken was only about a year old or so, it still was very intelligent. Krakens also live a longer time as well and have actually survived longer than humans if given the chance, but unfortunately, humans hunt them and kill them for sport and for food. Not many kraken live long enough to reach their full lifespan<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kraken looked all around the lake, but all the crevices and holes it would have normally fit through were blocked. The kraken would have been able to fit through the bars easily, but each bar had razor shape edges which made it impossible to get through without getting seriously cut. The kraken had to find a different way out. Eventually, the kraken came to the surface when no human was around. (It had memorized the humans' routines and knew about the time each human came in its prison.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kraken eventually found an opening, but there was a major problem. The opening was close to the ceiling on a wall and underneath the ceiling was dry land. The kraken would have to get on dry land and climb the wall. It would be easy enough to do so, but there was no grantee that there would be water on the other side of the opening. If there wasn't, the kraken was as good as dead. Was the kraken willing to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was yes, and it placed its tentacles on dry land and pulled itself out of the water. With the suction cups on each of the eight tentacles, the kraken was able to start walking up the wall towards the entrance. The kraken was still young and it didn't have time on it side. It couldn't stay out of the water as long as an adult kraken and the kraken was having troubles without oxygen form the water. The kraken had a strong will, though, and continued to try and prevail onwards. The kraken's tentacle made it to the opening and pulled it up to it. It needed water right then, but when its eyes revealed the other side of the opening, no water was to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kraken's strength gave away and it fell on the rocky ground before the lake. The kraken was too weak, it couldn't even lift a tentacle to make itself crawl to the lake. The kraken knew it was going to die. It have failed to escape and now it was going to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix opened the door and pushed the cart in only to find the kraken on land. Felix stopped dead in his tracks fearing the kraken had came on land to eat him. The kraken's skin was black now and it was the strangest creature Felix had ever seen. The creature had eight tentacles like sailors had said and it had a large dome shaped head. The large dome shape was behind the creature and its eyes were directly above the center where all the tentacles met and in front of the dome. The octopus was on its side and Felix could see the beak on the bottom. It looked exactly like an over-sized octopus, but Felix didn't know that, because he never saw an octopus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix stayed back, but when he noticed the way the octopus was sprawled on the ground, Felix began to remember what Lord William had said. <i>\"Krakens can't live a long time out of the water,\"</i> Felix remembered, <i>\"It's dying and if it dies, Lord William will blame me and my head will be his. I have to save the beast or I will die as well!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix didn't waste any time. He took the smallest barrel and dumped the fish on the ground before running to the edge. Once at the edge, he filled the barrel with water and rushed over to the kraken. He hoped that his plan would work, but he had no idea if it would since he knew practically nothing about krakens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix came upon the kraken and didn't care that he was within inches of it. He was too afraid of what Lord William would do to him than the kraken since letting the kraken was a sure death for himself. Felix had to examine the creature before he could figure out where the gills were. Eventually, Felix found two pocket like shapes where the dome and the rest of the body met. Felix dumped water there and which caused the pockets to move and it's eyes with rectangular pupils to open. Felix ran back to the edge, filled the barrel, and dumped the water on the kraken again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Please let this work. Please don't let this beast die,\"</i> Felix pleaded in his mind and to the gods he worshiped. However, in the back of his mind he thought the gods wouldn't answer. After all, they had never answered before and Felix was still a slave to an evil lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the kraken moved a tentacle, stretched it out on the ground towards the water and tried pulling itself forward. <i>\"It's moving!\"</i> Felix exclaimed in his mind. Soon Felix found himself encouraging the creature by saying, \"Come on, you can do it. Just keep going. You can't die on me, please.\" Eventually, Felix even found himself pushing on the back of the dome to try and keep the kraken moving. To his surprise, the kraken was much lighter than it should have been. (This was mostly because the kraken had no internal bones like other octopus.) Felix also found its skin soft, squishy, and slick. It was the strangest thing Felix had ever touched and he couldn't find the words to even describe the creature's skin. Felix also noticed that the creature's skin turned from a black color to very dark red. (This was because it was determined to make it to the edge. Determination, along with other emotions such as anger, were signified with a dark red color.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kraken eventually made it to the edge and fell into the lake. Felix fell to his knees, close to the edge of the water. Felix continued to look into the water to see if the kraken would make it, but the lake was deep and dark and Felix couldn't see too far down into the water. He had no idea if the kraken was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kraken thought it was going to die for its stupid mistake, yet it did not die that day. It suddenly felt water by its gills and was able to breath the dissolved oxygen. The kraken opened its eyes to see a human helping it. The kraken didn't understand, all the humans it had met were terrible and evil creatures, but this one was helping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human did everything to help it. The human poured water, encouraged it to get to the water, and even helped push when the kraken was weak from the lack of oxygen. Eventually, the kraken made it to the lake and could finally breathe! As the kraken caught its breath, it looked up at the human kneeling by the side. The human looked worried for its safety. The human had saved the kraken's life and it knew it had to repay the human somehow. However, the kraken knew nothing about humans and didn't know what it would want. It also had no idea how to communicate with the human. Humans seemed to speak to communicate, but krakens had a beak, and couldn't speak like humans. Besides, krakens communicated with body language and the colors of their skin. It had no idea if the human would know how to communicate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did the kraken do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The kraken stayed underwater. The human threw fish in the water, worried the kraken was dead. The kraken ate the fish as it normally did, by dragging them down with its tentacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The kraken tried to make peace with the human by surfacing in front of it and changing its skin olive green (the peace color to krakens). However, the human became extremely frightened. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Felix's thoughts were soon answered and two tentacles came out of the water and stuck themselves on dry land on either side of Felix. The tentacles even wrapped around a little creating a C-shape with Felix trapped in it. (Sure, he could climb over the tentacles, but who would want to go near the tentacles when it could grab him?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the kraken's head emerged from the water. Most of the dome, especially the gills stayed underwater, but the eyes where out and almost level with Felix who was sitting down by the edge. Felix was frightened beyond belief, so much so that he didn't notice the kraken had changed the color of its skin to olive green. (Which is the sign of peace for krakens.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix just cowered in fear believing he was going to be eaten by the giant sea monster before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the kraken wasn't going to harm the human. It just wanted peace since the human had save it. Yet, the human was very frightened of it. The human didn't understand the kraken's color change. <i>\"The human doesn't understand me,\"</i> the kraken realized, <i>\"Humans talk to communicate with each other. They don't know the meanings of my colors. I'm going to have to show the human that I mean no harm a different way.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was sitting on the rocky ground with his knees to his chest. His face was face down in his knees and he was praying he would make it out of this situation alive. <i>\"Please don't let the monster eat me. I saved the damn creature so that I wouldn't die and now I'm going to die because I saved the creature. Please, let me live. You put me in a situation that I couldn't live from no matter what choice I chose. Please, if any of you gods are listening, please help me,\"</i> Felix pleaded not only to his gods but the other gods of other religions since he didn't know who was a true god. He didn't even truly know if he believed there was even a god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something touched his back. Felix slowly turned his head to see a green tentacle with the nonsuctiony part of the tentacle touching his back. It was then that Felix didn't mind jumping over the tentacles. Felix shot up and jumped over the tentacles to head for the door without feeding the kraken. Felix made it to the door and turned his head to look back at the kraken briefly. However, his brief became longer when he saw the kraken had stayed put. The kraken just slowly crawled back into the depths of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was confused by the creature's actions. It had enough time to catch him, but the kraken chose not to. Felix knew the kraken was hungry, unless... <i>\"Unless, the kraken didn't want to eat me. I saved its life. Maybe it spared me because I saved its life, but that would mean the creature has intelligence, because most animals would still try to eat you after saving it. Yet, this one might be different,\"</i> Felix began to wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked at the barrels and the pile of fish from one of the barrels on the ground. Felix didn't feed the kraken yet, and he knew he had to. Felix sighed, took a broom from the cart and swept the pile of fish to the edge of the water first. He didn't throw the fish from the pile in the lake yet. Instead, he rolled the barrels in the lake first. The tentacle came up as usual and grabbed the barrels before dragging them underwater and devouring them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix then looked at the pile of fish next to him and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"I hope I'm right about the kraken,\"</i> Felix kept his fingers crossed on one hand. Felix gulped and knelt down beside the edge of the water. The water was only about an inch under the land surface and Felix didn't have to bend down too much as he put his hand in the water and splashed . He was trying to get the kraken's attention and hoping it would come back to him. He was also hoping he had made the right decision and that the kraken won't eat him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes, but eventually, he saw two tentacles shoot out of the water. The tentacles stuck themselves to the land and They formed the C-shape around Felix again. <i>\"Please don't eat me. Please don't eat me,\"</i> Felix kept repeating in his mind as the kraken's head came to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix backed up slightly when the kraken rose to the surface so that he wasn't right in front of the creature because he was still nervous of the creature. It was supposed to be a blood-thirsty monster after all and it was big enough to eat Felix if the kraken would want to. Felix stood still and watched the kraken as it looked at him. Felix and the kraken stayed in this position for a long time, doing nothing except staring at each other. Felix noticed that the kraken was a deep purple once more. <i>\"How can it change colors like that?\"</i> Felix wondered, <i>\"Is there a meaning to its color changings?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix looked into the krakens large rectangular pupiled eyes next. The eyes were very alien to him, yet he found something familiar in the eyes. Felix saw an emotion in the monster's eyes that Felix knew all too well. he saw sadness and depression in the beast's eyes. Felix was to much in awe to do anything for a few minutes. <i>\"It... It's sad,\"</i> Felix realized, <i>\"But, wouldn't that mean it has at least some intelligence?\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix studied the sadness in the kraken's eyes for a long time. Felix had been in the depressing castle under the rule of an oppressive lord for a long time and he knew many different levels of sadness. He usually knew what level of sadness people were in just by looking at their eyes, and Felix was trying to do that same thing with the kraken. He was surprised that he was successful in doing so. he had thought it would be hard to do so with such a different and alien creature to him, but it seemed as though the kraken was intelligent enough to have the same emotional depth has a human's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix found the kraken to be at a level of sadness that matched Felix's emotions when he first arrived at the castle and had become a slave. Felix remembered that day. It was filled with confusion and depression he had troubles describing. He couldn't remember his family and suddenly found himself in a castle as a slave. He was only five years old and couldn't grasp the concept of slavery. All he knew was that people were ordering him to do things he didn't want to do and he was whipped or beaten when he refused or didn't do it correct. He was the lord's property and alone without anyone to care for him or even acknowledge his existence.it was a depression and loneliness that still haunted Felix and now he realized that the kraken was feeling the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"The kraken and I feel the same. We're both alone, scared, and depressed. We're both trapped in this castle with an evil lord ruling over us. We're very much a like,\"</i> Felix understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix noticed that the kraken was about to go back in the water. \"Wait!\" Felix commanded while holding his hands out. Felix had no idea if the kraken understood him, but the kraken stayed put and waited. Felix side stepped and pointed to the fish pile near him. \"Don't you want the rest of the fish?\" Felix asked. The kraken seemed hesitant at first, but two more tentacles came out of the water and attached themselves next to the other tentacles. Suddenly, the kraken puled itself so that it was vertically positioned at the edge. This made it so Felix was facing the underside of the kraken and the beak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tentacle on the otherside of Felix moved and Felix backed against the other tentacle. The moving tentacle set down on the fish pile and dragged it to its break. The kraken then set its body on the surface ate the fish pile under it. Felix looked at the place where the fish pile used to be and saw one fish was missed. Felix picked up the fish and when the kraken brought itself down to its normal level, Felix informed the kraken, \"You missed one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kraken stared at the fish in Felix's hand for a while before turning olive green and propping itself up vertically again. Suddenly, a tentacle pushed on Felix's back and pushed him towards the mouth. Felix became scared and tried to resist, but the tentacle was too powerful to push against. He eventually found himself at the beak and Felix feared that the kraken was going to fall on top of him and eat him like the pile of fish, but that event never came. As Felix waited and breathed heavily in a panicked state, the kraken just stayed in its position with its beak open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nothing had happened for a long time, Felix began to realize the kraken was not going to eat him. <i>\"It... It just wants me to feed it the fish,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"Maybe it's because it would have troubles finding one fish and it would have to be out of the water longer than it needed to be. Or Maybe, it's a sign of trust. Maybe it's showing me it wouldn't harm me.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason was, Felix threw the fish in the kraken's beak and the beak slowly closed and the tentacle moved away from Felix's back. Felix backed away quickly and the kraken lowered itself down with only two tentacles on land. What did Felix do?</span></div></div>",

Felix stood in silence for a long time and stared back into the eyes. Again he saw the deep depression and loneliness in the creature's eyes and Felix felt sorry for it. <i>\"The kraken obviously has some sort of intelligence,\"</i> Felix thought, <i>\"It shows emotions and it seems to be grateful for me saving it. Maybe if I keep being kind to it, I can befriend the creature.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping Felix was right in his beliefs, Felix walked closer to the kraken's head which was suspended in the water by the edge. Eventually, Felix was at the edge and he knelt down so that he was pretty much eye level with the giant octopus. The creature just continued to stare at him with its sad eyes. Felix took a deep breath and placed his hand on the octopus's head. Felix then began to pet it, hoping it would comfort the kraken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did more than just comfort the kraken. It had been without friends and without anyone to care for it ever since it had been captured. Now, it had finally met a human that seemed to be willing to be friends. The kraken was happier than it had ever been in its whole life and it turned aqua green. The emotion that corresponded with the color was emotional healing and protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was surprised to see the color of the kraken's skin to change as soon as he began rubbing the strange and slightly slimy skin. It changed to a color he had never seen the kraken change to before, aqua green. Felix looked into the eyes of the octopus to see its eyes were filled with a happiness and hope Felix never thought was possible. Felix was glad to see the kraken happy and didn't notice the tentacle come up behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tentacle suddenly wrapped around Felix's body firmly and quickly pushed him over the edge. Felix began to panic and thought the kraken had fooled him and was going to eat him, but his body never hit water to go under to where the beak was. Instead, Felix found himself pressed against the kraken just below the eyes. Felix was pressed into the soft and mussy surface while the tentacle was wrapped around him with the suction cups pressed against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix was frightened at first, but when the kraken did nothing else, Felix began to realize the kraken was hugging him. Felix looked up at the eyes and his thoughts were confirmed. The kraken's eyes were still filled with joy and were actually tearing up. Felix didn't think octopus had tear ducts to produce the tears. Yet, somehow the kraken was crying out of joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix gave the kraken a friendly smile before freeing one of his arms and petting the kraken. \"It will be alright,\" Felix assured the kraken that held him tight, \"I'll be here for you and I'll be your friend.\" Felix still didn't know if the kraken understood him, but he said it anyway. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIt\u2019s a sea serpent.\u201d Lord William said plainly.  Felix went wide eyed knowing a little of sea serpents.  Lord William saw his reaction and smiled do to it.  \u201cI take it you know of such monsters?\u201d William asked Felix.  \u201cYe. yes sir.\u201d Felix replied quickly not wanting to be punished for the simplest of things.  Felix did in fact know of sea serpents.  He know because of one the other slaves, Colt.  Colt was a slave longer then Felix, was two years older then Felix.  Colt was also huge for his age too, Colt having two feet on Felix.  Colt and his family were from across the seas and just a mile or so away from shore, the Boat Colt was on was attacked by none other then a massive sea serpent.  Not going in to details just because it was so horrifying, Colt with what could only be his mother were the only ones to live.  Traumatized, the two made it to shore, only to find Lord William watching the whole thing.  In fact it was here when William thought to attain such a beast for his own and mold it for his dreams.  When Colt and his mother came to the beach, William acted like he was going to help them but shortly after, Kill Colt\u2019s mother, right in front of him.  Colt then was taken form the Lord and made to be a slave.  A few years later Colt met Felix.  Colt didn\u2019t talk to him at first but slowly became friends with each other, and making sure it was a secret do to Lord William\u2019s so called rules.  Colt told Felix his story after a while.  That\u2019s why Felix was fearful right now.  Oh, and it goes without saying, Colt Hates William, greatly.  While Felix was in thought, Lord William slapped him to get his attention. \u201cBoy!\u201d Felix quickly looked at William.  \u201cYour totally worthless to me.  This is why you have the job of feeding this monster, or hell, just throw yourself to it, that will do as well.\u201d Lord William laughed as a group of guards came from the door of the serpent.  There were eight, all with newly developed scares all over them.  Three were being carried, dead.  \u201cWhy did you bring them back!\u201d William barked. The soldiers just looked down and the ones holding the dead, through them back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a minute later when a cart arrived with rare meat.  \u201cSlave, this job doesn\u2019t mean your other chores are negated you know.\u201d William said motioning to the meat then the door.  Felix know right away and not wanting any pain to fall onto him, quickly grabbed the cart and dashes though the door.  Inside was a massive room with a almost equally massive hole in frond to Felix.  The room was light up by no more then a few torches.  Felix wondered on what to do now.  He slowly walked up to the hole and stopped at the edge.  He found a pebble, picked it up and throw it in.  it was a full ten counts when Felix finally heard a small splash.  \u201cAbout five floors.\u201d he thought to himself.  He then heard something he didn\u2019t want to. A howling screech of a roar, making the ground shack a little and that made Felix\u2018s ears nearly go deaf. In a panic, Felix threw the cart in with the meat, simply not wanting to die. H then ran out of the room not thinking on what he just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone heard the roar of the beast and all but Lord William shuttered.  William then saw his Slave come out without the cart, the only one he had to stair.  William grabbed Felix neck before Felix had a chance to run and squeezed. \u201cBoy\u201d he said coldly. \u201cWhere is my cart?\u201d William loosened his grip just enough to let his Slave speak. \u201cI, I, I\u2019m sorry, mast, master. Ple, please don\u2019t make me go\u2026\u201d Felix was cut out do to William squeezing tighter again. \u201cSlave, one of three thing will happen on.  You either get it back, die trying or hale the meat yourself, after twenty or so lashes.\u201d William let go.  Felix gasped for breath for a moment then said \u201cI\u2019ll take it myself master.\u201d Lord William just gave Felix a look of disapproval. \u201cYour more afraid of the beast then me?\u201d Felix gulped knowing what ever he said from here on was wrong. \u201cY-yes, I am\u201d Felix said nervously. William didn\u2019t do anything to him surprisingly, all he did was smile as he mumbled \u201cand it isn\u2019t even fully grown.\u201d  Felix heard that and shuttered at the thought. \u201cGuards!\u201d William yelled. A pair of them grabbed Felix and  went to the torture champers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt fifteen Felix finally getting the thought, lingering within him, that he was stuck as a slave for the rest of his life.  Five years of feeding the monster, caring the food himself, talking the Colt about it, and avoiding as much pain as he could.  Lord William getting impatient because he so far hasn\u2019t broke the monster yet.  Colt had the idea that in wasn\u2019t a sea serpent at all but something else entirely. Through out theses five long years, Felix noticed that people were going missing, thee it be Slave or soldier.  More came in there places but none of them came back to where ever they went to in the first place.  He also notice that his cargo of meat was getting heavier and heavier, by this point the was dragging it on the floor with  three rather large sakes.  He had to pull one at a time, they were so big.  This in turn made him stronger but at the same time, made him sometimes late to do his other duties.  William made sure that no one helped him either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix, having left two of the sake next to the monster\u2019s door, do to William torturing the beast at the time, just came back with the third and sat down on the other wall away from the door, just in case.  Sure enough a few minutes after, the door slammed open and William storming out.  He walked right past Felix, paying no mind to him at all.  He was pissed about something. Two guard soon followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix got up and pulled all three sakes inside the room, untied the opening in each and one by one, dumped the contents in the giant hole in the floor, making sure not to drop the sakes.  Through out the years Felix became more and more curious but fear always stopped him.  Now however, that didn\u2019t stop him from finally picked over the edge.  He saw nothing but darkness.  He lead over a little more to see if he could see anything at all.  Suddenly the ground shuck from under him, cussing to hop a little but the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelix now hanging on to dear life felt his one hand that somehow grabbed the edge, slipping.  Before he could get his other hand up and grab anything, his other, slipped out entirely.  Felix started counting knowing it was ten counts before his death.  As he counted he couldn\u2019t help but to think on his life.  He easterly accepted death.  Not much of a life.  As he reached one, he was shocked to feel himself splash into the water.  He struggled but quickly got his head above water, but it didn\u2019t last.  This was the first time Felix was ever in a pool of water, he didn\u2019t know how to swim.  He was drowning.  After thirty second of struggling, he found it pointless,  he was going to die one way or the other.  Just then Felix felt land and it was rising.  The mass of land broke through the skin of the water and continued to rise.  Felix fell on his back because of the sudden force.  \u201cOh Shit\u201d Felix thought as he flipped around to see a pair of huge dragon-like eyes looking at him.  Felix then jolted backwards almost falling off the edge of it\u2019s snout. \u201cOH SHIT!\u201d he thought again.  The part Felix was on, was it\u2019s snout, and it\u2019s was able to swallow him alive if it wanted to.  The beast must have turned it\u2019s head a little because Felix felt the land he was on tilt enough to make Felix slide a little.  It was like this for a moment but the monster straitened it\u2019s head then soon after started bobbing it\u2019s head coursing Felix fly a little then slam down rather hard on the creature\u2019s snout, over and over.  Felix managed to grab hold and held on tightly.  It soon stopped after that.  Felix in lots of pain kept his grasp and closed his eyes, not wanting to know how he was going to die.  That\u2019s when the beast started to shake it\u2019s head violently.  It cursed Felix to let go almost instantly, smashing him into a wall, coughing up a little blood.  He then felt himself fall on the ground, stone this time.  He looked to his left and found stairs.  He also found hope of survival.  He pushed himself up with shier willpower  and slowly went to the stairs, the monster coming ever so closer.  Felix tried to speed up but couldn\u2019t do to pain through out his body.  It stopped in it track when Felix heard the voice of William. \u201cBoy! You have better not have feed it yet.\u201d  His voice echoed all the way down.  It was quite for a second when Felix saw the monster flee under water and William continuing. \u201cDamn it.  Looks like he fell in\u2026 oh well. No big loss. I was wondering when this would have happen.  I also ask myself, why is it so hard to brake a Leviathan?\u201d Felix waited for a moment, his eyes shown realization, when he heard the door slam from William\u2019s retreat.  Felix looked up then to the waters. \"Oh, Shit...\" he said out loud. Felix thought on his options then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On one hand I go up and face Lord William and his wrath,  Well on the other hand I stay down here with the...\" He gulped. \"the Leviathan...\" Felix sat down. \"Wait, its a Leviathan?, what I know on them is that they can whip out armies in seconds, this one must be a child, wait! a child, must have been just trying to play with me, wait, why?, its been down here and tortured for the last five year.  But then again... Damn it! what Am I thinking!, I'm dead either way!, What the hell can I do damn it! I don't know which one's worse. Hell!\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Okay. I just saw a trailer for a videogame that was made public three days ago. Well, three days ago today which is 5-21-09. The trailer was of Team Ico's next game. The trailer alone inspired me to think up this interactive. I don't want it to be like the game and I don't even know if this is the main primiss of the game since I've only seen a trailer. If you're intrested in the trailer look up Project Trico on youtube and you'll find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe story of this interactive:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young ten year old slave is trapt into servitude for a nasty and evil lord who is very power hungry. One day, the lord's men captured something alive and very large. The creature is chained up in the prison cells and put in a dark and uncomfortable place. Feeding the creature becomes one of the young slaves many jobs, but the slave is very afraid of what the creature might be and only tosses the food in the room without looking at the creature. Little does the slave know that the creature is a mythical creature that may be the size of an elephant now, but it is only an infant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I end up deleting or editing a page I will always explain why I've done so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. I have no problems with violence, but please keep the fetishes away. Crushing and eating people is fine, because it is a giant mythical creature, but the creature and the characters shouldn't be turned on by such an act and the boy and creature can't do anything sexual, because he's only ten and the creature's an infant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. I've had some problems with chapter additions beening too short. You see, there is a limit of chapters per storyline. I didn't even know about this till I created Outcast, but there is a limit and having many short chapters only brings a story closer to the limit with little action involved. So, if you wish to know about how long I would like chapters to be, take a look at the first chapter which is slightly longer than the mimimun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Another thing is that the creature imprisoned needed for be a child or younger. The story is not meant for the creature to be much older than Felix who is ten. So, about 12 or younger it about the age limit. The creature should be preferably an infant to its kind. So, creatures with longer lifespans than humans, like dragons, could be about ten years of age but an infant to its kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. If you choose to add to the Felarya creatures, read about Felarya and the creature you choose.  <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.felarya.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.felarya.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page</a> (Be warned though, the sight has nudity and vore) The story doesn't take place in Felarya, but the creature (if you choose a Felarya creature), is from Felarya and will have the qualities of that species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. There are a few things that some people seem to forget after the first chapter. (This is most likely because after the first chapter, the reader gets to choose what kind of monster the creature is and it could get to a point were the choice is a good length away from the first chapter.) So, here are the two things. #1. The creature was rolled into the dungeons by a large wooden cages meant for elephants. This means that the creature is very large and since it is an infant to its kind from rule 3, the creature option has to be a large creature. Otherwise there wouldn't have been any need for such a large cage. Size changing creatures are an exception to this rule. #2. Though the creature comes in this cage, it is stored into a large cell made of stone and concrete with only two ways in, The large door used to push the cage in and the human door. Some people seem to believe the elephant cage is the creature's cell, but it is only the transport to its cell. Those were just two things I'd like to clear up if I didn't make it clear enough in the first chapter.</td>",
