The man was barely the size of a hair's breadth, and many times lighter, and so she noticed nothing as her foot became the ceiling of his world, lording over him like some fleshy sky of pink, and looking soft for a moment, until it drew closer, and he could make out every line, every curve of her flesh. It was not a good feeling for him, for his world sailed down, and he was sure he would be crushed, but as the weight of the goddess settled over him, the carpet fibers beneath, bigger than sky scrapes bending under her titanic mass, he found that he was saved by the sock which held him tight. Of course, then, the world rose again, and he found the air torn from his lungs, as the foot shot upward and away from him, before it halted, and he was literally tossed against it, the sock rubbing him into that warm skin, letting him feel it as if it was his own, before it feel again, and pressed him hard into it, thought at his insignificant size, he made not even the slightest impression in her, as he fell towards the earth, and then into blackness. The smell was overpowering, and the heat even more so. He could actually smell her sweating already, as the black confines of a shoe closed around his world, sealing him in with the scrap of lace against lace, and then finally moving upward again. He would be trapped, at least for the day, if not forever, an unnoticed speck beneath the foot of a goddess.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't enough to make her look thought, as she snuggly fit the footwear over her socked foot and then started to walk. Of course, to you, that tickle feeling was taking everything you had, as you pounded on the soft skin above you, the tiny arms pressing and poking at it, trying to force her to notice you, just like you had been most of the day. Not too weird, really, considering what had been going on the last few days. You had been one of the people selected for a random study, taken from your home and then given a new drug to test out. A sort of energy booster, you weren't supposed to have to sleep once you took it, or eat, or anything else. You were supposed to be able to work constantly, without getting tired or hungry, though thirst was still an issue. It had been great at first, being able to do everything you loved, constantly. Then you'd noticed something odd. The world seemed to be getting bigger. But it had been so slow. In a week you hadn't lost more than an inch, but then, the process began to speed up, and three weeks after the study you were sent home. You couldn't sleep, despite being told it would wear off. You then noticed that the shrinking was accelerating. In one day you lost a foot. In another two, you were an inch tall. Of course, the day before you had left your home, trying to get some help, but you lived alone in the country, and at your size it had taken almost the whole day to get to your neighbors. When you did, you ended up in the room of their teenage daughter, finding her to be quite a looker as you tumbled into her room through her window. You had then fallen asleep in a pile of soft clothes, exhausted. You were woken only by her putting on the sock you were on, and then spent the day in school with her, getting tossed about with every step. Every motion of her foot taking you around the bend, trying to squash you flat. Not that you noticed too much, as the world moved violently around you. Still, the softness of her skin, and the sock, cushioned you, and you survived until now, when she was changing out of her normal shoes, into gym ones, freeing you long enough to pound against her toe. The pounding did little good, though, as she merely shrugged you off as some odd bit of air, and then started to run, and your day began to really go to pot. You wondered, idly, if you would survive, but were then knocked out as she started jumping jacks. You were crushed flat by her second jump.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The wolf smiled as the kitsune's ass resisted his attempts to penetrate it with the long metal rod for a few moments. Not that such resistence would succeed. It was doomed to failure now, at this point. Her only chance of getting away had passed by the moment he'd bound her, ankles and wrists tied together with a bit of plastic wire, which were so tight they were cutting into her a bit, blood flowing down her hands and feet. Smiling at that, he licked at the trickles of red on her footpads. She actually chuckled a little, involuntairily, at least one would think so from the tears running down her eyes. She obviously felt the poker end of the spit sticking up her bum, not yet pressing far in, but hanging there, waiting for that moment. The wolf didn't make he wait long, however, as he felt her loosen up, the giggle running through her body taking the tension off her muscles for a moment, an allowing him to almost effortlessly skewer her with the spit rod. It tore through her body without effort, not even her organ providing a resistance for the wolf's strength as he pushed the sharp metal rod through her, into her body, and then jammed down on it hard, cutting through her throat, and causing her voice to let out one last gurgling cry before the sharp end came out of her mouth. Smiling, he then placed the spit on top of the roasting pools, a nice warm fire already going between them, causing her flesh to warm nicely as he let her sit there for a moment. She was alive, despite the loss of many internal organs, and for a while she probably wondered how this was possible,  though only the wolf could have explained it. After a few moments of the agony of her life, however, as the blood flowed out of her mouth and rear, any thoughts in her head were gone, as she only prayed for it all to end, and for something to kill her. The wolf wasn't about to let his meal slip away, however, and slowly began to spin the kitsune around on the spit, making her cook evenly, as he gently moved a brush covered in sauce over her fur, which caused her to tingle in the open air, but then burn as the flames licked at it, the liquid taking the heat in better than her fur, scalded against her skin, and making her whimper in pain as he made sure he gave her whole body a nice, even coating. He wasn't done though, for the instant she felt him finish with the brush, he picked up a shaker, and started to dash her with its contents. This was an action even worse than the sauce, for though the sauce only burned in the fire, this stuff popped and melted as it touched the liquid, creating white hot points of pain everywhere it touched, making her tears redouble in effort, forcing the wolf to redo the sauce around her eyes many times, getting some of it in them, before he finally saw her run out of tears, and nod. This was obviously some kind of signal to him, as he choose that instant to pull her off the two rods, holding the spit in front of him as he licked his lips, and then opened wide, allowing her to slowly slip off it into his mouth face first. Her view of the world was soon dark, as she became a meal to the wolf, who's throat bulged around her, allowing her to slip down into his gullet without a swallow, somehow staying open, his breathing blowing around her like a sharp biting wind as the walls pressed against her sore skin, making her squirm as felt the pain redouble inside her, the spit slowly coming out of her body, before, she was at last, free of it, and allowed to slump forward, slipping down into the belly of the wolf, which was soon nice and round, the outline of the kitsune girl lost in his gut, which he gently stroked as it began to gurgle and churn, Leshana not allowed to die, even as her body was ripped apart by the digestive juices of the lupine stomach.</span></div></div>",

That was uncalled for, especially from some rat, and she swished her tail in his face before walking away. Had she or the rat been more attentive, they might have noticed the tiny catboy who had been substituted for a real hotdog, Lucky having been shrunk and sleeping in a tree over the cart a few minutes ago when a blast of wind had swept him off his perch, and caused him to fall unnoticed inside the cart. As it was, he had gone unnoticed as the tongs of the rat had grabbed him, and stuffed him in a bun. Before he could protest, of course, the rat had squirted him with ketchup, making a pass at his dog customer, and then getting paid with a fierce growl. So, the dog girl had walked away, grumbling under he breath as she held a tiny catboy in a bun in her hand. Not even looking at him, she opened her mouth wide, giving him a good view into her mouth as she moved him completely inside, stuffing him into her maw, and then snapping it shut around him, her fangs almost tearing into his body but literally just missing. Sealed inside her hot, humid maw, the catboy couldn't breath, let alone shout out for help, and then, without even chewing him, her head tilted back, and she swallowed, a huge lump moving down her neck, and vanishing soon into her chest, as she put her headphones back on, and started to jog again. Inside, Lucky was tossed about as his devourer began to jog, and he dropped right into a pool of active stomach juices, his body stinging as it fell inside. But, of course, with the jolting motion of the dog girl around him, he couldn't get at the walls to pound on them, to tell her that she had eaten him, and so, as the hotdog bun sank into the acids, his followed, his cries of anguish lost in her music, as his body dissolved inside her belly, the walls moving in sharply to cause the acids to fill the chamber, and making him become nothing but a lump of unidentified mass, his mind barely having time to process pain, before he begins to drain into her intestine. Over the course of her jog he would be absorbed into her, slowly becoming part of her as he was passed down through her body, bits and pieces of him filtering everywhere as he moved, and then, finally, what remained was clumped up into a long, thick log, that began to poke at the exit of her body. Groaning at the diversion from her jog, which had lasted for over three hours now, the canine took one of the porta-potties, and went inside, taking off her jeans, and then sitting down, pulling her cheeks apart as she did so, so the seat would hold them apart. This tactic helped immensely, as she was able to drop her load with only a few grunts, and a bit of effort, the long piece of skat that had been lucky landing amid the sludge with a wet splurk, before she added a few bits of piss to the mix, and then whipped off, taking a moment to clean herself, before tossing the used toilet paper into the pottie, covering the remains of the catboy up with it, before continuing with her run.</span></div></div>",

Oh, right,\" the horse girl looks over at you, and grabs you with one paw, holding you up in front of her face as she sniffs you a bit, wondering why this was something your watcher wanted, but then shrugging. It was not the puppets place to question the puppeteer. Smiling at you a bit, she ten brought a hotdog bun your size up, and then placed you in it, almost gently. Of course, before you could get out, she squeezed the sides around you rather hard, holding you in place despite your struggles against her grip. Looking around a few second, she spotted the bottle of ketchup where it was supposed to be, and picked it up, holding the nozzle of it in her teeth for a moment as she spun it around, opening it up and getting a little in her mouth, before moving it over you, shaking it so that it was down at the end, before squeezing, squirting your tiny form with the gooey stuff, covering you from head to toe in a long, squiggle of tomato paste. Bringing it up to her mouth, she smiled at you and licked her lips a bit, before pressing you inside, passing your between her sets of flat, rock like teeth, and then gently cradling you on her tongue as she closed her mouth around you, casting you into darkness. Of course, you were soon covered in sweat, saliva, and ketchup all mixed together around your body, a very messy mixture, and then your world was filled wih her voice as she mmmed around you, threatening to deafen you with her pleasure, before she tilted her head back, and then pushed you down her throat with her tongue, the walls growing tight around you as you were crushed inside the bun as her neck bulged around your form as it was passed downward. Soon you were nothing, the bulge passing between her collar bone, and vanishing into her chest. The pressure around you increased greatly at his point, and the air you were breathing got thinner as you were pumped out into her belly, splashing into a half full sac of liquid, that broke up the bread around you, leaving you floating in it, your clothes already dissolving a bit as she sighed around you, and returned to whatever she had been doing when she noticed you. Of course, her ignoring you didn't mean her body did, as the liquid around you started to sting, the air growing heavy, and the surface of the liquid getting choppier as the wall moved in and out roughly, pulling and poking at you, as they reduced the rest of the food to nothing. So you survived for several minute, your body just too solid to be broken down yet, though your clothes and fur burned off, and you couldn't move as a suction pulled you down into the intestines. This is where you expired, as the small intestines offered not a single gasp of air, and you simply drowned in the acids which ate away at your form, reducing you to mush, that the villa lined walls rubbed against, taking what they could of you, adding it to the horse, while passing the rest on. Hours would then pass, as you were moved deeper into the equine's body, coming to rest at last in a tightly packed lump in a sack of similar lumps, that soon filled to capacity. The horse, feeling this, moved toward a bathroom, and sat down on the toilet after taking off her jeans. For several minutes she grunted and groaned as she fought to force you from inside her, trying hard to get you to come out, as you resisted, and then, with one deep plunk, you landed in the water, splashing about as nothing more than a gooey, soft log of shit that stank heavily, and ran with anal juices that poured out with it. Then her urine came, a torrent of it slamming into the log, breaking it apart to become a brown soup that filled the bowl with the warmth of her body, before the equine rose, and then jiggled the handle of the toilet, flushing your remains down without even a thought.</span></div></div>",

He'd been right by the picnic basket only a few minutes ago, when she'd gone off to find a place to pee, but when she'd gotten returned, he was no where in sight, which kind of upset her. Had he found another good looking wolfess or female to run off with? She doubted it, after all, he wasn't the kind to do that, but still, she saw a bunch of other people looking at her as she sat there on a blanket, obviously laid out for two as there were two plates sitting in front of her. She sighed as she rubbed the back of her neck, looking down only once, and not seeing the tiny speck on the top of her sandwich as she looked away. Had she looked closer, she would have known what had happened, her date, having waited for her for a few minutes, had felt something prick the back of his neck, and slapped at it, a small bug thing flying off into the sky away from him, shimmering as if it were made of light, and then vanishing into the sky. Had he thought about it a bit, he would have realized how odd the bug had looked, but he didn't as he had other things on his mind a moment later, when he noticed that the whole park seemed to be getting bigger around him, enlarging somehow. Then, it hit him. He was shrinking, and he started to try and shout at someone, running off the blanket, only to trip on the edge of a plate, and fly forward, shrinking down to bug sized and then finding himself stuck inside one of the holes on the top of the bread. Struggling did no good, and after a moment, he stopped as she came back. She was titanic in proportions, truly magnificent in her strides, and he found himself getting excited at the sight of her body, as his date sat down in front of the plate, and started to look around. He yelled up at her at first, his arms pinned at his side, and preventing him from waving, but at his size, she saw and heard nothing of him, even when she looked down at the sandwich....and then he started struggling again, as he remembered where he was, a bit too late though, as he was suddenly picked up by her hand, which wrapped around the snack easily, and lifted it up to her maw, which seemed to creak open, revealing a cavern of soft flesh, and liquid surfaces that rippled as he watched. Her breath blew on him, and felt it blow around him, hot, humid, and smelling divine, allowing him to forget, for a moment, where he was. He remembered when that moment passed though, as her jaws rushed at him, and then clamped down, her teeth cutting through the sandwich easily, and trapping him inside as she started to chew slowly, her massive teeth smashing together and reducing everything between them too paste. Trying to fight his way out of that, he murred and struggled, not wanting to end up a stain between her fangs. And he didn't, though that was mostly because she didn't chew long, her head tilting back, causing him to slide along her tongue, and impact the wall of her throat, which popped him free of his sandwich prison, but then opened up below him as she swallowed, her neck bulging out as she gulped down what she believed to be only a bite of a snack, and which slipped down her throat, into her chest, and vanished from sight. The male was subjected to the thumping of her hear, the hurricane bellows of her lungs, and then finally, dropped out into her gurgling belly, which greeted the snack with an almost bestial growl of hunger.</span></div></div>",

It liked the way you smelled on the outside, and was quite willing to fill your belly, now that it grumbled, as you had taken it into your cave out of the pouring rain that was still falling in buckets out of the sky, with the occasional flash of lightning and blast of thundered to punctuate the near constant din of the shower. You had come back to your home not twelve minutes before it started, and found the young kit curled in a corner, shivering against its wet fur as it had wandered in from the outside. Not one to turn away someone in need, you had allowed it to stay, picking up the shivering little guy and placing him on your warm chest that was slightly soggy from the drizzle that had preceded the downpour. The warm, soft fur had dried quickly though, and the fox kit had soon drifted off into a peaceful slumber as your belly moved up and down beneath him. After a time, you two drifted off, running a single claw through the kit's fur to clear a tangle before doing so. The two of you awoke that morning to find the rain still coming down outside, the thunder and lightning still flashing and crashing through the skies overhead. That had made your morning quite unpleasant, as your hunt the night before had been unsuccessful, and as it was, not a single piece of prey would be outside in this, making any attempts at hunting quite futile. You were surprised when the kit, hearing your stomach growl, laughed, and offered to help silence it, saying something about you being nice and soft. Not one to refuse a meal, you sat now with your claw curled around the kit's body, raised over your mouth as you held it open. The maw, just big enough to hold the young vulpine, was soft and wet with saliva, as your body sensed incoming food, and the kit actually laughed as you lowered him slowly onto your out stretched tongue, gently placing him on the long slimy member, before it slurped him up into your hot, humid maw, his fur becoming soaked again, and causing him to shiver, but this time in delight as you closed your mouth around him, sealing him inside. For you, the experience was quite pleasant, as you tasted the little guy on your tongue, and found it to be one of the more pleasing flavors, the taste of his body soft as he himself was, like a light brush against your taste buds with a hint of fruit to counterpoint the meat. Suckling on him for a time, you pressed him up into the roof of your mouth, rubbing him softly with your tongue, causing him to murr in delight, as you mmmed around him. At last, however, you felt the need to swallow, and in a wash of salvia, you gulped, the muscles of your throat opening wide and allowing the little guy inside, drawing him in and cupping around him, becoming like a second layer of skin as he was slowly passed downward by the peristaltic muscle contractions, his outline visible in your throat for a moment, before he dropped out into your belly, creating a nice bulge inside the sac, as his form filled it up, intermittently squirming and wriggling inside as he got comfortable, causing you to chuckle at the tickling sensation, before at last he settled down, your breakfast, and then stayed silent as you did with him what you did with every meal.</span></div></div>",

Grabbing the vulpine with one paw the wolf lightly dabs him in sauce to get a good coating of the stuff on his tiny body, before dropping him into the wrap, and then curling it up around him, sealing his fate as lunch as he tucks the two ends into themselves, closing the snack up. Rising back to his feet, he looks around for anyone else, and then chuckles as he hears the cries from inside his lunch. The fox, coughing and covered in the gooey stuff that, despite conscious effort, he couldn't deny tasted good, was squirming and wriggling, as much as the food stuff allowed, and trying with all his might to escape. Of course, his only chance would be when the wolf bit down on the wrap, which would hopefully give him enough room to maneuver, but as he waited inside, the wrap shifted and moved, growing oddly hotter as the sides pressed around him more firmly, probably the wolf cooking him. Outside the wolf considered his meal, and came to the same conclusion as the fox, but rather than allow his meal even a chance at freedom, he opened his muzzle wide, his fangs gleaming as he moved the wrap forward toward his throat, which quivered with anticipation, as the columns of spit that moved between his upper and lower palettes were blown about by his hot, humid breath. some breaking and flying outward, causing the wrap to grow damp as it was shoved whole inside the mouth, the fox believing the pressure only to be the wolf holding onto him tighter. Smirking around his meal, the wolf decided to see if he could really swallow it whole, and with a tilt of his head, he gulped it down, the throat pulling back, revealing the abyss and sucking the food stuff down into it. The fox, hearing the gulp, realized he was doomed, and started to move and squirm all the harder, trying to avoid the drop into the stomach as the walls closed to crushing around his body, and he yowled out in pain. The fox's trip was mercifully short, as the esophagus of the wolf was quick in sending his food to his belly, which growled and grumbled a sharp counterpoint to the thudding booms of his nearby heart, and the roaring bellows of the lungs that the vulpine passed between. Dropping out of the throat into the stomach, the fox thought he would be free to attempt escape, but he was wrong beyond counting, as the wrap sank into the stomach juices, which seeped inward, bubbling everywhere around the fox, who was aware that he would drown before he was digest, or at least, he hoped for it, as the wrap gave way, and the acids flooded him, a sharp pain filling his world before  blackness came. The wolf, sitting down in his favorite chair, patted his bloated belly, loving the fullness it felt, before he suddenly let loose a massive belch, that caused him to chuckle as he flipped on the tube to see what was on.</span></div></div>",

The giant had ordered you to make lunch, which was hard, considering your size, but then, it was hard anyway. It had of course, been fun those first few days, when the guy had been your friend. Just after shrinking, thanks to that light stuff that streamed in from the window. You were now about two inches tall, a mouthful for your roomie, and he'd been very helpful at first. Then, over the days, when you failed to grow back, he's stopped being so nice. It was kind of like a switch had been flipped in his head, from good to evil, and now he was using you like some kind of toy. Just the other day he had laid in bed and ordered you to get him off, or he would crush you against his dick with his hand, and probably smear you in the process. You'd been scared, because you knew he meant it, and had done your damnedest to give him the ejaculation of his life, and had succeeded after a few minutes, the cock growing hard as you hugged it against your body, but then, before you could get away, he had grabbed you, and held you against the penis as the cum had dribbled down it, covering your body in the thick, slimy seed. It had then turned even worse as he commented he had never tasted his own cum, and tossed you into his mouth like a candy, sucking on you, and pressing you into the roof of his mouth with his tongue as he let his saliva mix with the cum, nearly deafening you as he moaned in pleasure at it. Now, today, he had ordered you to make him a sandwich, laying out the bread and stuff, and then watching as you did so. It was tough, but you were doing it. Cheese, lettuce, and now turkey, were being laid out on the slice of bread, and he was just smiling down at you, licking his lips. Stepping onto the lettuce, you were forced to step back, as your foot slipped a bit, the leaf sliding around on the slice piece of cheese beneath it, causing your foot to nearly slide out from under you, and drop the slice of turkey. Looking down at the offending, half complete sandwich, you considered your options well, wondering what you could do to get on without falling, and then finally stepping onto the lettuce leaf hanging off the sandwich, and inching your way, step by step, onto the sandwich. Then, just as you reached the center, you felt the pressure above you rise dramatically, and then you were pushed down into the lettuce, which felt cold and wet against your skin as the turkey was pushed down on you. Screaming out, you looked forward, and in a small gap between the bread, you could just see outside, and what you saw almost made you wet yourself, in more ways than one. It was his mouth, his tongue running over his lips in anticipation, as he opened wide, revealing a fleshy cavern of soft skin, counter pointed by hard teeth, all of which glistened with saliva. Smiling, not saying anything, he moved the sandwich and you inside that mouth, an bit down. His teeth, those sharp yet grinding pieces of bone, crunched through bread, lettuce, and meat before meeting with a clack, and causing you to shake about as you were sealed inside his maw, with the deafening mmm of his pleasure shaking you, before he started to chew, your world dropping, and then rising up. Luckily he used his tongue to keep you in his mouth, away from the teeth, and you were given a show, your body becoming drenched in spit as pieces of food stuck to it, and whimpering as you saw the power of his body over you. Then it stopped, and for a moment, you thought he was going to take you out. Then his mouth opened, and you screamed in terror as the neck of a bottle of beer came into view, and then washed everything in his mouth down his throat, into his growling belly, which he patted, before letting out a sharp belch, and chuckling as he took another bite from his sandwich.</span></div></div>",

Looking at it again, he sighed, wondering what in the world his friend had in store for him, as his eyes went back and forth over the piece of paper. The note only said that Bryan had a surprise for him, which wasn't a lot of information to go on. In fact, he had almost decided to ignore it when he'd found it taped to a special place in his mail box he's shown some of his local friends when he'd moved into town for important information. Sighing, he walked forward, looking around the room for his friend, but his eyes, searching for someone who still existed in his world, missed completely the tiny form on the floor at his feet. You, of course, had been intending to surprise Jon with a treat of sorts, as you knew him to be into the giant stuff, if not your aspect of it. The online site you'd bought the nano-reduction serum from had promised that it could reduce biological mass by several times, a great weight loss formula, or so they said. You, however, had taken many times the normal dosage, and so had been reduced many times more than they had intended. Of course, there was an antidote, and you were going to have Jon order it for you when he got over, so the two of you would have a few days to enjoy your small stature. But then the air conditioner had turned on, and blown you off the table where you'd been sitting on a piece of paper in a circle, with a magnifying glass set next to it. Now the only thing on the table was the glass, you and the paper having been tossed off by the strong gust, the paper having fluttered into a nearby garbage can, while you plummeted toward the hard tile floor. Luckily for you, your terminal velocity at your size was so little that you didn't even break a bone upon landing, though you certainly felt very sore. Unluckily, as Jon walked in, he didn't even look at the table, so he never saw the magnifying glass, and so never wondered why it was there, his white tennis shoes thumping on the tiles as he moved toward you. You weren't foolish enough to try and run at him to get his attention. At your size you were more likely to become a smear on his sole. Of course, not running toward him wasn't enough to save you from that fate as he took a big step, his long legs covering the distance toward you easily, and as you looked up, the sky went dark, and you covered your head as you screamed, while above, Jon continued to look around, not even feeling the tiny pop crackle on his foot, or seeing the red stain on the floor as he searched for you in vain.</span></div></div>",

Sighing a but, not sure he would be finished before the show comes on, he lets go of his cock through the fabric, pulling open his underwear to allow the scent of his musk to fill the room. It's probable he wouldn't have done this, however, had he been looking up. Sitting on one of the blades of his overhead fan, you had been observing him for a few hours, wondering when he would get to this part, as you had been promised a show upon being dropped off by the company that he would get a bit of a show. Now though, he weas doing just what you wanted, and slowly, he started to stoke himself a bit, the short, flaccid piece of flesh slowly growing to become hard as blood pumped into it, transforming it into an eight inch pillar of flesh that soon stretched out in front of his body as he played with it, picturing something in his mind that he would enjoy. You, meanwhile, were enjoying the show yourself, and started to pull on your own manhood, letting your hand rub it gently up and down as you watched him move his own hand along the thick skin of his manhood. Soon after, to a bit of a gurgling groan, he came, the geyser of seed flying upward, and coming to a stop right in front of your face, before finally falling back down to splatter on his chest, as he breathed hard, and you let loose your own small blast into his, masking it completely in his own gargantuan explosion. Of course, this explosion on your part is followed by gasping for breath as you lay back on the fan blade, drained, but not quite asleep yet, while for him, there is only a few moments of pleasure, a few seconds where there is no motion, before he gets up. You, still a bit wiped from your cumming, simply lay back on the fan blade, oblivious to the fact that he turns on said fan, and your body suddenly falls off, plummeting toward the ground below. You are luck enough, however, to fall on something white, and soft. Of course, you're luck balances out a moment later, as you realize that the soft white thing is bread. You're on a sandwich, and the teen chooses to reach for it after coming back into his room from washing his hands. You get only a moment to view his mouth as it slowly moves over you, and then the teeth come down, tearing through the sandwich, and sealing you in darkness, as he chews, and then swallows your body.</span></div></div>",

He had thought he was alone in his apartment today, as he'd locked the door, and even removed the spare key from the hole in the wall where he kept it. Of course, you had snuck in earlier, after using a bit of shrinking potion to reduce your height to only inches. Now you sat on the desk in front of him, but below his eye level as he stroked himself a bit, enjoying a few naughty pictures on the net. Looking down at that long, thick shaft you couldn't resist surprising him, but then, without warning, he spun his chair around, the back of it striking the desk rather hard, causing you to fall off, down onto the arm of chair, and then slide off the right toward his leg, which bounced as you hit it, sending you skyward. You had only a minute or two to look down at the view, before you twisted end over end, and then splashed into the can of Pepsi sitting on the desk. Jon, not hearing that, merely shrugged, and returned to his dirty pictures, sighing, wishing he knew girls with bodies like that, or creatures that could swallow him like the ones in he vore pics. Thinking of eating, he remembered he hadn't done that in a while, and grabbed his sandwich, sniffing at it, to make sure it hadn't gone bad, and then taking a bite, finding the flavors of bologna and cheese enough to fulfill his appetite, as he picked up the can of soda, and then took a slug, your world moving violently around you before the light above you was cut off, and you were swept into the tight, warm space of his mouth, and then swallowed with the bite of sandwich down into his stomach.</span></div></div>",

She'd just gotten it back from the repair shop, which had assured her that it would be working fine now, and it had, for about five minutes, but now there seemed to be some problem with it ringing at odd intervals. Her tail swishing about, she got a hard expression on her face, her lips curling back and her fur getting a bit shinier as she raised her hackles and continued to mess with the watch. Of course, had she been in anyway a buff of old military stuff, she might have recognized the beeps as Morse code, specifically the tones for S.O.S., a standard distress signal. In this case, coming from one of the assistants in the watch shop, who happened to be a normal sized kitsune. Her job being to climb inside the watches and clean the gears, making them shiny, and getting rid of anything that might block them. Her boss, however, had forgotten about her when the catgirl had come back a little earlier, and given the watch to its owner without allowing his worker to exit it. This was quite a predicament for Leshana, who found the world tilting and moving around her quite sharply, jamming her between gears, and inside springs for a moment, before smashing  her against the small bell inside. Quickly thinking of something to send, she remembered something from an old movie she'd seen once, and started to tap it out. That was when she'd found herself in real trouble. <br>\r\nBefore, as sharp as the motions were, they were wave like, as if she were on a ship. But as the ringing continued, whoever owned the watch had taken to shaking it about, battering her around inside the watch, which stopped working as she held the knob outside. When everything finally stopped, however, the kitsune let out a squeak of terror, as she found herself in one of the gears. She was then rapidly shook around as the gear moved with the knob, which turned about quickly, but always stopped just before she would be between two gears. At least for, a while, then, when he catgirl had decided the ringing had stopped, she pushed the knob back in, and started on her way, this caused the clock to start, and Leshana found herself moving with the gear's normal rotation, each tick bringing her closer, and closer to the crunch she expected. Then, at exactly 6:06 and six seconds PM, it happened. Her feet were the first to go, her ankles and foot bones having no chance against the metal's strength and power, as they were reduced to nothing but smears with a low crunch sound, but the gear didn't stop there, as it continued to move up her body, slowly pressing her legs down, the bones popping with a crackling sound, like a back being crush, and then, it seemed to stop at her pelvis a moment, the bones being strong enough, and thick enough, that they resisted even the titanic strength of the watch for a moment, until the second passed again, and she was forced ot endure the horrible cracking sound as her hips were crush, and her lungs were then squeezed like toothpaste tubes, forcing her to emit a low whine of a shriek, and then, with a slowly splat, her head was pushed between the gear, and she knew nothing more. The next time the watch was cleaned, it was dipped in water, before a normal was sent in, and any trace of the now missing Leshana, were washed away, down the drain.</span></div></div>",

Of course, had it been looking a moment or two ago, it might have noticed a small kitsune girl reading a book on the sidewalk, minding her own business...and probably plotting something evil, but that's because, as a girl, she was naturally evil. The foot came out of the sky at her as Artis ran full bore down the street to catch up with his jumper board, a surfboard like device the flew through the air and allowed him to move between continents in moments. Of course, considering his weight was many metric tons, the kitsune girl had little time to react. The weight crashed down on her with a single step, the treaded foot sole pressing her into the hard street cement as she tried to resist, putting up her arms in a feeble defense that even the most hopeful of individuals would have found pitiful. Taking as they did, the full mass of the bot, her bones snapped like twigs, branching out and shredding her arms as the shards of bone tore their way out, causing her no inconsiderable amount of pain, as blood ran down her arms, and her torn and destroyed muscles allowed that foot to press her down. The weight crushing against her body was such that she only had a moment of revelation as the ridges of the sole literally cut right through her body, causing her neck to slice off of the rest as her waist and knees were subdivided into many sections. Of course, when the sole moved, it slipped a bit, and the still living kitsune girl felt it tear smash into her, and then smear her over the sidewalk. Meanwhile, the humanoid Artis looked down, and then blasted off, the rockets on his heels incinerating any remains of the tiny girl, whom the fifty story bot dismissed as unimportant.*</span></div></div>",

At the same time, his muzzle, easily as big as your head, opens wide, his hot, humid breath washing over you, putting droplets of saliva in your fur, leaving you damp, and slightly chilled in the cool night air, until his maw closes around you, his teeth combing through your fur as his cock pulses, forcing you up, into his mouth.

She winked once at the fox girl before she moved her too far into her mouth to see, and then slowly closed her lips around the treat, her finger tips getting caught between them as well, as she suckled on them, and moved the cupcake around them, gently rubbing the vixen against the finger with her tongue, covering her with the cupcake that was sticky, and soaked with saliva.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The smiling face staring down at you was not what one would ever call reassuring. It was the face of someone who owned you. Not that that came as any surprise. You were, after all, very tiny compared to the person owning that smile, her face so big that it literally filled your sky, and her body a monolith reaching into the heavens above you. To think that only a few minutes ago you had been sitting in class, just minding your own business, working through lunch on a bit of homework you had...neglected to do the night before. Such was your idiom, and you had grabbed a quick sack lunch and finished it in a few speedy gulps as you worked on the equations, coming up with X=Y/4 in an equation that didn't even have a Y value, as you tried to finish it, reaching over and grabbing a can of soda you had brought to keep you focused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as concentrated as you were on the problems, there was no wonder that when your hand closed around something that wasn't your drink, you didn't even notice, picking up the beaker of blue colored liquid and downing it without tasting it, as you continue to work. Then you were suddenly cast into darkness, as the world around you seemed to fall away, and you were smothered with heat, and the smell of sweat all around you. Shaking yourself, feeling at your wet fur and wondering what was going on, you started to look around, soon finding that the darkness in which you rested was not absolute, Instead there were small slivers of light coming from various locations that allowed you to see, and what you saw took your breath away, or at least would have if the smell weren't already doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou at first believed yourself to be in some kind of cavern, but a quick look at the emblem on the floor convinced you otherwise, as you instantly recognized it as the logo of the company from which you bought your shoes. Knowing, without knowing how it happened, that you were in your footwear, you started to panic, a condition exacerbated by a sudden rumbling, and then an earthquake that was probably way off the Richter scale as the whole world tumbled about, and you slide out of your booth onto the cold hard desk. Above you, squinting a little to make sure that blue green dot was you, the orange lizard girl smirking as her forked tongue licked at the air. She had set the beaker on your desk when you had gotten to the point that you weren't even paying attention to her, the mixture inside something she had gotten from a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't had the heart to try it out on anyone yet, but then had noticed you in your frantic pace, and decided you could use a break. Staring up at her now, you were still trying to recover from the experience in your boot, and were actually wheezing out various words, none of them good, though luckily she couldn't hear you, as she had no ears and only 'heard' sounds through the vibrations they made in the ground, against her feet. She didn't need to hear you anyway. She was enjoying staring at your tiny form, small enough that she could have wrapped you in her tongue and swallowed you whole without any trouble at all. Thinking about that, she darted her tongue onto the desk beside you, causing you to scream as it looked for a moment like she was going to devour you, only to have it smack he faux-wood desktop enough to shake it, sending you to your knees as you almost rolled off the desk to a multistory drop of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at the way you were reacting, she was considering what else to do to you, when the bell suddenly rang, and she stared at the clock for a moment in disbelief, before getting a rather evil grin on her face. Picking up your clothes and things, she stuffed them into a small cubbyhole in the back of the room, and then took off one of her own tennis shoes, hissing down at you. \"If you excite my sole enough, I may consider letting you go once I get home,\" she said in her odd voice, before dropping you into the shoe, and then placing her foot in after you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft, scaly, and somewhat slimy sole pinned you to the hard floor of the shoe, which was designed not for comfort, but to enhance the vibrations in the ground, letting her hear better. Before you could really do anything about your situation, you were quite suddenly shaken about, as the sounds of the returning students caused you to shake against the sensitive scales of her foot sole, and you found that, while quite frightening, you were oddly aroused as the soft scales rubbed against your bare fur, making you murr a little as you stuck out your tongue, licking at your lips to get rid of some of the sweat built up around them, only to lick the bottom of her sole, and get the sweet taste of her skin oils in your mouth, before the world moved violently up and down as she tapped her foot at the pleasure of the sensation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis reminded you of your predicament, and as you sat there, listening to the muffled sounds of the teacher droning on, you realized that no one was noticing your disappearance, probably thinking you skipped because you hadn't finished your work. As such, you started to make love to the bottom of her foot, almost literally. The sensation was similar, anyway, as you licked it, rubbed in with your body, working your claws between her scales to tickle at the extremely sensitive flesh underneath, causing her to burst out in giggle fits as she sat there in class, drawing strange looks from everyone for the last hour of the day, until, at last, he bell rang. Oddly, rather than hurting you, the motion of her walk made you feel even better, as you were pressed into her scales, finding that, despite the stereotype, they were warm, and that your could feel the beating of her heart beneath them as her weight settled gently atop you each time, only to lift upward again, and drag you into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis cycle repeated a countless number of times, and you found yourself falling into the rhythm so much that, after a few minutes, you dozed, the lizard girl growing annoyed with your lack of movement by the time she was home, and taking her shoe off to look down at you, asleep on the job. Sighing and shaking her head, she wondered if she could find any more reliable toys in the school, or if she should keep you for now. Looking around her room, she saw she had a large jug of the shrinking juice, and decided it was enough that she could probably find someone better than you at his duties, and so she lifted her shoe above her head, opening her mouth wide as she shook it, violently slamming you about, waking you up just in time to scream as you fell out of the shoe, and directly into her mouth, her lips closing you in the hot, humid darkness of her maw a moment later, as the deafening sound of her mmm filled your ears, causing you to cover them with your hands, before you were pinned against the roof of her mouth by her tongue, which held you there for long a long moment, her saliva soaking into your fur, drawing out your own flavor, and that of the sweat, slime, and everything else you had gotten into today, before you started to struggle, your efforts causing you to slip off the back of her tongue, and then fall into her throat. Swallowing reflexively, she rubbed at her throat, and then smiled as she went to make more of the potion, feeling you drop into her stomach with a plop, and enjoying the sensation of you inside her almost as much as that of you against her foot.  Definitely something she wanted to experience again soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I pushed and tried to fight against the weight as it pushed down on me. Far above, I could hear the deafening roar of the voice that had been plaguing me for days, since I shrank down to this size. She was the owner of the apartment, her body, soft and supple when I was her size, now hard as rock, and gargantuan in size. She had nearly reduced me to a smear on her heel more times than I cared to think about, but I had always been able to save myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, I had not been so fortunate. I had been looking for food on the kitchen counter, a usual activity for me these days. It took so much effort to simply get a meal at this size, but I\u2019d worked out a good system. Grab the crumbs while she was eating her meals at the table, before she could come back into the kitchen and clean off the counters. It had worked well so many times, that I guess  ha gotten really careless about how I did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had left the kitchen, and I\u2019d run out to find a plate of burgers sitting there, unguarded, probably being saved for later. Licking my lips at the sight of the first real food I had seen besides crumbs, I ran for it. I should have known something would go wrong, but I didn\u2019t really think about it. Then, as I climbed onto the burger, trying to tear off a few chunks, I was suddenly accosted by a rumbling shake, and I looked toward the kitchen door to watch as she came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t stupid, no matter what my actions may attest to at times. I attempted to flee the instant I saw her, but I forgot just how porous a food item like a hamburger patty was to someone my size. Needless to say, when I slip, I thought the earth had cracked open in front of me, and I went tumbling down into a fissure of darkness, only to stop a few feet\u2026.well feet to me, down into the fissure, and then stare back upward at the  bulk of her form as she continued to hum some tune she\u2019d had stuck in her head all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I was not going to take this laying down, and immediately tried to pull myself up out of the crease in the burger patty. Before I could make it, however, I felt upward movement, and then a drop that made my stomach leap into my throat. The impact was jarring as the patty hit something, but far worse for me was the hissing sizzle from below, along with the sensation of heat billowing upward through other cracks in the burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a second to build up the courage to get up and look out of the fissure of beef. When I did I seriously wished I hadn\u2019t. All around me were flames, leaping up out of the grill. She must have taken the burger onto the patio, and now she had set it down to cook. And rather than sit and wait for it to finish, she had walked away. I couldn\u2019t see her anymore, and even if I had, I doubt I could have gotten her to see me, which was really more of the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seem like ages as I sat there. All around me was a landscape that appeared to be solid and dry when I climbed on, was fast becoming loose and damp as the ice on the patty melted, and warm air made its way through the meat. I panicked a bit at this, and ran toward the edge of the burger, only to stop as a particularly large gout of flames came up from below, causing me to fall back into the crack, aghast at what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was lucky I had fallen back into the crack too, as the woman chose that moment to return. She instantly pressed down on the top of my burger, the spatulas smooth metal shimmering in the light from the sun in the distance, the first natural light I\u2019d seen in a while. Of course, that light only made me more afraid, as she lifted it off me, and then I watched it vanish off to the side. Bracing myself, I felt the burger rise into the air, and then come down again, and I stared into the very bowels of Hades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment at that point that I thought I cried. Of course, even if I was true, there was no point to it, the tears would have evaporated before they even got near those searing hot coals, which, luckily for me, only sent up waves of heat at me, tongues of flame lapping at the burger around me, but never coming near enough to turn me to ash. And, of course, the smell of the burger only grew better, and I found that, despite my situation, my mouth was watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was over. I moved closer to the flames for a moment, her pressing on the top of the burger with her spatula, and then it was under me, and I felt myself rising up, before the world was flipped around, and I got a glorious, if somewhat painful, taste of the cold evening air. My skin, covered with sweat, began to actually turn blue for a moment, before the warmth of the burger made it normal again, and I looked over to see her messing with something out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t wait for her to finish either, and got up out of the crack, and made for the edge of the patty. It wasn\u2019t easy, however. The heat had sapped my strength, and worse, she was starting to add to the burger. First a few squirts of ketchup, followed a moment after by a leaf of lettuce, which settled gently atop me, but was no heavier than a wet blanket. Finally I made it out of that, and I saw freedom not five yards away, when a shadow passed overhead, and I looked up and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus do we return to the present. Above me I can here the girl mmm at her creation, as I try to hold open the bun, which threatens to crush me beneath its weight. It wasn\u2019t an easy battle, and I knew as soon as I had gotten stuck there, on the edge of freedom, that I was dead. I didn\u2019t give up, however, not until she wrapped her hands around the burger, the pressure increasing as she did so, forcing me down, and then lifting me upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t waste a moment in her meal, her mouth opening wide in front of me, allowing me to stare into the huge, fleshy cavern, saliva moving between the rows of teeth in long, column like towers, flowing both up and down. It was an impressive sight, and then, as she breathed out on me, I could smell her sweet scent, before my world lurched forward, and her mouth lunged at me, the two sets of teeth beginning to come together  even before I was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce within her, the sounds of the world became distorted, and I could hear her teeth tear through the bread, and then grind through the meat, before finally crunching around the lettuce, and taking her first bite of burger completely inside her mouth. It was another world, hot as the grill, but worse, as the humidity, combined with the oppressive enclosure, caused me to pant in exhaustion, even as the world filled with a deafening rumble, and I knew she was just going mmm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it got even worse. She started to chew. It was horrible. The world dropped, and then moved upward again, and I felt my heart leap as I heard the sound of her teeth crushing everything between them, the saliva mixing with it all, making it mushy. I was thrown from the burger, free at last, but for an awful reason, and then, the tongue tilted, and I impacted something hard, and looked around in a suddenly burst of light to find I was on one of her teeth, about to be chomped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuck was on my side, and I leapt from the tooth just in time, landing on the tongue, and then having it wrap and curl around me, tasting me, and measuring my flavor against the burger as the jaws continued to move, and I tried to find somewhere to lay where I wouldn\u2019t risk getting chewed up. I found it near the back of the tongue, hanging on a tastebud, and looking forward to stare at her mouth as she masticated the food completely. Then, she swallowed, and I was sent down her throat with everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of free fall, and I think I screamed, but the sounds of my tiny body were lost within her\u2019s. Around me the squelching noise of her throat rippling around the food as it was shoved deeper inside of her was al powerful. Then I moved passed a tight spot, and he noises of her body increased a thousand fold, her heart, a deep bass thud to which everything worked, and her lungs, roaring bellows that sounded like hurricanes, and worst of al, her gurgling belly, ready for its meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was dropped out of her esophagus a moment later, shouting as I plummeted downward, moving toward her the churning sea of acids within her, and landing with a splash in the tingling fluids. Instantly, I make for the surface, coming up with a gasp, hoping to draw in a breath, but only feeling a burning in my lungs, and I realize there\u2019s acid in the air as well, and it, like the liquid around me, is trying to make me into nothing more than a bit or proteins and nutrients for her to absorb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fought my way toward her stomach wall as the tingling around me grew, and I could hear, from somewhere above, that same grinding sound, and then another roar of her pleasure at the taste of her own cooking. I didn\u2019t let it stop me though, struggling through the muck that was building in her belly, trying to make for some imagined safety. I was startled, however, when another gulp sounded from above, and the valve overhead let in an almost whole chunk of burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had not moved. The churning motion had kept me where I was in her stomach, and there was nothing I could do to get out of the way. The bit of almost whole burger fell atop me, and it sank like a rock. I found myself pinned to the pit of the girl\u2019s stomach, railing against the thing that held me as those little bubbles of precious air seeped from between my lips, my vision tunneling even as he tingling feeling began to turn into a burning sensation, and soon, I knew no more.</span></div></div>",

As if wanting to savor the moment they slow pulled against the long metal shaft, inching down, and thus the mechanisms that controlled the gear were slow to start, moving only fractions of their true speed, as you stare above at the gear's companion, which slowly approaches you. There is no solace or mercy here, and when you first feel the gear on your feet there is he crack of your bones as they are crushed to nothing between the prongs of the giant machine, and that crack and crunch slowly travels up your legs as the muscles snap taunt, your body wrack with a pain beyond any it could ever comprehend as the machine fought against it, trying to finish the turn. Suddenly the figure of your captor yanked the gear, and the clock, fully powered, turned hard, and all at once you felt a great pressure on your ribs, and you actually heard them break, one by one, as the force over matched their resistance, until finally you could breath no more, and the gears came together around your head with a mind numbing crunch.</span></div></div>",

When light returns you find yourself laying strung out, your wrists and ankles tied to ropes, while you yourself hang in the air. Turning your head as far as you can, you can see a flat metal surface below, with two ropes criss-crossing between you and it. Suddenly that metal surface starts to rise, but just before it hits you, you suddenly feel your legs and arms get pulled apart, the force on them almost enough to tear them from their sockets, before releasing you, and turning you watch as the metal surface drops back, and then rises again, pressing against the ropes once more, and causing you to feel the same pull. You can't fight it though, and when it descends again you are given even less time to contemplate as the piston rises, and this time you can fell it, the muscles and tendons can't hold, and with a wet ripping sound you are suddenly just a torso with two tails, falling onto the piston, which keeps rising. You are staring upward now, at the flat ceiling above, and with the force of a runaway truck you are slammed into it, your rib cage and everything inside it becoming flat, as your head is crushed down upon, popping it as it flattens, and spreading your gray matter all over the once silvery metal.</span></div></div>",

Luckily for her, it had just been cleaned out, the walls scrubbed clean. Also lucky was the fact that they only dumped at night, and someone came in to check things before hand, to make sure there was nothing valuable down in the room, before they dumped, and before they started. Unluckily one of the cooks bumped the switch in the corner of the kitchen, and the walls suddenly came to life, screeching against the floor as they moved forward, making sparks. Pushing back against the three foot thick metal walls availed the kitsune girl naught as they kept coming against her minor resistance, and soon pressed into her. Used to trash that was from macro plates, the compactor had little trouble with one little Leshana, and they walls pressed into her stomach, making time seem to slow as her ribs took the pressure for only a moment before cracking, sending shards of her own bones ripping through her insides, tearing apart her organs, and making her bleed inside, which had the added effect of making her even softer as the walls kept closing in. Her feet were flat on the ground, but had folded a bit to prevent themselves from breaking, now though there was nothing holding them together, and with a deafening, pain filled crack they tore themselves apart, and the walls closed in on her chest completely, her other bones no longer in the right places as she felt the darkness starting to take her. She would not be allowed to slip off quietly though as the walls pressed forward farther, and she could feel her neck swell with the goop that was her internals as she was squeezed like a tube of tooth paste, and then the worst pain, her head was caught between the walls, and that solid force of bone was actually able to hold a moment under the pressure, allowing her to feel each minute crack and leak in her skull for a moment, before she was pushed to exploding, and the only thing that remained was the unidentifiable splatter on the walls, as they moved back out to their proper place.</span></div></div>",

It doesn't really have a face though. Instead, all over the front of its body, it seems to have a huge set of eyes, with great arms that end in hand stretching out from them. In fact, the thing seems to have no head, and the mouth is a circle of teeth in the center of its disk-like form, with a long, snake like tongue whipping about from inside it, striking at the rocks around it, causing them to shatter and crumble, filling the space with a loud crackling sound, as the huge eyes twist and spin, the whole body of the thing turning about to find its prey. At last, the disk tilts, and it spots the Archnine, the creature it had been hunting for many hours, who had illuded it through only luck, as if the fates had tried to deny it its meal. No more, however, as it stands tall above you, and you stare up at it, its disk like form rising up on the arm like extentions of its appendages. It seems to be chuckling now, a low rasping hiss coming out of that circular jaw in its center, the teeth spinning independently of the body, revealing several rows of them inside, which create a clicking sound as they scrap against one another. The rising beast suddnely stops, and for a moment, one blessed instant, you think maybe it got sick, or died, or bored, or something, but then with a speed that belied the nature of the event, it struck, the body slamming down into the canyon, the tongue lashing out at you, and wrapping aroundyour tiny form, before drawing you upward into it, the spinning teeth slashing and cutting at your body, tearing off your limbs after ripping them open, and then finally sicing you clean in half as you are drawn upward into the things stomach. Standing there for a few seconds after its meal, the thing spins around, as if searching for something, and then, either finding or not finding it, it leans forward on its largest leg, so that its mouth is pointed out, and a low belch of gas can be heard, before it returns to its level, walking position, and saunters off.</span></div></div>",

It sure packed a punch too, and the fox had no memory of the rest of the night, of his propositioning a sphinx, and promptly getting a put down, way down, and then nearly getting stepped on dozens of times, before his hostess, a gryphoness, had scooped him up and put him out of harms way. Of course, the morning brought with it a headache of no small strength for her, and so she was groaning a bit as she shook her head, and then dunked it so far into the nearby sink that her beak clanked against the bottom. Lifting back up, she shook herself dry and then flattened out her feathers again with only a single stroke of her hand as she moved toward the counter, upon which the bowl sat. The still small fox marveled for a moment, at the size of his hostess, but then remembered where he was and started calling up at her. Before he could catch her attention however, she grabbed a box from a nearby cabinet, and suddenly large wheels of many colors feel all around the tiny vulpine, forcing him to dodge left and right as she poured herself a morning bowl of cereal. Sighing a bit to herself, unaware of the danger to one of her guests who had stayed the night, the gryphoness proceeded to the fridge, and with a claw poked a hole in the bottom of a milk carton, proceeding to dump its remains into the bowl, the buried fox who had survived the sky falling, finding himself suddenly drowning in the white stuff as she poured it in. Sighing again as she tossed away the no empty carton, the gryphoness added a spoon full of sugar to her quaint meal, the crystals falling down just as the fox gets to the surface, covering his fur in them, making him as white as the milk as he pulls them out of his fur. Now hidden from view, the fox climbs atop two of the circles, and starts waving his arms, only to be tossed off as a huge metal shovel plummets out of the sky, scooping up a goodly portion of cereal and milk, raising it up to disappear with a crunch into the mouth of the gryphoness with an mmm. Looking up at that sight, the fox suddenly got very afraid, but found himself unable to move as the shovel swooped down again, the gryphoness pulling the spoon through her breakfast, and getting a tiny treat with it as she plunged it into the depths of her maw. Mmming again, she licked at the tiny fox inside her mouth, while he tried to fight his way toward the corner, to escape the coming doom, but before he could make it, the beak opened wide, and from somewhere a swimming pool of brown liquid appeared. Gasping at the size of it, the fox had no time to react as he was washed down the gryphoness' throat with a flood of coffee, as she enjoyed her morning repast, her crop taking all of it in and chewing it for her inside her body, before passing it along to her belly.</span></div></div>",

In truth, this was to be expected of someone in Hida's position, considering his latest residence happened to be in the fridge of a home he knew not. The owner of said home, a lovely gryphoness, was not one to go hunting for intruders though. Especially considering she lived on an almost sheer cliff, that commanded a view of the valley below. It was not easy to sneak upon her dwelling by any means, but the dragon had found a way. That way being the troths above her home, where a few friends dumpped things like orange juice and milk, things that were hard to bring down on wing, as the masses shifted so easily inside containers. Finding a basin of milk the night before, the dragon, seeing no one about, and helped himself, and then promptly fallen asleep, the slow, gentle ride down the pipe into a freezer not waking him, and the cold only making him fall into a deeper sleep. No though, as his bottle of milk is poured he awakes, falling fast toward the bowl, and then being silenced as he is tossed beneath the surface of the dairy liquid. For a few moments, there is no movement from the dragon, not that the gryphoness had seen him, and so the surface is calmed, but then, all at once, he bursts free, his wings bound by a circle of grains that served as the gryphoness' morning meal. Still not seeing the tiny drake, the avian female merely hummed to herself as she cut up some strawberries, letting the chucks fall where they may in the cereal, and then, at last, adding blue berries, the mixture of their flavors being pleasuring to her tongue. Licking that slimy member across her beak, she lefts a thin forest of spital trees that broke, even as the dragon climbed atop one of the strawberry chunks, waving his forepaws at her, unable to fly thanks to the binding on his wings. She still fails to see him though, and with a plunge of her spoon, she drags tons of the food upward, toward her gapping maw, and then places it inside.  For a moment she just lets the spoon rest in her beak, her tongue licking over the stuff inside, before it pulls back, a thick strand of saliva attaching to the spoon, and snapping as it pulls out, a few drops of spit falling into the bowl, one smacking the dragon in his tiny face, making him miss as the spoon dips down again, and draws his own form out of the cold milk. Waving his forepaws again, he gets no attention from the gryphoness, whose eyes are closed as she tilts her head back, and gulps, sending a bulge down her neck toward her crop below. Squeaking in fright, the dragon has only a moment to stare as the beak opens wide again, the top and bottom connected by streams of saliva, the spit moving up and down in them as the tongue, slick and shiny, quivers with excitement. Without a moment's pause, the gryphoness places the spoon on her tongue, the heat closing around the dragon as she closes her beak, and then all that spit flows around him, sticking to him, as the tongue comes behind and scraps him off the retreating spoon. He tries to grasp it as it leaves, but is not up to the task, and in a moment, he is alone in that beak, with only a thin line of light to mark the outside world. The mmming of the gryphoness echoes around him, and the tongue curls up on him, some of those streamers attaching to his body, and he futility grasps at them, as the head tilts back, and he is sent down toward he crop to join her breakfast with a deep, resounding gulp.</span></div></div>",

For a moment, there was nothing that seemed to happen to the intended target, and Kamaria slowly opened her eyes, having expected to open them and be vaporized. Then, as if in slow motion, everything looked like it was getting farther away. As if she were moving away from everything, and then, it all started to get taller, and the catgirl realized she was shrinking. Quick, to figure this out, she attempted to run away, only to find that the shrinking accelerated as she reached the pinnacle of smallitude, and a shadow fell over her rapidly diminishing form. Without a way to dodge, she was pinned to the hard floor by the bare sole of the girl's foot, her body feeling every rough grove of the flesh, as above her, the girl laughed and giggled, enjoying this feeling of power. Slowly, she rotated her foot, grinding the tiny thing about the size of the appendage, into the floor, letting her squirming tickle her as she played with several ideas of what to do with her new toy, while Kamaria, feelings the grinding, yowled in pain as it felt like she was being ripped apart, and her flesh torn off her. Of course, those plans were put on hold as she heard a ringing bell, and realized she only had a minute or two to get rid of the catgirl, before someone found out she was playing with stuff like this. Removing her foot from the catgirl, she pointed the ray again, making sure no one would be able to see the little one as she was shrunk down even farther, soon losing sight of her on the red tile, as she became only an inch or so tall. Smiling at that success, she moved her foot over her again, and then gently started it down, Kamaria's scream of terror not reaching her ears as she lowered the sole down onto her, the tiny catgirl feeling the pressure on her back as she was crushed into the floor. Unlike before though, this pressure did not stop, it kept building, her legs and chest bending under the mass of the giantess above her, and her view of the world narrowing as the sole covered the light. Slowly, it seemed her breathing got harder, and she found that the world dimmed a bit as she lost the ability to draw more air in. Before she could pass out though, one of her legs shattered, becoming a flat stain on the floor, and then her chest collapsed, the shards of her ribs tearing into her other organs, creating a warm pool of blood beneath the girl's foot. Thinking Kamaria dead, the science student twisted her heel again, and the now voiceless, but still alive, catgirl was drug across the floor, limbs and things stretching until they were literally torn from her body, and then, left to be trampled on more as the girl returned to her seat, and dozens of students came in, rending the catgirl into nothing but a red stain on the floor as class resumed, none the wiser for what had gone on.</span></div></div>",

Shaking her head, she figured that there was just something odd in the air today. As she brought her head to rest, she looked straight down, and found her eyes locking with those of a tiny catgirl. Not an odd sight, really, but not a usual one either. Probably, she was searching for food or something of that sort, but the girl then noticed that she had a small cracker in her hand. Taking a bit of a closer look, she realizes that what she'd thought was the wind, must have been that little feline jumping off of her after stealing a bit of food out of her pocket. Sighing, she decided to deal with the little thief in the easiest way possible, and just took a step forward, for a moment her shoe blocking out the light and causing the tiny catgirl to look up, only to be slammed down with a huge force. There was no slow pressure build here, it was just the slamming of a foot, and all the weight of a much larger female onto her. Her legs still shattered as they tried to bare that mass, and her body felt like it was broken in two as she was pushed onto the rough sidewalk, and then there was a small crack, and darkness. Above, the girl smirked at the sound, and then watched as a small puddle of blood started to spread out from her shoe. Looking around, she saw no one had noticed, and so ground her foot into the remains, smearing the catgirl on the pavement, before walking off.</span></div></div>",

The spell had worked, and the catgirl had been reduced to a mouse...well, mouse sized anyway. Kicking her hard, the preppy girl laughed as she watched Kamaria sail across the class room, slamming into the wall with a grunt, and then slumping down onto the floor, groaning as she rubbed at her arms, which looked broken. That only seemed to make her tormentor laugh harder as she moved toward her, slamming her shoes onto the tiled floor so that it made a sharp clack, so Kamaria would know exactly how close she was. The catgirl, knowing what would happen when the girl got to her, tried to get away, yowling in pain as she put weight on her broken arm, and the slumpping over onto her side just in time to stare at the pair of massive feet beside her. Squirming and wriggling, she moved, a millimeter at a time toward the door. She made it barely a fraction of an inch before a shadow passed over her, and she looked up to find the girl holding her foot right over her, smiling down at her little trapped prey. Before Kamaria could so much as squeak, the sole came down, hard, smashing her into the ground, and getting a nice, wet, crunching sound as her legs were smashed into smears on the floor, and then slowly, the foot came down on her, pressure building as the sole rolled over her form, pressing her into the tile, and making her cry out in pain until her chest became too tight for her to take a breath. As the weight atop her grew, Kamaria could feel each bone in her chest as it succumb to the damage, her ribs cracking one after another, her insides torn to shreds by the shards, as she whimpered, trying to crawl away, only to be pinned completely, as only her head remained, the rest of her body a sore and broken wreck. Thinking her dead, the girl, not even realizing how cruel it was, so insignificant was he catgirl to her, she twisted her heel, and Kamaria was literally torn apart, her body stretching to its breaking point, and then bursting open, her howl of agony unable to be heard as it as breathless, and her mind able to feel it all, until the girl's heel came down on her head with a sickening crack, and darkness overtook her.</span></div></div>",

This was her task, this was her duty, and she enjoyed it, some of the other heaven dwellers went so far as to say she enjoyed it a little too much, though few, if any, would dare speak against her to her face. She wielded the terrible might of the Sword. The divine blade which cut the Heavens from the Earth so long ago, and she alone was allowed to even so much as touch it. Most mortals, though, never saw the Sword, for that was a punishment meant only for the lowest of the low, reserved for those whom even the Hells rejected out of disgust. Today, this thing standing before her was barely worth noticing at all. A tiny catgirl, who's sins were many. She coveted what was not her's, stealing from others, though many would have said she took only what she needed, and from those with plenty to spare. The angle did not see this though. She saw a thief. If a minor one. Such transgressions were of the flesh, however, and not the soul, as she had not been truely malicious in their doings. This meant she would not be cast into the Pit, but would instead be punished by flesh. This flesh happened to be on the angel's foot, and she lifted it over Kamaria, who could do naught but stare at it, as it hovered over her like the wrath of an angry goddess, which, it was, in a way. With a switfness that would have made the most bloodied executioner proud, that foot was brought down upon its victim. Kamaria would feel the weight of the world crash down upon her, and hear her legs give out a moment later, unable to feel them as her spine snapped first, her feeling below the waist cut off. She could still feel the bones though, as they cut into her body as she was forced down upon them. Her leg bones, splintered and shattered slashed upwards through her ribcage, pierince every organ of note as she was spiked down upon them, pain filling her like divine fire, as she was forced down still farther, her body crumpling around her, leaving her as just a head for a moment, a head which resisted the divine punishment, if only for a single blink, before it too gave out with a sickening crunch. Looking down at her justice, the angel smiled, and gave her foot a twist, scrapping the bloody mass across the floor, before walking off, leaving the task of cleanup to someone lower on the scales of heaven than she, as she went to find the next victim, already forgetting about Kamaria, and her life.</span></div></div>",

She'd been told to come here by some weird guy in a long brown robe with a large sword. Of course, she might have ended up here anyway even had she not been told, it was all random chance, but it was because he told her to come that she found herself here now, and as her school uniform blew a bit in the breeze, she held down the skirt of it, wishing she had something like those American uniforms, and not her native Japanese on. Shaking her head, she tried to clear it of stray thoughts, and took a step forward, and then heard the horrible crunch of bones and body parts as her weight crashed into something tiny and vulnerable. Looking down, she lifted the sole of her foot, and sighed. There, on the flat sole, was the squashed and almost unrecognizable form of a tiny cat girl, in a uniform similar too her own. Kamaria by name. This catgirl had been minding her own business by the park entrance, when the foot of the other girl had come out of the sky without warning, pressing her into the ground, causing her body to fall under its' weight, and making her scream, though as her lungs were literally squeezed like bagpipes, she found the scream of pain little more than a wheeze. The girl, staring at Kamaria, cursed her bad luck, as the shoes were knew, and seeing a bit of a twitch, from one of the limbs, the girl muttered something, and then slammed her foot into the ground, the tiny catgirl feeling the weight again, this time worse as it born down on wounds that had been allowed to settle. Before she can really register that pain, there came a worse one, as the ground moved, or rather, the shoe she was stuck to moved against the ground, grinding her body, tearing it as only such a motion could, and making her nothing more than a paste mixed with the dirt, her last thought lost to the sheer pain of the event, as the woman scrapped her sole on the ground to get rid of the disgusting catgirl, before walking off, gripping about having come here in the first place.</span></div></div>",

Groaning as only a piece of foliage could do, the plant monster leaned back, hugging its huge, bulging member, and then squeezing it, forcing the wolf down deeper, and spritzing him with the plant cum, which tasted of chlorophyll and pollen.

The test of her skills as a programmer was right in front of her, and she found it quite thrilling as she typed in the last command, laughing as she got the result she wanted, the screen becoming a rainbow of colors, and then swirling into darkness. Clapping her paws together, she decides this deserves a treat and opens up a small box she brought with her. Smirking at the thing inside, she grabs it by one of it's tails, startling it awake, and causing it to squeak at her as she lifts it from inside the box, and then above her head as she licks her lips. Exspensive in the extreme, kitsune's were quie the taste treat, and the tigress had been lucky enough to catch a wild one the other day on one of her trips with a friend. Now dangling it above her mouth, she smirked as she opened wide, and lulled her tongue out, letting sailva flow down it as she eyed the literal mouth watering treat, before dropping her inside, feeling her land on her tongue, and then purring deeply as her taste flowed around her mouth. The purr, coming as it did from all around her, caused the kitsune a bit of pain at first due to the noise it made, and shaking her about inside the mouth of the tigress, who simple sucked on her like a candy. Luckily, the tigress wasn't one to gloat long over a success, and in a moment, she swallowed her treat down into her belly, feeling it struggle and move inside her as it was pumped deeper into her body. Dropping into her belly, the little kitsune would be surrounded by the tigeress' warmth, and would probably feel quite contented, and slowly drifted off into a light slumber, as the tigeress closed down her station for the night, and then went out of the office. Stopping by one of her favorite places, she picked up her usual dinner, and then went home with it, soon sitting in her dining room, licking her lips as she cut into a large steak with her claws. Smiling, she shoved a piece into her maw, and swallowed without so much as a nibble, sending a chunk of meat into her belly to fall atop the kitsune girl. Of course, soon, more meat would follow suit, chunks of it battering the poor foxish girl around, as it was tossed inside without regards to the occupant. Letting her belly fill, the tigress was soon quite content, and went to take a few hours of catnapping before work returned to fill her time. When she fell into this slumber, of course, her body would begin to work on it's contents, the strong stomach of a carnivore filling with powerful acids that bubbled against the steak bits, melting them, as the walls churned hard to convert it all into mush, while the kitsune, immune to the acids, rides it around like a fair attraction, actually laughing once or twice before she's pumped into the intestines with all of it. Luckily for her, the tigress' body uses the whole of the steak, and so, nothing is left for waste as she is passed through the tight tube of the feline's intestine, slowly being shoved forward, until she falls into an open sack that smells a bit worse of the wear. When the night is over, the tigress would rise from her bed, and groggily walk toward the bathroom, sitting down on the toilet, and then pushing at the odd lump inside her bodyl shoving and grunting, until the kitsune, warm from the ride through her body, would drop right into the chilly water of the bowl, and then suddenly get flushed, as the tigress pressed the handle down as she rose, sending the unnoticed meal down into the sewers, which would dump her right out into the woods again, to be caught some other time, by some other predator.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mare sighes as she stares out at the park. All around her was a herd of younglings having fun, and she couldn't join in. Not that she would have if she could really. She knew the games, and knew that her speed was too great for them to ever even try to get away from her. After all, she was an adult now, and that made the games less fun, when you always won. There had to be some chance of losing to really be amusing, and so she stayed out of it, and did the adult thing. She only had an hour or so for lunch anyway, and then it would be back to work for the day, which made her even more depressed as she looked back over her shoulder one last time, before reaching into the brown paper sack which carried her meal. Her hand had to rummage around a bit before she felt the tiny, warm body of some small creature inside it, and then she pulled it out into the open. The little kitsune was a small thing she'd caught on the way to the table, just one of the creatures of the woods, and so she had decided to do the natural thing with the tiny one. Eat her. After all, that was the purpose of thos smaller than herself, to feed her. Or so she had been taught. Reaching into the sack again,she pulled out some fries, and then a burger wrap in paper as well, holding the tiny fox girl down by putting one finger on a single tail, keeping her from getting away as she struggled a bit, though obviously she was already defeated, her struggles not even budging the tail from beneath the finger as the mare slowly unwraped her lunch with one hand, and then pulled the top bun off, licking her lips at the sight of the stuff inside, including the meat and veggies. Pulling her thumb together witth the finger, she lifted the kitsune up above the burger, dangling her by her tail for a moment, before dropping her amid the lettuce and tomato. Then, to make sure she couldn't get away, the equine female picked up a packet of ketchup and tore it open, squirting the contents straight down on her live meal, pressing her into the burger patty, and then covering her up with the top bun. Taking up the burger in one hand, and a few fries in the other, the mare opened her mouth wide, shoving a large portion of the burger into her mouth, and then closing her jaws around it, her teeth, not sharp, but flat, creating a horrible grinding sound inside her maw as she was literally tearing through everything rather than slicing through it with her teeth. After a while though, it came off, and she pulled back, feeling the struggles of the little fox inside her mouth as she scrambled about, obviously having found her second wind, and wanting out. That made the mare chuckle, her mouth shaking with her deafening laughter for a moment, before she started to chew, her jaw falling down and letting in a little light, before the teeth came together with a terrifying crunch, her tongue moving the kitsune forward to be chewed up as well. Not wanting that death, the ktisune moved toward the back of her predator's maw, which was relatively safe, at least at the moment. Of course, that wouldn't stay that way long, and in fact, it became very hazardous a moment later, as the equine's lips pursed, and a tube came though them, poking into her jaws. Before the tiny kitsune could investigate, a suction pulled her back into the throat, and then a waterfall of soda followed, as the equine sipped from her drink, enjoying her lunch with an mmm, before gulpping everything down, feeling the tiny, struggling bulge of the kitsune inside her neck, as she was pulled down into the depths of the mare's belly, which gurgled a greeting at her as she fell inside, landing with a splash, before getting pushed under by the fall of liquid. And so the meal would go for a long time, the kitsune, unable to do anything as burger, fries, and soda fell down on her, and her body was covered with mush and muscus from the walls, her fur sticking to her everywhere, until, at last, the stomach sphincter opened, and everything drained into the equine's intestine. That process of digestion was a slow one though, and the equine, finishing her lunch, would return to work, and put in another five hours, before she finally clocked out, wondering why she wasn't hungry yet considering her small lunch, but then shrugging as she went off into the park again, and then felt a low pressure below her waist. Looking around, she saw no portapoties or bathrooms anywhere, and so, merely went behind a tree and squated, pushing against the tiny lump inside her, and grunting as it slipped between her cheeks and fell onto the ground. Getting up and not looking back, she didn't see the kitsune, alive and relatively clean despite her ordeal. Of course, she was then buried alive as the mare kicked some dirt with her hoof to cover her waste, before walking off, leaving the little vulpine girl to dig herself out, and wait for another person to devour her sometime.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The kitsune would find herself inside the maw of the deer, having been resting in a small patch of grass. Of course, that meant that she was now lunch for the herbivore, who began to chew the contents of her mouth without thinking about it, not even really caring about the chewy bit that got caught between her teeth once or twice, before she swallowed it down, her tight throat opening up, slipping around the kitsune like a second skin, the grass pulpped around her almost like a cacoon of mush as she was passed down by rippling muscles into the first stomah of the deer's body. Of course, that was where her journey would begin, as she fell in amid the remains of the rest of the doe's lunch, splating into a mixture of chewed grass, water, and stomach juices. The soft, almost delicate walls moving around her, and grinding her and everything else up still farther, while mixing in bits of her digestive fluid. The dark sac seemed to shake about in a side to side motion of a trot as the doe around her began to move on, obviously having had her fill of that particular patch of grass. This meant that her stomach was allowed to go full bore on the load inside it, the walls closing in and bunching everything up, before pulling apart, the grass and plant matter going out with it, creating a soupy mixture that was already being pumpped into the second stomach. Flowing with it, Kimmy was soon pumpped through a tight valve of flesh with the grass, finding herself rolling into a soft, sticky slide, which left her coated with muscus as she moved about, the stuff tingling slightly with the acids in it, as her fur felt it only a little, and the grass, what few solid bits remained, were melting inside packets of first stage digestive juices, while the motion of the trot was causing them all to roll down the sticky walls at a steady pace, slowly being moved down toward the far more open entrance of her third stomach, which she would be able to hear gurgle and churn, deafening out the sounds of the doe's heartbeat, and the roaring bellows of her lungs, as she was dumpped forward, falling over an edge, and dropping into the third stomach, where the grass became nothing but strings of protiens and various other minerals that the doe's body could use. The stomach here was churning, but not hard, as it gently let the acids all mix together, pulling apart the various things the grass and water contained, allowing her body to absorb them all quite well, before everything, including the kitsune, was sucked into her forth and final stomach, a whirlpool of grassy water spinning with kimmy in it, before she was flooded into the closed chamber, the walls pressing in on her as it sorted her out from the rest, smashing her into a few stones that the deer had eaten at one point. This stomach would sort waste solids from the rest of the stuff, and would pass it through a secondary exit toward her rear, the stones simply sinking to the bottom, too heavy to be pushed out. Kimmy, however, proved just heavy enough that the stomach couldn't get her out the way it wanted, and so the kitsune would find herself pumped through into the intestine, the tight, crushing walls squeezing against her, as light ripples moved her onward, toward her destination, while villi lined walls grabbed at her, the rough, almost plant like things cleaning her fur as she was passed along. Her presence, somehow, was making it so that nothing was wasted with her, the villi absorbing everything around her, as she herself was pushed deeper into the doe's body, the intestine first wet, and then suddenly becoming extremely dry as she moved from small into large. Luckily she was still protected, and after a few hours of being rubbed by the large intestine's walls, which sucked her fur dry, she was at last passed into the doe's colon, which greeted her clean and ready for her. Gasping as she fell in, the kitsune would feel the trotting of the doe around her, as she absorbed the radiant heat from her body, taking in the excess and fueling herself for a few moments, before she started to push, trying to force her way out of the backside of the deer, who made a moaning sound, before squating behind a tree, and letting loose a blast of air from inside her, causing the kitsune to fly through the air, landing with a splash in a nearby river. Of coruse, before she could make it to the shore, a long, thick tongue wrapped around her, and Kimmy began another journey, as a fillie lapped her up with a drink of water, never even noticing her as she moved off, her first stomach sloshing around her drink, and unintended meal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The man moaned as he regained himself. The world was finally starting to come into focus again, as much as he wished it wouldn't. For over an hour now he'd been trying to get the attention of one of the huge men around him, standing at thousands of miles tall to his miniature form, which he guessed was no more than a sixteenth of an inch in height, if not less. He could not even make it up the sole of the boots that had slammed down around him, threatening to crush him into paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, however, he realized something different was going on. The world had changed around him a bit, and he tried to think of why. The last thing he remembered was the boot of one of the guys, a huge bear, even compared to the others, striking the ground with his full weight. The man had expected to die right then, as the sole of the boot had struck, but miraculously he'd been spared, falling right into one of the groves on the sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was a blank, and the tiny man tried to figure it out. Then, after a moment or two of searching his mind, he figured it out. The boot, it must have struck him when it had lifted up, and then knocked him out. But then, why was he still alive? Such an impact would have torn him to shreds, or at least snapped his neck. He doesn't think he's dead though, and starts to look around, finding that he can't seem to move easily, as the ground bends under his steps, and he wonders why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he gets his answer. The reason the ground is so soft is because it's not ground.<br>\r\nIt's skin. The skin on top of a cock head to be precise. How this had happened, the tiny man knew not at all, but it was happening, just like the shrinking, or teleporting, or<br>\r\nwhatever had made him small. Worse though, was when he looked up, he saw something that filled him with fear and terror. Another guy's face, and it was looking straight at him, or rather, straight at the cock, and licking its lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't think next, he just acted. He ran, and ran fast, right toward the one place<br>\r\nwith cover he could see. He knew what it was of course, and knew it wouldn't protect him, not if what was going to happen, happened, but he felt he had no choice. So he ran, and dove into the slit on the cock head, leaping inside just in time as the mouth far<br>\r\noverhead opened wide, and then began to move toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have to watch the rest of the spectacle, luckily, as the tube leading down into<br>\r\nthe cock was huge compared to him. Almost cave-like, and easily able to let him pass by. In fact, as he felt the pressure on the walls increase, the blow job starting, the shift<br>\r\nsuddenly widened, the muscles spasming, and allowing him to literally slide down, toward the ballsack, and hopefully, someplace he could ride out this storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slide was actually quite pleasant, the feeling of the flesh beneath him warm and<br>\r\ninviting, and so he let it take him down toward the cum filled opening at the bottom,<br>\r\ndropping into it like a rock, and sinking beneath the surface of a small enclosed lake of<br>\r\ncum, semen bouncing against him for a moment, before they all started toward the opening he had come in through, the muscles dilating again, even as a sucktion pulled at everything in the sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man wanted nothing of this, and swam away from the opening, trying to fight<br>\r\nagainst the current, but it was impossible, and he had known it when he'd run for the<br>\r\nopening. The walls a few miles from him approached, and like a shot, the stuff inside the sack was shot out of the penis, blasting upward in a warm, wet flood of juices that<br>\r\nthreatened to drown the small man for a few moments, before he at last burst out into<br>\r\nanother opening, this one hotter even that the sac, and with huge, white boulders for<br>\r\nwalls, except near the back, which was a bottomless pit, and of course, right behind him, which was a wall of cock head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to run back toward the safety of the member, of course, not wanting to be left<br>\r\ninside the mouth, but he finds the manhood withdrawn too quickly to get too. And worse, as the world moves with startling speed upward, it opens to let in light, and he can see a huge set of lips opening up beyond his own, allowing him to see into the mouth of the man who's cock he was just inside, the two lovers about to kiss after a blow job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis run back towards the throat is, of course, short lived, as the gods around him<br>\r\nembrace, the tongues pressing against each other, semen, cum, and saliva mixing around him, trying once against to drown him in bodily fluid, as he is sloshed about within their mouths, their exuberance in their love one that might be touching, were he not so much in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all at once, it was over, and the man, breathing heavily. Found himself alive, and<br>\r\nlaughed. He had just survived a blow job and kiss, and actually thought himself safe.<br>\r\nOnly to be struck a heartbeat later with terror, as the mouth opened up in front of him,<br>\r\nand he stared out at the sight of a burger, bigger than any stadium, coming toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs always, the titan moved too quickly for him to get out of the way, and the mouth would close around him, pushing him into the bread, as it started to go up and down with a rapidity that left him dizzy, the teeth never catching him between them, though coming close more than once, as he, the semen, and saliva, where all joined as part of the titan's meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the giant washed it all down with a single slug of beer, the little man drowning on<br>\r\nthe way to his stomach. The tiny man was thus spared his own digestion, as he would fall out of the throat along with the wriggling sperm, into a sea of caustic acids, dropping<br>\r\nwith a sizzling splash, and never rising up again, not even a single bone surviving the<br>\r\njuices, as the titan's meal continued.</span></div></div>",

Less than enthusiastic about the circumstances, you try calling out to him again, waving your arms, shouting that you'd gotten hit with something at the cereal plant and added to his box. He doesn't hear you anymore now than he had before, and after a moment, his spoon dives into the sea of cold milk, plunging under the surface, and soon coming up with a load that seemed like it would weigh tons to you. Without a pause, that massive spoonful it placed in the boys mouth as he stares elsewhere, watching the TV, and barely even paying attention to his cereal as a music video comes on. Chewing his mouthful with a most disturbing crunching sound, you try desperately to pull you leg free once again, but find that it is still as stuck as when this whole thing started, and when you look back up, the spoon is coming back down, this time right at you. Before you can launch any kind of protest, no matter how ineffective it woul have been, you are taken up toward the mouth of the titanic teen, which opens wide. You would think that such a terrifying moment would last forever, but unfortunately he's moving fast, and you soon find yourself inside his mouth, his lips sliding you and the spoonful off, to land with a splat on the remains of his first bite. Of course, he then resumes chewing, his jaw dropping out from under you, making your stomach lurch, before it comes back up, and with a much louder, and far more terrifying sound, cereal is crunched between his sharp, mountainous teeth. Luckily, he missed you, and he seems too busy to chew anymore, as his mouth opens again, this time bringing a pool of orange liquid up to you. Screaming out only once, you are soon swallowed in a torrent of orange juice, with a light gulp that the boy doesn't even have to work down, only a small lump in his neck showing your passage, before you vanish into his chest. In there, the sounds of his body are amplified a thousand fold. The thumping of his heart, the bellowing roar of his lungs, and worst of all, the gurgle of his stomach. The latter grows closer and closer as you descend his esophagus, until finally you are dumped into his belly, landing with a splash in a pool of stomach juice. Luckily, there is only one instant of a horrible burning sensation, before it is over, and you become nothing more than a light belch in his conversation later at school.</span></div></div>",

He had taken several laps around the field, kicked a few goals in, and then left for the locker room to get cleaned up. Of course, he hadn't noticed the tiny guy hanging out in the room. A bit of a peeping tom, he'd been enjoying the sights, and had probably been about to leave when the jock had entered, his body dripping with sweat as he tore off his shirt and tossed it into the laundry basket, and then made his way over to the lockers. Seeing him startled you of course, as you'd been sure there had been no one else on the field. As such, you had tried to hide, again, on a spot just above the lockers where you could look down on them all, hanging off the ceiling on a little wire. But stuck on top of the locker, you were rocked about as he tore open his personal locker, and then rumaged around for his school clothes, slipping on a shirt. and some real pants, before he slammed it closed, causing your world to jump, and you to fall into the wealth of blonde hair on the top of his head. Luckily, he chose not to take a shore, or you might have been washed down the drain, and instead he made his way to the cafeteria, you riding on top of him, getting the air sucked out of you, as he, to your perspective, moved faster than the wind. He had grabbed one of the trays from the wash, and gone, as the coach had told him, to a small locker in the back of the kitchen, to find the place where they stored the teacher's lunches. Licking his lips he had grabbed a burger, and then some fries, before moving out ino the cafeteria, toward the little condiment island. You had been just peering off the top of his head when he reached it, and idly ran his fingers through his hair. That had caused you to plummet down as the hairs whipped about, and you fell forward with a scream, which caused him to look around. Shrugging, as he finds nothing to attribute the sound to, he squirts a bit of ketchup onto his burger, not noticing the tiny dot on it that was trying to get off. Smiling, he then pressed the bun down on it, prefering just meat in his lunch Taking the tray to a table, he sat down and picked up the burger, licking his lips against as he felt the seasme seed bun give a litte under his grip. Then he opened wide, and took a huge bite, your tiny form being taken into his mouth, and then getting rattled about as he chewed, You were lucky, however, that you were so small, as the teeth couldn't even touch something your size. That luck was two fold though, for a single swallow was capable of drawing you down into his throat, your body stuck in a drop of saliva that sealed you in, cutting off your air, as you tumbled down his throat, the pressure in your lungs building as you tried desperately to get a breath in, barely noticing the slide of his esophagus as you were drawn downward. With a gasp you broke free, however, as the saliva dropped onto a solid bit of burger, and you were clinging to it, looking all around you at a rolling sea of gastric juices that bubbled and churned, sizzling as the piece of meat you were clinging to started to descend into it. Outside, the jock let out a light belch, before shoving some fries into his mouth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The man looked out of the glass and sighed. His wife had left him here again, after a bit of fun with him shrinking, a trick the woman had picked up on one of her little outings to somewhere else. She loved making him tiny, and then using him for sex, before growing him back, but today thy had been interrupted, and the woman had taken off after she'd shrunk him, promising a good time when she got back from the office. The guy, a bit bored, had decided to explore a bit at his size, rarely being left alone at this height, as his wife never liked him out of her sight. Today, with pressing business at the office, she hadn't had time to grow him back though, and so he'd been left on the kitchen counter, allowed to roam freely, or at least, as freely as someone his size could. That was what had gotten him into trouble, as he walked all over that counter, finding a few spots and marks on it as he went around, and then run into a problem as he rounded the sink, slipping on a soft spot, and then going tumbling into it, landing in a glass with a plink as he struck the floor of it. And so he'd sat here for the last few minutes, not even bothering to try to escape. Even if he did tip the glass over, it might shatter ,and he was fairly certain the shards would kill him if that happened. Of course, this meant hours of boredom, that soon left ihm curled up against one wall of the glass, sleeping soundly. That meant that he missed his soon coming home from high school with one of the other guys, the two of them discussing the game on friday. Not jocks by any stretch of the imagination, the two were really just enthusiast at the games, and often made a game of pranking the visiting team, or even their own when the team captain or someone picked on them or their friends. Loads of laughs they had, and they were laughing loudly as they came in, tossing their bags and things onto the floor in the livingroom as they made their way toward the kitchen. Waking up only slowly, the man stared upward, and caught only a small glimpse of his son's massive form as he swiftly moved through his limited field of vision, and then vanished again, the sound of his vocie quite loud in the confined space of the glass, forcing the man to cover his ears as he considered what to do next. That decision was taken from his hand an instant later, however, as a huge hand wrapped around the glass, bringing it up onto the counter, allowing him an excellent view for a moment, before a white, cold substance started to pour into the glass, filling it up and spinning him about, sliding him along the wall of the glass for a few minutes, before the motion stopped. Swimming to the top of the glass, he broke the surface of the milk, and took a deep, ragged breath as he drew his arms in about him, swearing against the cold as he tried to draw warmth back into his body, rubbing himself as he looked over at the person hold his glass, and stared right at his son's mouth as he took a bite of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, his teeth tearing into the soft bread with enough force that the stuff inside leaked out a bite, before he started to chew, his jaw moving up and downa few times, while across from him, at another seat in the living room, his friend munched on some chips. Before the man could do much of anything about his situation, the glass rose upward, and he went under the liquid again, this time though he felt everything as it tilted, and a flow carried it toward what he knew was his son's mouth. He couldn't fight the strong current, not with his limbs already a bit numb from the chill, and so he was swept into the mouth with everything else, soon rolling onto the tongue for a moment, and getting covered with mushy bread mixed with saliva, milk, jelly, and peanut butter, before it was all lumped up around him, the pressure becoming almost unbearable as the throat seized him, and he was swallowed. His journey, was swift and straight, giving him only a moment to consider the situation, before he was dumpped out into his son's stomach, falling in with a lump of mush, and then being drawn down into a little pool of acid. Outside, his son idly voiced his wonder at his dad not being home, but his friend doubted it was serious, and his mother never would tell him anything about what happened to his dad when questioned later.</span></div></div>",

It literally slithers along most of the time, the hands and arms sticking out of its top laying uselessly above it, but as it draws closer, the eyes on its head turn toward you, and its nostrils flare as a sharp wind is drawn into them. The beast makes no other sounds, its body sliding silently across the rocks and rubble of the ground, as you turn, running away, but falling every few feet as the litter strewn way trips you. It had aleady been here. Or something like it at least, and it moves over the rubble easily, only a few pieces rubbing against it falling away, clattering about in the silence of the destruction. It doesn't seem too concerned that you might get away. In fact, the eyes on the sides of its head are already gazing around, as if looking for more prey, more creatures,but that once, central eye, remains fixed on you, the slitted pupil never erring as it arrows in on your position. You realize then that it is futile. You can't get away. This thing, this monster of a snake or something else, is too fast, even over the uneven terrain, and so you stand. You do not run. You're scared, but...at the same time, numb. You feel nothing, and as you grab a steel rod from the rubble, you heft it up like a javalin, and the beast, not concerned, moves onward. It's mistake, as the eye makes a perfect target, and just as it gets close enough, you hurl the rod at it, and the eye pops like a balloon, the thing rearing up with a scream that forces you to cover your ears, and then, suddenly, everything goes black. You open your eyes and gaze upward into its slick belly scales, only to have them collapse on your a moment later. Yowling with the pain of it, you are hurt, but alive, though you wish you were dead as every bone in your body is broken, your skull only just whole, as it had fallen into some kind of hole in the street. Before you can really comprehend this, the monster moves, and the slick scales still drag you with it. A sharp pull is what you fell over your bdy, you can even hear your limbs tearing off, before all at once, your skull is flattened, and the creature, blinking, finds its eye repaired automatically. Lifting up with its arm, it turns its head inward, and gazes down at the broken up stain of your body on its belly, and it licks at it, finding it enjoys the taste. Murring, a low clicking sound, it folds back down, and your body is completely obliterated as it moves on, to find some more like you to snack on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bunnyess looked down at the thing she had caught. It was lizard, or so she thought. Not a dragon, they were bigger than this, but something like it. Lithe, agile, and with claws, as a scratch on her hand could attest to. Right now it was even trying to still get a way, tugging at its tail, the end of which was pinned to the board with a fork. She had caught him trying to make off with a coin from her purse, and so had let him get to the cutting board, before tossing the utinsile at him, and trapping him. When she'd tried to grab him, he'd attempted to claw her, actually drawing a bit of blood, which had made her angry enough that now that she had him in front of her on the kitchen table, she was slowly twisting the fork about, tearing open the wounds in his tail as she considered what to do with him, and then remembered she still had dinner to make. Looking down at him, she felt her stomach give off a gurgle, and smiled, a sight which made him pull back, and then start pulling at his tail, directly away from her. Chuckling at this, the lapine rose from her seat and moved to a cabinet, pulling out a few things for a nice snack, as she didn't want her husband to think she didn't like whatever he would be bringing home tonight. So she just pulled out a few slices of bread, a slice of cheese, and then some ham, and smiling, she placed them on both pieces of bread, one on each, before going back to the table, where the lizard thing had exhausted himself, and was laying against the fork, his tail oddly no longer bleeding. As she came nearer though, he seemed to have gained a second wind, and began to tug sharply on his tail again, to no avail, as she picked up the board, and brought it into the kitchen, holding it over her sandwich for a moment, and then picking up a sharp knife. The lizard seemed to go limp at the sight, and at first she thought he'd fainted, but then noticed he twitched. He was playing possum, and with a laugh, she slashed at the board, cutting clean through his tail with a sickening squish-crunch, and causing him to fall onto the ham on the slice of bread, onto which she quickly flipped the cheese slice, before tossing the whole thing onto a pan on the stove, which was already blazing hot, as she'd been warming it before she'd spotted him. She chuckled again as she heard his scream, and imagined what it must be like inside the sandwich, the cheese melting over his boy, bubbles of liquid evaporating from the ham, popping in his face and scarring him, as she just sat there, and enjoyed the show for a while. Of course, she was forced to flip the bread after a minute, pressing down on the top for a second, causing the scream to grow sharper as she pressed into his burning scales, and then flipping him over, which caused the scream to cut off as the air was pushed from his lungs. Smiling still, the bunnyess hummed as she pressed into the sandwich again, willing it too cook faster, and then, less than half a minute later flipped it off the pan, and right into her pad, which felt the heat only slightly, as she squished and poked the sandwich with a hand, before takinga bite, enjoying the way the insides of it crunched between her teeth. Looking in, she saw that she'd bittin through one of his legs, and he was still squirming inside the sandwich, still fighting, which nearly made her choke as she started laughing with the bite in her mouth. Of course, as she swallowed, she heard the doorbell ring, and so, stuffed the rest of the sandwich in her mouth, and swallowed it down as fast as she could, wondering how long the burned and injured lizard would last in her tummy. She forgot all about him though, as she walked up to her husband and kissed him, and he commented on a strange taste on her lips, which she identified as a new lipstick, Eau du Reptile, with a sardonic chuckle as she rubbed her gurgling stomach.</span></div></div>",

Obviously she wasn't too mad, really, as she wasn't fruious, but you can't say that stare built up a lot of confidence in you as you grunted under the weight of the jewel you were trying to swipe. Moving as quickly as you can away from her, at least, as quickly as you can without dropping your 'find', you hobble toward the exit of her den. She merely chuckles at you as she takes a single step, and is suddenly standing in front of you again. You, of course, turn right around and try again to flee, but this time you are hindered by the jewel on your back seemeing to get heavier. Looking up through the glass like crystal, you can actually see the foot of the dragoness, her clean pad shining through the gem. You, seeing the futility of continuing, try to drop the crystal and make a run for it, but, by this time, the dragoness can merely lean forward, and swoop you up in her hand. Before you can really understand what happened, you world is inverted, and you go sailing forward, right into the gullet of the dragoness, who downs you with only a single gulp, the tight walls of her throat squeezing at your body, rubbing against you wetly as you are drawn down her neck as nothing more than a squirming bulge, fighting to resist the downward pull. Finally, as you think you're about to pass out from lack of air, the passage ends, and you are dumpped into her belly, landing amid the stomach jucies, which tinlge against your scales. Then, all at once, the world moves about, you rolling along a slick, folded wall, and then getting splashed by her stomach acid as the liquid settles over you, the dragoness leaning down to retrieve the item you had been attempting to pilfer. Smiling as she licked her lips, she rubbed one hand against her belly, moving her loose strips of clothing, her 'temple dress' out of the way to feel you flialing about inside her belly. Chuckling, which causes you whole world to shake and rattle, she moves back to her hoard, and replaces the jewel in its proper spot, before sitting down on the pile of jewels and gold, and then laying back, causing youto again roll along the wall, and then the stomach acids to cover you again. Slowly but surely, the dragoness drifts off to slumber, and you, inside her belly, get the full treatment of her digestive system, the stomach churning you hard, and the acids burning at your body, the scales on your belly melting off, as the air gets into your lungs, making your insides feel like they're on fire. After a while, of course, your body melts into her's, and is pushed through with the rest of her meal. When she awakens hours later, she has already forgotten you, as you were just one thief in a long line of them who are always trying to steal her treasure. The only honor you are given on your death is to be shit out, a log of it coming out of her backside behind her den as she grunts and groans, your skull decoratiing the tip of it. Slowly working the huge piece of crap out of her body, she sighs heavily as it finally drops from her bum and splats on the ground, only to be broken into a small bog as she lets loose a torrent of piss onto it, creating a pool of urine in which your skull floats. Getting up, she doesn't turn back to see that tiny head bone, as it sinks into the ground, buried with the rest of her meals.</span></div></div>",

The first and third parts were written by someone who sends me RP greetings from time to time, Kamaria, a catgirl)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up from your sleep...but only because there's a sudden, hot, burning feeling on your back! You feel yourself almost floating in a large amount of grease, and there's a bunch of melted, wet stuff below you...it's like...almost...cheese? Suddenly darkness lifts, and you see a smiling catgirl above you. There's no time for you to scream as she reaches towards you...no, over you...and grabs some kind of brown, doughy end...you realize you are on a pizza. A loud crrruuuunch sounds as she folds that part, you almost slide off due to the grease...but unfortunately for you, her hand supports the pointed end. You can see her cute catgirl fangs slowly chomp away at the end, closer, and closer, and closer...CHOMP...CHOMP...you can hear the powerful sound of her teeth working at the pizza. The moment you realize you are going to be a victim of this her teeth immediately chomp over you, encasing in darkness. Though you pray for a quick death, it is not to be, as her teeth miss crushing your body, chewing the delicious Italian food. You can see her throat open up, everything inverts...a loud, rumbling GULP later, and you find yourself falling into eternal silence. You hit an acidic bottom, joining the rest of the catgirl's meal...and she is ever blissfully unaware of killing your little, pathetic self. You are just another pizza topping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is another silent day in the city. Not that every day isn't quite for her. She sits here, all alone, every day, just dreaming of adventure that lays beyond. Others are out there, fighting dragons, defeating demons, and all the stuff she'd read about in books, and seen on television. Not that she thught she could do that. After all, the world outside the city was a volatile place, with never an instant of peace, or a moment of rest. The world was a cruel mistress. Sighing, as she laid back against the park bench, her skirt flaring as a sudden gust shot right up it, she gasped as she spotted something on the ground at her feet. A tiny thing, barely two inches in height, and looking so...humanish. It was not a fae though. It took her a moment to tell what it was, however, as the things tail was curled up around her waist. Recognizing it the instant that tail came uncurled, the school girl groaned in disgust.. Another catgirl. The things bred like viruses, with one turning into hundreds in hours, despite how few catboys there were. Grunting as she rose, she gave the catgirl, who was innocently munching on a tiny piece of pizza, Walking right up to her, she moves her foot just over her, making sure the shadow is not in her view so she won't get startled and run. Then, with a grunt of effort, she shoots it down. The catgirl has not time to move, not a second to think, as the school girl's flat soled shoe slams into her from above, driving her into the cold, rough cement of the park path.  In less than a heartbeat she was on her stomach, her body broken and bleeding to the point that it hurt to take in even the ragged breathes that she could. She felt her body as only one raw nerve of pain, which made her mind scream in agony, as her mouth couldn't form the words, when all of a sudden, it got worse, as the foot above her twisted on its heel, and she was scrapped along the ground, her body stretching out into a stain that was barely visible as the schoolgirl removed her foot, and then swore at the need to clean her shoe again, having just done so a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the girl didn't realize is that there's always a bigger catgirl. No, no, a MUCH bigger catgirl...and she just saw what just happened. Before long, two fingers grasped the girl by the back of her shirt, clenching them together. It was her worst nightmare, encountering a huge catgirl. It was like encountering a giant ant or something. The catgirl smiled, showing off her cute fangs, and licked her lips, deliberately indicating her next move. There was no doubt about it, as she was slowly moved towards the mouth, opened wide...in spite of her struggles. Her lips closed around her head, and slowly drew her in like a piece of pasta, her kicking legs sliding in last. The catgirl's teeth bruised and battered her, punishment for the sin she had just committed, before finally the throat took her to her final destination, the acidy stomach. She was dazed and unable to even fight against that acid as she slowly melted into it, painfully. The world IS a cruel mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magical girl who had been watching this go on, merely sighed at the waste of it all as she cast a simple spell of reduction on her foe, the giant catgirl soon shrinking down into nothing but a mouse. With a flick of her wrist she brought a wind up from the air, tossing the now tiny catgirl into the sky, where she would land in a crosswalk, her landing not even marked as the traffic stopped for a light, no one's eyes seeing her as she skidded to a stop in the middle of the walk. The woman in a business suit didn't even look down at her as she moved forward, her high heels clicking on the hard pavement as she moved toward the injured, and broken catgirl, who could do naught but watch as those heels grew closer, and then, as luck would have it, the small point came down on her, crushing her into the pavement, smashing through her ribs and organs, as they were reduced to nothing but paste by the woman, who didn't even stop in stride, her heel driven through the catgirl's body enough that she was picked up as the woman moved on, and so was subjected to her steps for a moment or two, before she came off, broken, beaten, and nearly dead. She didn't even see the curior on a bike who flatened her, the girl taking food to someone else, and not minding a small bump in the path as she goes toward the person who ordered it.</span></div></div>",

She had been alone for the last few days, her apartment having been caught in some kind of vortex, and torn apart, her mass reduced until she was barely an inch tall. At that size, her body heat was lower, and she could maintain it for only a few minutes at a time outside something warm. So she'd spent the night inside the engine of a car, actually inside the piston, which had been even warmer, though her fur was now covered in oil and other gunk that coated the walls. Smiling as she had curled up, she had hoped that the car rocking would wake her up to get her out of the location before someone started the engine. Of course, the car itself was a bit of a tech model, with a few gimmicks in it that she might have appriciated more at her normal size, like auto temperature controled seats, which would start heat up or cool off, depending on the temperature around them, whenever there was a person sized piece of weight sitting in them. Lights that shined brighter when there was no other illumination in the area while they were on. A few other bells and whistles too, but the one that mattered most at the moment was the auto starter, for as the driver walked out of their home, they pressed a single button, a simple flick and push, and the engine started. Awakening to the horrible sound of grinding as the piston she was on went upward, Leshana screamed, expecting to be crushed flat as the smooth piece of metal rose, but just as she neared the top, a liquid sprayed on her, and she had only a moment to sniff it and realize it was gas, before the sound of a spark came from above, and her whole world was engulfed in flames, her body burning up as her gas soaked fur was literally blazed off her body, leaving her nude to the flames, as they charred her skin, and then she sank back down, her whole body literally covered in burns, and her eyes literally boiling in their sockets. To her pain addled mind, it didn't matter if she was alive or dead. Every nerve, every fiber of her being had been roasted in those flames, and she could barely string one thought beside another for the pain, as she dropped down, getting sucked through into the compressor of the combustion engine, the small press coming down as the piston went back up, and she was crushed, her already softened skin offering not a single moment of resistence to it, as she was pressed into the cold, hard metal, and then her bones popped,her pain only growing as the shards of calcium ripped through what little good tissue remained, and then finally, gratefully, everything went black as her gray matter was spread over the compressor, her head gone, and her life finally ended.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girl was in her room, the dress hanging loose on her as she stood in front of a mirror. She'd stolen it from her big sister's room, who was over five years older than her and about to graduate. She had literally just become the age of marriageability, and so had decided to see what the dress, a courting gown, would look like on her. It was bulky, actually, as she spun in front of the mirror, but then, she was several years younger, almost a foot shorter, and smaller in every other direction than her sister, who had worn the dress many years ago when she had been her age, and had found her own prince charming. The princess hoped to find one too, and as she clacked her heels on the stone cold floor, making a loud noise as she spun, she smiled. Of course, as she spun back toward the table where she kept her own jewelry and finery, she got a disgusted look on her face. Standing there, just under the chair was one of those annoying little people who sometimes wandered into the castle from outside. The guards were obviously slacking again, as this one wore full battle armor, a plate mail vest and some chain link shorts and even carried a blade. Even if it was only a toothpick sized piece of metal to her, the princess still didn't want it near her, and scooting her foot out of her left shoe a bit, she kicked out her leg and it flew across the room, the catgirl having not a single moment to dodge it before it collided with her, creating a horrible metallic grinding sound as it drove into her armor. The catgirl cried out in that annoying squeaky voice of hers as she was tossed about, the weapon falling to the floor with a clatter before stopping, as the princess walked toward her, the dress coming off a bit and revealing hr under garments as she made her way toward the catgirl, who seemed to be having a bit of trouble getting back to her feet. Seeing her, squirming there like a bug, the princess grunted, and rose her foot high above the little parasite, and then gave her a cold, stony gaze right in her eyes, before she brought down the hard soled heel she was still wearing on her right foot. There was that metal grinding sound, as the vest resisted the foot's descent, but it was no match for the weight of the princess, who, though dainty by her own standards, was quite massive to the catgirl. Her chest would resist for an even less amount of time as the metal can around her torso was crushed flat, and her blood and squashed inside were literally squeezed out of every hole, forcing her limbs away in a flood of her life blood, her head frozen in a silent scream as it remained alive after literally being cut off by the sharp edged neck hole, and then she was gone, as the heel landed on the floor with a clack, crunch, and squish sound all mixed together, a small pool of gore forming on the floor, before the princess raised her foot, and grabbed a cleaning cloth to wipe away the mess, and then tossing it into a hole in the wall, the catgirl being buried in the cesspool behind the castle. A fitting place for such vermin</span></div></div>",

Of course, the boat at the dock wasn't in use at the moment, as most people had decided to run like hell when he reports came in of the giant lizard thing headed toward the coast. Yet one boy had stayed behind. He'd figured the monster wouldn't even bother with him, after all, it usually went after large population centers, if for food than nothing else, but then he'd tripped over a rope as he tried to steal a bit of catch from a docked fisherman's boat. The gargantuan thing chose that moment to show up, it's face filling the sky as it leaned down toward the boat, spotting a tiny human inside the fish. Not that the lizard cared. After all, food was food, and with an open mouthed roar that set the kid's pants to wetting, his mouth came down and closed around the net with a squish and a snap, as the sharp teeth tore through the ropes, and then lifted the mawful skyward, striking the boy hard against the rock like roof of his mouth, before the beast began to chew, the jaw moving down, causing the boy to yell out, just before it cam back up and tossed him in with a bunch of mushed fish, guts flying all over him. Trying to haul himself away from the teeth was futile, for as the mouth opened again, the tongue tilted, and the boy found himself wedged between two of the teeth that were larger than he was, before the jaws came together again. The body provided little resistance for the lizard's powerful muscles, and with a sickening crunch, the boy's form was literally ground between the two pointed teeth, the taste of human blood filling the things mouth as the boy could feel the weight of the monster's jaw on hm, his legs crunching into paste, his ribs cracking and shredding at his insides, before at last, the pressure reached his head, and with one, blissful crack, he was lost to the darkness, as the lizard tossed its head back and swallowed, starting inland, already forgetting about it's meal.</span></div></div>",

Not that he awoke quickly. The heat, the humidity. It all added something to keeping him asleep. Probably why humans chose to live in more comfortable environments for their bodies, given a choice. He was lethargic and weak, almost like he hadn't had any sugar all day, though he clearly remembered some. His step-dad had bought him some chocolate from some old stand. It had tasted funny, what with the purple stuff inside it, but it was still chocolate. The body couldn't remember getting home, either, but then, he didn't appear to be home quite yet, as he lay down on some kind of dirt floor, with huge trees and walks all around him. Shaking himself off, trying to remember what had happened, the body was still groggy as he walked toward the sound of some muffled voices, only to be stopped as some kind of moving wall got in his way, walking right into it, and then bouncing off, feeling a bit of slime come off with him. Going 'yuck', and making a face, he wiped himself off, and then started to shake his hands, only to hear a dull, hissing sound from nearby, and start to look around. The wall was gone, which surprised him, but he also couldn't find the source of the sound, and that scared him, as he moved toward the sound of voices once more, only to turn a corner, and suddenly be came to face with a huge snake. The serpent gave him not even the slightest chance to react, as it stared at him one moment, and then opened its jaws and struck the next, it's mouth allowing the boy to literally pass inside it without any trouble. The boy, of course, fought with all his strength against the snake's muscles, as he was pushed down it's body as a lump, but the pressure was so much that he couldn't even get a breath, let alone move, and as he felt himself getting dizzy, he was dumped into a chamber with some kind of tingling liquid. Oddly, it made him feel tired, even as it burned at him, and in a moment, he was asleep, the snake hissing again at the glass outside its display, before slithering off to digest its meal in peace, away from the gawkers.</span></div></div>",

She was stripped naked, cold, and lonely in an area that looked as if it was in the middle of nowhere. All she could do was continue on foot, walking to wherever her little body could take her. Later on, as the sun seemed to go down, she noticed something tall and white, blocking her way. She walked over to the huge form, touching and pressing the white cushy material. It seemed soft to her and as she tried to walk through it the walls embraced her heavily and easily bounced her out, leaving her no choice but to try and climb it's tall overlooking body. So the girl climbed, climbing higher and higher, something large and yellow caught her eye as she poked at it; it felt floppy and odd. She looked inside and saw a tiny dark opening, noticing her own tiredness as she crawled in, laying on the soft yellow ground, deciding to sleep there for the night. She dozed off easily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened as a wolf entered into his house. Locking the door and flumping onto the couch lazily, he flipped the tv on when something catched the corner of his eye. Hm? He pads over to the counter, lifting up a piece of paper that reads, \"Got ya one from the store, luv you! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf looks over at the humongous sammich and eyeballs it. Mmmm, soo big! and quite delish p= can't wait to taste! He giggles and raises the sammich up to his nose, sniffing at it as he licks some of the mayo that was about to drip off. His jaws open, drooling as he bites into it...the teeny female never knowing she was shrunk multiple times, walking around on a giant kitchen counter, and sleeping between two massive pieces of warm bread.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This morning she had only buttered toast and jam, as a result of a large supper the night before.  But she could hardly wait, afterall, yesterday she received her package, and would be able to fully enjoy the newest thing in spices.  Setting the toast, jam, tea, sugar cubes and spoon on the cement bench beside her, she grabbed the tiny package opposite of her.  Quickly ripping it open, there was simply a pepper shaker, filled to the brim.  From a distance it might only seem like pepper, but upon closer inspection, you could see the millions of men, women and children crammed inside, expressions on fear and pain on their faces.  They screamed as light flooded their world for the first time, but the soundproof glass prevented Traci from hearing their plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing them up to her face, the group facing her was greeted by a massive face, no older than thirteen or fourteen, grinning wide.  And as quickly as they were ripped out of the packaging, they were flipped upside down, and shaken, harshly, as the teenager attempted to dump some out into her palm.  But nothing came out.  Confused, Traci raised the glass to her eye and peaked in.  The bright blue eyes could have been an ocean to the people in the glass.  They could see for hundreds of yards into her pupil, but more screaming ensued as she shook the glass bottle a bit more, wondering why nothing was coming out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait!  The safety seal!  Traci felt dumb.  Her breakfast was getting cold, even if it was only toast and tea, she hated cold breakfast, and hurriedly unscrewed the cap, revealing the white plastic lead, sealing her tasty little victims inside.  Again, in a hurry, she ripped off the plastic seal, but clumsily almost dropped the entire bottle.  She watched as thousands of tiny people fell onto her nightgown, cursing herself for wasting such an expensivce product.  Annoyed, now, she stood, dusting off her nightdress, making sure that not a single speck remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose unlucky enough to fall into the fabric of the dress found themselves in quite the predicament, as their recently preteen-turned-teenaged capturess dusting them off of her dress like bugs, or even worse, dirt.  And like dirt they fell, the millions of miles or so from dress, down the length of her knees and legs, to the grass.  A few managed to land unharmed in a forest of blue trees and grass.  Lost, they found no reason to hide or brace for empact when a shadow, like an eclipse of the sun, descended upon the unlucky patrons of  Traci's blue flully slipper.  There was no heel, so Traci simply let her foot hover above the cave like entrace to her house-shoe, before letting her toes, painted a light shade of purple, guide the rest of her dainty food inside.  A few of the tiny adventurers had wound up hanging or dangling from the roof at the entrance to the footwear, but toes of the goddess wiggled as they passed below them, knocking a few of the passengers off balance, and sending them plummeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost expected death, but were only treated to a rude awakening when they landed squarely on Traci's big toe, and doomed to live the rest of their days on the toenail of this preteen goddess, until they died, or until she was due for a pedicure.  Those underneath the once delicate foot, either entered a world of darkness, trapped underneath the warm, bare sole of this stranger-girl's foot, or once the foot had settled into place, became one with it.  Too small to be crushed, they found existance in the oceanic footprint of the unwitting schoolgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her toes one last wiggle, trapping a last few innocents between the canyons of flesh, Traci screwed the cap back on her shaker, and turned her attention back to her breakfast.  Hell broke loose one last time, as they entire capsule inverted again, only this time, there was no plastic seal to prevent anyone from falling.  Hundreds upon hundreds of innocent people fell from thousands of feet into the air, to land on a vast, hot, springy plain, covered in strawberry jam.  Seeds as large as houses dominated the land, and there was no such thing as movement.  The jam was simply to sticky, and there was way to much of it.  Once she felt her toast was sufficiently covered in the tiny tasties, she grabbed hold of sqaure, crisp bread, even waved goodbye with her pinky finger, bringing the entire continent that the pathetic humans lived on to her lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese same lips were licked several times by the massive, undulating monster on a tongue, residing within the young girls mouth.  Opening it only enough to allow her prisoners a tour, she thrust the toast into her mouth, giving the occupants of said toast  a roller coaster ride to hell.  The luckiest of those were fortunate to be smeared against her lips and teeth as she bit down, and stuck there, the jam acting like glue.  But they had no time for celebration, the tongue that had once warned them of their destiny, returned once again to carry out it's warning, thrusting the lot of them, 200 or so, into the hellish maw of the 14 year old.  She began to chew, the sticky saliva, jam, and toast combination searing, cutting, and dissolving away at the unfortunate victims of a hungry girls wrath.  The teeth, just barely able to destroy such tiny vessels, did so, and most of   the people found a quick, yet excrutiating death. The pink, monstrous tongue was brutal, and thrashing and flailing about as if it were the the white whale, caught on the line by Posedon.Those who were able to survive the massive genocide of their people fell victim to the swallowing process, and were never heard from again,after the intial gulp that decimated their eardrums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Quickly pulling what didn't fit into her mouth away, Traci stiffled a giggle, trying to imagine what it was like for the poor people she was having for breakfast.  With a sigh, however, she put those thoughts away, and spied her tea, sitting there, getting colder.  Then, with an idea, she set her toast down, and picked up the bottle again, wondering if her tiny disgestible pals could help make her tea even better...</span></div></div>",

She had missed lunch trying to find the handbag earlier and as a result was particularly hungry, as her growling stomach attested to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was! She smiled in satifaction as her black furred fingers came to rest on the grooved coin that completed the set. Quickly it was slipped into the slot and the red lights that said \"Insert Exact Change\" were replaced by a different set saying, \"Make Selection\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hazel eyes darted over the cardboard boxes that had labels like Rabbit, Newt, and Ferret on them, finally stopping at mouse, she punched in E5 and felt her mouth water in anticipation as the ring slid back one the corresponding box and dropped it into the padded area directly below the flap with PUSH labeled on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled it out of the drop-area and calmly, but feverently, tore open the side of the box with her index finger, the claw sliing through the material with ease. Then she tilted the box on its side and shook it several times to dislodge the occupant, as experience had taught her that they sometimes like to cling to the sides as a last ditch effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gray mouse, bipedal with arms like her but of course he size of her humb, slid into the fox's waiting palm. He appeared disorieted from the ordeal and shook his head a few times to clear his mind, though it wouldn't matter soon. He seemed to realize where he was too late, her fingers closing around him just as he tried to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLive, intelligent prey was her favorite, and the favorite of most others her age, though older people sometimes began to feel slightly guilty as time went by. Not in this case. The hungry vixen was currently thinking about the cute wolf she flirted with in Biology rather than making her food's final moments comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood rushed to the mouse's toes as the hand rose quickly towards her mouth. For him, it was almost unearthly watching the smooth, white furred belly and the rounded hills of her bosoms behind her tank top rush by him towards her delicate. The hand actually paused at the crevase of the mountainous cleavage for a second and in a brief moment of male fantasy he wondered if she teasing him, but no, he looked up and saw the fox fussing to push a strand of loose red hair back into place. Hewasn't even worth that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually succeeded, and the ascent continued up to her delicate muzzle. Her mouth opened and all the mouse could was a pink, wet cavern surrounded by razorsharp white teeth guading a black hole to oblivion. The  fingers suddenly released and his momentim carried him inside, his tiny body impacting with the spongy surface of her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could stand, the white stalagtites and stalagmites closed around the mouse, the vixen's lips coming together and sealing off the world of light behind him. The fox then tilted her head back and, just like in the box, the mouse began to slide forward, only this time into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were too tight for him to really struggle and he plunged into the vixen's throat with little fuss, the walls messaging him as he desceneded deeper into her body, knowing that he was doomed. The esophagus then opened and he was coaxed gently into the girl's stomach, which quickly contracted around him with a gurgle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis impulse was to struggle, but the mouse ignored it, realizing how futile it was now that he was here in the vixen's belly, completely forgotten by her as the chamber began to sway with her movements as she went back to whatever her business was. Hot liquid ran down his cheeks in the darkness and in the last moments of his life the mouse couldn't decide if it was his tears or her digestive juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mouse began to feed her, the fox felt her hunger diminish and uncharacteristically she felt some gratiutde towards him for not putting up an uncomfortable fight inside of her. She rubbed her exposed midriff gently then thought nothing more of him.</span></div></div>",

The company had sent her here for a conference and paid for housing and flight costs, but they had neglected to tell her that she would have to stay in a seedy motel without even the most basic comforts like TV. Going outside wouldn't help, eiher, since there was little to this town besides gas stations and convenience stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at least the staff had left a confectionary treat for her on the pillow, she noted, ears twitching with interest as the shivering, terrified little fox met her gaze. A faint smile played at the she-wolf's lips as new thoughts on how to kill some time before the meeting took hold and she slowly unbuttoned her blouse and pants, sauntering over to the bed deliberately slow so the little one would have time to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox was even tied up with a nice ribbon and had bee sprayed with mint to make him more appealing. Now in her bra and panties the shewolf flopped onto the bed beside him, her breasts coming down inches from the whimpering vulpine. \"Now, now,\" she whispered, leaning her face down and giving him a lick, \"let's try to make the most of it, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad it been a female she might have just skipped to the meal, but this particularly she-wolf had had to endure male eyes constantly undressing her in the office as well as the occassional smack on the rump. Though her current victim had never done any of this, she still saw this as away to alleviate some of that pent up tension by being sexual predator as well as the hungry one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelicately the wolf woman traced her fingers around the cups of her bra, pushing her bosums together for effect, and grinning as the fox became aroused despite obviously trying not to. \"Are you coming on to me, sir?\" She gave a mock look of offense, feeling strangely empowered. \"Well, there's just one way to deal with harassment.\" A single claw flashed out and sliced through the ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow free, the fox's first impulse was to run; he didn't get far before being gently but firmly compressed under her hand, the fingers closing around his squirming form as the she-wolf rolled back and then placed him flat against her stomach. \"You think women are just breasts with eyes, huh?\" She dragged him slowly up her belly and then snuggled him into her cleavage for a few seconds, \"just meat? Well, the tables have certainly turned now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands cupped the edges of her bosums and she pushed them together, moaning with pleasure at the sensual feeling produced by the little's squirming between her fleshy mounds. One hand drifted free and worked its way down to her crotch, as the fox's struggles intensified she began to rub herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, her free hand had pushed him further down, gently encouraging him into her left cup, the fox becoming perfectly centered on her hardened nipple. Needless to say, his struggles against the soft areola and the wolfess's own actions soon brought her to climax as she literally howled with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe relaxed, spread out on the bed, panting heavily for several minutes before even becoming aware of the faint tingle from inside her bra. Delicately she pulled out the frazzled vulpine and moved him closer to her muzzle, giving him a quick kiss. \"Thank you,\" her grattitude was actual. \"I'll return the favor before you go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLolling her tongue out, mouth open wide, she dropped him in. Careful to catch him and not bite with her teeth, the shewolf began to massage the fox between her jaws with her tongue, running the smooth pink muscle between his legs and touching on his malehood until she felt it erect. Giggling, the sound almost defeaning to him, she continued to caress the hapless little for several minutes until he finally came himself, a faint cry mixed between fear, ecstasy, and embarassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied now that there was a bit of extra seasoning her mouth, the wolf tilted her head back, feeling the fox's moistened body slide into her throat, and swallowed. As the one-time lover disappeared into her belly, she made a mental note to thank the hotel staff and ask for another treat before she went home.</span></div></div>",

As he did so, he saw a mass of orange and black before, and only when the tigress drew her hand back did he fully recognize her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great female cat rose to her knees and stalked forward with a feral smile aimed at the terrified little creature before her. She had taken painstakingly tedious steps to conceal herself in the foilage, and even more so to remain downwind and still as a rock this entire time. She had been waiting on a deer to drop by, but this tiny thumb sized morsel would suffice for the moment,she thought, lying down on the ground next to the dazed rodent and then curling her body around him as she propped up on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse finally recovered his wits fully as the blows stopped and looked up to see a wall of white fur before him, his eyes impulsive roaming up and down, first to her slender yet firm legs and then up to her mountainous chest that easily dwarfed any attributes of the women of his village. Beyond that was her head with shoulder-length black hair and emerald green eyes and a playful, deadly smile of pearly white fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low gurgle came from the tight belly in front of of him and before the mouse could blink the tigress instinctively shot forward, catching him playfully in between her soft lips that squeezed him delicately in a parody of a kiss, before, with a wet squelch,he was sucked into her mouth with such force that his rounded ears popped. She took her time with his tail, playfully slurping it in and pushing him further  until the he filled the back of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud rumbling filled the small space around him as the tigress purred with delight. But all good sensations must ultimately end and with a gentle tip of the head, followed by a heavy gulp, the tigress swallowed the mouse. The purring was even louder on the inside, he discovered with dismay, but when the mouse got to her stomach, it became the least of his problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the tigress gave a stretch, a yawn, and then a small burp as she went back to lie in wait for more prey. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The arctic fox slipped into the log house, shivering with pent up energy as she shook the wet snow from her clothing and body, dumping the wood she carried noisily to the floor. That damn ice patch had caught her again, and she'd toppled clumsily into a snow bank soaking herself down to her fur but not her skin due to her natural winter coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling about the cold and the soreness of her fanny, the white colored young vixen stripped down to her underwear, she lived alone and nobody was going to come visit her in a blizzard anyway, revealing her athletic figure and modest chest to the one soul who had come in earlier, unbeknown to this host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little snow mouse had also been searching for a way out of the cold. He'd come across he cabin and to his happiness had found a gap between two logs at the foundation just big enough for himself to get through and had cautiously skittered across the empty room once he was confident that the owner was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd climbed up onto the kitchen counter following a pleasant smell expecting food, finding instead a bowl of warm soup that had been left to simmer while the lady of the house had gone out for more firewood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot realizing what it was at first, he decided to use it as a hot tub, dipping his toes into the cooled-from-a-boil liquid in the bowl, finding it pleasant he had eased his legs and tail in shortly afterward before finally lowering himself in up to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the fox had slammed the door open, he'd panicked and lost his grip on the rim of the bowl and had slid down the smooth curved wall to the bottom in a faint splash. Quickly he'd struggled to the surface just in time to catch a view of the vixen's breasts from the underside, held back snugly in her bra she approached her dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was where he'd made his second mistake and had dove under the surface, the opaque liquid effectively hiding him while the soup's aroma masked his smell. The next sensation he was aware of was the \"hot tub\" moving as the fox slid her paws around the bowl and lifted it up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poked his head up to gasp for air even though he knew he'd be spotted----yet he wasn't, the giantess's eyes were closed as she inhaled deeply, savoring the airborne taste of her meal. \"Smells perfect,\" she muttered aloud to herself, or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse watched in silent horror, still too afraid to move or squeak as his captor brought her lips to the edge of the bowl and opened her muzzle. He stared into the pink cavern of her mouth lined with perfectly kept fangs that abruptly dropped off into the black pit of her throat for several seconds until he became aware that the world---or at least the part of it he occupied, had tilted, and he was being carried forward towards the vixen's mouth by a river of yellow soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't much of a swimmer, all the impromptu ingredient could manage was to tread water as it carried him into the maw of the fox. Thankfully he wasn't caught on her razor sharp teeth, but this also meant there was nothing to stop him from reaching the back of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen felt a lump poised at the edge of her gullet and closed her mouth, frowning as she sloshed it around with the accompanying soup. She didn't recall putting any meat chunks into this, and was tempted to reach in and pull it out with her fingers for a quick inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, she was SO hungry; tromping through that thick snow and carrying those heavy logs had built up a tremendous appetite, one that gnawed at her belly and possibly caused her to ignore the faint sensation of tiny feet kicking against her palate which she dismissed as random pieces breaking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen swallowed, hard. Soup and meaty lump alike were squeezed down her neck, the warm liquid giving her a pleasant tingle, warming her chest and stomach as the meal descended into her body. Quickly she drank the rest of the soup and licked her lips contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse, meanwhile, couldn't help but find irony in all of this: he'd snuck into this cabin to find warmth, and now he had it in overabundant supply. The body heat from the fox mixed in with the simmering liquid that had brought him down here made the female's tummy the perfect spa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, almost perfect. True, he could feel the last bit of air running out as the bubble that his head occupied begin shrink with each breath. And the aqueous environment magnified the sounds of his surroundings several times: the beating of her heart was like a thunderstorm in the darkness as well as the churning gurgle of her stomach beginning to massage its heavy load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally there was the matter of everything moving as the vixen went to lie down, curling up under a blanket as she sighed with content---also magnified to her unwitting prey---licked her lips a second time and rolled over, the action causing the contents of her belly to rearrange themselves such as the mouse and the air bubble ending up at opposite ends, and drifted off happily to sleep, dreaming of a warm spring just around the corner.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This isn't the traditional story, as such things go. Oh, the options are going to be left open, two every chapter. One goes straight forward, and is going to be where I post things I call RP greetings. Mini-Stories, typed up for various people I meet on the net, designed with their particulars in mind. Most are full of grammar or spelling errors, due to literally being made on the fly for people. Also, these are fetish things, so expect a lot of stuff, mostly vore and crush, as I'm a macrophile myself, and find things of that genre easier to write, but some involve adult things, and others...well, read at your own risk. Also, I have been asked what these are, and the answer is simple, bribes. I call them RP greetings because of the original reason they were written. If, on a chat or in IM, someone who's into crush comes on and I want to play, but vore, I type these up for them, and usually it was enough to get what I wanted. Nowadays, I just write them to be friendly, or when I'd like something from the other person. The longer ones are actually stuff made to get pictures or stories from vorish artist and authors respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote 1: If anyone who has a greeting here would like it taken down, ask. These are for you, and if you don't want to share, I won't force you to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote 2: These aren't all the ones I've done, just the ones I could remember doing, and found in my IM logs, some of which were lost in a purge a while back, if you have some I made, I would be grateful if you could send them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote 3: I was asked if I take requests for chapters, and the answer is yes, I do. If you'd like me to type something up, send a request to my email here, and we'll see what happens. I won't promise to doing all ideas, as this shows, I can do many things, and have only a few limits, but it still takes will to write these, and so I may not do every request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote 4: This is a growing work, not just by me, but hopefully by others too. Have something like this, Mini-fetish stories? Well come on and post them here. We'd love to see them. Only 3 rules:<br>\r\n1) NO BUGS!!!! I don't like them. I find them creepy. Anything involving them will be deleted. So don't waste your time.<br>\r\n2) Don't do more than one chapter stories, though length of them doesn't matter in the slightest. These are designed for reading, quick and simple. As chapter titles list what you're doing, for example, the first chapter is Macro/Micro, Foot, Unaware, which translates to a shrink or grow, with a foot centered scene, and unaware on the part of either the shrunken or the giant person. Use common sense to determine what your additions are, and then add away.<br>\r\n3) Enjoy. Like I say to everyone who likes these, enjoy them, they're made for that. However, note that I myself am a vore/macrophile, with a liking for unaware, food related scenes. I've had others give my scenes that are what I make for them. I have never written something I didn't like, but my favorite scene is a girl, usually Teen to Earlier Twenties, eating a sandwich with a little person inside.</td>",
