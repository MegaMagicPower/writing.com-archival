But you can't live on hopes alone and the last few months have been hard. You've spent more time with books at night, going over everything you can think of to help you get a leg up in the industry, to find the people that might help you get started, to improve your artwork for the designs themselves, and unfortunately have had to work days too. Recently it's been at a Mc Phearson Burger bar, and the work hours, combined with your research &amp; training were starting to get to you... or you thought that was the reason for the aches, pains and muscle cramps.<br>\r\nWhen you went to your Doctor for something you were surprised at the result. He suggested you visit a Tau Clinic! You, visit a Super-Finder?<br>\r\nWell, after a lot of soul searching you made up your mind and went to the nearest one in the City of Burgsville. The last two hours have been spent in white walled rooms, filling in forms, getting blood tests, urine tests, skin tests, getting scanned, sensored, probed and anything else they could throw at you! It's been rough.<br>\r\nNow you are lying in a fairly comfy bed, alone in a small room wearing only a standard patient smock they gave you.<br>\r\n\"Lucy?\"<br>\r\nThe voice snaps you from your mental wandering and you turn to see a female doctor enter. She isn't one of the doctors you've spoken to so far today. Why someone new all of a sudden?<br>\r\n\"Yes, have you got the results yet?\" you ask, expectantly.<br>\r\nThe doctor doesn't smile, always a bad sign, and sits down by the bed before speaking, another bad sign.<br>\r\n\"Miss Marshall, my name is doctor Ingerson. We've gone over the samples you've given us quite thoroughly and the Tau scan, MRI and xrays confirm the results. You may find this a little awkward. First, you do have Tau abilities, and they are a previously discovered pattern. We have mapped them before and have experience in their functioning.\"<br>\r\nYou aren't sure whether to jump for joy or cringe in fear. It's obvious that there is something that the doctor isn't saying yet, something not pleasant!<br>\r\n\"Please doctor, what is.. are my powers?\"<br>\r\nDoctor Ingerson sighs then looks down at her tablet.<br>\r\n\"Well, the combination is an odd one, not terribly common. Firstly you have an altered cellular structure, making your skin, muscles, flesh etc rather stretchy. Secondly any of your bone joints can dislocate painlessly, and several bones can part and move that normally don't, for example your ribcage can part in the middle. Thirdly your muscle structure has started to expand, in strength certainly, but also more muscle groups are forming, complete with nerve linkages. Forthly your bone structure in your torso, ie ribs, spine, hip bones etc, all have undergone a rather unusual reformation internally. They are gradually forming specialised cists that seem to distort the fabric of reality, bending space. The upshot of this is that the area contained within these bones, effectively the interior of your torso, is becoming larger on the inside than the outside.\"<br>\r\nAt this you gasp. Stretching, yes you've heard of, dislocating bones, sure, better muscles, of course, but becoming larger inside than you are outside? That's weird!<br>\r\nBefore you can interrupt the doctor continues.<br>\r\n\"Fifthly your body has drastically altered how it metabolises food. The stomach is now almost useless for this purpose, and even the upper intestine. Now the middle and lower intestine absorb dead organic material, mainly meat, or high protein vegetable matter, directly into the intestinal wall. This has caused a drastic increase in efficiency of your digestive system and your body mass has already increased to slightly over two hundred and sixty pounds, and still rising.\"<br>\r\n\"That's ridiculous!\" you but in, \"I weighed myself this morning and only weigh a hundred and twenty!\"<br>\r\nThe doctor smiles at you, the first freindly expression she's shown you so far.<br>\r\n\"Quite correct, and it will remain somewhat similar. Weight isn't affected as the distortion your bones create also affects gravity. It doesn't however affect inertia and you will find that you have more difficulty in slowing down when you are moving. Your increased musculature will enable you to walk and run almost normally, even faster than normal despite your mass, but stopping after wards may be a challenge. Most of your extra mass is created as your body grows to fill the distorted cavity within your torso. Already the flesh, organs etc have become shaped to the odd curvature of space that fills your torso so you would no longer survive without the distortion. On the plus side all your vital organs are buried far deeper inside you than in a normal person, and also the extra weight, indeed any extra.. Ahem.. weight you gain will not show externally except on rather advanced scanners.\"<br>\r\nThis is getting incredibly weird and you wonder if there's more. The doctor takes a breath before continuing and you realise there IS more!<br>\r\n\"Finally you also have a drastically altered respitory system. Your body breaths more than usual, though you may not notice any difference in breathing pattern. You take in and store almost double the usual amount of oxygen in the blood, but also have reservoirs of air forming inside you that can allow you to hold your breath far longer. The respitory system seems also to be connected to an organ we have labelled a metabolic charger. Strictly speaking it takes part of your food that the body normally can't use and... compresses it with distortion similar to the fields that create the enlarged space within you. This creates huge releases of energy which then catalyses with carbon dioxide running through the respitory system that this organ weaves around, thus liberating more oxygen for you to breath. In short you will most likely be able to hold your breath almost indefinitely, and will actually have the air inside you regulated to stay breathable.\"<br>\r\nMost of what she just said made no sense to you at all, but never need to breath again? Weird!<br>\r\nThe next few minutes pass almost in a blur, you vaguely hearing the doctor console you that you do not qualify for certain government programs, probably shouldn't apply to the usual acredited Super Hero training establishments, and some other things that seem equally pessimistic.<br>\r\nAs far as you can tell the only thing you have is a slightly increased strength and would be more difficult to kill in the torso (though anyone planning on shooting your head wouldn't have to worry too much about you afterwards). The stretching doesn't stretch your bones so isn't much use to capture or subdue super villains. The brief visions you had of leaping or flying over the rooftops, defeating criminals disappear and you realise you are probably going to be an Ord, someone with Super power, but who leans an 'ordinary' life. You wonder what job that the powers you do have will help with?<br>\r\nFinally the doctor smiles, hands you some standard government leaflets of the regulatory issues regarding Supers, and leaves you to yourself.<br>\r\nWhat are you going to do?</span></div></div>",

But surely this can't be it, can it? You do HAVE powers, even if they aren't particularly useful... or are they? Maybe you'd better talk to someone with experience in this sort of thing.<br>\r\nYou think back to what the doctor said about not joining a Super Team. Well, maybe there are teams that would take you? It's worth a shot, and there ought to be one that has experience in your type of powers.<br>\r\nYou buzz the nurse and ask if there is access to the internet in the building.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They definitely are an interesting Super Team, one that seems to rely mostly on gadgets made by one of their members, as the others aren't very powerful. You almost skim over their site as you have dozens of others when your eye catches on one of the listed members; Slurpina.<br>\r\nHer listing describes her as being a living repository for their equipment as well as being tough, agile, and an expert in an obscure martial arts form. What catches your eye at first is her uniform. It's a one piece, figure hugging light blue uniform with a red oval around her mouth. Very odd to accentuate her mouth you think. After a little digging you find out why. She swallows objects and then regurgitates them for the group to use in battle. It seems she can hold a great deal of stuff without it showing in her figure.<br>\r\nThat sounds just like your powers! She must be bigger on the inside too! Excited you get an address off the site and download a list of their members to go over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen Death - Leader of the group, owner of the Eliminator's base (a building on the outskirts of town with a well stocked basement apparently), and the most powerful of the group. He is a short stocky looking man, heavily built with a uniform that is mostly a light silvery green with dark green tunic, gloves and boots. He wears a one piece odd looking green helmet (definitely a custom job) with no apparent faceplate, making him look decidedly impersonal. They list his powers as Mental Communication (apparently consensual, so no use to read villains minds), 'Green Blast' -  some sort of energy blast from his fists, and Enhanced Mass - which seems to make him more difficult to hurt. He also uses stun bombs and a flight belt built by their resident Genius...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetal Freak - Their resident female Genius and maker of all their gadgets, tall, with very thick wavy blonde hair and wears dark goggles in the image as well as a grease covered lab coat. She apparently can understand any machinery in seconds if she can see the working parts (and notes she has made herself goggles to see inside machinery without taking it apart) and can produce incredibly complex equipment. She has no other powers but does go into battle wearing a suit of Power Armour she's built for herself which makes her tougher, stronger and includes laser guns in the arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlurpina - A tall woman with the blue and red uniform you've already looked at. On further inspection she might not have exactly your powers. They don't list any kind of stretching in her abilities but note she can hold large gadgets. Presumably her mouth stretches to swallow something that big. She usually carries stun bombs and a vibro sword into combat and the listing notes her incredible agility and combat skills. Nothing here about being tougher to hurt or increased mass like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Sky - A skinny looking guy wearing a gray flight suit with a flak vest on. He has a backpack on (again built by Metal Freak) with scanners which can make video recordings of battle, improves targeting for him, and an oxygen supply. He seems to wear a standard flight helmet with the mask connected to the backpack over his shoulder. His powers are Flight and Electrical Discharge - short range electrical blasts that knock people out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, Slurpina certainly seems similar to you in some ways. Should you see if you can meet her on her own and ask about her powers? Maybe she has the other abilities you have but doesn't list them?<br>\r\nOr perhaps you should just go to the Team's headquarters?</span></div></div>",

What to wear to make a good impression? Well, if you're trying to enter a Super Team probably something that at least has the Super style flair. Nothing you have looks like a super hero costume exactly, but you find a skin tight pink jogging suit. With a hair band you think you look at least presentable.<br>\r\nDriving out to the address of the team HQ you pick up a few snacks (you are getting more hungry recently you realise) to keep going for however long it would take. It was now almost ten at night and you hope you aren't too late to catch Slurpina before she leaves.<br>\r\nParking up the road from the HQ you sit back and watch the entrance. The building is blockish, a little different from the other suburban buildings about here, but looks presentable. It has the Super Team logo above the entrance, simply a black oval with 'The Eliminators!' in yellow text inside. Very unoriginal! If you get in you'll do some redesigning for sure!<br>\r\nAs you wait a thought occurs. You had assumed that Slurpina would head home, but she may sleep in the building.<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you say to yourself \"if She doesn't come out I guess I'd better go in.

Then she grabs your ankles and presses them together.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you manage, still trying to look backwards.<br>\r\nShoes are plucked off you, and your socks, and you feel something slap against the soles of your feet, then all around your feet, something wet, springy and moving! Straining suddenly your neck gives a little 'crack' and your head rotates 180 degrees! You forgot about your dislocating bones! It didn't hurt but it does feel tight in your vertebrae. You peer back and gasp, seeing Slurpina's lips sliding around your calves! She's eating you!<br>\r\nFor a few moments you freeze in shock, watching as she gulps repeatedly. You can feel the ripples of muscles as your feet are drawn into her throat, her lips gliding up over your knees. As she starts to work over your thighs you manage to break your brain freeze and desperately try to wriggle away. Unfortunately her throat muscles barely give at all, pinning you fast as she gulps again.<br>\r\n\"Stop it! *Ungh* What are you doing? I just wanted to talk.\" you say, still struggling.<br>\r\nSlurpina doesn't respond, instead she slips her hands beneath your hips and hefts up, leaving your shoulders and head all that rests on the ground as she kneels before you, her mouth a tight ring around the top of your thighs.<br>\r\nIt's incredible to watch, and watch you do with a kind of morbid fascination, as she tenses and swallows. You gasp as her lips and jaw work your rump into her mouth, her lips now near your waist. As you desperately reach down and try to grab her shoulders to stop your descent, a thought occurs to you. You can stretch and dislocate bones so could you do this? Swallow a person whole?<br>\r\nThe thought spirals away as a liquid gulp squeezes and draws your hips into her throat while she slaps one of your hands against you, then shoves it alongside you into her maw. She switches hands, the other supporting herself on the ground, and does the same to your other hand, trapping both in her mouth.<br>\r\nSmiling around your slender waist She pushes forwards, your head and shoulders grinding against the cement ground, driving your abdomen into her mouth. This can't be happening!<br>\r\nThen she shifts, bringing one knee up, foot almost up to your back as she balances. She reaches down with both hands and slides them under your shoulders. As you watch her face you can see her tense, straining muscles as she heaves back, heaving you up into the air as she stands up. You wave about above her till she gets herself steady, then the tight flesh surrounding your body relaxes.<br>\r\n\"EEEEP!\" you gasp as you slide down rapidly, still held unbending inside her body as you drop.<br>\r\nFinally your breasts bounce against her lips, halting your descent. Immediately her muscles clamp down on you once more. She must be bigger on the inside than the outside otherwise your feet would have gone below her waist by now! Looking down confirms that. Her mouth and neck are swollen around your body, her collar bones can be seen bulging out where your waist enters her torso, but below that she looks normal. Very well built normal at that!<br>\r\nFurther speculation is put aside as she reaches up and grabs your chest.<br>\r\n\"Hey cut that... Ooooh!\" you gasp as she firmly squeezes your chest and gradually mashes it down into her mouth, waddling the flesh into her. \"Aaah! Please, sto.. Eep! Stop!\" you gasp, feeling your nipples scrape over her teeth.<br>\r\nYou can't believe the sensations as she gulps and presses, finally squeezing your chest into her mouth. You gasp for breath, then gasp as she gulps hard, your chest mashed tight into her throat, pushed back by her muscular tongue, her lips riding up over the back of your head and covering your mouth.<br>\r\nHere she pauses, and looking down see her patting her belly, which hasn't even bulged an inch! Slowly she makes little jerks with her head, sliding you in slowly. You watch as her lips push up over your nose, gradually covers your eyes. As your ears are swallowed you can hear the reverberating wet slurping and gulping as she eats you. Straining you tip your head back enough to look up a little, watching her teeth pass your nose, scraping over your forehead. Another gulp sucks you down a little more, her tongue pressing against your face, cheeks on either side, her palette scraping over your crown. The view up is the dark sky, framed by two slowly closing sets of teeth, the tongue writhing around, pressing up sharply. You get to see the teeth click together her tongue heaves back, squeezing down and a swallow gulping you into her throat.<br>\r\nBones creak around you as you are squeezed down, your legs coming out into a chamber. It's tight in there, barely fitting your calves in, but it easily stretches as you enter.<br>\r\nDown and down you go, squished tight into the warm belly, finally plopping in and forced to curl up into a ball, panting hard.<br>\r\nWhy did she do that? And why are you feeling so.. so... turned on? You blush bright red as you realise that being swallowed like that felt incredibly sexy! You wonder if it feels as good to swallow someone as it does to be swallowed.</span></div></div>",

When your elbow shoves into the walls of the stomach the flesh pushes out a few inches before it returns to its original shape. You thank God that your not claustrophobic because soon you feel the stomach tighten a little causing you to be further pushed into the fetal position. Your knees rest against your temples as you breath in the humid stale air of the stomach. For a second you fear that you might suffocate. Then you remember that the ability to live without breathing is one of the numerous powers that you have gained.

You hear a door opening then closing, and then the sound of feet echoing on floorboards and ever so often vibration of your current internments breathes. All these sounds help you further to fall into a meditative state.  You are jolted out of your state as you feel something brush against your groin. Looking down, you see that it is actually your hand that had mysteriously slipped down to your slightly wet opening all by itself. \u2018Why would it do that? \u2018 You wonder as you slowly lift your hand away from your crotch.   <br>\r\n\u201cI sure hope that\u2019s a mugger or super villain.\u201d Came a commanding voice from outside the stomach. The sound makes your head spring up and bump into the flexible lining of the stomach. You rub your head, not that the stomach hurt it but more out of habit.<br>\r\n\u201cIt could be a mugger. I was to hungry to ask her.\u201d The nonchalant voice of Slurpina vibrates around you.  She thinks I\u2019m a mugger? No wonder she tried to eat me.<br>\r\n\u201cSHE! Then that means she defiantly isn\u2019t a mugger.\u201d Came the same commanding voice from earlier.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean Green Death. You don\u2019t think a woman can be a mugger? After all the women super villains we\u2019ve fought, you have trouble believing that a woman can be a criminal. That\u2019s so sexist of you.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice responds to the first voice, which you assume belongs to the leader Green Death.<br>\r\n\u201cI took her shoes off before eating her.\u201d Said Slurpina. You hope that they don\u2019t think you\u2019re a criminal or you can be in serious trouble. You don\u2019t know if Slurpina can digest people yet but this isn\u2019t the best way to find out.<br>\r\n\u201cLet me have a look at those Slurpina.\u201d After a moment the voice continued speaking. \u201cHigh heels. Not the type of footwear of your average mugger.\u201d You are so relieved to hear this that you miss what is said next. You return to listening to what is being said when you hear a third voice start to talk.<br>\r\n\u201cSlurpina, you need to let her out now. We can\u2019t deal with another law suit for sexual harassment like last time.\u201d They say with a wary tone.<br>\r\n\u201cBut this time I didn\u2019t suck anything improper more then I sucked the rest of her body.\u201d Slurpina says in her defense. You feel a blush come over you as you imagine Slurpina slowly devouring you again, only doing it while licking at your chest and crotch. This time you stop your hand from lowering to your midsection.<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much you focus on a certain area.  One word about you stuffing her breast into your mouth to a lawyer and you can kiss your paycheck goodbye. Now spit her up and hopefully we can all avoid a messy lawsuit.\u201d The voice of Green Death strictly told Slurpina. When you heard that you were going to be leaving the stomach you didn\u2019t know whether to be relieved or sad. This place was starting to grow on you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before you've even registered it your head is half way up her throat, her stomach's contractions jamming you up tightly.<br>\r\nThis is much quicker than your descent and you don't even get the chance to straighten your legs. You feel the rack of teeth over you and bright light floods in on you as you collapse in a wet heap on the floor.<br>\r\n\"Almost as nice on the way up too.\" comes Slurpina's voice above you.<br>\r\nLooking up you see her smiling face peering down at you, mask covering it, the red oval over her mouth looking rather wierd, almost like a clown mouth. She winks at you and licks her lips.<br>\r\n\"Surpina!\" Comes that commanding tone again. \"Cut it out!\"<br>\r\nYou turn and see the owner of the voice, obviously the Green Death. He has removed his helmet revealing a short cut bearded face and crew cut hair framing a very severe looking face. His costume is just as the website showed it, but they didn't do one aspect of him justice.<br>\r\nHe's a little under four foot tall!<br>\r\nSomehow, despite his height, he practically radiates authority. There is no doubt who is the boss here.<br>\r\n\"Hey, the john's backed up again, where's Freak?\" comes from across the room where a wirey kid walks in. He notices you and grins \"Oh, hey there! Take the scenic route in huh?\"<br>\r\n\"No Scott,\" Responds Green Death without turning, \"I haven't seen Freak in a while. I think she's working in her lab.\" Then he leans over and offers you his hand.<br>\r\n\"Erm, thanks.\" You manage, accepting his assistance in standing, then you notice all the saliva soaked into your jogging suit. \"Damn, only got this thing a few weeks ago!\"<br>\r\nGreen Death stares at you for a few rather uncomfortable seconds, while Slurpina and the kid (must be Captain Sky) head over to the side of the room. Glancing around you realise for the first time that this seems to be a cafeteria.<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Green Death says, interrupting your train of thought. \"Perhaps you could tell us your name and why you came here? It's obvious your attention was on us, or one of us at least.\"<br>\r\nA chuckle comes from Slurpina.<br>\r\n\"Oh I attract all the cute chicks!\"<br>\r\nCaptain Sky just shakes his head.<br>\r\nG.D. is waiting for an answer, so what'll you tell him?</span></div></div>",

I have to get home soon or the traffic\u2019s going to be killer.\u201d<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you realize that you had been blathering. \u201cThe Doctor told me I had powers similar to Slurpina. I can stretch my internal organs to great lengths and relocate my bones without pain.\u201d You tell this to them while staring at them intently. You can see no reaction on Captain Sky and Green Death except a raised eyebrow from the leader; Slurpina on the other hand looks the complete opposite. A grin had spread from ear to ear and you can see a peculiar glint in her eyes that puts you on edge. No one speaks for a moment as you fidget with the corner of your wet jogging suit. Finally Green Death clears his voice and ends the silence.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we think your lying, but if you would let me I could like to scan your mind to see if your story is true.\u201d He tries to say this while sounding as cool as possible with the suggestion of invading your mind. You hoped he would suggest this so you eagerly nod your head. <br>\r\nHe closes his eyes and after a split second he reopens them. \u201cShe\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d When he\u2019s done speaking your forced to the ground as a squealing Slurpina tackles you to the floor in a bear hug. You feel her heaviness on you, while her arms tightly wrapped around your torso. The soft weight of her breasts make your heart beat faster and you desperately struggle to get the affectionate girl off you. You see Captain Sky try to pry her off but he is unable to lift Slurpina for some reason. You figured he would be stronger. All the while you hear Slurpina whispering in your ear.<br>\r\n\u201cWe can be like sisters. I\u2019ll teach you all my tricks. I can\u2019t wait to go out on the town with you, we\u2019ll have so much fun Sweet cheeks.\u201d Finally Green Death pulls Slurpina off you, leaving you in a blushing heap on the floor. What did she mean when she called you sweet cheeks? Hopeful it was a nickname and not a description of your flavor.<br>\r\nGreen Death gives Slurpina one final nasty look before turning to you.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about Slurpina, she gets a little excited.

Everyone is looking at you with interest, especially Slurpina. It looks like she\u2019s going to jump at you again, but as if reading her mind (which he probably did) Green Death shoots Slurpina another nasty look. This is the moment of truth, you realize. The decision you make now will change your life forever. Place your life at risk and put your dreams of becoming a fashion designer (or possibly a graphic artist) on hold or go back to working at Mc Phearson Burger bar where the only thing more rawer then the hamburgers is your butt after work and continue pursuing a dream that seems impossible. Not a very hard choice.<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Death sir, I\u2019d be honored if I could join your prestigious team.\u201d You say in your best military voice.<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to have you on board.\u201d He says, and then turns to leave. Before he reaches the door he shouts out one more thing. \u201cBe here at eight hundred hours sharp. We\u2019ll get the paper work signed and you\u2019ll officially become a member of the Eliminators.\u201d Then he is gone.<br>\r\nSlurpina walks over to you, instinctually you cringe expecting another flying tackle hug but instead she puts a gloved hand on your shoulder and looks you in the eyes. For the first time you notice that her eyes are green, you hadn\u2019t noticed it while looking at her picture on the Internet. Her eyes hold an ancient look to them that speak of someone who has seen things in her short lifetime that most people will never experience. Your marvel at her eyes and slowly drifts away in your mind. <br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind the green dwarf.\u201d She says with a wide smile. \u201cHe had to leave so he could do his happy leprechaun dance where no one could see him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d You ask unintelligently.<br>\r\n\u201cYou probably don\u2019t know this but my powers are in much demand in the super hero business and up till now I was the only listed super hero with the ability to do vore.\u201d Slurpina finishes, slowly shaking her head then turning to look at Captain Sky. \u201cDo you mind leaving? This is girl talk.\u201d<br>\r\nCaptain Sky hastily starts to draw back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me I\u2019m leaving. It was nice meeting you and by the way now that you\u2019re joining the team you aren\u2019t planning any legal action for any of Slurpina\u2019s earlier actions\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI said bugger off!\u201d A fuming Slurpina says with barley suppressed growl. Captain Sky scampers off to join Green Death in the other room, leaving you alone with Slurpina.<br>\r\n\u201cHonestly, He should have stayed a lawyer and leave the super heroing to the real heroes.\u201d Turning to you, her happy go lucky smile returns. \u201cWhy not head back to my place where I can answer all your questions.\u201d<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t know what to say. Everything is going so fast, this morning you were a struggling girl with a minimum wage job and now you\u2019re a super hero, talking with a women who not ten minutes ago swallowed you whole. Part of you trusts Slurpina because you share similar powers but another part is afraid of her and the feelings she gives you. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides there are a couple of things that Slurpina said that has peaked your curiosity. Why was Green Death so excited about me joining? Why did Slurpina say that Captain Sky should have stayed a lawyer? Could you swallow people whole like Slurpina? And what is this vore thing that Slurpina mentioned earlier? You have to find out these answers before you can even start thinking about sleep. Sigh, this is going to be a long evening. <br>\r\n\u201cLead the way Slurpina, but no funny business. I don\u2019t know what you think but some people don\u2019t like being swallowed randomly.\u201d This is your failed attempt to impersonate the commanding tone of Green Death, but you end up sounding more like a bossy third grade teacher trying to discipline a child.  Slurpina just giggles at you and hastily nods her head. You have to wonder why you agreed to go with this oddball in the first place.<br>\r\nAs you head out of the Eliminators headquarters you notice that Slurpina is walking funny, you wonder if it has something to do with her powers.  Slurpina turns to you with her big red lined mouth in a big smile. Can this girl make any other facial expressions other then a smile?<br>\r\n\u201cSince you have a car would you mind giving me a ride to my apartment. I was going to walk but since you\u2019re here why not give a fellow vore user a ride home.\u201d She says while sifting her eyes into a very convincing pair of puppy dog eyes. Before you know it your answering her.<br>\r\n\u201cSure Slurpina.\u201d Then everything that she said sinks in. \u201cWhat\u2019s a vore user?\u201d you stutter out to a surprised Slurpina. Slurpina just looks at you for a second then her surprise shifts into a smile. Only this smile is different then her previous one. This smile you have seen previously when you first announced your powers.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a complete green horn to this, aren\u2019t you? I can\u2019t wait to mold you into a copy of me.\u201d Slurpina begins to slip into another world, as you start to notice a bit of drool beginning to build up in her mouth you decide to try to break her out of it.<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Slurpina, we better get going, people are starting to stare.\u201d Slurpina awakes from her fantasies with a shake of her head that causes a little of her saliva to spill onto the ground.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Sweet Cheeks got a little distracted back there. You should know though that the reason people are staring isn\u2019t because of me. It\u2019s because of you.\u201d Slurpina punctuates her words by poking her finger lightly into your chest.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would they be staring at\u2026\u201d You never get to finish because you look down and see that Slurpina\u2019s finger has pulled away from your chest all wet. You look down to see that your pink Jump suit has become skin tight from the moister you received from your trip down Slurpina\u2019s gullet. It\u2019s no wonder you were feeling cold.<br>\r\n\u201cEppp!\u201d You let out as you dash to your car and leap inside in a vain attempt to keep your modesty. All the while your doing this, Slurpina is laughing her ass off in the parking lot. <br>\r\nEventually Slurpina pulls herself together and calmly walks to your car. She slides up beside you and puts a hand on your soggy shoulder.  Slurpina\u2019s lucky that you don\u2019t have death ray vision because you would be killing Slurpina a thousand times over with the intensity of the stare your giving her.<br>\r\n\u201cRule one of vore etiquette, always take into consideration your appearance after being swallowed.\u201d Slurpina just grins at you completely oblivious to your anger. \u201cBy the way, you only have to call me Slurpina while we\u2019re on the job or in the bedroom. Other wise just call me Suzy.\u201d She puts her hand out so you can shake her hand, but when your hands touch Slurpin\u2026 err I mean Suzy, she pulls you in till you\u2019re nose to nose. \u201cNow that you know my secret identity why not reveal your real name?

You move in closer to get a better look. It seems impossible to imagine that your whole body traveled down that gullet not long ago. It looks so small and soft. Your face has neared Suzy\u2019s face that you can smell her minty fresh breath. You wonder if she slipped a breath mint after swallowing you or if her breath was another of her powers that the Internet hadn\u2019t mentioned.  You\u2019re shocked out of your deliberations when you feel something wet and slippery swab at your nose. Blushing, you sit back into the drives seat away from Suzy and her intriguing mouth. You think back to what had happened, now that you can think more clearly you realize that Suzy had licked your nose. You turn back to the playful girl, who is sitting up strait, her arms wrapped around her knees and that silly grin that suits her so well plastered on her face.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, you looked too good not to taste.\u201d You just nod your head; glad that she hasn\u2019t asked why you were leaning towards her.

Where did you go to school? Do you have any other Super friends? Do you have a boyfriend? How about a girlfriend? Have you ever swallowed a car? Are you a virgin? And how was it if your not?\u201d The Questions hit you all in one breath. You can just sigh and shake your head, the reason you agreed to go with Suzy was to get your questions answered. Not tell your life story to this Super that seems to be getting stranger every second.<br>\r\n\u201cBlue, Sister Rondo Catholic School, no, no, no, are you crazy? And that\u2019s not any of your business!\u201d The last of your patience wash away and you turn to Suzy to berate her for asking such private questions. Did she think that you were just going to tell her about your first sexual experience? Your anger disappears when you see that Suzy is pouting at you, some how when she isn\u2019t smiling it seems that she became a different person, a less beautiful person.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not answering your last two questions. \u201d You firmly say, and then you turn back to the road.<br>\r\n\u201cIt was that bad huh?\u201d Suzy says sympathetically.<br>\r\n\u201cGrrrrrr\u201d You say between grounding your teeth. You swear that you haven\u2019t been this aggravated since the time you had to take over bathroom clean up at Mc Phearson Burger bar.

Well, you might as well ask the big questions first.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is Vore?\u201d You don\u2019t take your eyes off the road while you speak. Out of the corner of your eye you see that Suzy is surprised by your question.<br>\r\n\u201cGuess you didn\u2019t do any research on your powers. From what I know vore is being interest in or sexually aroused by one creature or person eating another. There are two primary forms of vore. One is hard vore which I personally dislike greatly, it involves ripping another person apart like a lion tears its prey apart with claws and teeth.\u201d You shudder at the mental image of you participating in such an act. Your stomach does flip flops, but you settle down and continue to listen.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I did with you was soft vore, which is simply engulfing another person without tearing them apart. It\u2019s kinda like what a snake does. \u201d You nod your head in understanding. It seems simple enough; one person swallows another for his or her own personal enjoyment. In a way it\u2019s like getting full body head. <br>\r\nThe image of your naughty bits being inside Suzy\u2019s mouth replaces the more violent vore fantasy.  You feel yourself getting aroused, but push it back. Beside you Suzy gives you directions to her apartment, but you only distantly hear her. Your whole body is on autopilot, while your mind is absorbing the full ramifications of what vore could bring to your life. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You knew that the wheels in her perverted mind must be been spinning around to formulate some dastardly deed. Was she planning on eating you again? Or did she have something else in mind?<br>\r\nYou gulp, the website didn\u2019t mention her talent for swallowing people so it was also very likely that Suzy had other abilities that you weren\u2019t aware of. As your mind try\u2019s to imagine the possible super powers of the woman whose room your inside of, Suzy slips into the bathroom unnoticed. <br>\r\nWhen you final notice the host has done, you creep towards the closed bathroom door and put your ear against the cold wood. Inside you hear clothes ruffling. She\u2019s taking a bath, you surmise. Instead of the sound of running water, the sound of a deep moan comes from the bathroom. You nearly fall back as panting follows the moans of pleasure. Your cheeks redden as you try to image what must be happening behind the closed door. The pants and moans quicken as the sound of something squishy moving around begins to be heard. The different sounds eclipse each other in a melody of strange noises. You have no idea what\u2019s going on inside but whatever is happening it seems that Suzy is enjoying it. Some how this Voyeur experioance has started to arouse you and awaken your libido from slumber. You feel dirty from listening to this and bite your lip when this fact only turns you on more. God, you\u2019ve only known Suzy less then an hour and she\u2019s already turned you into a pervert.<br>\r\nThe weird slurping sound gets louder till it peaks with the thud of something hitting the ground. The moaning and panting slows down and ends with a sigh of content. You listen closely as Suzy says something about needing a cigarette, then you hear a giggle that strangely enough sounds nothing like Suzy\u2019s normal sweet, soft, silly laugh.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the heck\u2019s going on?\u201d you softly say as you lean in closer to listen for anything else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sputtering you look up and see the curly blond public hair and the enflamed vulva of Suzy. Your eyes take in the sight of her sex while noticing that it is moist and dripping with something you know isn\u2019t water. With your eyes focused on the sex hanging above your face, you fail to notice the second female standing equally naked next to Suzy. The second person makes her presence felt when she knelt down next to you and gazes at the same sex that has entrapped your vision.<br>\r\n\u201cInviting isn\u2019t it?\u201d she chuckles as you abstractedly nod your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Suzy puts on a robe so you wouldn\u2019t be distracted, you sit down on her bed in front of her and the mysterious female. Although Suzy had clothed herself, the second female hasn\u2019t which although not as distracting as Suzy\u2019s nakedness still made you slightly uncomfortable. You avert your eyes from the second girl and focus on Suzy who is practically beaming with a strange after glow that you realize must be from what happened in the bathroom. Suzy ends the awkward silence.<br>\r\n\u201cLucy, I\u2019d like you to meet Metal Freak.\u201d Suzy directs towards the blond standing adjacent to her. You glance over at Metal Freak; she waves enthusiastically at you, which makes her naked body do things that make you blush harder. You hadn\u2019t recognized her before because on the website she was wearing dark goggles and a grease covered lab coat.<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you Metal Freak,\u201d you quickly say before returning your attention to Suzy.<br>\r\n\u201cHow did she get into the bathroom?\u201d This question had been bothering you since breaking away from the bush of Surpina. When you had looked into the bathroom there was no second pair of clothes so that meant that Metal Freak was naked when she entered. Since the only way in other then the door was the window you doubted that Metal Freak had crawled in from they\u2019re naked.<br>\r\n\u201cShe was inside me of coarse,\u201d Suzy said it like it was obvious.<br>\r\n\u201cBut when I was inside your stomach I didn\u2019t see her and you didn\u2019t have a chance swallow her after because you were with me the whole time.\u201d Both girls look at you, then one another and then burst into hysterical laughter.<br>\r\n\u201cYou were right in the car Suez, she is a green horn,\u201d Freak exclaims then grabs her sides and laughs again. You can only stare at the two supers in confusion until they have calmed down.<br>\r\n\u201cSweet cheeks,\u201d Suzy says in a calming manner. \u201cDid you really think that only these lips could stretch?\u201d she says, indicating towards her mouth.<br>\r\nThe meaning behind Suzy\u2019s words sinks in and you surge to your feet.<br>\r\n\u201cShe was in there!\u201d You practically scream pointing towards Suzy\u2019s crotch. Both girls nod with silly grins on their faces. Some how this new development has made you really happy that Suzy had only stuffed you in her mouth when you first meet.<br>\r\n\u201cI usually let Freaky spend the night inside my snug confines, but I need her here so she can help you with your super abilities\u201d You nod your head, a scientist like Metal freak is just the person you should be talking to. But then you note the sly smile on Suzy\u2019s face and you start to reconsider your notion that Metal Freak is here to only talk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is there anywhere to change? In fact is there any change of clothes here?\"<br>\r\nCaptain Sky chuckles.<br>\r\n\"Oh I think we'll have something your size, and please, call me Scott. We only use pseudonyms on the street and for the press... Except for Freak. Don't think even Greeny knows her real name.\"<br>\r\nHe holds his hand out to you smiling.<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you Scott,\" you say, shaking his hand, \"My name's Lucy, Lucy Marshall.\"<br>\r\n\"So, Lucy,\" Scott says, while he shows you down a corridor, \"Given any thought to a moniker for yourself?\"<br>\r\n\"Err, I hadn't even thought about it actually.\" you mutter.<br>\r\nHe grins while showing you to an unmarked door which he opens for you.<br>\r\n\"Well, my personal suggestion is think long and hard about it, but first get a download from the Government website of all registered names. Trust me you don't want a lawsuit from some Super Girl from Manhattan who claims you stole her identity!\"<br>\r\nInside the room you see the layout of what looks like a hospital room; Medical bed, cabinets of drugs and a large unidentifiable machine that looks distinctly medical... and has a large radiation hazard label on it.<br>\r\n\"Here, we have some spares in here.\" he says opening a cupboard. \"Don't think your quite Suzy.. sorry Slurpina's size, but I think Freak's will fit OK. They're all stretch to fit anyways, and frankly Freak doesn't use her costume much with those power armor things she uses.\"<br>\r\nHe turns back showing you a jet black full body costume with gray collar, wrists and ankles, and also a small version of their logo on the left breast. Small like that it doesn't look too bad, though some color on such a stark suit wouldn't go amiss!<br>\r\n\"There are chambers you can change in back there.\" he says, pointing to a tiled area of the room where a corridor leads off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It makes a weird little squeak of shock before it's tiny head vanishes down your throat and you tumble to the floor with the creepy thing. You roll around, lips sucking hard on the wriggling monstrosity, and slowly work it's body in, forcing it's legs to the side. You glance sideways and see two others get past their panic and start towards you. With a grunt you grab a hold of it's... rump? Thorax? Whatever that end bit is called, and yank hard, gulping. An odd despirited squeak comes from inside you as you swallow it whole, it's legs twitching for a second as they slide between your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll over, dodging one and then leaping at the other spider. It squeals, then backpedals at your attack, surprised. You manage to lunge forward and grab it's mandibles. It gives a keening noise and quivers, it's legs jerking. Ah, those are sensitive huh? You grin and heave forward on them, swinging the body of the thing sideways, slamming it into the other one before opening up and pulling it's shocked face towards yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling, swinging, gulping. It takes seconds to get half the horrible thing entrenched in your throat and you roll again, once more using the body of the thing to bludgeon the other nearby spider before a huge gulp sends your meal down your throat to join it's friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll back to your haunches, staring at the other near one with a grin. It... backpedals, with what you can swear is fear on it's odd, eight eyed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Come back here lunch!\" You say and run at it, even as you see three more around you close in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to grab it before it's compatriots close in on you and get a lip lock on it's 'tail' or whatever it's called before mandibles and legs from it's friends grip you. Rolling you reach and grab those mandibles, making the owners jerk from the sensitive touch. Oh yeah, got their weakness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next minute is a rolling wrestling match. Your lips verses four spiders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips win, hands down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back up, sweaty and a grin on your face, the last twitching leg vanishes down your throat as you stare back at the final spider, who apparently has been busy tearing pretty much all of Metal Freak's clothes off her. Now it looks nervously at you, your body not showing a hint of six struggling spiders inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last chance. If you can understand me surrender.\" You say, standing up and brushing dust off your legs. The adrenaline is starting to wear off and you can feel yourself begin to shake a little, the unfamiliar situation and panic beginning to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the last spider doesn't show much sense and makes a high pitch keening sound before charging at you. Moments later it's a vanishing bulge in your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp you force yourself to relax and head up to the naked engineer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK Metal Freak, I'll get you out of there.\" You say, trying to find something to chip the wax away with.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>OK, this is possibly the weirdest situation you've been in. Went to join a super hero group, eaten a member of said group, member crapped you out thinking you digested and now you are staring up at said member from the remains of the shattered toilet bowl you landed in (rather explosively!). Thankfully Slurpina looks rather shocked and hasn't reacted in the few seconds it took you to get your bearings. Time seems to contract for you, remembering the forced consumption by Slurpina, your hopes of joining a Super group dashed, and for some reason a flashback of what the doctor was saying... oh yes, you could do this too couldn't you?<br>\r\nJust then a mean look tinges Slurpina's eyes and you can see that she is not only not pleased you survived your trip through her insides but seems to want to do something about it, probably something permanent! In panic you jump up without thinking and bash into the Hero, slamming her into the bathroom wall. The two of you tangle as you slide to the floor and you desperately stretch your jaws. You get a last shocked look from Slurpina's face as it slips into yours.<br>\r\nDamn, She's delicious!<br>\r\nImmediately she struggles, and she IS very strong, but she can't seem to dislodge your lips from her neck. She does however manage to slam your legs painfully into the wall so you desperately heave back and gulp, sucking in shoulders as you throw her body up in the air. Without leverage she just thrashes in mid air as you collapse to the ground on your back, Slurpina waving above you as she slips in. Her blowse doesn't taste good, though the shapes of her chest beneath the fabric feel nice slipping into your mouth. Gulping hard you heave her in more till her arms are pinned to her side. Now at least she can't hit you and the angle seems wrong for her to kick you either. Your pretty sure she's screaming inside you, but the noise from behind your ribs is very muffled. No wonder she couldn't hear you when you were inside her!<br>\r\nGulp swallow, bit by bit, more leisurely now, she slides in. Once past her blouse you get skin on your tongue as she'd removed her skirt and panties. Your tongue goes into overdrive as you taste her, sliding over every inch of her skin as she oozes in. Almost as an afterthought it weaves into her slit and tastes the sumptuous nectar there. You pause here, nose buried between her buttocks, and explore every inch inside her. She seems to like the experience if her shuddering is anything to go by and you caress and squeeze her delicious rump as you go.<br>\r\nEventually she slips a bit and devouring continues, your tongue flicking out of her box as she glides down your throat effortlessly. Wide thighs pass into you, knees sucked in, then you are working down her shivering calves and she suddenly jerks and bucks. Hmm was that an orgasm? Maybe all the attention you gave her earlier almost got her over the edge and now being squeezed on her whole body by your throat muscles tipped her over. You can vouch for how sensuous it is to be swallowed!<br>\r\nFinally two quivering feet slip into your jaws and disappear from view.<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, delicious! God, I could have played with those buns forever!\" you murmur softly to yourself... then stop. You've never been gay before, but now your longing over a girl's butt? For a meal perhaps, and she did deserve it, but still...<br>\r\nAnyway, now what? You could just digest her (or try) given that that was what she was about to do to you. Since she seemed scared of being eaten and earlier on seemed sure you'd digest you're pretty sure that would work. But... Could you really kill someone? Hardly heroic, whatever she tried to do to you before.<br>\r\nAlternatives? Well you could go back to the Eliminators and see what they have to say about Slurpina's activities. She said 'Greeny'  wouldn't like her choice of meals. Perhaps that meant the Green Death, the leader of the Eliminators?</span></div></div>",

They taste awful!\" and you slap your belly.<br>\r\nHmm, right now your clothes are a mess, partially digested, torn and ripped. Checking you find the remains of your purse and thankfully your phone seems to have survived as does your credit cards. Paper money did not do so well and the rest, well the less said the better. With a sigh you sort through Slurpina's clothes and try to find something to fit you.<br>\r\n\"Hope you don't mind, since you digested my clothes!\" you say to the swallowed hero.<br>\r\nOnce you've settled on a simple light blue dress and sneakers you head out (finding Slurpina's keys and locking the door behind you). Once on the street you see you're only a few blocks from the Eliminators HQ and walk off back the Super Lair.<br>\r\nIt's a short walk and you smile as you feel Slurpina squirm inside you. Idly you gulp air down for her, then remember what the doc said about you 'have the air inside you regulated to stay breathable'. Does that mean Slurpina can breath fine in there? Then you stop suddenly. Oh, yeah. That also means she wouldn't suffocate and the doc said you can't digest anything except dead meat/vegetable matter. OK, so you couldn't have digested her anyway. Well, you suppose you could have tried crushing her THEN digesting her but that seems particularly sick... well, digesting a living person also sounds somewhat sick you suppose.<br>\r\nFurther thoughts are cut off as you return to the square infront of the Eliminator's HQ. With a sigh you walk up to the door and bang on it (it's mid morning right now it seems). After a few minutes the door opens and a twenty something guy smiles out at you. Captain Sky.<br>\r\n\"Welcome citizen! What can THE ELIMINATORS do for you?\" somehow he actually manages to say it IN CAPITALS. You can almost hear the echo.<br>\r\n\"Um, well I came here yesterday to join you and bumped into Slurpina.\" You say nervously.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, she didn't show up this morning. It happens, she's not the most punctual girl around. So you're an Ord?\"<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah, but there is something more important to talk about.

Her costume is smooth (some sort of plastic or something?) but doesn't taste good. Still this does feel good so you keep slurping away and soon her terrified eyes slip into your maw and you gulp her head into your throat. With an almost absentminded yank you tear her free from the wreck of your car, ripping a good portion of the middle of her costume away in the process (seems it wasn't exactly plastic after all, maybe some new smooth, artificial cloth?). As your lips descend over her other shoulder she keeps struggling even though her free arm isn't so free any more.<br>\r\nThis seems so easy and you reach down and grab her waist, lifting her from the ground.

Two seconds (and a muffled yelp from inside you) and they're gone, only gurgles and squishing noises from inside you.<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh! BURRRP! Oh, pardon me!\" you gasp, then stare down at your perfectly flat stomach. Vaguely remembering what the doctor said about space distortion. Have you really got a full grown woman curled up in your belly? A vigorous kick felt from within proves you do!

She must be getting tired to since you only get a single punch in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take some pictures of the damage to your car for the insurance, and then try to start it up.  It doesn't even make noises like its trying.  Ugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell at least you can use your power to get it home instead of waiting for a tow truck.  It's not that far from the house you just hadn't wanted to be out at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start at the front right corner of the bumper and start stretching your mouth over the front of the car.  It's actually pretty hard to get your mouth stretched that far to begin with you have to walk around the front of the car a few times to get it inside as your jaw stretches out massively.  Your body looks really weird too as your mouth and neck are stretched out to car size but then it funnels down into your chest without any sign it's there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It doesn't taste nearly as good as your belly buddy did either.  Once you get the front end in your mouth though you start walking forward suckling your mouth up the broken windshield and along the sides of the car including the crumpled side.  Parts of it are a bit pointy from the damage and uncomfortable but not really painful.  Then you get to the wheels and realize you can't get your mouth under them, and you can't get the car to roll forward into your mouth either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully that the street is still amazingly empty. You're a bit embarrassed but you have to back off and go switch the car to neutral.  This time when you get to the wheels you're able to get the car to start rolling into your mouth with a little rocking.  Once it starts rolling it rolls right down your throat neat as can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you have to stand up somehow, and you can really feel how hard it is to move around with an extra ton of car inside you even if it isn't pushing you down.  You start heading home at a slow walk.  Despite the taste the car still makes your belly feel pleasantly full in a way that having a whole person inside you didn't even manage. Your belly buddy also seems to have given up for now, she's only moving a little bit and you think she's just trying to get comfortable now.</span></div></div>",

Plus you kind of look like a perfect victim being all of 5'2\" and a hundred twenty pounds with long naturally bright blonde hair and a pretty face that has gotten you harassed in retail a lot.  So it's really your own fault when a mugger fitting stereotypes stops you. He's scruffy looking with a baggy hoodie and a knife.  \"Hey pretty lady, if you want to keep being pretty you better hand over everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've had a long night though and you've fought a ninja.  A mugger is nothing now, so you try to just ignore him and walk past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm talking to you!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk past he reaches out with his knife and slice your arm.  After the punishment you took fighting the ninja you're a bit surprised by the pain and bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you get for ignoring me!  Now you're going to pay extra,\" he says as you turn to him no longer ignoring him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, I tried to let you go,\" you say before reaching out and grabbing his knife arm.  You're not sure about how strong your outside is but your inside can take anything a ninja could throw at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing!\" he shouts as you jerk his knife arm forward, throwing him off balance with the unexpected move, right before you open your mouth and swallow up his whole arm to the shoulder as he practically falls over into you.\"Shit you're a super!\"  He tries to use his other arm to push against your face as his knife flails around your throat, but inside your throat you can just feel it poking around without actually hurting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his right arm already in your mouth up to the shoulder though there's little he can do as your throat muscles pull his arm further in and you open your mouth up further to suck his head in.  You didn't really get to taste his arm so you lick his face a bit, the dirt and grime he's covered in is pretty disgusting, but underneath it is still pretty tasty, not nearly as much as the ninja though.  He tries to bite your tongue though so you decide to swallow a bit further.  Your throat muscles rippling as you pull his whole body in to his chest over the flailing of his other arm and his legs.  You barely have to do more with your arms than guide him in, your inertia is so high with the car that his flailing barely rocks you a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does manage to wake your belly buddy up though, you really ought to get her name.  <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"What's going on out there!</font> you hear in a teeny voice from your belly.  You can't reply with your mouth full though.  You hurry slurping the flailing mugger down, though you take off his shoes when his legs can't move much.  His clothes are just nasty and you can't even reach the tasty part underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he's down you say to yourself, well your belly really, \"Just dealing with a mugger.\"  You can't really make out her response, you think it might not have been words to begin with.  She punches your stomach a few times and lays back down though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mugger on the other hand is in the same space with your car now though since you hadn't bothered pushing that off into its own space and you can feel him jabbing around inside of you with his knife to no avail.  With time to think about it, you realize your insides must be much tougher than your outsides though you don't really know why.  Your outsides are really rubbery, so maybe that's why when the ninja hit you a couple times and you hit her it didn't do much damage whereas a cut still did damage.  You'll have to watch out for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stabbing and kicking is still pretty pleasant though, the stabbing is more like a pins and needles sensation when it feels good than actually painful, and his squirming makes you blush.  You could really get used to struggling people in your belly.  Even though the mugger tasted bad he still feels great inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't want him to mess with your car though, even if it's already a bit wrecked.  So you try and concentrate on splitting your belly again, but you can't seem to move the mugger away from the car even if you can move them both away from your intestines.  You'll just have to remember to do it before swallowing anyone next time.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't even squirming for you anymore, just sitting there screaming.  So you decided to head over to the police station instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have your Super ID yet, that usually came in the mail, but the Tau Clinic did give you a temporary paper card to use if you needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closest police station wasn't that far from your house anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you arrived at the station the mugger was loudly (or it would be if not for your belly muffling it so only you could hear) confessing his sins to God, and the ninja was yelling at him to be quiet so she could sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't any line at the moment luckily enough so you were able to talk to the officer at the desk immediately.  You took the paper card out of your wallet and showed the officer. \"Hi I have a guy that tried to mug me that I want you to take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer, J. Smith on his name card gave a tired glance over your body and a look you interpreted as wondering where you could be holding anyone. You then stood back from the desk and told your belly:  \"Hey mugger, get out of my car and reach up and I'll let you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmith's strange look that told you he wasn't experienced enough with Supers yet to be jaded to how weird they could be.  Granted neither were you, but it was your body so you could act like you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the mugger apparently wanted out desperately enough to obey.  He was pushing way up from the car and using the strange control you had over your insides now you were able to get your muscles to grip onto him and start pulling him up through the twisted path between that strange space and your throat.  In seconds you were coughing him up, thankful you no longer seemed to have a gag reflex, and that he only seemed to be coated in saliva rather than vomit.  He tasted no better coming up than going down though as you coughed him up onto the floor in a wet pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer's face was some combination of shocked, disgusted, and maybe some other things you didn't get.  But after a few seconds he picked himself up and handcuffed the mugger.  The mugger was in no state for a quick get away anyway with being slippery with saliva and still missing the shoes you left in the alley<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to fill out some paperwork and give a statement but it wasn't too difficult.  Before you left though \"Um I also have a super ninja that attacked me in there, do you want her too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" the officer spoke a bit too quickly.  \"Er, that is most of the other officers are out at The Eliminators tower after the bombing there and I'm really too inexperienced to handle that sort of thing, come back when there's someone more qualified here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I guess,\" you supposed you could give him a break, people made trouble for you at your work too and he probably doesn't know what to do with a super anyway.  You'd come back tomorrow.  As you walked out the door you smiled, it was kind of nice having her inside you anyway and you didn't want to give that feeling up anyway.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You finally arrive in your driveway around 3am and really wishing you were asleep hours ago.  You manage to cough up your car in your driveway though, not wanting to leave it in your belly overnight.  It leaves you feeling a lot easier to move but no less exhausted by the day.  Belly ninja is long since asleep and you almost think her lucky for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl into your bed and pass out in your clothes barely kicking off your shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake still feeling terribly tired a few hours later with the sun shining in the window and a belly ninja yelling at you. <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"> \"If you're going to keep me in here I need food and water!\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's hard to stay mad at her though when her jumping around in your belly feels <i>so good </i>though.  \"What's your name anyway?  I can't keep calling you ninja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punches you a bit for good measure, but that really just makes you moan a little.  You roll over to get up and she tumbles around inside your belly.  If she keeps moving around you're going to have to stay in bed for another reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to realize she's not bothering you though and replies: <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"You can call me Nina, I guess\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nina the Ninja?\" you are torn between snickering and disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"It's something you can call me at least.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright Nina the Ninja I guess I'll get you that food and water,\" you get up and head to the kitchen.  Compared to moving while you had a car inside you, with just another person it's almost like moving normally, your improved strength handles it easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder what to give her for a few moments in the kitchen, but decide to be nice since she's giving you such nice feelings right now with her pacing back and forth inside you.  You're not sure you'll ever get used to how good it feels to have someone moving around inside you.  So you pick a water bottle out of the fridge and make her a sandwich and put it in a plastic bag so it doesn't get your saliva on it.  Then you easily swallow both of them, still amused by how the water bottle distends your throat and then vanishes once it passes into your stomach, and direct them through your strange internal muscles into the section where Nina is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Thanks,\"</font> Nina replies more quietly than previously, you can't really feel her well enough to know she's eating, but you can guess it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then debate what to eat for yourself.  You suppose compared to a car no normal food is really going to fill you up, but the doctor never said anything about you really needing to eat more, just that you could eat as much as you wanted and it would all fit and never change your figure.  You've never had to calorie count to maintain your figure like others have, you suppose an early manifestation of your ability, but you still have an odd temptation to eat everything in your kitchen just because you can now.  You put it aside though, you can't really afford to pay for eating like that every day, and it's not like any amount of food is going to compare to swallowing a delicious struggling human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou end up having the same cereal and toast you usually have, carefully directing it down your main digestive path.  Then you consider the rest of your day.  You ended up going to the doctor on Saturday who referred you to the Tau Clinic where you spent much of Sunday.  Now you're contemplating if you're really going to bother going back to work at Mc Phearson Burger bar after finding out you have superpowers, maybe not the best ones, but still.  You suppose you could call in sick for the day.  You had been achy and cramped before, that's why you went to the doctor's office in the first place.  So it wouldn't be that much of a stretch, though you felt much better now anyway.  You needed time to consider your options, so yeah you'd do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get your cell phone and call in sick, you don't often get sick so you have some days saved.  Once that's done you start freshening up.  You crashed in bed last night and your hair is a mess.  You go into the bathroom and brush your teeth and try to use the toilet, but with no effect.  Oddly you don't have any urge to use the toilet and haven't in over a day now.  You guess your new digestive system means you don't produce any waste.  Maybe you should have paid more attention to the explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still spend a lot of time trying to brush out your hair, and it's at this point that Nina speaks up again.  <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"I <i>really </i>have to go to the bathroom, are you going to let me out for that?  And what about my trash?\"</font></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You think about it for a moment.  You beat her last time, but that was mostly luck from getting her stuck in the car.  If she'd been able to move around you wouldn't have had nearly so easy a time.  Plus it still ended up wrecking your car, and you don't want her to get to wreck your house too.  Even if this was a bit of a poor neighborhood you still like your house, and it being a bad neighborhood is much less of a problem for you now as last night's mugger could attest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, eating a car didn't give you stomach problems, anything she doesn't won't be anything on that scale.  You'll not even have to see, taste, or smell it either.  You will need to get it out from her though.  You concentrate on your internal muscles and shift things around again.  You make a hole that leads into your intestines from your Nina belly.  The plastic might give you trouble, but you'll just see if you end up pooping it out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your belly absently.  \"There, you can just put everything down that hole, you better not go down it yourself though!\" you decide to warn her, the doctor said living things wouldn't be digested, so she might escape that way, but you doubt she'd know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Ugh, you're terrible, this is cruel and unusual... actually you know what I'll enjoy this part!\"</font> Nina seems to change her mind after she thinks about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just take a shower and then try again to untangle your hair.  But as you're back at the mirror trying again with wet hair you feel Nina start bumping around all over inside your belly.  Mmmmm, you rub your belly and have to stop your hand drifting lower.  It feels so good when she's moving around you don't think you ever want to be without someone inside you again.  \"Aaahh... W-what are you doing down there?\" You struggle to say as you moan.</span></div></div>",

You start masturbating on the toilet quietly, but you guess you aren't as subtle as you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina stops moving around, <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Are you masturbating to this?\"</font> she asks with a bit of an unhinged tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how good it feels when you're doing that!\"  You're still trying to get off, but with her stopped it's hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Of course I don't.  I don't EAT PEOPLE!\"</font> she almost reaches a normal voice volume at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute you abandon your efforts to get off, you can't match the incredible feeling of a grown human struggling inside you with your hands.  \"Yeah you're so much better, you bombed The Eliminators building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just a job, nothing personal about it.  If I didn't someone else would have.  There's not a lot of family friendly ninja work you know.\"  She's a bit calmer now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering you work at a burger bar you're torn in how to respond to that.  Upset that she doesn't take a legitimate job like you even though you hate it, or sympathetic for her just doing her job.  Then again she did try to kill you a little, even if she did a poor job of it.  Sitting naked on the toilet with a wet slit and talking to your perfectly flat belly gives an odd sort of perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to let you out, you tried to kill me.  But... if you help me get off I can make your space bigger,\" you tentatively offer.  You can feel about how big your internal spaces are, and Nina's belly is only a couple times her size, she probably can't even stand upright without crouching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit there awkwardly on the toilet for a minute or two, considering if you should say something more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, it's worth it I guess,\" Nina finally replies a bit sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that as permission, you actually squeeze your Nina belly a little tighter around her to jump start her moving.  The flailing around inside you that kicks off jumps your arousal from nearly completely cooled off to red hot again near instantly.  Your left hand rubs your flat tummy, you can't even feel her flailing from the outside but the rubbing on the outside and the squirming on the inside feels soooo good.  Your right hand moves down to play with your clit as you mentally ripple your internal walls around Nina.  Minor spikes of pleasure run through you as she squirms and seem to bounce off the additional stimulation you're giving your clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour silky flesh walls pulsating around her don't give her enough room to really punch or kick, but she keeps trying anyway. The feeble blows far from hurting feel amazing.  The power of having a whole human inside your belly, one that could have killed you, and now you're using them as a sex toy, \"Unnn\" turns you on so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jam two fingers inside your tight pussy and orgasm harder than you ever have before, your whole body convulsing in rapturous pleasure.  The waves of spasms even go through your insides tightly, but not crushingly, caressing your occupant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lose control of your body and practically fall off the toilet.  You end up banging against the bathtub, letting it keep you from falling all the way to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"Oh, that felt way too good,\"</font> you vaguely hear Nina mumbling something inside you but you don't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there in a boneless slouch from the toilet to the edge of the bathtub for a couple minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Hey, your part of the deal!\"</font> Nina rouses you from your afterglow.  You suppose you should do that.  You close your eyes and try to focus on your insides. You generate some more space, and Nina's belly expands from a pouch 6 feet long by three feet tall and wide at its biggest points into a sort of half sphere 8 feet across, and you put a little hole to your intestines off on one side.  That's enough space for her for now, she can actually stand up and walk around a bit.  Maybe you'll give her a little more each time you have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel her start to run around inside you and jump a bit, but it seems like with the space bigger it doesn't feel nearly as good as when her every move brushed against you.  Her moving around is still a pleasant warmth, but it's no longer arousing.  It's probably for the best though, you'd never get anything done like that.  You really ought to get up, and probably shower again.</span></div></div>",

You had been just enjoying the afterglow and the feeling of Nina exercising in her new larger area.  You contemplate throwing on clothes, but that seems like it would take too long and you just throw on your fluffy pink bath robe and cinch it shut carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rings again more insistently.  \"I'm coming!\" you yell.  You make your way from the bathroom to the door and pick up the aluminum baseball bat you keep by the door for protection.  Then your brain catches up.  You don't need that anymore and you set it back down and look through the peephole.  A couple of guys in suits that might as well be embroidered with Government on the front.  Far as you know you're a law abiding citizen though, even if technically keeping Nina isn't right, you were going to get around to handing her over, eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door.  You almost laugh at the difference between these two guys in their black glasses, black suits, each about 6' tall; and then you at a bare 5'2\" with your hair still a mess in a pink fuzzy bathrobe.  With supers appearances are very deceiving though, so you aren't surprised when it gets no reaction from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on the right, maybe a few hairs shorter than the other, opens up one of those wallet badges to you. \"I'm Special Agent Rivers with the Superhuman Affairs Division,\" he gestures to his partner \"and that's Special Agent Booker, we'd like to discuss some things with you, can we come in?\"  They don't seem likely to be Supers themselves so it's probably not intended to be violent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had heard about them when you did your research yesterday.  They investigate super crimes, help keep the superheroes and Ords from going too far, and organize certification for Ords using their powers for work.  An Ord could find work with their powers without a certification, but it was usually with less pay because the government hadn't stamped that it was safe.  Though most superheroes formed their own groups or even acted alone, they usually received some degree of funding and oversight from the FBI:SAD.  There were a lot of jurisdictional battles over various aspects of Super regulation and enforcement, but the FBI had eventually managed to take over just about everything to do with them in the end.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSAD has some Super members, but their actual jurisdiction was quite broad and so they employed a lot more normal people.  Supers are rare and valuable enough that they don't tend to waste them knocking on doors for chats when they could send a normal person.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me what this is about?\"  Your stomach flutters a bit and not just from Nina's ongoing exercise.</span></div></div>",

It also allows us to generate data about what jobs a superhuman ability can be used for safely which is the most common use...\" Booker is the speaker this time, though you get the feeling he's basically giving a memorized PR/Legal boilerplate and it starts blurring together to you.  Rivers just stands in a corner paying attention to you and occasionally sweeping his eyes across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just nod your head every once in a while, a little impatient for him to get to what pertains to you, but you expect he'd just continue where he left off if you tried to hurry him.

Creamy unblemished skin, long silky blonde hair, sparkling blue eyes, pert little turned up nose, full pouty red lips, perky firm well rounded breasts, curvy hourglass figure, firmly packed butt, long luscious gams, and an air of superiority that can sap any woman's self esteem and steal any male in the area. <br>\r\nBoth squads look at you as you enter.

Face and hair are, if not in full warpaint, are quite close to it, especially since this meeting was arranged only hours ago, but it looks like all she is wearing is a bathrobe.  \"Am I too early?\" That might explain this, tho you are sure you are not.<br>\r\n     \"Not at all\" Rachel confirms, \"Please come in.\"  Since she grabs your hand and pulls you in, you hardly have any choice in the matter.  Maybe with your new powers..., but definitely not without making a terrible fuss...  Rachel shuts the door and steers you to the bedroom, again leaving you with little choice.  And her pleading smile makes you hesitate to even try.  <br>\r\n     Once in the bedroom, Rachel throws off the bathrobe, revealing that was indeed all she was wearing.  She spins around, giving you a full look at a fine body.  Then she flops on the bed and raises a leg in your direction, \"Enjoy.\"<br>\r\n     \"Now wait a minute.\" you object, \"what is going on here?\"  That vore site, had it been for real?  But surely nobody would want you to just swallow them?  Surely?<br>\r\n     \"What?  Are you another virgin?\"  Rachel's face goes from eagerly welcoming to seriously disappointed, \"Well, no matter.  We can work it out.  Here,\" she says as she sticks out a lovely leg, \"Just give my foot a kiss, even just a toe...\"<br>\r\n     You really should just run right out of here, but she is not asking much, and you have come this far...  Hesitantly you bend down and give the most tiny of kisses to her big toe.<br>\r\n       She tastes fantastic!  You doubt you have ever tasted anything half as good.  The kiss, which you have intended to be the shortest of pecks, lengthens.  You have never had a kiss this long, and you don't want to stop. When she pushes the rest of her toes into your mouth, you do not try to stop her.<br>\r\n      You try to tell yourself this is a human being you are eating alive, that she deserves better than this, even if she is willing, nay, eager.  But she is just so tasty.  Even if she wasn't smiling at you, you could not resist.  The rest of her dainty foot is shoved into your mouth, and you do not try to stop it.  Indeed, when the other foot comes calling, you open your mouth wider so it gets in too.  And before that foot is fully in, you find yourself swallowing.  \"Wonderful, you can do it from here,\" Rachel encourages, \"enjoy your meal\".<br>\r\n     You do, very much so.  Cute calves vanish and are soon followed by trim thighs.  Somewhere in the back of your mind is a voice saying this is all a terrible crime, that you must stop right away.  But it is a small voice and the shouts about her great flavor drown it out easily.  You stop only at her most sensitive spot when Rachel orders, \"Wait.  Use your tongue and you will be well rewarded.\"  <br>\r\n     Never have you tried anything that might be deemed lesbian before, but she is doing so much to make you happy...  Your tongue dart into where it should not go...<br>\r\n     Or maybe where it should always go.  Even by her wonderful standard, This is just fantastic.  And she is enjoying it too.  Her hands come down to stroke your hair, and then to clutch when she climaxes.  You in the meantime are swallowing all of her juices, and enjoying them greatly.<br>\r\n     But your appetite rules.  You have got to eat the rest of her.  So you resume devouring her.  Rachel shoves her hands into your mouth, and then to her blond curls, where they start stimulating her.  You in the meantime consume those heavenly hams, and soon you reach her slender waist.  Again Rachel explodes in delight, and smiles as you move towards her massive mounds.  <br>\r\n     These are quivering with emotion when you reach them, and and stretch you lips some more to get them in..  You caress them with your hands until they are covered by your lips.  Her nipples are tiny nails as they are going into your throat.  Rachel is blissfully muttering \"yes, yes,..Yes!\" until she goes over the top again.  Then she is quiet for a moment before she orders, \"Finish me.  I want to be in your belly.\"<br>\r\n     It is not an order your hunger will let you disobey.  Creamy shoulders slip inside and then her lips, still smiling, are covered.  Now all that is left are some strands of hair, that delightfully make their way down your throat.  You feel her curling into a ball of meat in your stomach, which somehow is saying \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n    \"Thank you.  You were delicious.\" somehow sounds like common politeness.  This was wonderful, but now what?  </span></div></div>",

Probably I'll just need a shower since this was your first time.\"<br>\r\n     \"Probably?\"  Rachel is acting all too unconcerned when her life is on the line.  \"But you are risking your life\" [In fact, you don't see how she can survive at all.] <br>\r\n     \"Now that is one of the funny things about vore.  The meal doesn't really care about her fate.  If you threaten me with cancer or an auto accident or...  Well, I'd want to avoid that.  But I'm cool with being digested.

One however covers 'Tau IDs', the governments program for recording who has powers. Before you had just ignored all the controversy over the IDs, now some of the arguments you vaguely heard on the news come back to you. Mostly people were talking about 'Big Brother for Supers' or similar issues, but there was also a lot of talk about the endless red tape that a Super had to go through to use his powers anywhere outside his/hers home. People had said this was just a method to force anyone with Powers into a formally recognized group, either a Super Team, or local community group for Ords as these had allowances to lessen government 'tracking' (the government needing you to tell them whenever you move ANYWHERE at all!) of individuals.<br>\r\nWith a sigh you gather up everything of yours here and change into your own clothes. After the usual form filling and paying the clinic's bills you find yourself on the streets once more heading home.<br>\r\nSo what are you going to do? If these 'Community Tau Groups' have lawyers to deal with the red tape rather than you having to that may be an idea. You could try to get a lawyer yourself, but that would cost a lot. As soon as you think of money you wonder, is there any way you can make your powers work for you in a higher paying job? You'll have to look up Ord jobs in the web when you get home.<br>\r\nAs you walk to your car you try to feel how you are walking, trying to sense what the doctor was saying about your increased muscles, increased mass and the inherent problems with stopping. You can feel that your gait is a little changed, but you'd barely noticed.

You guess they haven't actually spent that much on such trivialities (and from the few documentaries you think they aren't that well funded anyway) and seem to rely on a small lot infront (that was full) and parking meters up the road.<br>\r\nWhile you walk among the buildings, heading back to your car, you glance up at the facades around you. Earlier on today you were imagining jumping from roof to roof, or even flying over them! Now... who knows, maybe somehow your powers will help clean them!<br>\r\nSelf absorbed as you are you don't notice the signs till a crash sends spatters of plaster from above you. Glancing up you see a garishly clad figure in a crater in the wall. It looks like he was thrown there. Wait, you recognise him. The blue and green clashing suit, the black goggles, the long black hair. It's the Scrambler!<br>\r\nAs you stare up he shakes his head, flexes his rather impressive muscles and flies off the wall. Tracing his motion you see him smash into a group of three figures on the rooftop a block down the road.<br>\r\nFor a moment you pause, but maybe you could could help? Scrambler is hardly an 'All American Hero', more of a good vigilante, but he is still a hero in a lot of people's eyes. You see the flare of his energy pulse scatter the green figure around him all asundry.<br>\r\nTaking the plunge you decide you can at least get closer to see what's going on. Dashing across the street you head up to the building he is fighting atop, taking larger and larger strides as you test your new muscles. As the Doc said it's a little more tricky slowing down and you find yourself skidding to a halt just infront of the building, landing in a heap on the sidewalk.<br>\r\nAbove another crash sounds and you glance up.</span></div></div>",

It's parked between a couple of other trucks and you sneak between them and stand there making sure you can't be seen. Well, if someone happens to be in the woods directly in front of the truck, maybe. Otherwise you're free and clear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stretch, crick your neck... or try to. It doesn't seem to want or need to now, or be able to to! Too stretchy! Chuckling you approach your breakfast and unbutton the top of your shirt, just to be safe. Opening wide you slurp up the corner of the cab... then pause. Ooh, a nasty thought just occurred to you. You'd assumed that anyone parking here would be going into the Truck stop to sleep... but they might not. Someone could be asleep in the cab! Letting the bumper go you climb up and peer inside. After perusing several windows you have a pretty good view and find it clear. Phew! That was a relief!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to breakfast you quickly suck on the corner and pause. It seems to taste a little better than the SUV. Maybe you're getting a taste for metal? Shrugging mentally you gulp, heaving your lips over the front of the truck, stretching obscenely large over the bulk of it. It seems a lot easier than you'd guessed and soon your lips stretch up once more over the windscreen. The vertical exhausts are a bit of a pain, but you slide over one pair on the right past the cab and feel a sudden jolt as the cab tilts down into your huge interior. Oh god, your insides being bigger on the inside act like a pit for this thing! It's falling down into you! Your shoes scrape across the tarmac as the thing tips further inside you, drawing you forwards! You lean back, trying to stop but with a thunk your belly is pitched to the ground, the back of the trailer heaving upwards above you. Gasping you feel it surge in, stretching you tight in there, SOOO tight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt grinds to a halt, still sticking about ten feet above the other trucks. Oh god, someone is bound to see it! Gulping hard you suck it in, but it's getting incredibly tight in your stomach. Reaching up you can grab handholds on the frame, yanking it down as fast as you can, stuffing it in. Rear tires squeak over your lips and with a few more hefty gulps your lips close over the rear of the tanker. It's a squeeze stuffing it down your throat, your stomach REALLY complaining about the stretching it's getting, but finally it plops inside completely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping you pant on the ground, feeling it settle inside you. You sit up, finding it hard... and harder to stop moving! With a gasp you fall flat on your back. Inertia is a bitch! A little more carefully you sit back up and then stand, a little shakily. You manage to get out of the parking lot without falling over, and hopefully without being seen! You settle back into your car and start up, but driving is a git! You really have to hit the gas to get the thing moving now! And braking! Better plan ahead! You go easy, but manage to get home in one piece. A couple of times you felt yourself slide hard to one side as you rounded a corner too hard. Do that too much and you'll tip the car over next time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering out of the car you head inside and collapse on the sofa. You sit there, exhausted but happy, gut full of gas truck. You can't believe you actually did it! You've eaten a whole truck! That's totally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GURRGLE!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. You feel a tenseness inside you, then a tightness. There she goes! That's quicker than usual, maybe the stomach empties quicker if it's stretched more? Slowly the huge truck squeezes out of the stomach and into your intestines. It's tight, but not as bad as the stomach had been and you slowly grin as your overly stuffed stomach relaxes. With a happy gurgle it empties it's burden and your intestines start to ripple, drawing the huge vehicle deeper and starting to clench on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the acid test! Can you cope with this? Were you totally insane to even contemplate it? Well, it's a little late for second thoughts now!</span></div></div>",

Oh, is it still burning in there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully you stand up, staggering into the kitchen and get a glass of water... then look at it... Nope, not nearly enough!

All that mass is mostly metal and your body is heavily magnetized now. You also seem to have lost what stretchiness you had from the SUV. That's a shame. More metal, less rubber you guess. Hmmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough that WAS fun you decide not to go around sucking up other huge stuff for the moment. You've proven you can eat a eighteen wheeler and that's enough for now. But you seem to be more metal than flesh right now. Maybe you'd better get some more normal food into you and absorb it, getting your body somewhat back to what you think it should be.... or maybe some rubber?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly empty the fridge and freezer (Oooh, cold ham!) and it barely makes a dent. You almost just eat the fridge itself, but then you'd be down a fridge and it's metal... naw, leave that for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you feel confident in maneuvering with your new mass you head out and go shopping. It drops your bank account a little low but you fill your car up and bring it all home. Given the cost of meat it can't all be that, though you'd prefer it. Instead there is a lot of grain. Boxes of oats, lots of cereal, cheap rice bags. Anything you can get in large quantity, it is a lot. You've completely filled the back of your car. It takes you five loads to bring it all in, well over forty carrier bags sitting in your kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon they are gone (including the plastic bags!) and it is pretty much effortless. Sighing with the feel of food inside you you lay back on your couch as you feel stuff settle inside you. It takes a long time to exit the stomach though. Seems like such a 'small' meal doesn't stimulate the stomach to dump it's contents. After a couple of hours on the couch you try to force it and find the muscles to squeeze it out and into your intestines. From there it goes smoothly, taking less than half an hour to absorb the shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving your body to settle for an hour after you feel a little more flexible again, but still stiff. Hmm, you probably need more food, but you can't afford to go emptying the store out! Heck what you want are some slabs of meat, heck maybe you can get a whole meat carcass? Or... wait, could you eat a cow? Alive? Um, well, why not? OK so you can't digest it alive, but it'd starve inside you wouldn't it? Oh, no. It'd probably come out first. Can you crush it? Ewww! Well, yes you certainly could. You did crush the car and truck down when you digested them. Still... EWWWW! Instead, given how much your stomach has stretched, and how reluctant it is to dump stuff, you might even be able to just leave the cow in your stomach till it keels over. That would be less... icky. Starving a cow in your belly? Weird!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne other thought occurs to you, the rubber tires from the SUV were what seemed to make you stretchier. You could just gobble some of that up for now to make you more flexible, but you would then be becoming more mineral than organic! You aren't sure you like the thought of being mostly rubber and metal.</span></div></div>",

You wonder how many they have? This would have to be careful, they doubtless have some kind of security.

Gotta test that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head for your car and sidle up to it. It's still early, though dawn has gone by now, but there don't appear to be any people around just yet. Crouching down you quickly grab the rear wheel and... Oh boy that is easy! The corner of your car lifts right up off the floor! Hmm, actually lifting an object this big is tough, it just tips away from you. You try to keep your balance, heave back, bounce the car and lunge forward. Success! The car bounces up, you hanging onto the rear corner, and the rest jerks up over your head. You wobble a bit beneath it, but you've got it! Heh, it'd be childsplay to just open up and drop it down your gullet... but it's YOUR ride, and that would be a large stack of cash to replace. With a sigh you crouch, balance one wheel on the ground, sidle round awkwardly and slowly let the car down to the cement with a light bounce. Hey, you're getting the hang of this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, not much of a test. You need something big to lift! Looking around the empty, early morning streets you wonder what to try next.</span></div></div>",

You close your curtains and strip them off, it feels so freeing.  You can feel a warmth spreading faintly out from you now and wriggle a bit before starting up your session once more. Twisting back and forth, bending over and touching your toes, you go through a whole series of maneuvers and feel yourself get more and more limber as you continue. This is getting easier!<br>\r\nThen, in one stretch, you swear your arm bent more than it should. Stopping for a minute you examine your arm and force it back and forth with your other hand. After some experimentation you feel the forearm bone resist, then slowly start to shift, then finally it bends smoothly in the middle. Shocked you stop, feeling your arm bend back to normal once more, unharmed.<br>\r\n\"Woah! No more broken bones I guess!\" you mutter.<br>\r\nYou glance around the room, wondering how far this can go and go over to the door. you take firm hold of the edge of the door with one arm and then lean back, pulling hard. At first it stretches a little, but not much, and you can feel tension in the elbow and shoulder joints. You stop for a minute, let it pull itself back to normal and wriggle your arm a minute. Tensing you can feel the difference in your joints and try to hold that as you pull again. Don't want to dislocate your arm... although it probably wouldn't be so bad now.<br>\r\nOnce again holding the door frame you pull back and stretch, and find it easier now. It seems all that rubber is slowly spreading through you, getting you springier and stretchier. You tense to hold the joints in and find your arm hauled back, stretching to twice it's normal length easily. Over the next few minutes you experiment and gradually find yourself stretching more and more. Soon even your joints seem better and can feel them dislocate painlessly. Checking the other arm you find it isn't practice with the arm doing this, that one works just as well. It must just be the rubber spreading through you slowly.<br>\r\nAfter about an hour it seems to stabilise, you now being able to stretch any limb or body part to four times it's normal length. You were stretchy before (mainly openings like lips etc) but now with all this rubber you can really stretch... but unfortunately not on command. You can't just point your arm and stretch it out. You have to hold onto something and pull to stretch it. No mister fantastic then. Still it seems incredibly difficult to damage yourself now. Trying to hit or cut yourself just pushes whatever you are trying to hurt away, not damage it, and it's also more resistant to damage itself. Cool!</span></div></div>",

You remember old cartoons where the hero blows into his thumb and inflates his hand. For a laugh you try it, but there is of course nothing to blow into there. Blinking you look down at your body and your gaze lands on your breasts. Ummm.<br>\r\nYou find your new stretchiness includes your neck and easily bend over to wrap your lips around a nipple. Well, here goes! You breath deep, press your lips tight to the nipple, and blow. You gasp and release immediately, shivering with pleasure.<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" you gasp, ripple of heat washing over you for a moment.<br>\r\nOK, that felt incredible! You start again, a little more slowly, and moan as air ripples through your sensitive nipple, filling your right breast. Carefully you keep it up and soon your breast inflates to twice, then three times normal size. Stopping you release and hear/feel a hiss as air escapes through it, and have to pinch it to stop the nipple letting your breast deflate.<br>\r\nYou go to the mirror and look at yourself. Cute, but looks kind of fake, the breast too round. You smile at yourself in profile and poke your chest out, tensing muscles and bending... then find yourself shifting the breast! Frowning you tense muscles you never knew you had (or maybe never had before) and feel your breast squeeze and align itself. You manage to hold the nipple shut (though it takes concentration at first to hold it) and even shift the swollen breast to look right for it's size. Incredible!<br>\r\nYou inflate the other to match (almost orgasming from it!) and shift that one too and stare at the mirror. Those are possibly the largest, most perfect looking breasts you've ever seen! You briefly wonder about inflating your body, but realize your space distorting insides would stop it doing anything. Your insides would get bigger, but your size wouldn't change.<br>\r\nWell, you can make yourself more attractive to guys now. You chuckle admiring your incredible chest, but realize too many people would think it odd to change like this over night. You relax certain muscles and hear air escaping, letting them deflate partially, leaving them still a couple of cup sizes bigger than before but not gigantic. That'll do.<br>\r\nYou feel your belly rumble and realize you are hungry, despite your rubber meal. Smiling you get yourself a sandwich or two and feel the hunger abate. Your body still needs normal nourishment then... Still, you do still remember the interesting feeling of the chair, tires and the SUV sliding into you. Maybe you should try eating something big again?</span></div></div>",

Shakily, you try to get up, but an enormous rumble from your gut stops you in your tracks as you double up, clutching your belly. You groan, wincing as something even bigger starts to emerge!

You cry out, pounding the ground with your hands as your butt stretches incredibly. You dare a quick look back. Your waist, normal sized, is a stunning contrast to your hips which are several feet wide! Your rump is enormous, your buttocks squeezing and clenching on the hood of the SUV as it emerges from your body. You gasp at the tightness... so tight! Your anus wraps around the huge circumference of the vehicle. You wiggle your hips, feeling the weight of the car swing back and forth as it wedges out of you. With one last push, it thumps to the ground, bouncing heavily on its suspension. The bumper pops out of your rear and you sigh with tremendous relief. You collapse to the ground, rolling onto your back. You stare up at the SUV which towers over you. You massage your butt... you feel tender, but you certainly managed it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll back over and push yourself heavily to your feet.

You know, build up your extra-dimensional muscles?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back into your house you take a brief shower, chuckling as the SUV is tossed about a bit in there. You hope he doesn't loose any knick-knacks in there. Everything is gonna be spread all over the place!

I hope you don't mind if I'll keep any real information about us secret until you decide whether or not you want to join us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Join your group? What's the deal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you have to give up your current life, you'll live under secret identity and we'll do our best to remove you from any and all records. You'll come to live and work with us, we'll be your new family. The alternative is that you forget this meeting ever happened and you go back to living your normal life. Oh and never explore your abilities, if you do that on your own, you'll most likely get locked up in a secret government lab somewhere as a guinea pig for the people there who tries to find a \"cure\" to our kind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses for a short moment. \"You need time to think it over? I could contact you in a day or so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" You mumble thinking through your situation, working at a crappy burger bar, you doubt your dreams have any major chance of coming true anytime soon and now you find out that you have cool powers you can't use. It's not that tough a decision, it's not the type of superpower you've wished you had from time to time, but having a person inside you is strangely appealing, you know you can't live without ever trying now that you know you could swallow someone down whole. <br>\r\n\"I want to join.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, real good.\" He says and a pleasant smile adorns his face once more. \u201cWe'll fix everything right now if you don't mind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything? What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll take you to our hideout and we'll arrange to have your belongings brought there, your house and car sold and erase your identity as well as we can. You never know what the tau clinic and the government are up too, I can only erase the physical evidence that you went there, not the information still in the heads of the people you met there. Perhaps the doctor went straight to an agent after leaving you, what do we know? I've seen it happen before. Either way you'll be safer with us and safer still as soon as any traces of your old life is gone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels a bit creepy, especially when he turns the car onto a gloomy forest road. You're having your identity erased and putting all your trust to a complete stranger you know only as \"Shadow\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow pushes a button and a panel slides away revealing a display and more instruments, a few pressed buttons later the display flickers and then you see the face of a pretty redhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Shadow?\" The beauty queries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news, I found a new recruit fresh out of the tau clinic. I'm coming over with her right now, could you see to that her material things are taken care of? I'm sending the info over right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" She looks though the information clearly coming up on a screen in front of her. \"It'll be taken care of before the evening.\" The red headed lady ends the transmission with a smile and the words \"Can't wait to meet her.\" </span></div></div>",

You see most in our group has abilities similar to yours. That is why I sought you out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can swallow people too?\" You wonder, looking the man over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm one of the few that can't, the only way I can make people disappear is on paper.\" He chuckles. \"My abilities are centred around getting around without getting noticed, hence my name 'Shadow'.\" <br>\r\n\"So what was it you were doing before, you seemed quicker than most to abandon your old life?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I worked at a burger bar and studied to hopefully become a fashion designer. But you know it's a tough business so I figured with as slim chances as I know I have at getting somewhere especially being tau now all of a sudden, I should take this chance while having it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could sure use a fashion designer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding.\" You tease and tug at his raincoat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I see your point.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Shadow turns off the road, apparently straight into a bush, but it parts at the very last instance and you find yourself travelling through a dark tunnel with several doors opening before you only to close again once you've passed. <br>\r\nAt last he pulls the car to a halt inside a well lit garage where you see several other fancy looking cars and bikes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man is slick, before you have time to gather your impressions he\u2019s on your side of the car holding the door open for you. \u201cOh, thank you!\u201d You stutter quite surprised by both seeing him there all of a sudden and by what he\u2019s doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy pleasure madam.\u201d He grins. \u201cWe should hurry though, I\u2019m quite certain that more than Red are eager to meet you and considering what else there is to do, we should get going, you\u2019ll be quite tired before the night is over anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat much to do?\u201d You wonder getting out and following his lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeck you don\u2019t even have a proper name, we can\u2019t just call you Lucy Marshall, that name you have to leave behind. As for a new one, we don\u2019t know exactly what your powers are, so a new, fitting name might take some time.\u201d Shadow says putting a hand on your shoulder. \u201cSo you shouldn\u2019t take offence, but you\u2019ll be called a lot of names until we can find you a proper one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Trial and error?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u201d he chuckles \u201cI was referring to, \u2018tuts\u2019, \u2018love\u2019, \u2018new one\u2019, \u2018kid\u2019, \u2018sweetie\u2019, or whatever people can come up with. Just don\u2019t take it too personal, your old life is history so it\u2019s a bad idea for you to use that name here, that\u2019d just ensure that you\u2019ll keep on to it anyway and that can be dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow leads you through the complex and eventually you hear voices coming from inside the next door.</span></div></div>",

You blush and wave to everyone. \u201cHi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone practically swarms you and you find yourself separated from Shadow, the woman you saw on the screen is there though, Red was it? So you shake her hand first.<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u2019 love, I\u2019m Red.\u201d She says confirming your assumption. \u201cCome see me here after you\u2019ve said hello to the others and I\u2019ll help you out with the technicalities, okay?\u201d You nod before getting carried off by the other girls in greetings and hugs. Was that someone squeezing your rump? And there, did someone grab your boob?<br>\r\nWell at least they seem friendly enough, perhaps a bit too friendly for a first encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re not sure how on earth you\u2019re supposed to remember all names, or even if you do that, who is who.<br>\r\nYou know there were some girl called Churna who was quick to great you and then make room for her friend Innah who was equally quick to make room for other girls. Then you got a real sticky handshake, was the girl sweating like mad?<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Sue.\u201d The girl says and you get a shock as you look up at her smiling face, not because she is completely bald, but because all of her is skin-coloured, her eyes, her lips, tongue, even teeth. She sees your reaction and giggles, \u201cYeah I\u2019m a bit of a softie.\u201d She says retracting her arm, but her hand remains in yours, her arm stretching up to become longer as she makes room for a new girl and then with a wet noise her hand is pulled away from yours and she returns to normal proportions.<br>\r\nYou shake hands with three more girls like her, though only Amib stuck, as she unlike the others weren\u2019t bald but had some weird looking hair, the strands were way too thick and looked as sticky as the rest of her, also she wasn\u2019t the colour of a white girl like the others, but really dark, negro for sooth, she was nigh black, not chocolate colour.<br>\r\nThen there were Nibbler, you got the impression she was the one, or at least one of the girls groping your tender parts when you weren\u2019t looking. She was the only one you saw that had short hair, it looked real good on her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you find yourself crushed in a very friendly, yet brutally careless hug, surely the girl has strength, but not the talent for handling it. Had you not become tougher in your body you\u2019re sure you would have broken a few ribs. \u201cWelcome girly.\u201d You hear the giant giggle as she holds you tight cramming your head in between her massive tits and that\u2019s even though you\u2019re no longer standing on the floor, this woman has to be over two meters tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunger!\u201d You hear several girls snap in unison. \u201cTake it easy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly you feel the big woman let go of you and as you fall to the floor you feel her hands on your shoulders to steady you. \u201cSorry! Girly not hurt is she?\u201d you hear her ask and looking up into a beautiful face you see genuine concern in those emerald eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m alright.\u201d You smile back at her, before dodging out of her way as she tries to embrace you again, no doubt with similar roughness.<br>\r\nA couple of girls help you along and when you stand back up again they are between you and this Hunger who is led away by some other girl, probably for safety\u2019s sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, she doesn\u2019t know her own strength\u201d One of the girls apologize. \u201cLucky you that you\u2019re tougher than you look, that could have ended badly otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d You manage, looking around. \u201cSo was that everyone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no. there's quite a few more that'd want to meet you, but I guess they haven't heard of your arrival, or just haven't made it here yet.\u201d The woman smiled, you were sure that you'd gotten her name, but it was lost to you.</span></div></div>",
