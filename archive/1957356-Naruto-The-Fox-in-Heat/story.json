Naruto\u2019s seal is designed to allow some of the Kyuubi\u2019s chakra to mingle and mix with Naruto\u2019s. This however has unintentional lead to Kyuubi\u2019s pheromones being able to affect the outside world and in turn those around Naruto. Due to the chakra mixing with Naruto\u2019s however, the effects of the pheromones can affect people in ways that it was never intended to. Such as leading his friends to try and eat him alive. Now not everyone is affected by the pheromones, some people Naruto knows may act up and other won\u2019t. It\u2019s up to Naruto to figure out who he can trust and who is being affected by the foxes pheromones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first two options lean more towards vore, where as the other two can lead to vore, unbirth, or need for sex being the effects. You don\u2019t need to stick to one thing and can have a number of people affected in different ways. The last option I will leave up to you guys.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was feeling rather nervous. For the past few weeks he had noticed the people of Konoha looking at him differently. At first he thought that they were finally starting to acknowledge him and see him for who is was but, then the letters started coming. As of recent, Naruto had been getting odd letters delivered to his home. In the beginning he had just brushed them off but, now they were starting to get real freaky. As he walked through the streets of Konoha, Naruto thought back to the letters he had been getting for the past week. Many of them showed the same thing, drawings of various women eating Naruto whole or in part, with cryptic wording such as \"I want us to become whole,\" or \"I want the taste of your ramen on my lips\" accompanying the drawings. The last few didn't show Naruto at all, just the girl with a bloated stomach, the kind expected if she had swallowed a 13 year old male whole. And that hadn\u2019t even been the freakiest of them all. No, that went to the painting he had found outside his door one day. It showed a faceless girl with long straight brown hair with a braid on one side wearing a dark pink kimono-like shirt that had a long right sleeve and a short left sleeve held closed by a wide pink sash over red mesh armor and a pair of violet baggy pants. But, the part that scared him was how the pink sash was undone and the kimono top was left partly open, allowing that massive stomach the faceless girl was sporting to hang down freely. The shape of a person was clearly able to be seen through the stomach and the pile of orange clothes only helped to solidify the fact that this picture was showing a girl with him inside the stomach. Despite how terrifying the picture was and the nightmares it gave him, he held on to it. Mostly in hopes he could use the picture to pick out who was sending these creepy letters. That is, at least what his plan had been until he took a better look at the other pictures and saw that none of the words or pictures were the same, meaning that it was likely more than one person sending him these letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently he was walking around the village, trying to calm his nerves. It wasn\u2019t working. Then again, he really shouldn\u2019t have expected it to, what with nearly the entire population of Konoha, especially the females, looking at him with this look of hunger then their eyes. It was the same look he gave a big bowl of Miso ramen after being denied ramen for a few days. He never thought that he would\u2019ve preferred the looks of hate he had been living with for so long but, they were definitely better then the looks of hunger he could see in a large part of the populace. Even some of his friends were looking at him differently. He could pick out one or two who had that same look of hunger pass through their eyes but, some of the others were giving him looks that were different still and he didn\u2019t like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed as he turned a corner, hoping that this weirdness would pass soon. The last thing he wanted was to be eaten alive by someone in his own village, much less someone that he trusted. He continued walking as he let his thoughts run. <i>\u2018Then again, if I\u2019m going to be eaten alive I\u2019d much rather it be by a cute girl.\u2019</i> He thought. Images of his teammate Sakura, the blond gossip Ino, the weapon mistress TenTen, and the shy but kind hearted Hyuga heiress Hinata moved through his mind. Idly he wondered which one he would prefer being eaten by and what they would look like with a massive Naruto sized belly. As much as he didn\u2019t want to die, he couldn\u2019t help but, wonder these things as he continued moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning another corner he\u2026</span></div></div>",

The pinkette was lying sprawled on the ground in front of him, a number of important-looking papers scattered this way and that. \"Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petite kunoichi looked up at him a little blankly at first, a dazed expression on her face. But this passed in just a few seconds, and her expression changed noticeably when she registered with whom it was she had collided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite a situation that would normally have her cursing the blond out and trying to bash in that maddeningly thick skull of his, Sakura smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said, her eyes gleaming a little ominously. \"I'm fine. Just a little <i>hungry</i>, you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rapidly paled when he saw the pinkette lick her lips, still looking intently straight at him. Warning signs were popping up left and right, and klaxons were blaring in his head as Sakura proceeded to slowly gather her papers back up -- never taking more than one eye off of him as she did so -- before standing and casually brushing off her dark-ish red dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry...?\" he said a little anxiously, extremely nervous and feeling unusually vulnerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Famished</i>,\" Sakura said, eyes twinkling merrily as she stared directly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped. Yet, in spite of the apparent situation, he couldn't help trying to leverage this for his own benefit. \"Um, wanna go to Ichiraku's...?\" he asked her. \"It could be like a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura threw her head back and laughed. \"No!\" she answered cheerfully -- far too cheerfully. \"I'm thinking of something <i>much</i> more substantial.\" She then licked her lips a second time, and her smile gained an uncharacteristically sultry quality. \"In fact...\" she said, humming thoughtfully. \"Why don't we go to my place? I'll cook up something to eat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winked -- actually <i>winked</i> -- before turning to leave. She walked a few steps, swaying her hips enticingly, before turning her head to look back over her shoulder at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" she asked him, giving him unmistakable bedroom eyes. \"Do you want to come, Naruto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond gulped.</span></div></div>",

Plus, the way she was swinging her hips as she walked was sexy enough that she could have gotten him to agree to <i>anything</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he followed Sakura to her house, eager for the date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That poor, oblivious fool. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to Sakura's place, Naruto was surprised to see that none of the lights were on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are your parents?\" he asked Sakura a little worriedly. Most of the adults in the village didn't exactly like him, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out,\" was all the answer she gave him, opening the front door and gesturing for Naruto to go inside. \"Come on in, take your shoes off,\" she said, smiling in a way that made Naruto's stomach feel all strange and fluttery, and his pants feel strangely a little bit tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerald eyes twinkled, cast over Naruto's frame as he walked inside before Sakura, and the pinkette licked her lips. Her eyes lingered especially on the blond's posterior, imagining a savory Naruto rump roast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning wickedly in the shadows of the unlit entry hallway, Sakura shut the door behind her. Then she locked it, sticking the key into a very private place that her tasty-looking teammate almost <i>certainly</i> wouldn't be getting a chance to look at. All the other exits were similarly sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto would not be escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to make yourself at home, Naruto~\" Sakura called out to the blond. \"I'll make some tea, and then draw you up a bath for starters. How does that sound\u2764?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Naruto yelp, and she could easily envision the blush that was no doubt forming on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that sounds good...\" he called back, sounding a little hesitant. Most likely this was more because of nerves than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled, and she went to grab a teapot. She brewed some up (not bothering to check what kind it was) in a few minutes using the good burner on their stove, and poured some out into two cups. One was pink and the other was blue, and fragrant steam wafted up from the cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she took out a small baggy of a finely ground, odorless powder, and stirred it into Naruto's cup. This was a potent sleeping drug she had concocted using an old recipe she'd found in a book belonging to her late great grandmother. According to the description, the powder was impossible to detect using human senses, and so powerful that even an elephant could be knocked out for a day using just a thimble-full of the stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for someone Naruto's size, according to Sakura's calculations, this dosage would effectively put him into a sleep from which there was no waking -- within a reasonable degree of metabolic deviation, at any rate. Of course it wouldn't take effect right away, but that was what the bath was for. No practical pot would be big enough to cook the blond, but a bathtub could do the trick. It was an old fashioned furo, which meant she could heat the water to boiling once Naruto slipped out of consciousness and make herself some loudmouth blond stew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she licked her lips at that thought. Naruto would be doing half the work for her, if her plan carried through, and she would be sitting pretty with a belly-full of delicious teammate, diets be damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would her plan work?</span></div></div>",

Sakura had finally come to see that he was better then that stuck up jerk, Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought firmly lodged in his head he happily accepted the tea that Sakura gave him and downed it with the biggest smile on his face. Sakura quirked an eyebrow at seeing Naruto down the hot liquid so quickly wondering if he even realized that it was still scorching hot. She wasn't disappointed when Naruto suddenly went wide eyed and started gasping while holding his throat. She sighed and gave her dumb soon-to-be meal a small cup of cold water before walking off to start drawing what would be the boys last bath; if one didn't count the acid bath that he would be taking soon enough.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Few Minutes Later</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed as he stood in Sakura's bathroom naked as the day he was born.

Once the tab was adequately filled with vegetables, Sakura began sprink.ling an array of spices into the water that would ultimately compliment and enhance Naruto's flavor. She sampled the water and smiled in satisfaction - everything was tasting great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the \"broth\" was taken care of, it was time for the main course himself. Sakura grabbed a dry rub and began massaging it onto Naruto's unconscious body. The hot water was doing it's job, a delicious aroma of cooked Naruto slowly began wafting into Sakura's nostrils. She practically drooled at the smell. It was tempting just to devour him now, but she had taken the time to start preparing him, she might as well see it through to the end. Besides... once he was fully prepared he would be that much tastier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the dry rub was fully applied. Now she just had to wait. Sakura glanced at a clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... about ten more minutes should do the trick.\" Sakura said. She really didn't want to wait any longer, but she knew it would be worth it in the end. She sat back and waited for her meal to finish cooking. To Sakura's surprise, Naruto's eyes slowly drooped open after about six minutes. She wasn't surprised that he was still alive (she wanted him alive after all, the hot water was just to boil him a little and tenderize his skin), but with the dose of knockout drugs he took, he should be out for days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sah...Sakura?\" Naruto asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Naruto. I'm surprised you're awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cha-chakra. I can't feel my chakra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you took a drug that permanently cuts off access to your chakra.\" Sakura hummed. \"You don't need chakra where you're going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean...\" Naruto mumbled, life starting to return to his eyes as he regained his full senses. \"Why is it so hot in here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm cooking you.\" Sakura replied nonchalantly. \"I want you to be tender when I eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EAT ME?!\" Naruto suddenly yelled in surprise, his eyes snapping fully open. He glanced around himself in terror. There were all kinds of vegetables, the water smelled like it had spices in it, and he was coated in some kind of... rub! \"No no no! Not you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not me?\" Sakura quirked an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be one of the people who sent me those creepy letters! You're my teammate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't send you any letters; I'm not some pathetic idiot like those other girls. I didn't need to give you any warning. I always knew your destiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My destiny is to be hokage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be the hokage if you're my dinner, idiot.\" Sakura scoffed, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have about three more minutes to cook, and then yes you will be.\" Sakura grinned. \"And just so you know, you smell delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you eat me...\" Naruto protested. He tried to move his body, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't move your body unless I let you.\" Sakura explained when she saw the confused look on his face. \"I put a little seal on you to prevent you from giving me any trouble. But don't worry, I'll let you move around all you want once you're taking a little dip in my stomach acids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, please don't do this! I don't want to be eaten! Let me go. I will never say a word about this to anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't.\" Sakura chuckled. \"But that's because you'll just have added to my curves. Breast and butt fat can't talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do anything you want! I'll be your personal servant forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only interested in dinner.\" Sakura replied. \"Two minutes left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to cook me longer!\" Naruto blurted in panic. He didn't know how to get out of this, but he needed all the time he could get if he was going to figure something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I definitely do not. I don't want to cook you to death. You're going to die in here.\" Sakura patted her stomach with a predatory grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you every penny I ever make! Think of me as a disposable income!\" Naruto attempted to bargain again. \"You would never have to work a day in your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do think of you as disposable.\" Sakura chuckled. \"Just in a different kind of way than income. One more minute, then it's dinner time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK! Stop this, Sakura!\" Naruto yelled in a truly panicked voice. Seeing his utter terror struck something primal and predatory in Sakura. Seeing that fear in her soon-to-be dinner only made her want to eat him that much more. She slowly licked her lips in anticipation of the upcoming meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't lick your lips like that!\" Naruto sputtered in fear. \"Get me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you out of there in 30 seconds, Naruto.\" Sakura said with a smug grin. \"I'll get you out of that bath so you can take your final bath in my stomach acids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO NO NO! I DON'T WANT THIS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10 seconds!\" Sakura said with anticipation. Her mouth was salivating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T EAT ME! I'M NOT FOOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner time!\" Sakura cheered after the 10 seconds had passed.</span></div></div>",

She went to grab his hips so she could lift him up high enough to start swallowing his feet, but she only managed to burn herself. Turns out, taking someone out of extremely hot water meant they were going to be too hot to touch for a little bit. She yelped and dropped her dinner in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.

Don't worry though, you should only need to cool off for about a minute, and then I'll finally have you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M WORRYING, SAKURA!\" Naruto yelled. \"SOMEBODY, ANYBODY, HELP!

Hurry up and cool down already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though his body was burning from its time in the hot water, Naruto found himself wishing he could keep himself so scalding hot forever.

At this point, he knew it was useless. Sakura made it very clear what she thought about him. But he couldn't stop himself from trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do! If I eat you too soon, you'll burn my mouth.\" Sakura countered. \"You don't want me to burn my mouth, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the very least!\" Naruto snapped back. \"I hope I burn every taste bud off your tongue! I also hope I give you indigestion and make you fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not very nice...\" Sakura replied, frowning in disapproval. \"But don't worry, you won't do any of that. I've taken precautions!\" She pressed another tentative hand to his thigh and a wicked grin spread across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! Cool enough to eat!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura grabbed Naruto's hips and lifted him into the air. She locked her eyes onto his and slowly licked her lips in anticipation of her meal. This was what she had been waiting for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to meet your destiny?\" Sakura taunted. \"I hope you are, because I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Sakura opened her mouth and took Naruto's feet into her mouth. One powerful swallow was all it took to send his feet down her throat. Naruto started screaming and begging incoherently in fear as the reality of his situation fully hit him. There was no escape. He was his teammate's dinner. Sakura kept her eyes locked onto Naruto's as she ever so slowly swallowed more and more of him down. She wanted to draw this process out as long as possible. Both because he tasted absolutely <i>heavenly</i> and because his desperate pleas and struggles evoked something in her predatorial side that she couldn't explain, but that she absolutely loved. The complete feeling of victory and dominance she felt from turning Naruto into her dinner was ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she swallowed more and more of him down, his body began to make a slight (slowly-expanding) bulge in her stomach. She grinned when she saw his terrified eyes land on her stomach and took another swallow sending more of him into her. His entire lower body was now inside of her. His hips and upper body would be joining his lower half soon. As Naruto's dick neared her mouth, Sakura took a powerful swallow, instantly sending it down her throat. She had heard some women would give their meals a last treat and play with the dick, but Sakura wasn't interested in that. She had zero interest in giving Naruto any semblance of pleasure. He was food to her. She didn't pleasure a hamburger before eating it, so why the hell should she give Naruto one last ride?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that Naruto, who had been in love with her (and annoyed the crap out of her) ever since she could remember, was going to die in her stomach a virgin thrilled Sakura. She swallowed a little bit, sending more of her teammate down her throat. The closer he got to the end, the more Naruto panicked, and Sakura was <i>loving</i> it. She had to wait a while for this, but it was definitely worth the wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been so angry when Naruto was placed on her team, but now, it was totally worth it. She wouldn't have gotten this opportunity to devour him if she wasn't his teammate. Their training/mission schedules would be different. She barely saw the other people she graduated with, and she definitely didn't have time to build a sense of trust with them to lure them into a trap like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her lips reached his sternum, she reflected on when she first decided he was going to be her dinner. Naruto asked if she wanted to get lunch with her now that they were on the same team, and she of course said no. Then, an idle thought drifted through her head. She thought to herself, the only way she would get lunch with Naruto is if he <i>were</i> her lunch. That thought then spiraled and morphed until she decided that, with absolutely certainty, Naruto Uzumaki was going to be her dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite fun for her after that. Every time he proudly proclaimed that he was going to be the strongest, that he would surpass Sasuke, that he would become hokage... It took everything she had not to giggle. Because she knew the truth. He was going to be coated in her stomach acids and digested long before he could ever hope to achieve any of those ridiculous goals. He was going to be fat on her butt (and hopefully her boobs).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sa-Sakura...\" Naruto stammered out. This was the first coherent thing he said since she started swallowing him. She took another swallow so everything but his shoulders and above were inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... please, I beg of you... Don't do this. I'll help you find someone else to have. Hell, I'll help you prepare them! Just...please... don't eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura giggled and a predatory, yet smug and victorious look flashed across her eyes. In reply to Naruto's plea, she took another swallow, sending his shoulders down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! PLEASE! SAKURA, YOU CAN'T DO THIS! I'M YOUR TEAMMATE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura just flashed Naruto a cruel look before taking another swallow. Now only his head remained in the outside world. She paused, because she wanted to savor this moment. This was the moment that she would be completely victorious over Naruto. She waited for his eyes to travel to her now bulging stomach and she reveled in the horrified cry he emitted upon seeing the results of his body in hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! I'LL DO ANYTHING!\" Naruto sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura flashed him one final smug look and swallowed, sending his head into her mouth. She closed her mouth over Naruto's head, sealing him inside. She giggled again when she heard his muffled cries. She was on cloud nine. This was it. This was the moment. She leaned her head back and took one powerful final swallow, sending Naruto's head down her throat to join the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*burp!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" Sakura giggled. \"God you were the best dinner I've ever had. I did such a good job preparing you.\" She happily moaned.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that his fate was sealed, Sakura finally used the seal she had placed on Naruto to let his body move. She grinned widely when he instantly started desperately squirming within her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... that's good. Squirm for me, Naruto.\" Sakura moaned. \"That will just cover you in my stomach acids that much quicker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knowledge that Sakura wanted him to squirm (and that it actually only hastened his demise) did not do anything to stop Naruto. He was trapped inside of his beautiful teammate's stomach. Survival instincts had fully kicked in. Squirming and desperately pushing against Sakura's stomach walls were the only chances he had of somehow escaping this hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha.\" Sakura laughed. \"Look at you, squirming with all your might, as if it will make a difference. It won't, Naruto. I told you, you're my dinner. Why don't you just enjoy your little acid bath instead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET...ME...OUT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will later. Once you're broken down and my body has converted as much of you as it can to useful fuel. Once that happens, I'll have no use for what's left of you, and I'll squeeze you out of my butt before flushing you down the drain.\" Sakura replied nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to... AAAH! This hurts!\" Naruto suddenly cried out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind, please do try to become breast and butt fat, ok? If you enhance my curves some, I'll definitely be able to get Sasuke-kun to like me!\" Sakura casually replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura... please... this...HURTS...AARGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you're being digested alive, stupid.\" Sakura giggled. \"Acid hurts. Especially when it's breaking your entire body down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...isn't...right...\" Naruto panted out in a pained voice. \"I saved you...from Gaara...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that. And now you've saved me not having an amazing dinner tonight! You're so helpful.\" Sakura added the last part in a mocking voice. \"Now, if you don't mind, would you quiet down a little? My favorite show to watch after dinner is on. Do digest quietly from here on out, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW...OWWW FUCK! How... can you do this to me...\" Naruto ground out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet!\" Sakura slapped her stomach, eliciting a howl of pain from the meal trapped inside of it.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------<br>\r\n<i><b>SIX HOURS LATER</b></i><br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next six hours, Sakura watched TV while enjoying the struggles of her dinner. Naruto did not in fact quiet down when she told him. He still screamed out in agony and pleaded for mercy. But Sakura was glad he did, because she loved hearing it. She would have to catch her shows later, but that was ok. Her stomach steadily shrunk as she digested the idiot, but to her surprise, he was still alive inside of her six hours later. She had heard that live meals like Naruto would usually be dead within a few hours, and they usually passed out before that. But here Naruto was, still going strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still alive?\" She yawned, taunting him some more. \"God, you really are the best dinner ever! I'm glad you're still here, but how the hell haven't you been completely digested yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura may not have known how he was still alive, but inside of her stomach, Naruto knew exactly what...the <i>Kyuubi</i>. The evil fox demon wasn't content with letting him digest quickly... oh no. It was working to regenerate his body. The dim red light of the Kyuubi's foul chakra provided just enough light in the chamber of Sakura's stomach that Naruto could see the state of his body. And it was not a pretty sight to say the least. Right now, the Kyuubi was working on regenerating his right arm, which Naruto had painfully felt (and watched) get dissolved earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please...\" He weakly begged. \"It's not too late... let me out.\" He knew that was a lie. It was too late. Despite the Kyuubi's attempts to regenerate his body, Sakura's stomach acids were the more powerful force. She had digested half of his body right now. Even if she did let him out, it would be too late. He was...dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha.\" Sakura laughed. \"Still begging for mercy. I love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd did she ever love it. This feeling of absolute victory was one she would cherish for years to come. Naruto was trying as hard as he could to survive in her gut, but her stomach acids were still breaking him down. It may take longer than she initially thought, but he would eventually be nothing more than fat on her butt/boobs and crap. She had taken a boy who had grand aspirations and dreams, and turned him into a worthless dinner. In the end, Naruto would be no better than a hamburger or a salad, or even one of the Naruto pieces in a bowl of ramen he was named after!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started laughing even harder at that thought. She couldn't <i>not</i> share it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't...\" Naruto futilely begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you're still fighting it. Your name is <i>Naruto</i>, which is a topping in ramen. Clearly, you were meant to be someone's dinner. You're just lucky I decided to make you the main course instead of a mere topping. I'm giving you a bigger honor here than you deserved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Naruto's pained weeping was music to Sakura's ears. All the times he had annoyed her, gotten in between her and Sasuke... This was the greatest night of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hours progressed, Sakura's stomach slowly but surely shrank bit by bit. It was getting late, but Sakura did not want to miss a second of this. She was going to enjoy this as long as Naruto was alive. And so, for the next five hours Naruto weekly pleaded, begged, cried and cursed while Sakura simply reveled in his misery. She loved checking in on her gut and seeing it ever smaller, knowing full well that meant more of Naruto had been digested. Meaning that more of Naruto had been defeated by her stomach. After five hours though, Naruto stopped pleading. He became completely quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally give up?\" Sakura crowed. She figured he was gone, but she couldn't help but taunt him more anyways. \"Finally accepted that you're nothing more than my dinner? That you're nothing more than a worthless piece of shit who no one will ever remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Sakura, Naruto <i>could</i> hear her words. And they stung almost as badly as her stomach acids. He stopped begging for mercy because his vocal cords had been digested. The Kyuubi was focusing its chakra on his vitals now to keep him alive. He weakly moved back and forth to let Sakura know that he was still in here and that he still hadn't given up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\" Sakura laughed. \"You're still alive? This is awesome! You can actually hear me! How much time do you have left I wonder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a good question, and one that Naruto had an idea on. The Kyuubi, which seemingly had an infinite amount of chakra, was actually reaching its limit. Sakura's powerful stomach was <i>this</i> close to overpowering one of the most powerful demons to ever live. Once the Kyuubi ran out of chakra, he would not last for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been a lot of fun tonight.\" Sakura hummed. \"I knew you were going to be a great dinner, but I never expected this. That's just further proof to me that this was always your true destiny. You would not have been such a great meal that lasted so long if you weren't meant for this. You've always been looking for something that you're good at, Naruto, and you finally found it...here in my stomach!\" She patted her stomach, causing flashes of pain to shoot through the small amount of Naruto's body that remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light of the Kyuubi's chakra flickered and a feeling of dread overcame Naruto. Despite the horrible pain he had endured to this point, and the state of his body, he was not ready. He was not ready to die. He rocked his body and squirmed desperately, which only caused his teammate to laugh harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must almost be over. Is this your final struggle?\" Sakura taunted. \"Time to finally accept defeat by my stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kyuubi's chakra flickered again, and again, and then...darkness. The Kyuubi's chakra was finally exhausted, defeated by Sakura's powerful stomach acids. Without the Kyuubi protecting him, Sakura's stomach acids quickly went to work finishing him off. He began desperately squirming in pain and desperation. This couldn't be it... He was going to be hokage - not fat on his hot teammate's ass! He was going to be hokage - not fat his hot teammate's boobs! He was going to be the hokage - not a pile of his hot teammate's crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura grinned wickedly as she felt Naruto's final, desperate struggle within her. His final struggle only lasted a few minutes until it finally came to a halt. She wasn't sure how, but she somehow just knew he was still clinging to his last seconds of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the dinner, moron. Have fun becoming fat and crap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Naruto's struggles within her completely stopped. She giggled to herself. She had actually done it! Naruto Uzumaki was no more!</span></div></div>",

She got out of her bed and grinned when she saw that her stomach was completely flat. Judging by the feeling in her bowels, her body was completely done with Naruto. She took off her clothes and walked into her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!\" She cheered when she saw her boobs. They still weren't giants like Tsunade's, but with the addition of Naruto, they had filled into some decent-sized perky b-cups. She spun around and smiled when she saw that her ass was a little fatter (in a good way) and rounder than before too. It seems Naruto made a good addition. She examined her body for any...less enviable additions and smiled when she saw none. Naruto just went straight to her tits and ass, just like she wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With these additions, I'm surprised there's anything left of you.\" Sakura hummed. She plopped down onto the toilet and began to do her business. Despite her new enhancements, there was still quite a large portion of Naruto that went unused and was turned into her crap. She squeezed him out, turd by turd for a few minutes before she had finally gotten rid of all of him. She wiped herself, stood up and looked down into the toilet bowl. She wanted to see this. She wanted to see what she had reduced him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God you look even uglier now than you did before, and you stink too!\" Sakura giggled. All that remained of Naruto Uzumaki was some swirly turds in her toilet bowl littered with his bones. Near the top, she could see his skull, and miraculously, a small patch of blonde hair remained that identified him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the dinner, loser.\" Sakura said smugly.

She went to put on a bra, but found that she didn't have one to fit her new, Naruto-enhanced boobs. She shrugged, and put on a pair of panties. They were much tighter than they were before Naruto became fat on her ass, but luckily she could still fit into them. She threw on her standard bicycle shorts, which suffered the same problem as her panties before finally putting on her red dress. She glanced at herself in the mirror and noted that the dress was stretched very tight in the chest region. It was stretched so tight, in fact, that her nipples were pretty visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there wasn't really much she could do about it. She had no way of predicting how much Naruto would enhance her body before eating him, so she didn't have a chance to buy new clothes. That was a problem for later though.

That's hysterical!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And boobs!\" Sakura added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelief flooded through Sasuke. Truthfully, Naruto was becoming a major problem. He had been advancing so rapidly, that Sasuke was starting to get frustrated at his own progression as a result. He was actually considering abandoning the village to go with Orochimaru and get more power. But considering Naruto was defeated by <i>Sakura</i> of all people, it appeared that Sasuke was wrong about him. Naruto's progression could not have been that great if he ended up as fat on the ass of a kunoichi of Sakura's strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen? Did you beat him up? How long have you been thinking about doing this?\" Sasuke blurted out all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So curious, Sasuke-kun.\" Sakura giggled. \"Well... I've been planning this pretty much since the first day we all became a team. Naruto asked me to lunch, and I thought to myself that the only way I would get lunch with him was if he was my lunch... And then it just kind of spiraled from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since the beginning?\" Sasuke gasped. He never suspected a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm.\" Sakura confirmed. \"That moron was destined to be my dinner from day one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how did it happen?\" Sasuke pressed. He had to know all the details about his former rival's demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked him if he wanted to come over to my house for dinner, and I specifically said that I was going to cook something to eat, but didn't say I would kick it for him. The hints were there from the start, but he accepted my offer, thinking we were going on some date. Then, slipped some drugs into a cup of tea that permanently cut off his access to his chakra and knock him out and had him go take a bath. As soon as he was out, I decided to cook him in a stew, turned up the heat and started cooking him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a fucking idiot. That was such an obvious trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Sakura giggled. \"I didn't bother trying to be secretive, because I knew he was stupid enough to fall right into any trap I set. So, I seasoned him, added some vegetables and spices to the water he was cooking in and then covered him in a wonderful rub before settling in to wait for him to finish cooking. Surprisingly, he actually woke up while he was still cooking, and you should have seen the look on his face when I told him he was going to be my dinner! He tried to threaten me, but I had placed a seal on his body that let me keep his body essentially paralyzed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasuke listened to Sakura's tale about Naruto's final moments, he couldn't help but feel more at ease. Naruto wasn't getting better than him; Naruto got caught in an obvious trap and was devoured. Sasuke would never fall into such an easy trap. Clearly, Naruto's progression was overrated. The more Sakura talked, the more confident Sasuke became that he could gain the power needed to kill his brother here, in Konoha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So after letting him cool off, I made sure to eat him as slowly as I could. And the idiot screamed, begged and pleaded as he slowly slid down my throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slowly, was that because he was the first one you had... you know? And you couldn't do it any faster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was the first boy I've eaten.\" Sakura confirmed. \"But I did it slowly to prolong his terror. It was so <i>hilarious</i> watching him plead, scream and cry like a little wimp. I also cooked him to perfection, so I wanted to savor his flavor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then he was digested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Sakura replied, smiling fondly at the memory. \"And boy did he last in here for a while.\" Sakura rubbed her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most boys are supposed to die within a few hours of being in a stomach, and pass out in an hour. But not Naruto. It took us a while, but we <i>finally</i> found something that idiot was good at - being eaten.\" Sakura giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long did he last?\" Sasuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was in my stomach, being digested alive, for about 11 total hours. It was hilarious, Sasuke! He kept trying to struggle, plead with me and even screamed in pain as my stomach acids overpowered his weak and worthless ass. But finally, the fun came to an end and he contributed to the two parts of my body I had hoped. Of course, he was so weak and useless that my body didn't use a good chunk of him. I actually crapped him out this morning and flushed him down the toilet.\" Sakura laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke grinned. How many times had Naruto gotten in his way? How many times had Naruto frustrated him? How many times had Naruto made him question himself? And now look at him - he literally was turned into Sakura's crap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura... thank you for telling me all that. You have no idea how much I needed to hear it.\" Sasuke said. \"I'm glad you got to enjoy him, and I'm glad you got <i>some</i> use out of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blushed at Sasuke's comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my pleasure, Sasuke-kun!\"</span></div></div>",

That could have been a mistake. Telling Sasuke was one thing, he hated Naruto almost as much as she did and wouldn't be upset... but telling a random villager could be trouble. If they caused a stink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE DEMON IS DEAD!\" The villager yelled in joy. \"THIS GIRL DEFEATED THE DEMON!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Sakura blinked in surprise (unaware of Naruto's secret).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd gathered and started praising her for doing away with the demon scum. Some were kind enough to explain that the \"demon\" they were referring to was Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, it looks like the demon made your clothes fit a little too tight. I own a clothing store nearby. Please stop by. I will give you whatever you want on the house! You can take the entire store stock if you want for all I care!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do that.\" Sakura grinned. Well, this was a surprise. She knew Naruto wasn't popular due to his pranks, but these villagers really hated him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for devouring the demon, Miss. I am happy to hear that he died a horrible and painful death in your stomach. That's a very fitting end for him!\" A random woman said, handing Sakura a stack of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news spread like wildfire throughout the village, and soon enough, a full brown celebration was going on around Sasuke and Sakura, with Sakura as the guest of honor. She was lauded and given so many gifts... all for eating her annoying teammate! If she had known she was going to get this treatment, she would've had Naruto take a bath in her stomach acids much sooner!</span></div></div>",

The crowd parted to make way for the village leader. Tsunade made her way to Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunade-sama... Hi.\" Sakura awkwardly greeted. She definitely didn't think this one through! Tsunade was close to Naruto for some reason. She was not going to be very happy to learn about his ultimate fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hokage-sama, Sakura-sama has devoured the demon! He plagues our village no more!\" One of the villagers spoke up, defending his new hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've told you a million times...\" Tsunade growled. \"That demon's name is Nar...\" Her eyes landed on Sakura's Naruto-enhanced chest and she stopped herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose it doesn't matter anymore.\" Tsunade sighed. \"He's just breast fat now.\" Sakura felt a surge of pride that her chest caused Tsunade to switch gears like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And butt fat!\" A random villager added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And literal crap somewhere in the sewers now!\" Another chimed in, causing the crowd to laugh. Their laughter erased the look of fear on Sakura's face, and she actually started laughing about it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed. This is not what she wanted for Naruto. He was on the right path. He was well on his way to gaining the respect of all these villagers who were celebrating his demise. Given a few years, Tsunade was confident he could've changed their minds. But it didn't matter now. Her eyes trailed down to Sakura's backside, noting that the boy did indeed contribute nicely to it. She sighed. Technically, Sakura murdered her teammate. That was a capital offense... but what was she going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she punished Sakura, the village would riot. And... Sakura used the same method to start enhancing her chest as Tsunade did. She glanced down at her own massive rack. She couldn't even remember the names of all the men who contributed to her girls. And she was just starting to take an interest in Sakura...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't going to punish her, are you?\" Sasuke asked the hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed again. She didn't want to say what she was about to, but she had to keep up appearances. There was no use in defending breast and butt fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I punish her? The demon is fat on her ass! Konoha is safe!\" Tsunade said, causing all the gathered villagers to cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I could help protect the village, Tsunade-sama.\" Sakura said with a respectful bow, but there was a smug grin on her face. And why wouldn't there be? She devoured a teammate she found annoying and was now being celebrated as a village hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough... as much as she hated to admit it, Sakura was a true village hero, the girl just didn't know why. There was no trace of the Kyuubi in her body. The great tailed beast was digested, right along with Naruto. Sakura's stomach acids actually managed to overpower the mighty Kyuubi. Even more, the Akatsuki was starting to get active and hunt for the tailed beasts. They didn't know what the Akatsuki's plans were, but now that there was no Kyuubi, the Akatsuki had no reason to attack Konoha to get to Naruto. Hell, the Akatsuki's plan likely needed the Kyuubi to succeed, and now that that the Kyuubi was gone, their plan was stopped before it could get off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Naruto's new status as Sakura's butt fat had other effects as well. Tsunade had started to sense a darkness rising in Sasuke Uchiha. She could see his frustration building, and was starting to think he was a flight risk. Kakashi had informed her that Naruto's progression was one of the main contributing factors to Ssasuke's frustration. Now that Naruto had joined his other teammate's body, Sasuke seemed brighter and more relieved. The rising darkness that Tsunade once sensed was gone. And in its place, was a renewed confidence and optimism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mentally groaned. Sakura having Naruto for dinner actually turned out to be the absolute best thing for the village. It was a shame that Tsunade couldn't protect the boy, but if she had a way to go back, she probably wouldn't intervene. She would sit back and let Naruto get devoured all over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really hated being a hokage sometimes...</span></div></div>",

Is that right? Tell me something then if you cared so much about Naruto....Where were you when he was getting beaten, teased, insulted,  and mocked? Where were you when he was constantly suffering heartbreak at the hands of that weak pink haired bitch?! WHERE WERE YOU WHEN MY SON WAS TRICKED AND EATEN BY HER?!\" Kushina's hair was floating in nine strands and her eyes glowed as a red aura of pure power surrounded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gasped, \"S-Son?! If you called Naruto-kun son that means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina nods still glaring,  \"Yes Naruto is my son, my only child. Despite my embarrassment of how he died I still love him and didn't want him suffering the same hell of being alone in the afterlife as he did here in life, so I decided to become his eternal prison instead.\" She then looks at Hinata. \"You claim to care about my son but you never made an attempt to get to know him or even help him with his pain.\" She scowled,  \"If things were different and we were both fully alive I wouldn't let you with 10 meters of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was shaking in fear of the red head's monstrous chakra pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina rubs her belly and licks her lips ,  \"Being brought back to this world has made me hungry very hungry.\" She shot her golden chains at Hinata. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata tried to use her clan's defense to block them. But Kushina's chains were able to easily subdue the Kyuubi itself a human stood no chance. The chains instantly wrapped around Hinata pinning her arms to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata squrimed and struggles to break free to no avail the chains drained her energy and left her tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina had released the jutsu so she couldn't be controlled. She drags Hinata over to her and liffs her upside down opening her mouth wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was too tired by the chains to struggle but the fear in her eyes said all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina lowered the Hyuga head-first into her mouth and purrs at the taste. \"Delicious, \" She gulps slowly pulling Hinata further down assisted by her chains lowering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata screamed as she was being devoured by her own crush's mother. \"NO PLEASE DON'T EAT ME! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina gulps Hinata down more pulling her shoulders into her mouth as Hinata's head entered her throat and slowly went down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata screamed in terror as she was pulled  further down Kushina's esophagus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina gropes Hinata's Large C to D cups much to the Hyuga's embarrassment. She spoke muffled around Hinata's body, \"Bigger than I was at that age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata squrimed as best she could with Kushina's chains draining her chakra and her tight accommodations. She squeaked blushing scarlet when she felt Kushina's hands grope her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina pulls in Hinata's ample chest and gulps her down slowly further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was soon able to see a faint light at the end of the esophagus and knows she had just entered Kushina's stomach. She spotted Naruto who was up to his chest right now in stomach acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was screaming in agony in his own hell right now. He kept trying to get out of the acid only for the limbs he was using to swim suddenly dissolve and reform in a swirl of ashes. Not to mention his lower body and legs constantly dissolving and reforming.  He was in pure hell and didn't even notice Hinata coming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata tried to call to him to comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina gulped and was able to get Hinata's own bloated belly into her mouth and slurp slowly  it down like jelly  pudding. It paid to be revived by Edo Tensei as you didn't need to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata opened her mouth to scream and her head was plunged right into the deadly acid with Kushina's latest gulp causing her to swallow it as well have her face slowly melting to the bone in a very gruesome manner and it went also into her ears like water and began eating through her brain causing instant death, her eyes were immediately digested revealing her empty eye sockets. Kushina's stomach acid began to quickly eat through the now dead Hyuga's head as she was now just meat with more meat inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina dismissed her chains and tilted her head back gulping the legs slowly nto her mouth and closes her mouth around them before closing her eyes and giving a loud audible final gulp sending her latest prey to join her son in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina's belly was now even bigger than before. She belched loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>*BURP!*</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina sighed and strokes her gurgling belly as it began to work on breaking down its newest meal and of course still working on Naruto as well. She closes her eyes to relax and let her newly revived body do its job.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This all because it's the world is full of hatred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina looked at him. \"How did you know that the seal was weakened during childbirth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madara told me.\"  Obito replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina gasped she knew the horrible tales of the biggest traitor in Konoha history, her relative Mito had told her stories about those days when Kushina was still a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObito coughed up blood, he suffered the same disease that Itachi had, \"Kushina-san I really am sorry for what I caused....I had forgotten everything Minato-sensei had taught me. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina returned her features to normal. \"Obito what was it Madara wanted you to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObito smiled weakly, \"He called it Project  Tsuki No Me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina listens as Obito explained about the plan and its phases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObito finally died laying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina's mind was reeling with the new information. <i>A new world where no one has to die? Naruto...Minato-kun...</i>  She hugged herself imagining hugging both her son who was actually alive and her husband. \"It sounds like thougb it wouldn't be real but a dream world...and dreams have to end sometime. \" She looks at the body of her late husband's student. \"I can't just leave him,here for someone to find and experiment on.\" She walked over and shoves the head into her mouth and quickly swallows the corpse down with two fast gulps. Her belly expanded greatly and jiggled. She burps loudly and rubs her belly as it works on digesting the fresh meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kushina looks back behind her with a mad glare to see who prevented her from rightfully (in her eyes right now )  punishing HER son. Her eyes widened in shock at who she saw. \"No...No way....\" before her was a woman with long, bright-red hair and large, pupiless eyes. She wore an elaborate, high-collared kimono with the Uzushiogakure symbol on the back of the obi which was tied around her waist. Her hair was arranged in buns with hair pins in them and three clips in the front. She also wore a dark shade of red lipstick and had a gem-like marking on her forehead, reminiscent of the Strength of a Hundred Seal. She also wore tags with kanji written on them in her hair decals. This woman was Mito Uzumaki Kushina's and Naruto's predecessor as the Kyuubi Jinchuriki. Kushina was stunned seeing her here in her prime. \"Mito-sama...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kushina what were you thinking trying that?  You know you would regret it for all eternity.\" Mito scolded Kushina how a mother would scold a bad child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was stunned seeing his mother look like a young girl who did something bad as she got off him and looked at the other red head with guilt. \"But Mito-sama the way he died was so embarrassing....!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter, also its the village's fault for not teaching him correctly anyways.\" Mito said with disgust towards her husband's former village. \"Also they think they got rid of the Kyuubi they gravelly underestimate that demons power and will to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina nodded knowing her predecessor was correct, if her son had been properly taught he could've easily detected Sakuras trickery and escaped being her dinner. The anger was gone replaced by guilt and sorrow. The village had no idea that Sakura had eaten Naruto in vain. She should've recalled just how tenacious the fox was from having it inside her for over a decade. \"What can we do Mito-sama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, it is clear that village is not the same one Hashi-kun and his brother made centuries ago,\" Mito replied. \"They even erased all records of our clans history I refuse to save a place that has corrupted itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina was stunned but she couldn't help but agree, Konoha had celebrated Naruto's death instead of mourn which only made the fact she had been about to eat her son herself before Mito stopped her all the more painful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also Kushina, my seal not only stopped you from eating Naruto but it separated you from him as well, I know you had sealed a portion of yourself to help him with the Kyuubi.\" Mito spoke the younger Uzumaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mito-sama, but since Minato-kun is forever trapped in the stomach of the Death God...I'm staying with Naruto. I need to not only make up for all the years I wasn't there to raise him, but also for my unjust and stupid actions earlier,\" Kushina said looking back at her son with guilt but also the material love she would've provided had she survived that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gets up looking at his mother and the other woman. \"So the fox isn't dead with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Naruto, the Kyuubi is literally living chakra given form...Despite what Tsunade believes the fox is very much alive and I have a feeling it will be using your so called teammate as a body soon.\" Kushina informed her son in a grave tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Naruto wanted to be brought back to attempt to help Sakura until he remembered how she treated him over the years especially while she had been devouring him. He had had enough of the horrid treatment for once the hero would not be so...He would let the village suffer for their own mistakes and treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Konoha...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This woman was the Red Hot Blooded Habanero and previous Kyuubi Jinchuriki Kushina Uzumaki and was also Naruto's mother. She glared at the stomach of the pink haired bitch that dared think she could eat HER son and digest him! Kushina already was doing handseals to give the bitch the worst case of indigestion she'll ever have. She would not let her child die like this he had too much to live for ! And she certainly wasn't gonna let him die in such a horrible way as food!  Golden Chains began to emerge from her back. Sakura would not survive Kushina's assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina smirked, \"Sorry pink bitch, but no way will the Uzumaki clan  be wiped out by a no name weakling like you!\" She shot her chains forward and they came out of Naruto's stomach without hurting him but the same couldn't be said for Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chains burst from a startled and horrified  Sakura's stomach in a gruesome display actually ripping right through her stomach tissue to all the way outside her body. The sharp tips were wet with her blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gasped and held her now bleeding stomach as both blood and acid were trickling out of the new wounds causing her even more agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's happening? !\" Sakura exclaimed losing the smugness she had from eating Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina wasn't done yet she shot more chains this time upward ripping and tearing up Sakura's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura felt a sharp pain in her throat and opened her mouth as mods golden chains shot out and were like deadly snakes as the sharp ends were all pointed at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina smirked, \"Good bye disgrace to kunoichi everywhere!\" She controlled her chains to wrap around Sakura's  entire upper body leaving only her horrified teary emerald eyes to see out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura only had time to tearfully  say one thing, \"I'm sorry!\" And her upper body was violently torn open in two spraying blood and organs everywhere. Leaving only a torso and legs which fell down unmoving. Sakura Haruno a once bright  kunoichi who arrogantly thought she could make her own teammate her dinner was instead murdered herself by that teammate's mother who was miraculously sealed along with the Kyuubi inside her son's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting amongst  the remains of Sakura Haruno was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Continuing on he took a turn around a nearby corner and quickly made a shadow clone while using the Transformation jutsu to disguise himself as an old man with a wooden cane. Waiting for his pursuer to turn the corner he felt his apprehension dissolve upon seeing the familiar rectangular box with cut out eyeholes and a rocklike pattern for camouflage. <i>'There\u2019s only one group of kids I know of that would use such an obvious disguise.\u2019</i> The blond thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the eyeholes, the box still bumped into him. From the whispers he heard just before the box bumped him, Naruto could tell that they had been arguing about something rather than paying attention to where they were going. Raising his cane he gave the box a few taps, \"Correct me if I'm wrong children but, I'm pretty sure that rocks aren't square shaped nor do they have eyeholes.\" Mentally Naruto smirked as he played the part of an old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction he got was expected so he wasn't surprised in the slightest when an explosion of colored smoke came from the box. He also wasn't surprised to find the kids coughing and mutters of 'too much gunpowder' coming from them. Naruto was surprised however to see not three but, four kids on the ground coughing. He quickly snapped out of it however when Konohamaru jumped up and started speaking. \"Hey Old Man, why'd you go and blow our cover like that? How are we suppose to surprise the Boss if someone goes and blows our cover like that?!?\" Naruto merely shook his head, \"Boy, your Boss would have to be blind to not notice a rock with perfect angles and eyeholes following him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you it wouldn't work Kono-kun but, you didn't want to listen.\" Naruto's eyes quickly shot to the new member of Konohamaru's little group. <i>'Hmm, she looks a lot like Hinata.'</i> And indeed the little girl did look a lot like the shy Hyuga heiress. The girl had long dark brown hair and her bangs were parted so only a single lock of hair fell in front of her face. Most noticeably however, was that she had large, white eyes that held a hint of lilac in them. A sleeveless, purple v-neck shirt, with mesh armor underneath, shorts of the same purple color and ninja-blue sandals. \"Don't be like that Hanabi-chan. Besides, Boss never noticed we were here.\" The boy was clearly ignored by the girl who was instead looking at Naruto as if she was confused as to why she was seeing some old man in front of them. The old man in question simply raised an eyebrow as Hanabi seemed to suddenly realize something. \"You\u2019re wrong Kono-kun because Naruto is right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the confused looks on the other kids faces Naruto decided that he had messed with them enough; for now at least. A small bang and a good bit of smoke later reviled Naruto, grin and all. \"You noticed rather quickly. Mind if I ask though, are you by chance related to Hinata? And I don't just mean as a Hyuga.\" The little girl grinned at that before proudly proclaiming, \"She's my big sister.\" Naruto found it kind of cute how she spoke like it was the greatest thing in the world to be Hinata's little sister. And who knows, maybe it was. Hinata was a great person after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Boss will you play ninja with us?\" Naruto paused a moment considering the idea. \"Play what?\" Konohamaru was quick to try and answer. \"How about ninja Ta...\" \"Let's play Missing Nin!\" Everyone looked at Moegi surprised that she had just cut in like that. \"Missing Nin huh?\" Naruto looked over the four. Moegi looked pleased with the suggestion where as Konohamaru seemed willing to play if only just. Udon as usual was neutral about either choice and the newest member of this marry band of trouble makers seemed curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissing Nin was a game that Naruto had come up with that pits the more experienced player (himself) vs. the less experienced. The goal of the game was to capture the Missing Nin before the time-limit expired. Its main purpose was to teach the kids how to capture a fleeing target while avoiding traps left by said target. Naruto was normally more than willing to play this game but, with how things have been recently he wasn't too sure he wanted to risk anything by getting caught in traps. Then again, it's not like these kids would really try something while he was caught and vulnerable, right? So deep in thought he was, that he completely missed the looks of hunger that passed through the girls\u2019 eyes, nor did he notice how they glanced at each other as if they were having a private conversation.</span></div></div>",

Hmm, seems I underestimated how advantageous having Hanabi was for them.'</i> Thought the blond as he looked at the trap he was caught in. His torso was bound by rope preventing him from using his arms, while hanging from another rope tied around his ankles. That one just so happened to be hanging from a tall tree and if he was seeing it right, there was a complex winch system at the end. The winch would allow the kids to lower him down easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Naruto could get free but, it would take at least a minute to get through the ropes knot. He mentally cursed all of his sensei\u2019s for never teaching him the <b><u>'Rope Escape jutsu'</u></b> or how to untie these more complex knots. Besides, the game wouldn't be much fun if he went all out on a few kids that weren't even ten yet.<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far away and hidden by the trees, Konohamaru and Udon fell to the ground like sacks of potatoes. Their attackers just so happened to be Moegi and Hanabi, both whom had planned this whole thing out. Now they only needed to decide who would get the main course. \"Moegi, before we make the decision can I ask a favor?\" Seeing no harm in at least hearing out the request of the only female friend she had near her age, Moegi motioned for Hanabi to ask. \"If I win, could you not eat Kono-kun?\" Moegi raised an eyebrow at the request. It didn't really surprise her as she had thought Hanabi might have a small crush on him. Shrugging she gave her response, \"Fine, <b>'IF'</b> you win then I won't go eating Konohamaru as my constellation meal. But, you have to make up the difference by buying me lunch, all I can eat.\" Hanabi didn't even hesitate, \"Deal! And I'll make sure to tell you what Naruto tastes like once I'm done eating.\" \"Confident huh? Well too bad because I plan to snack on boss myself so you'll just have to hope Udon can hold you over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe challenge was set and with that they played a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide who would dine on the blond.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was feeling a little bored and was currently contemplating whether or not he should start freeing himself from the rope. He was snapped from his thoughts however when he felt the rope give a little. Surprised he turned to look at the makeshift winch but, could only make out the vague outline of a person, not who. He then heard a female voice from under him call out, \"Let him loose!\" The moment he heard that he realized what had happened. These people planned to eat him and where going to use the kids trap to do it. As gravity reasserted its hold on him, Naruto's mind went into overdrive, trying to think of a way out. Sadly he knew he was trapped as he hadn't even attempted to free himself yet and it would take longer than the fall down to do so. He still tried of course but in the end his head was engulfed in the wide open mouth of...</span></div></div>",

With as wide open as her mouth was, and as fast as he was falling, she was able to get him head-first down her gullet all the way up to his waist in a single gulp.

Considering that he was taller and bigger than her, the young Hyuuga's stomach was already bulging considerably. The front of her shirt was bunched up, riding up high over her distended gut. Her lips were up to Naruto's knees, already, and the blond was as good as digested. With this much of him already inside of her, Naruto would NOT be escaping, no matter what he tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear the blonde shouting frantically from inside her belly as she gulped him down up to his shins. Soon only Naruto's feet were left outside of Hanabi's mouth and a good part of his body was already settling into her rumbling, gurgling stomach. Soon she would be digesting him. He would become a permanent part of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto's toes passed her lips, Hanabi gave a hard swallow before she sighed contentedly. She just laid there a moment, feeling the blond continue to struggle futilely even as he was slowly deposited into her hungry stomach. She smiled in victory as she felt his feet and lower legs being pushed down her esophagus by the powerful muscles so that they could join the rest of him already curled up inside the Hyuuga's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky, Naruto,\" she said cheerfully to her grossly distended stomach. \"You'll to get to become part of the Hyuuga clan, once I finish digesting you. Hehe, I'll be unstoppable with all of that chakra of yours added to my body... Who knows? Maybe I'll even become the second woman Hokage. Wouldn't that be nice, Naruto? You'll get to fulfill your dream as a part of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe faintly heard a muffled whimper come from her belly. Then she felt the blond, now wholly trapped within the digestive sac that was her stomach, redouble his desperate writhing and struggles. But there was no way he would be able to escape her, now. He might as well just except that he would soon be nothing more then padding for her developing body and the leftovers being made into a steaming pile of shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a belch, satisfied beyond measure with her meal. Smiling contentedly, Hanabi leaned herself against a tree in repose, just lying there and listening as her stomach began to churn around Naruto's still struggling body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he get digested, or does somebody come to the blond's \"rescue\" at the last minute?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hanabi simply laid there, eyes closed and as happy as could be while Naruto desperately struggled and squirmed inside her belly. It was such a wonderful day, for the girl at least. As she laid there she could feel her stomach slowly constricting around her wonderfully filling meal. Giggling gently to herself at how good his movements felt before letting loose a rather wet belch. She made pleased 'Mmmm' noises as she licked her lips, finally able to taste a little more of his delightful flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made no motion to open her eyes even as she heard the telltale sound of someone walking up to her. Hanabi was in fact one of the rare few members of the Hyuga clan that were sensitive to chakra and the signature each source gave off. Mind that she was only 'just' able to actively notice chakra signatures that were familiar to her. \"Enjoying yourself?\" The person asked. Hanabi licked her lips again before answering. \"Of course! He's quite the filling meal.\" She of course said this just as she gave her massively distended and wriggling stomach a firm pat. Almost as if in response her stomach have a loud groan and churning noise as the weaker acids finally started to pour from her stomach walls. \"I can't help but wonder though, why big sister didn't eat him herself? I mean she had plenty of chances? Oh well, her loss!\" Finally opening her eyes she turned to look at her companion, eyeing the belly said person seemed to be carrying. \"So Moegi, how was your Udon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now revealed Moegi rolled her eyes at the jab of her meals name before taking a seat next to the sated Hyuga girl. \"Despite him suddenly waking once I was nearly done, my meal was okay.\" The orange haired pigtailed girl admitted. \"Bet Boss tasted much better though.\" Moegi saw the concerned look that Hanabi gave her stomach and decided to put an end to her worries. \"Stop! I know what you\u2019re thinking and you don't need to worry. I left Konohamaru tied up to a tree shortly after releasing Naruto for you. Speaking of, how did he taste?\" Hanabi looked at her distended gut as it groaned and gurgled gently around it's wiggling meal. \"There's not much to say sadly. Between the rope and his clothes I couldn't really taste much of him. He felt wonderful going down however!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoegi blinked processing what she had just heard before an idea came to her. \"You said 'couldn't taste much of him', that leads to one assuming that you did get some flavor from him.\" When Hanabi gave a hesitant nod Moegi grinned widely. \"Well then, share!\" Hanabi looked at her best friend like she had gone insane. \"And just how do you propose I 'share' my meals flavor? You know firsthand that it's near impossible to simply describe such a thing.\" \"I know that! That's why you are going to let me have a taste.\" \"I am not throwing up my meal just so you can taste him Moegi!\" Hanabi felt repulsed at the very thought.  \"Hanabi... There is a different way. I'll tell you what; I'll do it to you first so I can get a taste of Bosses flavor. If you don't like it then you don't need to do it to me and I won't ask you to do it ever again.\" As Hanabi poked the tip of her tongue out to lube her lips, and moaned inwardly as her lively stomach continued to gurgle around the squirming blond, she gave her friends words some thought. She had no idea what Moegi planned to do but, she trusted her friend to not try something. Besides, the girl wouldn't be able to stomach her while they were both currently digesting full sized meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Hanabi give a nod of consent Moegi asked her to close her eyes and just let her finish as she would likely feel the impulse to push her away. Closing her eyes Hanabi soon felt something soft press against her lips. She was confused by this and only became even more so when she felt something wet and slimy run over her lips. It didn't take long however for her to put the pieces together and realize that the wet thing was Moegi's tongue. Her mouth opened out of shock and soon found Moegi's tongue inside her mouth, exploring it in search of Naruto's elusive flavor. Minutes seemed to pass by before Moegi pulled away. Hanabi watched wide eyed and bright red as her friend worked her jaw as if trying to spread the flavors on her tongue around. \"Your right. Not much flavor from him. Plenty from you though...\" Hanabi simply chose to say nothing and go back to enjoying the slowly weakening movements of her meal as digestion picked up and stronger digestive acids started getting worked into his clothes and skin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto wiggled in the cramped confines of Hanabi's stomach, desperate to escape. Her stomach was incredibly tight and what movement he could've made was further restricted by the rope that was still tied around him from earlier. This left him curled up in a manner reminiscent to a fetal position. If he wasn't in a such a deadly situation, Naruto would have found it rather amazing how much the young girls stomach had stretched in order to properly load him into it... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time however he could feel nothing but panic and desperation as the warm, wet, pulsing flesh massaged him from every angle, some of it semi-painfully as the weak tingling acids coating her stomach wall gradually turned into slightly stronger stinging ones. Still a part of him found it amazing how her digestive organ could stretch so much, yet still remain tight enough to not allow him the needed room to struggle too hard or effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the fact was that he was trapped and would certainly die if he didn't find some way to escape, and without the use of his arms the chances of freedom where practically nonexistent. Not one to simply give in despite the odds, Naruto started slamming himself against the stomach walls by using his legs to accelerate himself against it \u2013 to little use, as it was incredibly cramped to begin with within the younger girl. So the dark-haired female easily handled him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot deterred by the lack of success, Naruto started struggling and ramming against the fleshy wall harder, hoping to burst out of the girl's stomach or at least force her throw him up. The continued ramming however wasn't having the effect that he hoped as his attempts if escaped did little but budging Hanabi's gut side to side, with no discomfort inflicted on the Hyuga. The stomach however was reacting to the movement. Realizing that it had food trapped inside of it, the stomach started releasing stronger acids into the chamber causing the bottom to start filling with the corrosive liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few minutes Naruto slowly tired himself out with nothing to show for his efforts outside of utterly soaking his body with slimy acids that where quickly eroding and dissolving his clothes. He hissed in pain only to start screeching as he felt the acids slowly gouge open wounds into his skin, after all the moisture had been drained from his bodies protective veil. It would not be long till her stomach acids started working away at the more nutritious meat inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto was suffering the beginnings of an agonizing digestion, Hanabi was happily stroking her wiggiling and loudly churning stomach, relishing the feeling of her body melting down a boy the same age as her sister into a nutritious gooey past. She couldn't help but, continually fondle her large growling gut as digestion continued inside it. Not even talking and giggling with her best friend Moegi managed to make her stop for even a second. How her big sister hadn't eaten this boy herself before now was a compleat mystery to the younger girl. She knew that Hinata had wanted too, as Hanabi had snuck a peek at her sisters diary only a few days ago. The entry had made it very clear that Hinata had been wanting to swallow the boy for a while now but, it never said why she hadn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi shrugged her shoulders at the thought. <i>'Her loss.'</i>, she thought just before her belly gurgled and sloshed strongly enough to jiggle around. Hanabi nearly squealed in delight at that before leaning back against the tree again to continue enjoying the boys digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally was freed from the amazingly digestive resistant rope, Naruto started thrashing for all he was worth. The acids coating and actively eating away at his body only spurred him on to keep fighting for his survival. He fought valiantly. Punches and kicks struck against slimy acid covered stomach walls, while his screams of pain where covered up by the groaning and churning of Hanabi's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut try as he might, even his steel will had limits to what it could achive. And he knew that surviving an prolonged acid bath inside a girls stomach was not one of those. The fiery pain he felt as his skin blistered and seemed to melt all at the same time as he continued to bath in the gastric acids currently soaking him. Yelling and crying from the pain, Naruto kept wiggling and squirming as his skin was being turned into a wet, gooey mess, making way to reveal the nutritious protein-rich muscle underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Was this it?!?'</i>, he wondered. Had he survived through all the pain and suffering that had been heaped upon him to this point, just to end up as a filling meal for a little girl? Was the younger sister of the shy and kindhearted Hinata really going to digest him alive? Did everything he had accomplished in life truly amount to him ending as nothing more then some child bowel movement? What kind of an end to life was that?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his continued struggles, Naruto had finally lost heart. He was now only struggling to try and keep his mind off the pain he was feeling as his muscles started to soften and melt. An odd thought crossed his mind as the stomach walls pressed down around him. <i>'I wonder if Hinata would have enjoyed digesting me as much as her sister seems to be?'</i> The thought oddly made him smile as he let himself get lost in the weird daydream of being inside of the shy girl and slowly becoming a part of her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Naruto thrashed around he soon noticed something. His body was suddenly starting to regenerate just as fast as it was dissolving. He realized that he had suddenly found himself in a stalemate. Hanabi couldn't fully digest him and he couldn't escape her stomach as his ninja tools had dissolved already and and he was in too much pain to be able to focus chakra for a jutsu. He didn't even know that  Hanabi had somehow fortified her stomach against chakra usage for anyone inside of her with a modified variant of the Hyuga's Gentle Fist style. Had he known this it wouldn't have really mattered seeing as how he was trapped anyway within this agonizing hell that was a little girls stomach. If this kept up then they would get no where and he would be forced to continue suffering inside her. Naruto didn't know wether to laugh at the sick irony of this realization or to rage and curse every higher being and hungry female that he could think of for this injustice. Instead he settled for weeping and crying out in pain and agony as he had been. He could only hope someone would find him and put an end to this horror he was experiencing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Hanabi looked to her gut in bewilderment. Her belly, though rounder and softer then before, hadn't shrunk at all despite having been digesting for the last couple of hours. If that wasn't confusing enough, she could clearly feel, and too some degree see, Naruto still thrashing around inside of her as he was digested. Looking towards her friend Moegi and saw that while her own stomach seemed to be getting nowhere, Moegi's stomach had already been reduced to a bulge too big to be called pudge but, defiantly too small to be a potbelly. Hanabi wondered how this was possible. True, Naruto was bigger then Udon was but, there was no way Moegi should have been able to almost fully digest Udon while Hanabi had only softened her own thrashing meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding she needed a better look at what was happening, Hanabi activated her Byakugan and peered into her stomach. She was very shocked at what she found. Naruto was apparently regenerating just as fast as her stomach was digesting him. Hanabi scowled at that. She had nor anticipated something like this. <i>'Is this why big sister never ate him? Because she would never be able to properly digest him?'</i> She pondered on this while trying to think of some way that she could make the needed headway to digest him. Soon enough two ideas came to her. The first was that she not bother with the digestion and just leave him inside her stomach. Doing this would mean that she would never need to stop in her day just to eat as Naruto would be providing for her at all times. A quick jutsu could cause her stomach to shrink in size returning her mobility while causing more pain to her meal. It seemed like a fair trade for not simply digesting like he was suppose to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second option was to empower her stomach with so much chakra that Naruto would be digested in an instant. Doing this though would mean that Hanabi would be absorbing more the just vitamins and nutrition. She would most likely pull the entirety of Naruto's being into herself. Basically, Hanabi would be pulling Naruto into her mindscape where he would be forever trapped seeing as how he would no longer have a body to return to. She thought about it for a moment, before coming to a decision. Smirking, she started making hand signs...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hanabi smirked to herself, knowing that her meal was going to be wishing that she could simply digest him, that is if he wasn't already wishing that. A small chuckle escaped her as the jutsu she used started to take effect. First, her belly flushed what she had managed to digest down into her intestines. This left very little in the ways of acids inside her stomach but, only for a moment. With a soft rumble the surface of her distended belly seemed to ripple, much like a pond would when you drop a rock into it's still waters. The sated little Hyuga opened her mouth and gave a loud, breathy belch, as her digestive tract contracted tighter around its contents. Naruto's form could now be clearly seen by anyone that looked at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi gave a giggle as she felt her stomach squeeze tighter and tighter around the boy. A very muffled sound came from the depths of her belly, quite abruptly and it took Hanabi a moment to realize that it wasn't the sound of Naruto screaming; it was in fact the sound of bones snapping under the pressure her stomach was putting on him. She gave another small giggle as she felt more then heard another bone give out. Naruto hadn't simply stopped moving though. He was in fact thrashing around as best as he could while trying to push her stomach walls away from him, if the imprint of his hands pressing outwards was anything to go on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi pitied the idiot for thinking that such a thing would actually work. She figured that he deserved his punishment if he was truly that stupid. An evil grin crossed her face as her massive stomach continued to shrink more and more, having already shrunk down by a fourth of its full size. Feeling eyes upon her, Hanabi turned towards her friend Moegi and nearly busted out laughing at the wide eyed and slack jawed expression the girl was giving her gut. \"Yes, Moegi?\" She watched in amusement as her friend got over her shock enough to speak. \"Hanabi w-what, what is happening to your stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi pondered on how to explain it as her ginger haired friend had asked a very legitimate question. \"Well, he wasn't digesting. And I do happen to have better things to do with my life other then digesting him forever. That doesn't mean I'm ever going to let him out. I got him into my belly fair and square, so he is only allowed to leave my tummy once he is fully digested.\" Hanabi paused for a moment to see if Moegi was still following. Seeing that she did indeed still have her friends attention she continued. \"Since I'm not going to let him out, I'd have to be able to keep him inside my stomach. This normally wouldn't be a problem as my tummy would have turned anyone else into a small bulge like you have. But Naruto is clearly different because he keeps healing as I digest him, so he isn't getting any smaller. If he's going to stay there then he has to be small enough that I can get up and walk around without much trouble.\" She paused a moment to think as a thought hit her. \"In truth I think that this is why my big sister hasn't eaten him yet, or it's one of the reasons.\" Hanabi went on to explain how her sister would have been able to keep him in her stomach because, she is with a team that knows Naruto and they may put two and two together if she shows up with a meal that won't fully digest and Naruto goes missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finishing up with her explanation, Hanabi turned her attention back to her belly and grinned happily. In the one hour after starting her jutsu, her belly was now just a bit larger then a basketball. \"It's not shrinking anymore?\" Asked her perplexed friend. \"No. Seems it's done.\", answered Hanabi as she gave the hard bulging sphere a gentle rub. She could feel the boys broken form quite clearly through her skin, though it would round out once it filled with acids again. Feeling a few twitches from inside, Hanabi smirked at knowing that Naruto was still very much alive and would continue to suffer for not simply digesting like he should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little Hyuga turned towards the sound of her friend as she stood up. \"Guess its time to go then, huh? We still need to drop Konohamaru off at home and I'll need to get rid of whatever is left of Udon.\" Agreeing with Moegi, Hanabi stood up, having only some trouble from the change in her center of gravity and how her belly blocked off certain movements. The girls moved back into the woods where they found Konohamaru having woken up only a few short moments ago. Hanabi was quick to correct this with a soft poke to the side of his neck. Both girls shared in carrying the weight of the boy back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they slowly progressed towards Konohamaru's home, Hanabi though of her sister. If Hinata ever found out she had eaten Naruto, Hanabi could only hope that her big sister wouldn't react poorly. If she did, than as much as she disliked the idea, Hanabi would have to send her sister down to join Naruto in her stomach. Hanabi wondered how long she'd be able to keep this from her sister and truly hoped that Hinata wouldn't be angry with her once she did learn of it.</span></div></div>",

Despite her now sporting a relatively massive belly, something she clearly didn't have this morning, the most she had gotten was a confused glance from the front guard; he didn't even try looking with his Byakugan to ensure she was who she appeared to be, he just let her walk right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018It\u2019s no wonder why On\u00e8e-sama is so worried about kidnappings if the guards won\u2019t even question why their youngest heiress is returning with a massive belly that she she clearly wasn\u2019t sporting when she left,\u2019</i> the young Hyuga thought to herself. She paused in her walk and looked down at her bloated middle with the slightest of frowns marring her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a large semi-rounded mass protruding from her body with a few oddly placed bumps here and there. The bumps being parts of her still living Uzumaki meal that were either pushing back in some misguided attempt at freedom, something she would make certain would never happen, or simply parts of him that refused to break and bend under her bellies mighty digestive power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave one of the bulges near the top a hard poke, only for it to not budge in the slightest. Grumbling to herself, Hanabi pushed harder feeling the bump slowly sink down into the churning depths of her stomach, only to then feel a different bulge forming elsewhere from her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling to herself again, Hanabi figured that if her meal wanted to be that much of an annoyance that she just let her belly deal with him, which she was sure would happen, given enough time. Until then, she was stuck looking like she was in the final stages of pregnancy, which considering her own size, made her belly look even bigger on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly feeling a little self conscious about all the cream colored skin she was showing she gave the bottom of her shirt a pull, hoping to cover it up at least a little bit. Sadly, her shirt was already stretched as far as it could go, not even covering up a third of the creamy white orb that hung from her body. Thankfully, it was tightly packed enough that gravity didn\u2019t seem to really affect it as there was no noticeable sag in the churning orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing in indignation at her meals lack of complying to her will, aka turning into bouncy boobs to play with like her big sister has, Hanabi tried to ignore the slight bounce she felt in her gut as she not quite stomped back towards her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hoping to get away with a few more hours to try and further digest the crushed Uzumaki boy stewing in her digestive acids. If she was really lucky, then by the time On\u00e8e-sama came home she\u2019d be able to pass him off as having over eaten or simply built up gas in her system. And it would all start with getting back to the safety of her bedroom.</span></div></div>",

She absolutely loved feeling living things squirm pitifully inside her stomach as she slowly digested them alive. What had been seen as a slight annoyance less then half an hour ago, Hanabi was finding utter enjoyment in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips she gave her bloated middle an affectionate pat and rub, giggling to herself in glee as she felt the stretched organ rumble under her fingertips. To Hanabi it seemed more like her belly was purring in contentment, much like how a cat would when you scratched them in just the right spot. All the while her Uzumaki morsel wriggled pitifully within his digestive hell. Well, he wriggled as well as someone with nearly every bone in their body being broken could at least. Honestly, she was slightly surprised to lay on her with her gut in the air like some great pale mountain, only to see her belly gently shift ever so slightly back and forth. She knew it could just be from her powerful stomach muscles churning him around but, the Hyuga munchkin thought she should give her tasty meal at least some credit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how big I\u2019d be if I swallowed Hinata-On\u00e8e, or maybe Natsu-san? She\u2019d really make me big, but would she wiggle around any better then my morsel here?\u201d Hanabi contemplated the idea of having her sister and Natsu join the broken Uzumaki in her belly. She could only imagine how big her tummy would be. She hoped they would squirm a lot as she digested them. \u201cI bet I could use my belly as a makeshift chair or bed after that. Though I wonder how many people I\u2019d be able to fit in my tummy? What do you think,\u201d questioned the girl as gave her churning gut a playful slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creamy-white rumbling mass sloshed and gurgled happily before an almost ominous growl came from within.

The little girls stomach violently, churning and gurgling as what would usually take hours to process, the boys meat was torn apart and dissolved in what seemed like seconds. Her bulging stomach convulsed as Naruto's muffled screams of agony were heard reverberating from within the organic sack that was soon to be his tomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi only smiled as she relished every last twitch and scream from her meal. She could literally feel how her stomach dried out his skin and ripped it open. She was starting to love the sensation of her digestive tract proceeding to rip off all his muscles and organs and how they were quickly reduced to sustenance as her stomach shrank as the acidity in its environment continued to increase much too the detriment of her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he continued to fight and struggle as she broke him down inside her gut. Nutritious parts turned into goop that her body quickly slurped up like soup... while the rest was flushed into the bowels. Soon all that remained was the remains of a degraded skeleton that currently soaked in her acids. After a minute they too broke down and were funneled into her intestinal tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body quickly and happily fed off the nutrients that had once been the boys body as circulation of her meal also progressed at high speed. Sadly, she was still too young to gain the full benefits of such a meat heavy meal. Still, Hanabi was pleased to find her body was now making the leap from little girl to preteen. She hoped to one day have boobs like her sister and looked forward to the day that she became so developed. A pleased sigh escaped her lips, as she stood, one hand firmly rubbing against her now flattened gut. \"Big sister, you missed out big time! Digesting that boy felt better then I ever thought possible.\", the young girl stated out loud as she stretched. She would need to relieve herself of what little remained of Naruto later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit Hanabi, that was pretty hardcore.\", exclaimed Moegi. This however only earned a confused look from the young Hyuga girl. \"I mean, I haven't spoken with Hinata much but, she clearly had a thing for the Boss. Not everyone would be willing to digest the guy their older sister liked.\" Hanabi however only seemed even more confused. \"Um, Hanabi, you did know that your sister liked the Boss didn't you?\", ask the young girl who now felt rather nervous. <i>'Hanabi couldn't have possible not known that, right?'</i> Her unspoken question was answered when Hanabi gained a look of understanding, then shifted to realization only to suddenly go pale and start shaking in fright. \"My Big sister liked him and you didn't think to check and see if I knew that?!? No! I didn't know that Big sis liked him! I never would have digested him if I knew that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoegi could only watch as Hanabi started to fret and mutter as she tried to think of a way out of this new mess. \"You could just eat her too...\" Moegi flinched at how Hanabi suddenly turned her neck to look at her, silently wondering how she didn't get whiplash from it. \"Moegi are you serious? Eat my big sister? The person who has been like a mother to me?\" Moegi couldn't tell if that hope in her voice or if Hanabi simply thought she was a loon for even suggesting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Geez Hanabi, it was just a suggestion.\", the pigtailed girl said while holding up her hands in a surrender motion. \"How about we go get Konohamaru and bring him home. We can use the time to think up ideas on how to keep your normally shy and kind sister from killing you for eating her crush.\" She didn't give Hanabi a chance to answer as before simply walking off towards the direction that Konohamaru lay. Hanabi was quick to join Moegi but, remained silent as she contemplated the idea of actually eating and digesting her big sister. I was a tempting idea and it would give her more people to play with once she visited her inner world. She would need to really think on this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>'If I'm going to survive trying to take on big sister I need a surefire method of getting her... problem is she's not as stupid as her crush was. The plan we used to get Naruto simply won't work on her. We'll also have to somehow account for her Byakugan... never thought I'd have to find a way around the family justu. As we are now we're simply not strong enough, so no matter what we either need to get stronger fast or somehow trick her.'</i>  As she ponders silently on this Hanabi feels the prospects of beating her sister are extremely low.  This has very little to do with the actual difference in their skills, as Hanabi is already talented enough to provide Hinata with a difficult match. Add the chakura she absorbed from Naruto and she might even win against a fully serious Hinata... but Hanabi actually overestimates of Hinata's abilities by a decent margin. This is a natural result of the bias with which Hanabi has always seen her sister, as being better at absolutely everything. The time that she has spent seeing Hinata actually be better then Hanabi has only reinforced that image. However, all the time that Hanabi has spent looking up to and studying her big sister could instead prove to be a huge aid... as anything that might beat the much stronger \"image\" of Hinata in Hanabi's head would without a doubt beat the real one. The problem will be getting a plan that will beat that powerful \"image\" in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could try pushing the fallout somewhere else. There's that pink haired girl that the Boss liked, I think we could convince your sister that she did it. Though I'd hate to be in her shoes when Hinata-san gets a hold of her.\" Moegi says, the latest in a list of bad plans she'd voiced while they were heading to get Konohamaru.  It was irritating chatter more then anything else, only distracting Hanabi from coming up with something that would actually WORK. <i>'After all, even if we somehow lied convincingly enough, one look at Sakura would be enough to prove that she hasn't had a meal of that size... on the other hand... that doesn't mean nobody besides me has grown from a human-sized meal.'</i> With that thought in mind, Hanabi stole a quick look at Moegi, critically inspecting her to see what she's gained from her Udon meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't completely sure how much, but Hanabi thought that Moegi looked a bit bigger all-round... height, breadth of shoulders, depth of torso, and just a hint of pudge. The annoying part was... with the difference spit so many ways it was actually kind of hard to notice even when looking for it. Hanabi knew that on some level this is because of her own sudden growth spurt, which had caused her body to leap from a young girl to almost preteen.  The common way of comparing size to her own body is completely skewed as a result of this rapid growth, and if she were to insist on using that as her standard then Moegi actually looks a bit smaller then before the meal. Hanabi is therefore basing her estimate of Moegi's growth on the wildlife around them... which is tricky at best. Still... bottom-line, if Hanabi wants to use Moegi as a scape goat, then she'll need to fatten that goat up some more. After all, to explain her own growth she'll be taking Moegi's place as having eaten Udon in the story she tells her sister.  And what would be easier for Hanabi then to take her sister on while she's completely weighed down by Moegi? In fact, depending on how it goes, she might even be able to get out of needing to eat Hinata entirely.  Probably the biggest downside to this plan is that she'd have to let Moegi eat Konohamaru... who she has feelings for. <i>'Just like sisters... both attracted to the biggest idiot our age'</i> Hanabi thought with a smile. <i>'Surely I can come up with something that will work on Sis without sacrificing Konohamaru though... then again, with Onee-sama as the opponent, it's most likely a fight that can't be won without some kind of sacrifice.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hanabi has been thinking on this they have come to where they left Konohamaru, and Moegi has not stopped coming up with pitifully childish and foolish plans that would be sure get them all killed or worse. Even while Moegi picks up the still unconscious Konohamaru she is still rattling off various bad ideas.  \"Maybe if we got Ebisu-sensei to help us? I know your sister's strong, but she can't stand up to someone with an adult's chakura and training. Or...\"  Hanabi found herself already tuning Moegi out again, taking Konohamaru from Moegi. <i>'Of all the stupid ideas... your actually thinking about telling that strict teacher!? He'd hand us over for her to do whatever she wanted short of killing us... that said, she's right about Onee-sama not being completely invincible. And Naruto has given my chakura a very considerable boost.'</i> Wondering just how big that boost is she activates her Byakugan and pushes it to the limit. Hanabi is surprised to find that she's somehow gained not only the chakura, but even the development and skill to consider her old maximum easy. She quickly estimates that she's got at least twice, maybe even three times, as much chakura as she did before eating Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If I've gained this much... maybe I actually can go head to head with Big Sister. Who am I kidding? This is just enough to make it a fight... if that. Still, if I can augment this chakura further, get the drop on Big Sis, I actually might just be able to overpower her.  But the only source of chakura I can get in time for it to make a difference, is Moegi. I'd say Konohamaru as well, but I doubt absorbing his chakura would make much difference. The only reason that Moegi would be significant is because she's absorbed Udon's. But do I really want to take the risk of trying such a direct method?'</i>  The downside to this is that Hanabi would have no other viable option but to win if she were to eat Moegi... but it's Moegi's own fault that their in this mess anyways. If Moegi had just mentioned that Hinata liked the blond idiot they would have been able to completely avoid all this. Besides, regardless of the plan, Moegi ends up eaten by someone... and if somebodies got to eat Hanabi's best friend it should be Hanabi herself. As an added bonus, Hanabi can add Moegi to her mindscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi thinks over the two most viable plans she can think of, and decides firmly and resolutely on the better of the two. She then speaks up, \"Moegi, follow me. I've figured out how we'll resolve this. But we'll need to do some preparation. I know somewhere safe for us to get ready.\" Hanabi leads Moegi to an out of the way Hyuga safehouse, one that she is confident her sister is not aware of. Once they arrive, Moegi asks \"So, what's the plan?\"  Hanabi smiles as she replies...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hanabi continues, \"But for that to work, before anything else, you and me need to be close to the same size...\" Moegi can hear the hesitation and can see how much the next part is paining Hanabi. \"So... you'll need to eat Konohamaru-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoegi looks longingly at the former leader of the one time trio she had considered her closest friends.

DO YOU THINK I WANT THIS!?\" Hanabi's wrath is short-lived however, and she quietly repeats to herself, almost as if it where a mantra, \"there is no other way, there is no other way, there is no other way.\" Moegi is frightened by the sudden strength her friend displayed, as well as the sudden outburst and the even more disturbing calm. Moegi starts to pick herself up to head to where Konohamaru still lies unconscious.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moegi freezes, recognizing the tall, slender figure of Hanabi's green haired caretaker. She raises her hand, pointing out the adult shinobi. \"Hanabi? I think we might have a problem.\" Hanabi looks up, and seeing Meogi pointing outside activates her Byakugan to see through the walls and instantly recognizes Natsu. It really shouldn't have come as a surprise that Natsu could find them here, after all Natsu herself was the one who showed this branch family hideout to Hanabi. Still, for a moment, Hanabi can't believe her eyes, stunned that they are already gonna be found. This lasts for only that single moment, after which Hanabi is already acting as a full shinobi should, and is thinking of ways to turn the situation to her own advantage. And the most obvious way has already made itself clear to her. It looks like there won't be any need for Konohamaru to be digested today after all. Quickly Hanabi gives instruction to her fellow conspirator and readies herself, keeping a close and wary eye on the maid with her Byakugan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside Natsu has had a very long day. First Konohamaru, Moegi and Udon had come and absolutely begged her to allow Hanabi-sama to join them for the day, a request that she refused at first, for Hanabi-sama's own sake of course. However, as she had gone through the day the constant presence, nagging and pranks, even if they were all foiled, wore on her until she finally relented. She had made herself quite clear that Hanabi-sama was supposed to be back by 3, which seeing as she let them go before lunch, Natsu thought was pretty generous. Shortly after she let Hanabi-sama go Natsu found herself completely bogged down with all of the worst kinds of jobs, which she was normally able to excuse herself from using the reason of needing to look after Hanabi-sama. It was almost like the other maids, and especially the tough head-maid, were trying to get back at her for having had a free pass for so long. Natsu had done it all without any complaint, efficiently and effectively, but it had been exhausting nevertheless. When the green haired caretaker finished with all the tasks that she'd been assigned she noticed that it was already 4, an entire hour after she had told all the kids that Hanabi-sama was supposed to be back! Tired, dirty and actually a bit angry, Natsu cleaned herself up and reviewed places where Hanabi-sama would go to hide from her. The abandoned safe house topped the list by a fair margin, and she set out to head there first. As she had approached she noticed movement within the safe house, which told her that coming here first had been a good move. Now she just had to punish some misbehaving children before dragging Hanabi-sama back to her lessons. <i>'Bunch of bad influences, see if I let you run off with young Hanabi-sama again anytime soon. But before that, I'll correct you in the place of your Ebisu-sensei. Should let him know about this as well while I'm at it. It's just sheer irresponsibility!'</i> Fuming, Natsu marched up to the main door with these thoughts in mind, not bothering to check inside with her Byakugan, and threw the door open to expose... A sealing tag!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan couldn't have worked better. The safe house had come with a considerable stash of weapons and tools in order to aid defense if ever it were to be discovered.  The sealing tag was something that Hanabi put in place to try to force Natsu to start moving toward the more confident and serious traps to the right side of the door, but it looks like the caretaker had simply failed to take care before entering what amounted to a fortress in disguise.  The sealing tag had wrapped up the kunoichi from the moment that it came into contact with her hand, which had been extended forward from her body to point accusingly at Hanabi and her friends. While it was doing so the maid stumbled towards the right, where she was rather defenseless against the exploding tag placed on the floor, which dropped her into a quickly rigged web of rope. That rope pulled taunt around the kunoichi even as it unraveled from it's web-like starting shape and thoroughly enmeshed her.  After this Natsu was unceremoniously dropped on her head, which triggered the last part of the trap, a simple pendulum with a 10 kg globe of steel on the end. (That's about 22 pounds for the metrically challenged.) As Natsu pulled herself for a moment, dazed, she was greeted by the sight of the mass of steel hitting her in the face. Now Hanabi and Moegi are left looking at a definitely unconscious Natsu, who has been so completely restrained and sealed that she wouldn't even pose a threat to them until she'd had about an hour to untangle herself. After she wakes up that is. Of course, giving her such time to recover isn't part of the plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi giggles as she rubs her hands together excitedly, proud of having thought of such a clever way to end all of this horrible mess. Once she had seen Natsu she realized all at once that there is more then one way to handle operation scapegoat. She'd been so focused on making sure that Moegi's gain was high enough to explain her as eating Naruto that she never thought of just finding a better way to explain her own gain. After all, if she were to tell Onee-sama that she ate Natsu, a full adult, as well as Udon, still a human size meal, then she would be able to have clearly gained over twice as much as Moegi, who digested Naruto, before Big Sis would question it. Plus, this way there are basically no downsides! Kono-kun stays outside of any stomachs, Onee-sama either drops the matter or ends up in Hanabi's stomach herself, Hanabi's current hunger for dinner is satisfied and Moegi, the only one to truly pay, is to blame for not warning Hanabi about Naruto and Hinata onee-sama to start with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, first things first, she needs to ACTUALLY eat Natsu. With Naruto she'd had it easy, just stand under him, open mouth, pull lever. Instant ramen, Hanabi thought with a giggle. Natsu is going to be much more cumbersome, as the tall maid will have to be manhandled into Hanabi's stomach from the start. Checking the condition of her new meal, Hanabi undresses her caretaker-turned-meal, intent on actually getting a good taste this time, and opens wide to begin swallowing Natsu's head.  Placing the face down on her tongue and gathering the hair out of the way across Natsu's back, Hanabi is surprised at how well the mix of flavors go together. Hints of sweetness are overpowered by the unexpected sourness and saltiness of the delightful meal, a signature taste that stands apart from anything that Hanabi had ever had before. She swallowed steadily, enjoying herself much more then she had expected to, pulling the modest breasts into her mouth.  Here the taste changes, adding a certain umami to the meaty meal, which is even more delicious with the addition. Hanabi only spends a little while tasting and chewing lightly on these small mounds before continuing on with her dinner. Ironically enough, it was Natsu herself who had always drilled it into Hanabi's head to finish all of her dinner, and now Hanabi is speeding up the delivery of the same to her stomach in keeping with those teachings. As she slid her mouth down the belly of the strict maid, she finds the umami taste replaced with a strengthening of the sweetness which had only been hinted at so far, a wonderful difference that speeds Hanabi on her way, wondering what other delights this lovely meal has in store. As she pulls Natsu's butt into her gaping maw, Hanabi finds a change which she is... less then pleased with, but only because she had built up such expectations, all the other changes having been for the better when they had occurred. When she reaches the ass, the flavor adds a noticeable bitterness, replacing the sweet, but it goes rather well with the most constant mixture of sour and salty which has formed the base of the caretaker's taste. Moving quickly along, Hanabi finds in the firmness of the long legs a strengthening of the saltiness, and the revival of the sweetness, which Hanabi takes delight in as perhaps the best taste yet. But alas, all good things must come to an end, and while following that excellent flavor Hanabi comes upon the end of the seemingly endless legs far sooner then expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the final swallow, Hanabi looks down at her now massive middle in a little bit of confusion. She had felt more full after eating Naruto... and he was way smaller. If anything, she had been slightly worried that she'd run out of room before Natsu ran out of leg. Instead, Hanabi found herself only moderately content. While she found it strange, she also had more important things on her mind, and she needed to prepare herself for that part of things. Looking up, she see that Moegi is staring at her. \"What?\" Moegi blinks at the short, sharp question, then responds, \"I was just surprised how easily you ate her Hanabi-chan.\" Hanabi can't fault her for that when she herself has had the same basic thought, but the pair still needs to get moving. And first on the list of priorities is for Moegi to get Konohamaru somewhere out of the way and for Hanabi to digest her second human meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe options for them both are rather simple. Hanabi can digest Natsu using the same jutsu that she used on Naruto and have Moegi hide Konohamaru somewhere nearby in the safe house, or Moegi can take Konohamaru back to the village and drop him off while Hanabi takes her time digesting her large dinner. If they take the first route, Hanabi will be able to resolve all of this today instead of tomorrow, plus she'll have Natsu in her mindscape to play with later, but it would leave Konohamaru in a precarious situation if Hinata were to take out both of herself and Moegi. On the other hand, if she takes her time, Natsu is gone for good, Konohamaru and Moegi are both at a slight risk while he's taken back to Konoha and she'll probably be digesting overnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Hanabi decide?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hanabi's actions were to be ruled by a need for speed. She felt quite plainly and honestly that if she were to fail to deal with the situation with her sister that things would spiral out of control. Of course, given her father's likely course of action if she were to disappear for a night, along with Natsu, without any warning... well, the safe and secret hideout wouldn't stay secret for long. And if that action were to be taken before digestion was complete, bringing Hanabi face to face with Onee-sama to early. Hanabi shuddered at the thought alone. No, it'd be much better to handle this quickly, while things could still be fairly easily controlled. Therefore, she'd take care of this digestion business as quickly as possible, and made the same handseals that she had when she digested Naruto. \"<u>Jinsokuna shobun no jutsu</u> (Rapid disposal technique)!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as it had for Naruto, the stomach kicked into a ultra-high gear, digesting the woman who had looked after Hanabi as if she were actually her mother at 100 times the speed that would have progressed normally. With Naruto, who had already been dramatically weakened and was far smaller, this had made the remainder of digestion feel like it happened in seconds, but a better estimation would have been a couple minutes. Strangely, Natsu felt the opposite as her still unconcious body was hit with the sheer power of Hanabi's jutsu-enhanced belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Hanabi it felt like ages watching her stomach shrink inch by inch as the flesh of the woman who raised her was steadily torn apart and converted into pure nutrients for Hanabi to absorb. She could feel it just as clearly as with the blonde idiot, as Natsu's skin was dried into a tough leather then shredded by savage acids, gouging out chunks of the muscles behind it which were brutally liquified into a goop which drained away into her intestines to fuel her body. Hanabi could sense Natsu's organs as they were split apart with savage and instant force, even fancying that she could recognize when some individual parts were crushed into the paste that would strengthen her. After an eternity, or maybe just a few minutes, Hanabi could only feel a skeleton remaining, which was attacked with the full fury of her gut, and slowly, ever so slowly weakened and broke down even Natsu's bones into a calcium which would help her to grow... just like milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hanabi's attention was firmly focused on the feeling of every ounce of Natsu being absorbed, her body was hard at work gathering up as much of it as possible and putting it to immediate use. When this new flood of sustenance began Hanabi was not quite ready to begin benefiting properly from a such a delightful dinner, but Natsu was generous enough to finish preparing Hanabi for such and to make a starting donation. Of course, it took the majority of what Natsu had to offer before Hanabi was ready, and even then only a small portion was set aside for such use at the time, but even so Hanabi was able begin to grow a more womanly figure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hanabi came to herself after the last of Natsu had been assimilated into her body, she had to take stock of her situation as she would if she were regaining consciousness. As she did so, she noticed three things which would surprise her. First, Moegi and Kono-kun had left without her noticing. Normally, with what passes for stealth according to Moegi, Hanabi would have expected to never lose track of her friend. Given the added handicap of having to drag or carry Konohamaru? Hanabi was impressed.  Second, she felt... wet... down at her most private place, and some instinct told her that it was different from having used the bathroom. She touched it for a moment, and it felt like a jolt of electricity, leaving her sighing as she came for the second time in her young life. The first time she recognized as the constant and drawn out feeling she got from absorbing Natsu. Third, she noticed that she had not only grown up some more, making a jump from a still preteen girl to a middle school lady, she had even developed somewhat in the chest and butt! True, they were both still small, but Natsu had made due with only slightly better, and she'd been a full grown adult. In all honesty, Hanabi's boobs were barely big enough to justify a training bra, if that, and her butt had just big enough to it to make her figure an hourglass... but it was a start!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you, thank you!\" Hanabi squealed with delight. \"I don't know what I did to deserve this Natsu-san, but thank you so much for the curves. I'll make sure to treasure them and to remember who got them started for me.\" Hanabi couldn't have been more pleased with the results, though she had definite plans on adding more to what Natsu had given her. After all, she still had to ensure that she'd be safe from Onee-sama. Question now is, should she visit her mindscape to thank Natsu for being so generous right away, or should she prioritize dealing with her big sister... which she is finally ready to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hanabi looks herself over, observing how small her shorts and shirt had gotten on her new body. Her shirt had gotten to be about a size small after eating Naruto, but after adding Natsu it is getting much too small, being both short, baring a tiny amount of her midrift, and tight, getting somewhat stretched across the chest. Her shorts had been a little tighter after Naruto's addition, but after Natsu Hanabi was honestly worried that if she undid them that she wouldn't be able to button them back up again. An they hugged far closer at the legs then they were made to, and were now showing off a good 2 or 3 inches of thigh, instead of the rough inch the designer intended. Of course, this really shouldn't have come as a surprise... these cloths were made with an 8 year old Hanabi in mind, and now they were being worn by what physically is closer to a 13 year old Hanabi. <i>'Add a new wardrobe to the list of things to take care of'</i> Hanabi sighed to herself. <i>'These cloths are not gonna survive another meal... not even an Moegi-size meal.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi then wondered what was keeping her friend so long and activated her Byakugan to find Moegi.  First she checks the area below herself, and while she doesn't find Moegi, she does spot Konohamru. Looks like she's already taken care of putting Kono-kun away safely, stashing him in the safehouses cellar, with a small weight placed on the trapdoor. If Konohamaru were to untangle himself, get something stable enough to stand on and give it a push with all his might it would hold for at least a few attempts before sliding out of the way. On the other hand, it will be pretty easy for Hanabi to push to the side after dealing with Onee-sama. <i>'Well, that's good. But where is Moegi?'</i> Hanabi then turned her attention to the area above her, finding Moegi in what looks like one of the bedrooms, measuring her height. Hanabi deactivates her Byakugan with a giggle, suddenly wondering how much taller she's gotten herself. She heads upstairs to join her friend, and they have just a few more minutes of fun before the two of them have to go to settle everything anyways. After all, at this time of day Hinata Onee-sama is extremely easy to find. She's mid-training with their father, and won't be done for another 30 minutes. At Moegi and Hanabi's old speed this safe house is only about 25 minutes away, and they've both gained a significant amount of chakura, so they have some time to kill anyways. Why not see what the profits from their meals were?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi walked in as Moegi was turning back around to check her height. As Moegi looked at the place her finger was marking she raged, \"122 cm? Seriously!? That's the fifth different height I've got from this stupid thing in six measurements... not to mention that's how tall I was before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly Moe-chan,\" Hanabi answered with a laugh. \"That's why you need someone to measure you. Here, I'll get your height and you can measure mine, that way we'll get it done sooner and it'll be accurate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoegi comes close to jumping out of her skin when Hanabi speaks up, and whirls on the spot. \"Don't sneak up on me like that Hanabi-chan. You scared me half to death.\" Moegi does, however, hand over the tape measurer and stands up straight, on her tip toes, for Hanabi to figure out her new height. Hanabi takes it with a \"Thanks\" and \"Stand flat footed\" then measures Moegi to have grown to... wow. Hanabi measures it again to be sure, same result, and asks Moegi how tall she was before. Moegi proudly responds that she was 122 cm, and Hanabi gives her the measurement that she had double checked... 131 cm. (For the metrically challenged... 122cm ~ 4 foot and 131cm ~ 4'4\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both are surprised and laugh as Hanabi makes fun of Moegi's growth spurt, asking if eating udon is really so good for growing. Moegi takes it in stride, commenting that they still had yet to see how much ramen and good care will do for a growing girl. Giggling as they went, Hanabi hands over the tape measurer and immediately hunches over forward like an old man with a bad back, which causes the pair to laugh until they the both fall over. A few minutes later, when things have called down and tears of laughter have been wiped from two pairs of eyes, Hanabi stands straight while Moegi measures the combined growth from Naruto and Natsu. Before her lunch and dinner, Hanabi stood at 132 cm. When Moegi checks the new height she has the exact same reaction that Hanabi did to Moegi's new height, and checks it again before announcing that Hanabi is now 145 cm. <i>'Wow, Onee-sama is only 147 cm, that means I'm nearly as tall as Sis!'</i> Hanabi thinks in shock. <i>'Probably a good thing we did this, I'd have been caught off guard if I'd only realized it when I was looking her in the eye. And there is no margin for error here.'</i> (For the metrically challenged, 132cm = 4'4\" 145 cm = 4'9\" and 147 cm ~ 4'10\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi's sober face as this thinks in stalls Moegi's continued glee, and she becomes serious as well. \"Is it time Hanabi-chan?\" She says with a great and solemn ceremony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is time Moegi-chan.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pair take to the trees as they race each other back toward the Hyuga clan's compound at speeds far higher then they ever could have before. In particular, Hanabi during the racing feels like her chakura is always pushing maximum, and is easily maintaining a pace that is faster then her old full sprint as if it were a morning jog. Moegi is able to keep pace with that speed, which itself is a huge statement about her increased ability, but it is a strain for her. Eventually seeing this, Hanabi slows down to match pace with her friend and talks Moegi through her \"part\" in operation scapegoat... while conveniently avoiding the fact that Moegi herself is the scapegoat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll greet my Onee-sama alone after she finishes her training. If we're lucky she hasn't realized that Boss is dead just yet, which will let me be the one to break the news. That'll automatically give us an edge in telling our story. I'll explain the whole situation to her, just keep quiet so that you don't say anything that doesn't fit the story. Onee-sama is not stupid enough to believe a single word of it if we ever contradict each other. No matter what, if Onee-sama asks you about the story I've fed her, you tell her that I'm right, ok?\" Hanabi says as they arrive. Moegi nods, completely trusting in Hanabi's wisdom, and asks, \"so where will I be while you explain everything?\"  Hanabi expected this question, and is already leading Moegi towards Hinata's room. \"We'll finish dealing with this in Onee-sama's room. When we get there I'm gonna tie you up so that she knows you haven't touched anything. She's already touchy enough about her privacy without already be enraged by her crush getting himself digested. Don't worry, your presence in her room will be explained before we get there, so she won't be surprised to see you.\"  Something about that seemed fishy to the scapegoat... sorry, to Moegi... but Hanabi surely knows her own sister, and if that's the best way to handle it then Moegi will continue to trust in her best friend and will just go with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got to the heiress's room and Hanabi tied the scapegoat's arms behind her back and tied that rope to the most immovable object in the room... the bed. Hanabi quickly changes into some of the general Hyuga clothing sized for her sister, and therefore much closer to her actual size then anything in her own room, and makes her way to the training complex. Hanabi honestly didn't expect to make it all the way to the training complex, because it was Hinata's habit to head back to her room to before going to the baths. Probably something she did to make sure that nobody was in the public bath house when she went in, or just to have some time alone to think about the day's training. The reason honestly didn't matter to Hanabi, but it made Hinata predictable. Before long Hanabi rounds a corner and runs straight into her sister, causing them to both lose their balance and fall in a tangled mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata recovers first and is already taking the blame and apologizing for her carelessness before she even gets back up to her feet or recognizes who ran into her. Hanabi cuts her off as she stands up and helps Hinata up. \"It's alright Hinata onee-sama, I should watch where I'm going. I was actually looking for you.\" Hinata had stopped in surprise when she realized that it was her sister that she'd run into, and while Hanabi was apologizing Hinata was stunned speechless by the growth that Hanabi has undergone over the course of a single day. Hanabi takes Hinata's silence as permission to keep going and launches into explaining why she'd gone looking for her older sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I needed to talk to you because I didn't want you to hear about this from anyone besides me. You know how I went with Moegi, Kono-kun and Udon to play earlier today?\" Hinata looks kinda blank, she actually hadn't known about that. Hanabi realizes this, and while disappointed that Hinata hasn't paid enough attention to Hanabi's life to know about that she also knows that the less Hinata actually already knows the more Hanabi can manipulate the information. \"Well I did. Now, they like to play around with Naruto sometimes, and they even call him Boss for some reason.\" Hinata nods at this, she's watched the kids and Naruto from afar before. \"When we were playing today we ran into Naruto. Moegi decided we should place missing nin, which is a game that puts all of us against Naruto. Normally they wouldn't be able to catch him at all, but when I was playing as well we eventually got him. Took a few hours though.\" Hinata smiles at that, somehow that made her proud of her sister and her crush at the same time. \"We got him in this rope trap finally, which we could easily lower him from with a lever. Moegi had talked to me earlier about something called vore. Do you know what that is Onee-sama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nods before replying, \"it's a technique that allows the user to completely devour and digest their target. Only kunoichi can use it, and even then it's pretty rare. I was told it's even rarer to be able to use it if you have a Kekkei Genkai like our Byakugan. Is that how you grew so much? Wait... You didn't...???\" Hinata can't bring herself to finish that thought. Surely her precious, cute little sister wouldn't betray her so much as to devour her beloved Naruto. There's got to be another explanation. And Hanabi is all to prepared to provide another explanation. \"Yes, I grew so much through using vore.\" Hinata immediately braces herself for the worst, praying fervently that Naruto isn't part of how her cute sister stopped being so little. \"But, no, I didn't eat Naruto. I ate Udon and Natsu.\" Hinata's emotions do a quick and interesting roller coaster from relieved that Naruto didn't get eaten, to shocked that Hanabi ate not one but two residents of Konoha, to finding her sister's appetite strangely alluring. Hanabi doesn't give her a moment to rest though and presses onwards. \"But... I'm sorry Onee-sama...\" For the rest of her story, Hanabi mentally activates the most fearsome jutsu of all youngest siblings... the crocodile tears jutsu. \"I tried to stop her... it all happened so fast *sniff* Moegi just stood under the rope trap... she looked up *sniff* she, she... she pulled the lever!\" As her sister speaks, a horrible knowing comes over Hinata, only confirmed more and more as Hanabi continues. Hinata continues denying it to herself, thinking that her wonderful Naruto couldn't be gone, but she can not gainsay the fact that Naruto has been digested. As that reality sets in, a fierce rage consumes the elder Hyuga sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas Hinata bought her sister's story? Is her wrath directed at the innocent Moegi? Or has the elder sister seen through the fake tears? Is Hanabi about to find herself in a brutal matchup with a furious Hinata? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unable to accept the death of her beloved Naruto, Hinata is desperate to find even the slightest of cracks in Hanabi's story to hold onto.  In a normal state of mind, Hinata would have easily noticed all of the falseness of the tears, the pure power of Hanabi's new chakura, the implications of Hanabi having talked to Moegi about vore before Naruto was eaten alive and various other flaws. In her current state of turmoil however, Hinata is left with a deep seated sense that something doesn't add up. Making things even harder for the Hyuga princess, unknown to both sisters, the influence of the Kyuubi's lust has not been stopped by Naruto's absorption by Hanabi. That said, it has been greatly affected by its new position inside of a boy who is inside of a girl... weakening the effects drastically and changing the nature of those effects somewhat. Using Hinata and Hanabi's bond as sisters, as well as Hinata's impression of her sister as a very pretty growing girl, the heat the Fox is feeling causes Hinata to have a greater then normal trust and dependence on her little sister... further exaggerated by Hinata's mile-wide submissive streak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of all of this, she can't place what it is... but Hinata is still sharp enough to realize that something is wrong. In her emotional state, and desperate for the most important detail, Naruto's death, to be proven false, Hinata's rage seizes the fake tears alone as the only thing that she can pin her misgivings on.  Hinata has seen those crocodile tears time and time again before, and concludes out of sheer hope and hopelessness that the lie that is covered by those fake tears is that Naruto is somehow alive. Hinata, out of her mind with desperation, convinces herself that while other aspects of the story must be true, Hanabi-chan is lying... MUST be lying... when she claims that Naruto is dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Hanabi is lying about something, which gives Hinata enough to latch onto and try to accuse with. \"Hanabi neechan... those tears may have always worked on Father... but I have always seen through them with ease.\" Hinata snarls, greatly upset that her little sister would dare mock her with a false report of Naruto's demise. \"I can see through you and your little lies with these eyes, little sister. I always have. And right now, you. are. lying. to. me. That you ate Natsu and Udon seems true enough, but after that the lies start. Now, how about this time you tell me the TRUTH!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger of the sisters begins to shake like a leaf before the obvious rage of the elder. But Hanabi does not let emotion rule her, and masters her fear into a tool to aid in the conceiving of her Onee-sama. Thinking quickly, using what Hinata Onee-sama has clearly accepted as truth to try to figure out what part of the lie is not being believed, Hanabi concludes that her big sister thinks that Naruto has survived. <i>'That's easily enough proven at least. I'll just have to hold my own long enough to get her to go and see what's happened to Moegi-chan.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You almost sound like Neji's old arrogance there Onee-sama,\" Hanabi returns with some heat herself. \"If you want me to tell you that Naruto is alive, then your out of luck. Your precious Naruto was digested alive in the stomach of a girl barely over half his age!\" Hanabi surprised herself with her own vehemence and strength as she stood nose to nose with her big sister.  \"You are right, these are fake tears. Personally I didn't even like Naruto that much, never thought he was worthy of the love that you gave him.  But I thought that for your sake, I should at least TRY to be gentle and compassionate in telling you!  Then again, if it's like this then you won't believe me unless I prove it will you!?\" Hanabi turns on her heel angrily and begins to march towards the Hyuga princess's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrown even further off balance by the sudden anger that her little sister retaliated with, Hinata is deeply wounded by accusation. However, she can't really deny that she had just talked to her sister in a way similar to how Neji had talked to her during the chunnin exams. And so, in shame, she takes that blow as just, and as she looks at the reason Hanabi-chan gave for the false tears she can't help but hope that it is a lie... but she can see her little sister thinking that of Naruto rather easily. Just like she can see Hanabi-neechan trying to show equal distress in telling Hinata, as a way to help Hinata deal with the disastrous news. But what bothers the Hyuuga heiress the most... is the confidence with which Hanabi demanded if she would have to prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You coming or not Onee-sama?\" Hinata is startled out of her thoughts with a jolt. \"What kind of proof are you going to show me, Hanabi-chan?\" Hinata can't see Hanabi's face as the little sister continues to lead them in the direction of the elder's room. Hinata does notice a slight hesitation before her sister responds, \"I'm going to show you what happened to Moegi after she ate Naruto. You can even ask her if I've been telling the truth. She won't deny it.\" By this time they are right outside of the door to Hinata's room. Hanabi throws open the door and leads the way inside, while Hinata lingers for a moment outside, hoping she won't see what she knows she'll see.</span></div></div>",

Taking her sister here was a gamble on what question her Big sis would ask the scapegoat, but she'd reached an impasse with her lies. But that does not mean that she can't keep a measure of control over the situation, and guide her sister's train of thought. In fact, Hanabi had already started to do so. By commenting that Hinata could ask Moegi if Hanabi had told the truth, she's already planted that question in Hinata's head. True, Hinata still might ask something different, like if Naruto was dead, or if he'd been digested. But as long as Hinata could be kept from asking who did the digesting Moegi should be able to avoid completely screwing it up.  <i>'I hope at least.'</i> Hanabi thought with a hint of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata entered behind her little sister, and was greeted by the sight of Moegi, both hands tied behind her back and secured to the bed. Hanabi can see the gears turning at breakneck speed in her big sister's head, as she observes the stretched out cloths, the clear growth in height and the confidence with which Moegi remains seated. Her sister's face pales and darkens by turns as the silence stretches from a scale of seconds to minutes, through which Moegi was thankfully intelligent enough to keep quiet, before Hanabi decides to carefully prod Hinata oneesama into motion.  \"Well,\" Hanabi started \"aren't you gonna ask her anything? You could start with what you doubted when I told you. Or maybe you could just ask if I told you the truth. But standing there staring at her isn't gonna make anything happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder Hyuga sister wanted desperately to believe this was nothing more then a nightmare, and had been frozen staring at what she could only see as undeniable proof of Hanabi's complete honesty. At the sound of her little sister's voice, Hinata is pulled from her despair... leaving a cold hard anger firmly directed at the guilty party before her. Before she does anything else, Hinata shuts the door and locks it, leaving the three girls in a scene of judgment at which Hinata herself is both Judge and Jury. Turning to the accused, Hinata finally speaks. \"Hanabi told me everything about what happened to Naruto earlier today. Is it true? Was he really digested today?\" Hinata's voice is pitched low, and speaks slowly and clearly... but with a unrelenting demand for answers and honesty fueled by her icy wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe accused girl, oblivious to the fact that the false testimony that her best friend had given this judge was against herself, was only moderately cowed. Moegi figured that Hanabi had cleverly directed the attention somewhere else, and while stunned in being brought face to face with Hinata's vengeful fury, was comforted greatly by the delusion that it was not directed at her. With this to give her confidence, Moegi quickly regains the power of speech, and answers in a scared voice, \"yes, everything that Hanabi told you is true.\" Unfortunately for Moegi, that was pretty much the worst answer she could have given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's rage explodes into action at the confession of guilt as she roughly seizes the younger girl by the back of her neck and slices off her tight fitting cloths with a kuni, drawing a little blood in some places. This done, the kuni slashes down between the bed post and Moegi's hands before the protesting girls head is brutally shoved into a predator, muffling her pleas with the body of her devourer. All this takes place in barely a second, but the most shocking part is...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once her sister got in gear and sat down to judge Moegi events happened so fast that it made Hanabi's head spin.  Hanabi had expected her Oneesama to be decisive, but given the doubts Big sis had expressed in the hallway Hanabi had expected a more through examination. So when the Hyuga heiress had started to strip Moegi naked and sever the tie to the bed while leaving her hands bound, Hanabi had opened her mouth to ask what Hinata planned to do to her. Hanabi never got to ask that question, but she did get an answer in the form of Moegi's head and shoulders being rammed down her own throat.  Hanabi is roughly shoved over backwards by the unexpected momentum, going from seated on her knees for the trial to pinned on her back for the execution. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MUUMPH!?\" Hanabi grunted in confusion as her big sister worked more of Moegi down Hanabi's throat. Thankfully, Hinata oneechan seems to understand the intended question, namely <i>\"Why are you having me eat Moegi???\"</i> \"I can't do vore. I've tried once before, but it didn't work out very well. It's the main reason that I never tried to eat Naruto myself. But every time I saw him I would get so hungry, and I thought to myself... if it's Naruto I could eat him. Never got up the courage to try in the end. After all, if I were to try to eat him and fail... he'd have hated me wouldn't he?\"  <i>'Well, that explains that mystery at least. And Oneesama did mention that the ability to do vore is even rarer among those who have a special bloodline like us. Guess that means I'm the one who beat the odds.'</i> So thinking Hanabi started doing more of the work of swallowing the struggling Moegi, pushing Hinata's hands away so that she can do it herself. After all, that cramming that Hinata was doing is more of a detriment then it is an aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, this way Hanabi would get to savor the flavor of her lovely scapegoat. Never in her wildest dreams would Hanabi have thought that things could wrap up so excellently. And Moegi tasted absolutely wonderful now that she could actually focus on the taste!  It was a hardy, tangy flavor that was enhanced by the taste of the iron from the wounds inflicted when Moegi was cut out of her cloths. Moegi was striving with all of her might to break free, but with her hands tied behind her back and her elbows and stomach already in Hanabi's mouth there really wasn't anything the poor girl could do. Hanabi ate her with efficient, now practiced swallows, enjoying the fight in this meal as it uselessly tried to break free. As she continued Hanabi came upon Moegi's butt, and remembering what had happened with Natsu was braced for a bitter taste to invade her senses, but instead tasted something sweeter then honey as her tongue slipping into Moegi's pussy. Surprised by the sensation, Moegi froze momentarily before her struggles to get away from the tasting tongue got even more frenzied, the wet instrument causing unfamiliar and frightening feelings to build through her body. Thankfully for Moegi the torture was short-lived, as she felt herself reach a high point and something wet leave her pussy. Confused, tired out and embarrassed, most of the fight leaves Moegi, while Hanabi delights in the wonderful taste of her reward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hanabi has been playing with her food, it has had quite an effect on Hinata. Something about watching Hanabi as a skillful predator making her prey cum was deeply arousing to the girl who used to love Naruto. She slipped a hand into her panties, while another went under her shirt to play with her boobs while she tried to bring herself to a climax watching her own little sister devour her best friend. Adding fuel to the fire, Hinata wonders what her not-so-little sister will look like by the time she's done with everything that Hinata has in mind for Moegi's punishment. That did it, the thought of what comes after this puts the Hyuga princess over the edge as she has the most powerful orgasm she'd ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe flavor of Moegi's nectar was the most complex taste that Hanabi had ever had before. It was a indescribable whirlwind of flavor that left Hanabi without any reference point to which to compare the delightful taste. But Hanabi was hungry for the rest of her dessert, and started down Moegi's legs, where she was met by a saltiness that was simply shocking, diluting all other tastes under the taste of Moegi's sweat. But that flavor of lust, fear and exertion was a wonder in it's own right and Hanabi dutifully licked up every drop of it on her way to swallowing down Moegi's feet.  Then, facing her big sister, Hanabi opens her mouth to show only Moegi's toes remain, and closes it to give a dramatic swallow before opening her mouth to confirm that the prisoner has been fully consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful job Hanabi neechan. Now, I want that little bitch to suffer for what she did to poor Naruto-kun.\" Hinata state with a measure of fierce satisfaction in her voice. \"And I'm going to teach you how to do it. I may not have had the talent for it, but I made sure to learn as much as possible in case I ever got the nerve to try to eat Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'But I've already swallowed Moegi... what else can we do to her?'</i> Hanabi wonders. That question is answered as Hinata explains that...</span></div></div>",

Which certainly gains the full attention of the younger Hyuga, who had been content to lay down and feel the fullness of her stomach. Strangely, Hanabi feels more full now then she did after eating Naruto, despite Moegi being smaller then even Naruto... let alone Natsu who had been the least filling. It's honestly as if her stomach acctually is thinking of Moegi as a dessert course to the dinner Natsu provided. Or at least, it felt that way until her Big sister got her attention with the possibility of soul vore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what it sounds like?\" Hanabi asks in surprise as she sat up. She'd have never thought that such a thing was possible. Oneesama replies with nothing more then a smirk and a nod, leaving Hanabi feeling like she needs to clarify. \"You mean to tell me it's actually possible for me to digest Moegi's soul?\" Meanwhile, the occupant of Hanabi's stomach is very clearly not pleased with how events have played out, even if she can't hear this talk about digesting her soul itself. Of course, Hinata and Hanabi can't hear what she's shouting either, just a bunch of muffled noises, but Moegi is not limiting herself to verbal resistance. That said... she's not making any progress physically forcing her way out either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata laughs, \"That's exactly what I'm saying Imouto.  Unfortunately, I only know a round about way to do it.\" Hanabi is leaning forward, squishing Moegi slightly, as she hangs on Hinata oneesama's every word. \"First, you'll need to use an accelerated digestion jutsu to absorb her soul into your mindspace. Do you know any, or would you like me to teach you one? This is honestly the time sensitive part, as it must be activated before she dies inside your stomach, so we'll need to get started right away either way.\"  Hinata's voice is strong and confident as she talks, not giving Hanabi much chance to interject verbally, though Hanabi nods in responce to the question. But as she finishes so as to let Hanabi give a more informative answer, Hinata does add something in a whisper, almost as if to herself,  \"Besides, I kinda wanna see how my Imouto looks after absorbing Moegi's body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, Hanabi herself was also curious about that point. \u201cI already know a Jutsu to speed my digestion enough to absorb her soul. I actually used it on Natsu-san when I ate her, though in her case it was to digest her fast enough.\u201d Hanabi informs her older sister. \u201cIt's a pretty wild ride to use too.\u201d Hanabi says as she forms the handsigns for the jutsu she used on Naruto and Natsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she digests Meogi, how does it affect Hanabi's body?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, Moegi, it's time to get this show on the road.\" Hanabi excitedly exclaims as she finishes the last of the handling needed. \"Jinsokuna shobun no jutsu!\" As the jutsu activates the power of Hanabi's belly vastly increases, which causes Moegi to thrash with uncontrollable might. Compared to Naruto's resistance Moegi was considerably weaker... yet where Naruto had been funny, Moegi is actually starting to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Moegi is facing by far the most terrible pain and betrayal of her young life. Her sides and across her legs are cut into in places, which allowed the acids to sleep behind the skin from the moment she was swallowed. It was painful and made a location at which Hanabi would be able to easily start breaking down muscle and more important organs long before it would have otherwise reached... which became a very immediate concern when Hanabi's gut suddenly went into overdrive. Moegi thrashed every which way, trying to protect her vulnerable cuts, as her flesh was attacked by acids strong enough to eat through metal. But against the young Hyuga's stomach, there was no such option. It brutally pulverized Moegi down and filled itself with enough acids that the cuts on her thighs were right at the churning violent broth, forcing more acids deeper in with every swirl, push, relaxing, and even every breath that passed in the terrible nightmare location. Within only 20-30 seconds Moegi's legs give out beneath her, plunging her whole body under the devastating fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Hanabi is enduring her own pain, as her stomach is not immune to it's own acids or the force of the struggles within... only much better suited to handling them. But her belly has already overcome 2 meals by greatly empowering its attacking acids and is crushing strength without improving its own ability to withstand that power. Needless to say, this stomach starts to ache very quickly. Initially, Hanabi is only annoyed by how it lightly distracts from the pleasure she felt the last two times... But by the time Moegi's legs give out Hanabi is in a good deal of pain herself, and Moegi is still giving her all to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow submerged in such mighty fluids, which fly everywhere as it boils like a pot on the stove and waves like the sea in a storm, Moegi is in the height of her pain and panic. The girl has lost feeling to her legs below the cuts, which scares her shirtless because she knows that it can only be a bad thing when everything above feels like a greater or lesser hell. Then again, as she strives to make any kind of headway to no apparent effect she feels her spirit break and says. \"Is this all our friendship ment to you Hanabi-chan?\" Before giving in and letting her head sink below the acids. Better to end the pain and be done with it. After all, the only good Naruto's hours of fighting did him was to amuse the two girls. What good could possibly come from keeping up a pointless fight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Hinata has come around to hold Hanabi in her arms to comfort the suffering predator, who's violent meal was actually causing enough problems that the Hyuga sisters were wondering if they needed to let Moegi out for the time being. Thankfully, the struggles finally ceased, even though Hinata can tell that Moegi is not dead just yet. Hanabi keeps the jutsu in place, determined to finish this in one go to let her suffering belly rest. It hurts, the worst belly ache that Hanabi had ever had, but she knows that it is far worse for the occupant of her stomach and holds on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing the minute mark, Moegi expires, leaving Hanabi with the much gentler job of breaking down the food for nutrition, which takes place over the most painful 10 minutes of Hanabi's life, the young woman crying like a baby before it concludes.  Hinata is left stunned at how this has turned out, and wishes there was something more she could do to alleviate her little sister's suffering, telling Hanabi multiple times that its ok if she stops. That digesting Moegi will be enough. Hanabi refused every time and simply suffered through. Hinata feels so guilty for so selfishly demanding such a painful act of her little sister and vows to herself to make it up to the best Imouto in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi was surprised when the pain kicked in, and was insulted by Hinata's offer to allow her to stop, but probably the most driving reason that she refused was that she looked on this pain as her punishment for digesting Naruto and tricking both Moegi and Hinata. It was cleansing to pay a penance, even a private one, in return for her actions. Besides, digesting her best friend SHOULD hurt, even if physical pain isn't the kind that would be expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth sisters are worried with other things as it steadily happens, but Moegi makes a considerable donation to a sexier Hanabi. Of course, they both pick up on it before its done, but neither could have told you when they first noticed Hanabi's tits expanding into the A, and then B cup range, finally stopping around the size of Hinata's borderline C cups. While that was Moegi's primary addition, a closer examination would also reveal that Hanabi's butt has received some love, gaining a thin layer of fat, which leaves Hanabi with an overall shape like an inverted triangle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls relax as the job is finally finished and Hanabi slumps, drenched in sweat and says \"We'll have to do the second part tomorrow sis. I'm not doing the rest until I get some sleep.\" Hinata meekly bows to the wish of her younger sister, \"anything you want my precious imouto. I'll do anything if its for you.\" That catches at Hanabi's mind, but the girl is too exhausted to really think about the implications it would have if her big sister was serious. \"Thanks Onee-chan. Right now I just want to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Hinata do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tenten and Hinata where casually walking back to the village after performing some intense training in one of the more distant training grounds. Despite what one may think when thinking of intense training these two had been practicing a different sort of training. As Kunoichi they were expected to be able to extract info from targets or the occasional random civilian using nothing but their feminine charms should the situation call for it. This normally meant that they would have to seduce their target and like all things you do practice made a Kunoichi more efficient. That is why they had chosen to go so far out for their practice. Just because they were expected to practice seduction techniques on their own didn't mean that they wanted others to stumble on to them while they practiced on each other. It wouldn't do for rumors to spread and end any chances they had at capturing their desired targets hearts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a lot better today than last time Hinata! Though I never thought you could get so aggressive once getting into the role.\" The older girl shrugged causing the younger and much shyer girl to blush from embarrassment. It was clear that Tenten was speaking of how Hinata had gotten a little too into her role. The shy girl had managed to strip the older girl down to her undergarments before they snapped out of it and realized what they were doing. \"And I still can't believe that you've never kissed someone before! I mean I would have sworn that you had to have practiced before.\" The burnet looked away at this trying to hide how red her face had gone at remembering how they had gone so far this session without even noticing; it actually had caused them to start questioning their own sexuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm just glad it's over for the day.\" Responded the shy Hyuga. She and Tenten had known each other for a few years now and was truthfully the only girl her age that she felt comfortable enough around that her stutter rarely pooped up. \"Hinata be truthful. How is it you can be so good at seducing someone and yet you haven't tried to use those skills on Naruto yet?\" Her friend questioned as they moved through the foliage. Hinata gave the question some serious thought but, in the end it all came back to one thing and it made her blush just thinking of it. \"I don't know why but, every time I see Naruto-kun I feel my mouth water and my stomach rumble; like my body is demanding me to eat him or something. When he gets close I can smell him and his scent is mouthwatering! It just makes me want to open my mouth and start shoving him into me. I'm afraid that if I try something like this with him that I'll completely lose it and just start swallowing him down... D-does that seem weird to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten didn't answer right away. How could she when she herself had been having similar reactions to the blond recently. She wasn't sure if what she had to say was right but, it made sense to her; in a sort of twisted manner at least. \"Well Hinata, I'd say that your body has a better idea of what you want then you may know.\" She was quick to continue when she saw the look of shock and slight horror at the thought that her body would betray her heart. \"Think on it like this Hinata. What is it you want most with Naruto? It's to be with him forever, right? Well by, gobbling him up you can do that. True he would suffer a terrible and agonizing digestion but that would only be for so long. Then he would effectively be a part of you. You'd always be together then.\" Hinata was quite for a time clearly thinking over what her friend had said. \"B-but, what about his dream?!? How can Naruto-kun be Hokage if I turn him into nothing but, fat on my body?\" It was odd for the shy girl to even think it but, the idea of making Naruto a part of herself was very tempting. \"Well first off, I doubt you need to worry about turning him into fat as I would be willing to bet you that he would go straight to your breasts and rump more than anything.\" She watched her shy friend in slight amusement as she blushed and unconsciously cupped her breasts at the thought that Naruto could become part of them. \"Second, if you eat him then he is a part of you, so just become Hokage in his place! After all, if you take the hat then essentially so does he!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blinked at that. It was so simple and she had never thought of it! There was only one thing left that could keep her from going through with eating the blond. \"Babies?\" Tenten didn't need her to explain what she meant thankfully. \"He's clearly old enough; likely they've already got samples on ice that you can use once you get a bit older.\" And with that it was decided, Hinata would no longer hold back and would devour Naruto so that he could become a part of her forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Made your decision have you.\" It was a statement not a question. Tenten could clearly see what Hinata had just promised to do once she saw the blond. A part of her was a bit disappointed knowing that she wouldn't get to eat the blond herself but, at least Hinata would finally have her man. It was at this time that the weapon mistress noticed something hanging from a nearby tree. \"Well it seems you'll get to put that new resolve to the test sooner than either of us thought!\" She said a grin on her face as she pointed at the bundle hanging from the tree and all nicely wrapped up. Perfect for a hungry young Kunoichi who was looking for a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Hinata do when she sees Naruto in the perfect position to be eaten?</span></div></div>",

After all, if she went through with this then she would never get to see him again. It didn't take long for Tenten to start losing patience though. Something she made known by tapping her foot against the ground before giving an exasperated sigh. \"Well? Are you going to eat him or not?!?\" Realizing that Tenten wasn't in the mood to wait, Hinata looked around and saw how the rope tying her soon-to-be-meal up was connected to some kind of pulley or winch system. \"Tenten, there's some sort pulley system connected to the rope holding Naruto-kun up. Could you go over to the other end and release him once I'm ready?\" Seeing no problem with this Tenten just grinned before walking off into the foliage towards the release lever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone with only her thoughts, her grumbling stomach and a view of her beloved that she couldn't help but fell amused by, Hinata steeled her resolve. She loved Naruto from the bottom of her heart and soon enough he would be a part of her body. She silently hoped that Tenten was right and that most of him did end up going strait to her breasts and butt. The knowledge that he was so close to her heart and that he was constantly supporting her, even if it was in a very different manner, would surly help her through the darker parts of life. Most of all it would mean that a part of him would be there to meet his children once she she was old enough to carry them. The keeping of that particular type of genetic material was a new addition to the village security that Lady Hokage had put in place. Every ninja was to donate some of their sperm or eggs to the new vault in a separate section of the hospital. This was to allow the village a better chance of replenishing their ninja ranks should some kind of disaster like the Kyubi attack ever happen again. Had they had this before then the Uchiha clan would not have so easily been reduced to only two members; both of who where village traitors. Hinata was looking forward to the day she could 'request' to be impregnated with little Uzumaki babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping herself from her thoughts, Hinata noticed Tenten had arrived to her destination and was simply awaiting Hinata's signal to let the boy drop. Licking her lips in perpetration Hinata quickly moved under Naruto so that the momentum of his fall could be used to swallow down more of him in the first few gulps. She was thankful that he would be dropping head first for if he got the chance to speak to her she just knew that she would be unable to go through with this. A small voice in the back of her mind nagged at her that this wasn't the right thing to do but, Hinata quickly crushed that thought and braced herself for the weight that would soon be dropping into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let him loose!\" As soon as she said those words Hinata opened her mouth wide, eagerly awaiting the now panicking blond as he plummeted towards her.</span></div></div>",

Hinata had used Naruto's momentum from his fall to her own advantage, only adding on to it by jumping ever-so-much in order to reach her blond meal sooner. With Naruto tied up the way he was, the force of his fall into Hinata, who was moving opposite due to her jump, Naruto quickly found Hinata's lips encircling his shoulders and his head in her throat. Once his momentum over powered Hinata's own however, he quickly found himself waist deep inside the girl upon her landing. This however was not the end of it as before Naruto even had the chance to realize that his head was inside the tiny cavern of her stomach, Hinata jumped and let herself land hard upon her butt. All of this caused Naruto to almost literally slam into her stomach, surrounding the boy with slimy acid-covered fleshy-walls and other substances that the boy could not muster a name for in his shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside Hinata looked on at the wiggling and twitching feet of her beloved, the only part of him not yet inside her body. Smiling happily around his ankles at knowing her task was nearly complete, Hinata removed the sandals and gave a few more gulps while still taking a moment to run her tongue over his bare skin. Surprisingly his feet tasted wonderful but, she pushed away her wish to continue tasting him and gave a final hard swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA content sigh escaped her lips as she simply laid there a moment, feeling the blond continue to struggle futilely even as he was slowly deposited into her hungry stomach. She smiled in victory as she felt his feet and lower legs being pushed down her esophagus by the powerful muscles so that they could join the rest of him already curled up inside her inhumanly distended gut. Licking her lips she gave her massive stomach a gentle pat only to let loose a wet belch moments after. She giggled in delight at feeling him wriggling helplessly inside her stomach, just under the thin layer of skin and muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling herself over to a nearby tree, Hinata settled herself against it and returned to rubbing her hands gently over the shapes and bulges that Naruto made in her stomach. She finally felt complete as her stomach rumbled and gurgled around the love of her life. Soon she would experience the joys of digesting him and of becoming one with him. Soon, he would become a permanent part of her body... And she couldn't have felt happier.</span></div></div>",

Not feeling deterred as he had a pretty good idea who it was, Naruto made his way to the nearby corner and peeked behind it. The kids soon heard that same \"Eep!\" noise once Naruto checked around the corner. The kids watched as Naruto reached out around the corner before starting on his way back to them with someone else in tow. The girl in question easily identified as Hinata Hyuga by the large baggy tan colored jacket she was always wearing and the red coloring her cheeks as Naruto pulled her along.

Good job finding him Hinata.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ino, what's up?\" He had all but forgotten about the four kids who where watching them with great interest and the fact that he hadn't stopped holding Hinata's hand, something the girl was quite happy about. \"You need to come with us, Naruto. And I'm not taking no for an answer.\" This confused Naruto greatly, why were they looking for him? Was it some kind of mission? Where they some of the girls that had been sending those letters about eating him? So many questions flouted in his head but, Ino apparently thought he was taking to long to answer and simply grabbed him by the arm before she started dragging him away. Taking a moment to say goodby to Konohamaru and his friends after getting over the bewilderment he felt, Naruto asked the girls what they were doing that they needed him for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata remained quite while trying to keep up enough that she could continue holding his hand, something he still hadn't realized. As such it was up to Ino to explain. \"Well Naruto, we are...\"</span></div></div>",

As the tired thirteen year old trudged along the dirt road of his village Naruto wondered what was going on to cause such a change in the villagers reception of him, or more specifically the reception the females of the village gave him. Naruto sighed tiredly as he tried to figure out why the girls had started acting so weird. Some women that had acted outright violent to him only days before had suddenly been all over him. Now Naruto could appreciate having a nicely developed woman rubbing herself all over him, or having their breasts pressed against him but, it was still weird that they had acted so differently like that. Then again that had been nearly a month ago and wasn't the last time it had happened since. At first he thought that this meant the people were finally starting to acknowledge him and see him for who is was. Getting girls to hang off of him like they did for Sasuke had simply been a plus in his opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave another sigh as he remembered how the women then started to get a little more... 'friendly' then he was comfortable with. Having grown women slipping their hands under his jacket or down his pants had truthfully been more then a little bit startling, and scary. He flushed as he recalled how even his teammate Sakura Haruno had been more... <i>'Touchy Feely'</i> then normal. Of course it was some how his fault and she proceeded to beet the living hell out of him. <i>'Cant help but, wonder why she stole my pants though?'</i> He thought to himself as he remembered having to run back to his apartment in broad daylight with no pants on earlier that week. He was thankful that the embarrassing mishap with Ino a few days before that and the one only yesterday where he fell on top of Hinata and practically groped her hadn't ended with him being beaten to a bloody pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to take a break he sat himself down on one of the many benches that could be found throughout the village and...</span></div></div>",

We couldn't have much of a dinner without the main course after all.\" Exclaimed the older woman while subtly giving Naruto another of those dark and hungry looks. A look that Naruto didn't pick up on. \"Get what you can and come over to this room in the Kage's Tower at 6 PM. We'll be waiting on you.\" And with that Shizune handed him a note with where to meet before walking off to finish her own preparations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\nArriving at 6, as he was told, Naruto gave a quick knock before opening the door and...</span></div></div>",

Knocking him out will mean nothing if your yelling just wakes him back up!\" Screamed the platinum blond female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, please no fighting. We got Naruto-kun. Can we just tie him up and get started? I want to win my prize.\" Interrupted the soft voice of the shyest Hyuga girl in the village. \"And who says you get to have him Hinata? You haven't won the game yet. I could get Naruto for myself after all.\" Challenged Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think both of you girls have forgotten that this dumbass has been chasing me around for years. I'd say its obvious that I'm the one who's going to get him.\" Proclaimed Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls glared at each other. Neither one willing to give up their claim on the blond prize that lay on the ground, blissfully unaware of the conflict going on over possession of his person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think all three of you are being idiots. Don't forget that you aren't the only girls after him in this game.\" Interrupted Tsunade who had just walked in from another room. \"Now strip him down, tie him up and bring him in. The game is about to start. Remember, when you win you can do anything you want to him, wither it be eat and digest him, or make love to him, or even something else is up to the one that wins.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the three girls nod and beginning to strip the blond boy down, Tsunade turned around and went back to where she came. In the middle of a large room sat a round table with a large silver plater at the center. Five chairs were arranged around the table where one seat was already occupied by Shizune. Off to the left near the back corner lay another table. This one however was long and covered with an assortment of foods meant for the players should they be feeling a bit peckish. This room was a one of a kind custom room in the Hokage tower. There was the entryway that she had just come from and lead to the spacious dinning/living room that she was currently in. To the right was a large doorway leading to a small kitchen area, where as strait ahead of her lay the main bedroom where the winner of this little game could have some alone time with their prize should they so desire. The main bedroom even had a small bathroom attached to it, just incase the winner had to 'dispose' of her winnings remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n On the left side, near the front, lay the guest bedroom which was set up to house all those that lost this little game for the night. That would help allow the winner to relax as they wouldn't have to worry about someone barging in on them at the wrong time. The guest room also had its own bathroom. All in all, things were perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with looking around Tsunade walked up to the only other female not involved in stripping the prize down. \"Shizune, are you sure those three are the best we can do for opposing players?\" If Shizune felt slighted in anyway at the doubt her teacher held for her decision she didn't show it. \"Yes Tsunade-sama. There were reasons I didn't bring the other older Kunoichi in on this. Anko is known to cheat if she can get away with it. Kurenai was just as likely to put everyone in a genjutsu and make off with the prize as she was to actually play fair. And Y\u016bgao Uzuki, or Cat as she's called from her ANBU mask, was sent out on a mission no more then half a day ago. It will be at least a week before she gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade considered this for a moment before nodding in agreement. \"So what do you plan to do with him if you win? I've seen you give some mixed looks recently?\"  Questioned the blond Sannin. Shizune seemed to pause in thought for a moment, taking the chance to look over the nude and tied up prize as the girls carried him in. She found it rather amusing how they tried to keep their wandering hands hidden from everyone else. \"To be truthful Tsunade-sama, I'm not sure. While I certainly wouldn't mind getting to experience sex with a male for once, I could really go for a nice struggling meal. However, getting to experience a live male wiggling inside me only once would be a bit of a downer, so I might see about just keeping him in my womb. I'm quite open to any option really.\" Admitted the burnet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Personally, I just feel like getting a meal out of him. He's always saying he'll be a part of those few who are Kage. If I eat him then he truly gets to be a part of this Hokage.\" Said the smug older blond before turning to the three girls as they placed the boy on the silver platter. \"What about you three? What do you plan to do with him if you win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was the first to answer. \"I'm going to eat the dumbass of course. He has no worth outside of being a nice filling meal for a strong kunoichi, like me.\" The others just looked at the girl with raised brows, clearly questioning the girls claims as a strong kunoichi. \"As for me, I plan to use him for some practice so I can better learn how to use my body to get information from a target. Once I'm done I'll just eat him. He'll help make my body even sexier. I bet I'll even get breasts bigger then yours Hinata-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata frowned at the sudden focused attention at her jacket covered chest. She didn't need Ino spouting out how much bigger her chest was then any other girl their age. Heck she was bigger them a number of girls older then her too. \"What about you Hinata? What are you going to do if you win Naruto?\" Asked the Shizune. \"I'm going to show him what it means to be loved.\" Said the girl with a surprising amount of conviction. \"Then I'll keep him close so that no one else can try and take him from me.\" Admitted the youngest girl as she gently pat her body just below her stomach. \"So your not going to eat him?\" Questioned the surprised Kage. \"One day I will. But I want Naruto locked up close to my heart long enough for him to realize that we were always meant to be one first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the surprise wore off Tsunade figured it was time to get started. \"Okay girls, strip down naked and we will begin. You have to win two games to get your prize. We have a number of games to play but, out first one will be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What kind of game do they play? It can be anything, as long as no lasting damage is done to the girls.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who-Cum-First? This is all about trying to get your target to cum before you do. Every one has a go and the one with the most wins, wins the first game.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Kyuubi, known by a very select few as Kurama, was not in a good mood. As a chakra being the fox had no true gender; then again Kitsune where well known for transforming into beautiful females and seducing males and the occasional female for a bit of fun. Kurama had taken her human form and was currently pacing back and forth inside her cage. Despite being smaller now, the seal continued to do its job well, preventing her from simply slipping out between the bars of her massive prison. Her human form was something that Kurama was quite proud of and as such did not let just anyone see her like this. The bangs of her long fiery red hair perfectly framed her unblemished heart shape face while cascading down her back like a waterfall down to her firm and shapely rear. She was currently wearing a rather reviling red battle kimono that left her shoulders bare while showing off a great deal of her firm and perky D-cups. The kimono, although closed and held in place by a black Obi, opened up at about mid-thigh to reveal her long creamy legs; she wore no foot wear of any kind however. Her eyes were a blood red, a fact that was enhanced all the more by her pale cream colored skin. All though her skin was paler then some, it still wasn\u2019t quite at the same level as that Hyuga girl that followed her container around nor was it anywhere near as tanned as said container either. To finish up the 5\u20198 beauty had three faint whisker marks on each cheek, red fox ears with black tips that came out the top of her head and nine silky smooth tails, the same colors as her ears, connected to her tailbone just over her rump. Her tails swayed about in a soothing yet enticing manner even as she continued to anxiously pace about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox woman was anxious for one reason\u2026 She was in heat! She wanted a good fuck so badly that she couldn\u2019t even believe it. Right now she could feel her container walking closer towards her location and it was taking everything she had to not start begging/demanding him to join her on this side of the gates for some loving. Another reason she was so worried was that this would be her best chance to escape. Being a chakra born creature she wasn\u2019t limited in the same ways as human females where and using this Kurama knew that she could slip out of the cage and take control of the boy\u2019s body but, only if she could lock the boy away first. The only way for her to have both freedom of the cage and control was to slip out of said cage, but only Naruto himself could do that at will. If however, Kurama trapped the boy inside of her body, then the cage would recognize her as the boy and let her leave. After that, she could use her chakra to alter the boy\u2019s body into a physical copy of her own and go off looking for a good time. <i>\u2018Maybe I\u2019ll give that Hyuga girl a visit? I could have some fun with her and then let her join the boy inside of me\u2026\u2019</i>, Kurama pondered on this possibility. Her whole plan hinged on being able to get the boy on the other side of the cage and keeping her urges for a good fuck in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the someone finally walking up to her cage Kurama turned her sights on to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had learned about what Yin and Yang symbolised and the results weren't pleasant for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin was characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity and nighttime. Yang, by contrast, was fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and aggressive; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity and daytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo ever since the Fourth Ninja War, he'd had the FEMALE side of Kurama sealed within him. And Yin-Kurama was much more of a handful than the male half that Madara had ripped out of him. Damned Uchihas...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped in front of the seal/cage and frowned at the woman on the other side of the bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bangs of her long, fiery, dark crimson red hair perfectly framed her unblemished heart shape face while cascading down her back like a waterfall down to her firm and shapely rear. She was currently wearing a rather revealing red battle kimono that left her shoulders bare while showing off a great deal of her firm and perky D-cups. The kimono, although closed and held in place by a black Obi, opened up at about mid-thigh to reveal her long creamy legs; she wore no foot wear of any kind however. Her eyes were a blood red, a fact that was enhanced all the more by her pale cream colored skin. All though her skin was paler then some, it still wasn't quite at the same level as that Hyuga girl that followed her container around nor was it anywhere near as tanned as said container either. To finish up the 5\u20198 beauty had three faint whisker marks on each cheek, red fox ears with black tips that came out the top of her head and nine silky smooth tails, the same colors as her ears, connected to her tailbone just over her rump. Her tails swayed about in a soothing yet enticing manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at him and smirked at the sixteen-year-old blonde boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you DO to me?!\" he demanded, \"Every woman and girl around me look like they wanna rape me and others look at me like I look at ramen! What. Did. You. DO?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama laughed \"You're cute when you're angry, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanna know, come in here and MAKE me tell you, Sweetie.\" the Yin-half of the tailed beast cooed, winking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was seeing red and squeezed between the bars, ready to give her a piece of his mind...only to receive a massive object slamming down onto him and pinning him under the water. Whatever it was wrapped around him and lifted him out of the water and into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, after he stopped coughing up liquid, went wide-eyed as he saw he was in the grasp of a massive, nine-tailed fox. It had black fur and long, rabbit-like ears and almost hand-shaped frontal paws, complete with opposable thumbs on it's clawed hands. What was more, it also had long, feminine eyelashes. The Yin-Kurama's form was the same as the Black Nine-Tails, who was sealed within the body of Naruto's alternate self, Menma, from that Genjutsu World, alternate, illusionary world created by Tobi when he casts his Limited Tsukuyomi on Naruto and Sakura Haruno and trapped them in a crystal ball which hosted the dimension in an attempt to capture Kurama. The illusion was a prototype of the Infinite Tsukuyomi and was influenced by both Naruto's deep desire to have parents and Sakura's desire for freedom from parental control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama laughed \"Got you sweetie-pie~!\" she singsonged, \"Now we can P-L-A-Y~!\" she bat her eyes at her (to her actual form) toy-sized host. He really WAS cute at her mercy like this! \"Ho...aren't you just absolutely darling!? And you're the perfect size too...ooh...and you came JUST in time! I'm in heat right now and wanted a good fuck so badly that I couldn't even believe it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed while paling at the same time, as impossible as that sounded to do. The female side of Kurama that had replaced the one Madara had extracted from him was going to use him to...! He flailed his arms and legs like crazy trying to get away.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNo! No! This is crazy! You can't be serious! I can't believe you're going to\u2026. to\u2026!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well...eager to get to pleasing your new lover, cutie! Aren't you the sweetest little thing! I have just the place for you too! It'll feel GREAT with you inside me if you keep that squirming and thrashing up! I even have something to help you fix inside!\" the black fox howled with amusement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all in his mind. the laws of physics meant nothing here. As such, she held up her other hand-like paw and her red chakra bubbled over it then it solidified, becoming physical matter. She looked at what she'd created with sadisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bottle of vaseline. Before Naruto even had time to realize that, he was pummeled by tons and tons of the thick oily cream. He tried to run, but Naruto just slipped and fell into the pile more and more. \"Thats right, get all slippery\", he heard her say above him. Kurama's paw-fingers fell around Naruto and she then started to knead the vaseline all over his body. 'Ooh, you need lots of this!'' laughed the vixen as she wiped more vaseline onto her host, so Naruto had a layer of vaseline a few meters thick almost all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then picked her new lover/plaything up out of the gunk and raised him to her muzzled, furry face. \"Do you know where you're headed, my little man?\" she laughed as Naruto tried to wipe the gunk off his face without success. Kurman lowered Naruto until he was right in front of her puckering anus and pinkish vagina. \"Can you guess now where you're headed?\" she said with one last laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama shoved Naruto...</span></div></div>",

Before Kurama could even figure out what was happening the fox found itself bound by Kushina's golden-chakra chains. Falling to the ground, Kurama could do no more then glare angrily at the dead woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not have my boy.\" She said it as if it was a fact. The sheer power backing those words being something Kurama had never seen from this woman. It honestly made the fox uneasy. \"You will not have him. No one will,\" she said, her voice trailing off and her eyes taking a slightly glazed over sheen. \"No one will have my Naruto-chan. No one, but <b>ME!</b>\"<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto Uzumaki grumbled to himself as he trudged through the rather depressing and flooded corridors that made up his inner world. <i>'Why's this got to be so gloomy anyway? Why not a ramen stand or something? Would look much better then some flooded boiler room.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just about to step out into the large room that held Kyubi's prison when he suddenly found himself wrapped up by some large golden chains. \"The fuck is thi...\", Naruto screamed just before getting dragged off by the chains. He tried to fight it. He tried to free himself, but the chains left him feeling so weak. Soon enough he found himself hanging upside down, staring into a pair of beautiful violet eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman's voice soon broke him from the odd daze that seeing those eyes had placed him under. \"Hello Naru-chan. It's so wonderful to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto simply made a confused sounding noise, the boy leaning back as best he could so as to get a better view of this person. What he saw surprised him as the woman was both very beautiful and rather young looking. She could be older then mid-twenties at most. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he couldn't get a real good view of her body due too the white high-collared, sleeveless blouse and long, loose-fitting green dress, Naruto had an odd feeling that said this woman had a nice set of curves hidden from sight. Her skin was fair, her eyes a striking violet and long knee-length, fiery red-hair that fell down her back. Strands of those fiery-locks framed both sides of her face and a black clip parted her hair to the left, keeping the long bangs out of her eyes. To finish up her look she wore a dark blue wristband on her left wrist and shinobi sandals that appeared to be some sort-of faded lavender color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been waiting for you my dear boy.\" If the statement hadn't been bad enough, the look in her eyes and the licking of her lips was certainly enough to make shivers of fear shoot up and down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What is Kushina going to do to Naruto?</b></span></div></div>",

It was here that the seal holding the dreaded Nine-Tailed Fox manifested in a fashion that allowed him to interact with it and in turn, interact with it's prisoner. The few times he had come here he was always left with this feeling of sadness and pain. He chalked it up to the lousy decor and tried to think no further on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally when he spoke to the fox it would follow a similar pattern of insult, insult, death threat, gloating, more insults and death threats before getting kicked out by the stupid fox. That's why when he heard nothing he grew concerned. Not for the fox, no. He'd never do that; at least not while the fuzzy jerk continued to be so hateful to him. Still, silence was an odd greeting to get from the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Naruto slowly moved a bit closer to the giant gate, making sure to keep his eyes open for even the smallest movement in the darkness. How the fox could deal with being surrounded by such pitch blackness he'd never know. Naruto knew that he was taking a risk by moving so close. If he wasn't alert then the Fox just might lash out and manage to skewer him on those massive building sized claws. The furry SOB had certainly threatened to do so enough that Naruto could tell he'd thought on doing it for some time now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to reach the bars without issue, which only made him even more worried then before. The Ky\u016bbi was a fox. There should be no way for him to sneak past the furballs hearing, especially with how big it's ears were. It made him wonder if Ky\u016bbi was somehow out of commission. If so then that left him vulnerable. Without Ky\u016bbi he wouldn't be able to pull out any sudden bursts of overwhelming chakra and power. The lack of fox could even screw with his faster then normal healing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'What if I get attacked by a ninja? What if one of my friends get hurt because I couldn't get any of the Fox's chakra?'</i> He though before an even more terrifying possibility crossed his mind. <i>'What if one of those girls that look at me like a big bowl of ramen manage to catch me?!?'</i> He didn't even want to think of the possible harm that could come to him then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully he didn't need to, as at that very moment a very human arm and hand shot out of the darkness on the other side of the gate and grabbed him. Naruto was suddenly pulled into the darkness faster then his mind could process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding in an ungraceful heap on the water covered ground, Naruto quickly tried to jump up in a defensive stance only to fumble the whole way. He fully expected Ky\u016bbi to take this chance and lash out at him or fill him with an overwhelming amount of its vile chakra so he'd lose control. Naruto did not expect to hear a feminine giggle from behind him and he most certainly did not expect to see the form of _______ with two fox ears on top of her head and nine swaying tails behind her. Both of which were the same color as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but, jaw drop and go wide eyed at the sight before him. The girl giggled into her hand, covering the smile behind it before slowly moving towards him, a small but, noticeable sashay in her walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Who did Ky\u016bbi shape-shift into?</b></span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Here is my second interactive story idea. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been reading a lot of interactive stories with Naruto being an option to follow and most of them involve fetishes that I find entertaining, such as vore, unbirth and such. The only thing is that most of these stories have other anime-verses that they can follow and the Naruto ones get left high and dry after a time. As such I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m dedicating this story purely to Naruto and we can see what sort of situations we can have Naruto in. Please note that this story wont get any bigger without you guys adding to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me give you the details. The nine-tailed fox being an animal goes through times of heat where it would take on a human form and find some lovers to pass the time. However, due to the fox being sealed inside of Naruto the effects of the foxes pheromones are twisted and altered. Now Naruto is forced to run from the very people he called friends while trying to wait out the heat session Kyuubi is having. The effects of the twisted pheromones can be having people affected by it trying to eat and digest him alive or for the girls they may find the pheromones addicting and want to be the only ones able to feel it by trapping Naruto inside of their wombs. Of course some are still going to be affected and simply feel horny so you can have characters trying to jump his bones as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Rules:</b></u><br>\r\n-I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like good grammer and spelling when you write chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try to leave two options after each chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If Naruto gets eaten then he is pretty much a dead man unless someone helps him get free. The story does not need to end if he is digested, just continue from his eaters point of view (POV).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Girls that unbirth Naruto can keep him for as long as they want. If they plan to never let him go then end the story. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sex is allowed and encouraged but, please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to detailed in guyXguy (yoai) chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sex in the younger age option is allowed but, not overly encouraged. Anyone under the age of 13 in those options are a no-go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Characters other then Naruto are allowed to be targeted but, not to many ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(As a personal preference, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to see some chapters with Hinata or Ino either eating, unbirthing or having sex with Naruto, but you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to make it happen.)<br>\r\n</td>",
