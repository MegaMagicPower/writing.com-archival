But what story will be told?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mysidian Revenge</b><br>\r\nThough the elders and most Mysidian have forgiven Cecil his past actions, the sentiment is not shared by all. A small group plots to enact revenge on Cecil for what he did as the leader of the Red Wings with their magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dr Lugae's Experiments</b><br>\r\nDr Lugae has gotten his hands on new subjects and plans to subject them to his strange new experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Changingway</b><br>\r\nNamingway was a Hummingway that could change the names of those who requested his power. With it, he could make it so that it would seem as if they had always had their newly desired name, and there was no limit to how much he could do it. But another Hummingway, known as Changingway, could change more about how a person than merely their name. Though he couldn't alter the physical form of anything, he could alter reality around his target, and none but he and his target would be any the wiser of what he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Troia's Domination</b><br>\r\nTroia is a peacful matriarchal society where women lead, and even fulfill all traditionally male roles. However, there is small, secret extremist group within their society who wishes to spread take Troian society even further and spread their own ways to others, by force. One of their methods is to capture and brainwash people, both women and men, to think and act like Troian women.</span></div></div>",

In the same way, everyone is still alive Shinra\u2019s president, Aerith, even the midgar zolom).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob was one of Shinra\u2019s many employees and unfortunately he was one of Scarlet\u2019s underlings. Most of the guys who worked for her loved their boss and would do anything for her, and that \u201canything\u201d could be fairly degrading. But not him, he hated being hit and treated like shit every day, he didn\u2019t want the position, but all it took was Scarlet saying \u201cyou pig, crawl over here\u201d and he had no choice in the matter.<br>\r\nToday his boss had summoned him to her office at the top of Shinra\u2019s building, the weirdest thing was that she had ordered him to use the elevator, usually he had to take the stairs all the way up there, but not today.<br>\r\nTo say that Bob was nervous was an understatement, whenever he had to deal with his bo\u2026 mistress, he had to call her mistress, better not repeat that mistake. Whenever he had to deal with his mistress he could barely speak and couldn\u2019t stop trembling. Using the elevator only made things worse.<br>\r\nArriving at her office he quickly knocked, the door opened automatically. His mistress was sitting on her desk, wearing her trademark red dress.<br>\r\n-Go.. go\u2026 good mo\u2026 <br>\r\nHe was too nervous to even properly greet his mistress.<br>\r\n-Shut up, pig, or we will be here all morning waiting for your squeals.<br>\r\nScarlet interrupted him, startling Bob.<br>\r\n-Here is your guinea pig, professor- she said to someone, this also surprised Bob, he was too focused in his mistress to realize there was somebody else there.<br>\r\nA white lab coat floated when professor Hojo walked to Bob and examined his face while saying.<br>\r\n-Interesting\u2026 yes\u2026 such unremarkable features\u2026<br>\r\nThe employee was about to faint, he was a guinea pig? Why? What would they do to him? He had heard about Hojo, the mad scientist, and was terrified about his well-being.<br>\r\n-Take this. <br>\r\nThe professor said, in his hands there were a pair of glasses and a materia.<br>\r\nBob didn\u2019t know how to react, his trembling hand approached the materia, he had never used something like that, soldiers did, engineers put them in robots or something, even scientific used them, but this was a first for him. Wait, what could that thing do to him? Would he die? Be turned into a chair for his mistress? Turn into a frog? Whatever the case he couldn\u2019t touch that thing.<br>\r\n-NOW, PIG!<br>\r\nScarlet commanded him.<br>\r\nIn a reflex movement he picked both items, he wasn\u2019t carbonized by the materia, that was a relief.<br>\r\n-You better give me some good data.<br>\r\nProfessor Hojo said before leaving the room.<br>\r\nHe was still dumbfounded, not knowing what to do with those things. Noticing his reluctance, his boss walked to him, moving her hips in her usual sexy demeanor while her heels clicked with each step, not that Bob heard them because his mistress\u2019 words where even worse than his nightmares:<br>\r\n-You are going to take down Avalanche.<br>\r\nHe was about to protest when she kicked him, that hurt a lot, what were those heels made of? Iron?<br>\r\n-The glasses will tell you everything, wear them all the time, and you better use that materia, put it on a ring or a necklace or something like that, I don\u2019t care, but you better take care of it.<br>\r\nBob was about to ask why him, but she kicked him again.<br>\r\n-Crawl your way out, pig.

But what else could he do? If he failed, his mistress wouldn\u2019t just fire him, she would do\u2026 something too horrible to even think about it.<br>\r\nSighing again, he used his trembling hand to put the glasses on his face and realized there was a button on them which he quickly pressed.<br>\r\nSome messages appeared in his vision, the first explained that he should use the button to proceed to the next message. The second informed him that the materia was a experimental one made by Professor Hojo, it was a new mystify materia that could alter a person\u2019s mind, either controlled or in a completely random way, causing them to think and act in a new way, essentially giving them a new personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob was astonished, materias could do that? No, this was an experiment so, why gave it to him? Shouldn\u2019t they test these things in the laboratory or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next message informed him of his mission: he had to find some Avalanche\u2019s members and use the materia on them in a way that would put an end to their operations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a good way to use this materia, but how was he supposed to stop them if he didn\u2019t know where to find them? It was a terrorist group, nobody knew who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next messages gave him information about some members, namely Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Jessie, Biggs and Wedge, explaining that he could find them in the \u201cSeventh heaven\u201d in sector seven\u2019s slums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob was surprised and a bit shocked, if Shinra had so much information on them, why weren\u2019t these people arrested? Hoping that the next message would solve his doubts he pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message explained that the glasses would record data whenever he pressed the button while wearing them, so he should do so before using the materia.<br>\r\nThe last message told him how to put the materia in an object and how to use it, the target should be within 16 ft (or 5 meters) and he had to focus on them. As the materia was still in the experimental phase, the range could vary and the time needed in order to affect the target wasn\u2019t clear. It could only be casted in a single target, but it was hypothesized that its effects would last forever, so it could affect various targets if used in one at a time. Also, it wasn\u2019t mind control, giving orders to a target wouldn\u2019t work, it was necessary to change his mind, for example, commanding some to undress wouldn\u2019t work, instead the target\u2019s mind should be changed making them believe that they always undress in the given situation or that they are always naked and don\u2019t like clothes. Of course a more general change could be applied like making a male adult think like a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last message, the next time he would press the button the recording would start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob couldn\u2019t fully grasp his situation, everything was so strange and most of it didn\u2019t make any sense. He had to use that materia in Avalanche\u2019s members, but just one at a time, everything else wasn\u2019t clear. Using the materia with so few knowledge was a death sentence. That is why he considered testing it before facing his foes, but if he was caught using it where he shouldn\u2019t, his mistress would kill him anyways. What should he do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Too bad for the kid, Bob only had his clothes, including the glasses from Professor Hojo that he was wearing, a wallet with some gils and the necklace with the mystify materia. Wait, what if the little devil stole the necklace? He wore it under his clothes, but he quickly grabbed it just to be sure it was still there, losing it would end his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was going in the same direction, so he walked that way too, not knowing where to find the seventh heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking the streets he realized there were a lot of people living there, probably more than in the upper levels, or at least people liked being in the streets more, not that their houses weren\u2019t nice, just a bit extravagant for his tastes, but big enough for a family of three or four, whenever ten people came out from one of them they were surely a group of friends having fun, there was no way so many people could live in the same house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the crowd grew, his fear increased, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to ask for directions and everyone looked at him as if he was out of place. With in fact he was. Bob was wearing casual clothes for the upper level, but his clean white shirt, his new jeans and his leather shoes weren\u2019t the most typical attire in the slums, it was like shouting that he was some rich guy, at least for slum\u2019s standards, and he was drawing unwanted attention.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSeventh heaven\u201d that name was clearly visible over the door of a big building which looked nicer than any other in the slums, reminding Bob of some classy pubs in the upper level this place was a relief after walking the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation he entered the bar, the interior was as nice as he had imagine, it was a clean place with a high ceiling, relaxing music and he could see a lot of bottles behind the waitress. With a relaxed sigh he sat at a table. Looking around, there were four men in a table, each one of them were checking him out.<br>\r\nRealizing where he was, Bob panicked again, he was here to look for Avalanche\u2019s members, this wasn\u2019t a safe place, it was the most dangerous, what if those guys where terrorists? He would be death. No, he was a normal citizen, they had no reason to suspect him, but they were so menacing, what if they knew he was a\u2026, what was he again? A spy? A guinea pig? He wasn\u2019t sure, but he was their enemy and that was bad for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Hello?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female voice startled him, bringing him back to reality, looking for the source of the voice, Bob was greeted by a big pair of flesh spheres enclosed in a white top, dumbfounded, he stared at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Up. Here<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice sounded colder, looking up, Bob met the beautiful face of a girl with dark long hair, angrily glaring at him with her red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised again, he tried to jump back, but, as he was currently sitting in a chair, he fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Are you okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl asked him with more concern. Caressing his side, Bob stood and sat again while saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yeah. Sorry. I\u2026 You surprised me. I was thinking\u2026 I am new here. Everything looks so\u2026 so\u2026 I\u00b4m sorry. I didn\u2019t want to look at\u2026 at\u2026 them, but I was surprised and\u2026 I mean\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Okay, stop right there and breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl ended his rambling with her reassuring voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob breathed. Air in, air out, in, out. When he had calmed himself he looked at the girl in the eyes, focusing all his will in not looking at her chest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sorry. Thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-It\u2019s nothing. Well, what do you want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob didn\u2019t know what she meant so he asked back:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-This is a bar and I am a waitress. Do you want a drink?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Oh, yeah, that\u2019s right. Whisky. Any kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Coming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl cheerfully answered before walking to the counter. Bob was entranced, not only her chest was superb, she was wearing a short skirt that barely covered her ass and her legs were so long and fit. This was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-We are leaving, Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guys said while all four stood and walked to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa waved her hand from behind the counter with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If you are going to stay, better take care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guys said to Bob before leaving, but he wasn\u2019t paying attention, he remembered reading that beautiful girl\u2019s name before, she was one of the terrorists: Taffy (Bob is bad with names).<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Justdon\u2019tdiedon\u2019tdiedon\u2019tdie\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Here you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa put a glass with whisky and two ice rocks in from of him, accompanied by her best smile. Seeing this Bob thought:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is going to kill me. I am so death. This isn\u2019t poison, right? She knows, right? We are alone, there will be no witnesses\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A sudden clap interrupted his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Again. Stop and breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir in. Air out. Air in. Air out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa sat in from of him crossing her legs, with her arms on the table just under her massive chest. No, Bob, don\u2019t look at her breasts, make eye contact. Breathing slower than before, he looked at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sorry. Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sure, anytime you need someone telling you to breathe, I am your girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, he drank his whisky, it wasn\u2019t poison but it wasn\u2019t the best, just a cheap brand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I know it could be hard at first, but the slums aren\u2019t so bad, so hang in there okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa said with a reassuring tone, while squeezing his hand, Bob didn\u2019t understand, what was she talking about? Unknown to him, she thought he was a guy who used to live in the upper levels, but had just lost everything and had to live in the slums from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-People here help each other. Marlo has been a big help for me, she is so sweet. Marlo is my landlord. Do you have a place to stay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer speech wasn\u2019t making any sense so he answered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Then you should ask her, just turn right when you exit the bar and go all the way down the street. Ask her, she is nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob didn\u2019t understand the situation, but his brain had already fried when the beautiful terrorist held his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-We should do something about your clothes, someone might assault you just for the way you look. Hold it, I have an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa said before going back to the counter. Without any other thing to do, Bob ended his drink. Maybe this Taffy girl wasn\u2019t so bad. Then he remembered his mission. He didn\u2019t want to stay there more than necessary. He should use the materia and make Taffy help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress came back with a bottle in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Ready?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d thought Bob just before she spilled the bottle\u2019s content over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Dirty clothes, now nobody would think you are new here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winked at him and then finished saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don\u2019t worry, this is on the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob had had enough, this was literally the last drop. He was using the materia on her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDrench your shirt in booze\u201d he commanded using his materia, but nothing happened. She just sat in front of him smiling and talking, not that he was paying attention. Then Bob remembered the instructions, this wasn\u2019t a mind control materia, he couldn\u2019t give her orders, he should change her train of thought. Thinking about it, Bob finally thought:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhenever you drench a customer in booze, you will do the same to yourself, it is your way of showing empathy by sharing the pain. Oh, and if you did it purposely, you will give your bra to that customer, is your way of apologizing. And you never cover your chest with your hands, never had done and never will do\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa stopped speaking and her eyes lost focus for a brief moment, then she stood, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I am sorry, I wanted to help, but still, I did something awful to you. Just wait a minute, I will make up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was embarrassed and quickly hid behind the counter, after some minutes she reappeared and picked a bottle. Then she came back to him with the bottle in her right hand and something black in her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I know this isn\u2019t enough, but please, accept this as an apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said giving him the black cloth, which was in fact her bra. Bob was starting to believe that the materia had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-And I will show you that you are not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued while spilling all the liquid from the bottle over her chest. Bob could see her big breast trough the wet white shirt, and they were magnificent. Timidly and staring at the floor, the waitress said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Please accept my apology. And please don\u2019t look at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn\u2019t try to cover her chest and Bob wouldn\u2019t look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn\u2019t believe it, the materia had worked. This dangerous but beautiful and well endowed girl was doing something so embarrassing in front of him. And in his hand was that big black bra, what was he supposed to do with it? He didn\u2019t care. This was the most exciting moment in his life. Power drunk, he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like wearing panties or thongs or those kinds of clothes in the bar, you had always felt that they hindered you and could bother the customers. If by any chance you forgive removing them before opening time, you will ask the nearest person to hold them for you until close time\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Tifa lost focus for a moment and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Oh my goodness, this can\u2019t be happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exclaimed quickly touching her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Noooo, this is the worst day ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly kneeled, making her breasts jiggle, put her hands under her skirt and took off her black panties. Standing again, while her chest freely moved up and down, she looked at him with puppy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Please, could you take care of these until close time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said while putting her panties in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob exclaimed excited, looking at her eyes for the first time in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugged him, making him feel her wet breast with his face, not that he complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You know? You are helping me a lot and you accepted my apology too, so today I will let you have whatever you want, on the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe offered smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob could barely avoid laughing, the girl with the wet shirt who had given him her underwear was trying to make up to him. This was perfect. He could take anything for free. As he wasn\u2019t interested in her drinks, he would use the materia to make her stay true to her word and give him others things for free.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact, this place is safer thanks to him, the neighborhood patrol is very grateful\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t talking about Avalanche at all, she was talking about some random guy. Maybe the materia was a failure? But what would happen to him if he failed? His mistress would kill him. Wait. The instructions said something about not giving orders, but changing their mind\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it Bob changed his approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a Shinra\u2019s agent infiltrated in Avalanche, that\u2019s the only reason you joined them. This bar is a way to share your information with other Shinra\u2019s agents disguised as customers. I am your new contact\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa stopped talking, for a brief moment her eyes lost focus and then it came back, her cheerful expression switched to a serious one before talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If you are going to disguise, do it properly, we can\u2019t risk my cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer demeanor had changed so drastically that Bob was sure the materia had worked, but just to be sure he asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What disguise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-People here don\u2019t wear clothes as good as yours, you should remember that next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Bob understood why she covered him in booze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Okay, I will remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at him, just like she was doing mere minutes ago, it looked like her personality hadn\u2019t changed. Getting closer to him, Tifa lowered her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Now hear me out, this is important, Avalanche\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened and a blonde muscular guy entered the bar. Immediately Tifa ran to him while cheerfully saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Cloud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t pay any more attention to Bob, the waitress just had eyes for that guy, she was all smiles, like a teenager girl trying to make the cool guy in class notice her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob was pissed, he had finally achieved something, he was about to complete his mission and go back home, take a shower and never come back to the slums, but this random guy had ruined everything.

And now the most beautiful girl in the world, his only ray of hope in this hellish mission was too busy paying attention to this guy. Terrorist or not Bob wouldn\u2019t accept it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe he was a bit drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would use the materia on Cludo, just as he had done on Taffy, but there was a difference; he hated him. A strong guy could protect him from danger, but that would make him look cooler and that could not be allowed. No. His change needed to be something embarrassing, something that would make Taffy and all the Taffys in the world hate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a sissy, you may look strong, but you know you have always wanted to be protected and treated like a princess, all that training and cool attitude was just a facade. Whenever you are alone, you wear female clothes, even from time to time you dress up and go to sector 6 to hit on boys. You love dicks, the bigger the better, you would be a true girl if a cock penetrated you, the only dick you hate is yours, you feel disgusted by it, but you would show it to a cute boy if he asked. Today you have decided to embrace that life, you will not suppress your true feelings anymore\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud lost focus for a moment. Paying close attention to him, Tifa asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Cloud, you okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head Cloud answered, showing a shining smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yes. Yes, I am. In fact, I have never been better. I have made up my mind. Tifa, I want to dress as a girl and be treated like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob anticipated Taffy to be disgusted, maybe even shout at him. But that wasn\u2019t what happened. Tifa cheerfully laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Like that time with Corneo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yes, something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what? This guy liked wearing girl\u2019s clothes? And Taffy knew? How? Why? Bob blanked some minutes. With a cold anger and most determination than ever in his life, he decided to do something. His plan failed because he didn\u2019t know that guy, so he would ask first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Excuse my intrusion, could I have another one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob said carrying his glass to the counter. Tifa blushed a bit before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Of course, coming up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was looking for the bottle, Bob sat in the counter and talked to Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You and Tifa look close. I suppose you come here a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You noticed? Yes, we are besties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cool attitude had disappeared, now he talked like a cheerful girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-We have been together since forever, you should have seen little Tifa and her cute dresses. She is a bit of a tomboy, but she can be so girlish, you know? I mean, look at her now, a sexy woman with a figure to die for and a perfect sense of style: sporty but feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You sure you are okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa asked serving the drink while looking at his friends face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Totally alright, bestie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob noticed that Taffy was suspicious of Cludo\u2019s new attitude, but she still liked him.

Yes, I will need a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he stood and shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I know the perfect name: Claudia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Your mother\u2019s name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yup, it\u2019s my beautiful mommy\u2019s name. I love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sounds good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob said smiling, while he was laughing in the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Thanks, sweetie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudia winked at him striking a pose with her left hand in her hip and her right hand doing a victory symbol in front of her open eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Now I have to buy some pretty clothes for my first day at work. Time for a shopping spree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudia pointed at the door and quickly left. Bob realized she still had that big sword in her back and she was running carrying it like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I can\u2019t stand that guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa said looking at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-But I am a softie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You are a good person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob said without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Thanks.

He now had the confidence to deal with anyone that pissed him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Well, I should close the bar if Cloud is coming tomorrow. Maybe I will run some errands. And I was the one who introduced him as a mercenary, if he suddenly stops working I would need to apologize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Her. Remember she is a girl now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob corrected Tifa, he had to make sure that she didn\u2019t see Cloud as a man anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yes, you are right. But I will need some time to get use to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tifa regained her energy and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If you don\u2019t have a place to stay, I can take you to Marlo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob didn\u2019t want to leave. He could change anyone. He could even make that beautiful girl fall in love with him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You believe I am the man of your life\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the changes that Bob did to Tifa, but her previous change was deeper than Bob thought, her memories had changed so that her new personality would make sense. This is Tifa\u2019s story as she believed it was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa was an outgoing child, friendly with everyone and had lots of friends, probably she was the most popular girl in Nibelheim, but there was a guy who was always after her: his neighbor Cloud. At first she welcomed him to her group, despite being older, Cloud treated Tifa as his superior, he was always following her orders and complimenting her. But that wasn\u2019t good for Tifa, his constant worship made her believe she was better than others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one day Cloud joined then wearing one of his mother\u2019s dresses while saying \u201clook Tifa, I am like you\u201d. This was the most embarrassing moment in her life, that was when she started calling him \u201csissy\u201d, but Cloud kept joining her, and that caused troubles. The girls who were tired of Tifa\u2019s popularity and superiority complex made everyone believe Cloud and her were dating and that she made him wear those clothes, her social life crumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day one of the guys took everyone to Mt. Nibel in an adventure, Tifa decided that was the moment to recover her leadership, after all, Cloud was too afraid to join them. But an accident occurred and her friends left her behind. Alone and afraid she cursed her false friends. Surprisingly, Cloud appeared and rescued her, but Tifa hated him for that, it only made everyone believe they were in fact dating. She hated them all, her former friends who abandoned her and made fun of her and the sissy who turned her into a laughing stock. She didn\u2019t need anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hated the kids her age, she started hanging out with tourist\u2019s children. At the beginning it was hard, she thought everyone was against her, lacking her former cheerfulness it was hard making new friends, but bit by bit she learned to put a fake smile and with time she looked as cheerful and friendly as she did when she was younger. She even took the effort of greeting and smiling at her former friends, but she didn\u2019t let them be anything else. Except Cloud, she couldn\u2019t shake him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking friends with tourists meant that their friendship was short, and Tifa liked it that way, she would put her fake smile and enjoy some company for a change, but they didn\u2019t have time to betray her. Then she met a handsome guy two years older than her, he was her first love and she received her first kiss. After that, she would rather befriend boys than girls, making out with them made her felt full and that she wasn\u2019t alone, besides, their kisses last even when they left. She obsessed with getting boys, she knew she was the most beautiful girl in town, but now she put even more effort in her appearance, learning to move seductively and practicing flirting techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the way she was heading it was only a matter of time until she lost her virginity to some random guy she had just met. At first she was afraid, but then she felt the fullest in her life, the void disappeared when that guy penetrated her. It was a shame she didn\u2019t know the boys\u2019 name, she had met so many people that she didn\u2019t care about their names anymore. After the first one, lots more came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a reputation and could tell that her former friends knew, the girls would call her bitch, slut or whore even in front of her, but she answered with her perfect fake smile before fucking their boyfriends as revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa had been working for years. At first she worked at the hotel, since the owner had seen her a lot in his place chatting with his customers. Tifa was great at her job, everybody loved the cheerful girl who took care of the customers as a true professional. When there weren\u2019t so many tourists she worked at a bar where she learned everything about waitressing tables. When she was 15 she worked part time as a tourist guide, she loved the job, she could met new people and had an excuse to take them to private places where she could felt full again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day some SOLDIERS came, a white haired guy and a dreamy black haired one, Tifa immediately decided to take the latter to her secret spot. She remembered Cloud, who had left years ago to be a SOLDIER to show her he was a true man, she didn\u2019t care, he was more an insufferable pet than a friend.<br>\r\nAfter that, Sephirot destroyed the city and the wanderer Zagan found her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZagan taught her how to fight. The exercise helped her remain fit and could help her overcome some obstacles. Nibelheim\u2019s destruction hadn\u2019t affected her, she was already alone, only the landscape changed. After some time with Zagan she was grateful with his teachings and tried to thanks him the only way she knew. When her teacher saw her naked trying to undress him, he broke their relationship saying that she tainted the martial arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone and betrayed again, Tifa traveled from town to town paying the trips and the food with her body, until arriving at sector seven\u2019s slums, where she decided to stay. She needed a work, she had a place to call home thanks to some random old lady, but she had to pay her expenses and food. At first she tough whoring herself out, but this was different than before, she would fuck her neighbors, not some random guys she would never meet again. Then she considered fighting monster with her martial arts, but that could let a scar in her beautiful body and she couldn\u2019t allow that. For the first time in her life she was lucky and could get a bar almost for free thanks to her sexual skills, she then used her body to get better drinks and food that any other local in the slums, turning the seventh heaven into a successful business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her free days she would go to the upper levels and let rich boys buy her drinks and clothes, some of them were her playthings for months, that was how she got her other job: Shinra\u2019s spy. Despite all her partners, she hadn\u2019t loved anyone since Zagan until today, when the nervous boy caught her attention at first sight. In her excitement she even soaked him, it was great, she could clearly see his body through his wet shirt. Then, when the sissy left, he said she was a good person, she almost laughed at him, but she had to pretend she was a caring girl, and she was a master at pretending, so she said something to make her look good. Now that they were alone she was ready to trap him and don\u2019t let him go.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tifa walked to Bob\u2019s side, seductively swaying her hips and making her boobs go up and down, she did it as if it was a natural way to walk. Then she put her hand on his wet chest and bent enough to look at him from under his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I still haven\u2019t apologized, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put an innocent expression and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I am sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she caressed his chest, while forming tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-But these are the slums and I don\u2019t want you to get any harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked away, moving her head to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course her every move was studied, looking sexy, then acting like an innocent girl that should be protected, then helping him and being embarrassed. It was all a trap for her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the weak point of her technique was that the man should be proactive from this point onwards and Bob didn\u2019t used to be that kind of man. But that could only apply until yesterday, Bob was a new man with all the power in the world, in fact he knew she loved him, that\u2019s why he was full of confidence. He took her by her chin and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I won\u2019t let you cry for something so trivial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him with adoration and he kissed her. They were more or less the same height, but Tifa was bending so he could be taller than her, which was part of her strategy, being taller than the girl makes boys think they should protect her and makes them feel manlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter parting their lips, Tifa moved away, feigning embarrassment, while shyly saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I am sorry. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his confidence, Bob wasn\u2019t used to these situations, he just stood there dumbfounded, so Tifa took the initiative again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I have an idea. I could dry your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proposed looking at him with a shy smile. Not knowing what to do, Bob answered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I\u2019m okay, don\u2019t worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed his hand and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don\u2019t say that, it was my fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed her boobs against his arm before adding in a seductive voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Let\u2019s go to my place, I will take care of your shirt there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob blushed but nodded, not being able of saying anything. Tifa smiled at him and guided him to the exit. Turning off the lights, she closed the door and told him to follow her. She liked going in the front, that way the guy could appreciate her ass and she was swaying it in order to keep his full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at her place, she softly but firmly pushed him inside. Closing the door she started unbuttoning his shirt, at first he tried to complain, but she didn\u2019t stop. With every button she came closer to him, pressing her boobs against his chest until their faces were touching, then she removed his shirt and pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I will let it here, in the morning it should be dry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said hanging the shirt in a hanger. Then she looked at him moving from side to side, this not only put attention on her boobs, it also made her look shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You know? I am not used to having boys in my room, less if I don\u2019t know their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a lie, she had taken some boys there, she wasn\u2019t as active as she used to be before coming to Midgar, but she was far from shy, of course most of those guys were unnamed strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob realized he had never told her his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-My name is Bob, nice to meet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed delighted and answered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Well, hello Bob, my name is\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe interrupted her and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I heard it before, your name is Taffy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In fact\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips touched his ear and she whispered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-It is a sweet pet name, I like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she put both her hands in his cheeks and kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time they didn\u2019t stop, they kissed and kissed and kissed again. She unbuckled her suspenders and took off her shirt revealing her black bra. Bob awkwardly caressed her breast and when she realized he wasn\u2019t going to unfasten her bra, she did herself. Bob was amazed, her breasts were so big and round and soft and the first breasts he could touch, he caressed then gently and slowly, but Tifa took his hands and made him grope her with all his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed him on her bed and then kneeled, she expertly unbuckled his belt and put his jeans and briefs down, revealing his cock. He was ashamed, this was the first time a girl saw his penis and he was already erect, but she smiled at him, she looked so pretty from up there, and she caressed his member with her soft and warm hand, slowly, gently. And then she put it in her mouth, Bob couldn\u2019t stand the pleasure of her wet mouth and her playful tongue, he tried but couldn\u2019t resist and come in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was afraid she would be mad, but Tifa just released the cock and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gulp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard her swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa used the break to remove her boots and socks. Realizing he should do the same, Bob removed his shoes and socks and took off his jeans and briefs, he was naked except for his glasses, he didn\u2019t remember he was wearing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa stood in from of him just in her black panties and then she started swaying her hips and her chest, slowly turning around, letting him see her ass. Her hips swaying, her breasts bouncing, Bob was already erect again. Tifa chuckled seeing him and then grabbed her panties while swaying her whole body from down her hips all the way up to her shoulders, she repeated it and suddenly the panties where in her hand. Bob didn\u2019t see how she did it, but he didn\u2019t care, he was seeing his first pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwaying her hips, Tifa walked to him and sat on his lap, rubbing her pussy against his dick, she was proud that after all these years her pussy was still as thigh as when she was a virgin (in fact, she still was, but she believed otherwise). Again, Bob couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, he warned Tifa, but she continued as if nothing was happening, his sperm covered her belly and  under her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I\u2019m sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe apologized, but she put her index finger in front of her lips telling him to don\u2019t say anything, she then picked some sperm with her hand and took it to her mouth, she licked her hand clean, smiled at him and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her hand on his chest, she gently pushed him on the bed, then she bend over him and put a condom on his penis, Bob didn\u2019t even know where that condom had came front. Tifa rubbed her boobs on his chest, up and down, up and down, up and kissed him. With a mischievous smile she put his cock in her pussy and slowly swayed her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm walls around his dick were making Bob go crazy, this was even better than the blowjob, it was so thigh and warm and wet, Tifa was increasing the rhythm and his dick was going crazy, he couldn\u2019t even pay attention to the big breasts jiggling in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Tifa was surprised, she was sure she was used to sex, but she was enjoying it like her first time, and like her first time it hurt. She didn\u2019t know why but it hurt. Bob\u2019s member wasn\u2019t the biggest she had had, but it hurt as the first time. Her facade couldn\u2019t hang anymore and she cried while moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa kept getting at it, swaying her hips like an expert, moaning loudly, not facing Bob so he couldn\u2019t see her crying, but she didn\u2019t need to hide her face, her partner couldn\u2019t see anything, he was too focused in his own pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs used as Tifa was to sex, she was feeling it coming, it had been years since a man had made her come so quickly, with a loud moan she let it all out of her body while Bob was filling the condom with his own juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing, Tifa felt relieved, that had been intense. Wiping her tears before Bob noticed, she lay at his side and asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Well?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-That was the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe answered panting, but Tifa also though \u201cindeed it was the best for me too\u201d, which made her realize she wanted to keep this man for herself as long as she could, not only a couple of months or until he had wasted lots of gils in her. No, this guy made her felt full again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her first thought was waking him up with a blowjob, men loved that, but she decided not to, this would be a serious relationship and he shouldn\u2019t know what she had done with other men, so giving him a blowjob was out of the question\u2026 probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for some clothes, Tifa wondered where most of her clothes had gone, she was sure most of her sugar daddys had bought her clothes, but now her wardrobe was almost empty. She didn\u2019t care, there was always someone who will bought anything to make her happy\u2026 or not. Again she had to remember she was in a serious relationship. Or she hoped she was. Yesterday was a day of fuck more than talk, maybe she should ask Bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed in her usual outfit, this time wearing a black sport bra and black shorts under her skirt, she decided to let things go their own way, after all she wasn\u2019t used to deal with serious stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she was being too noisy, but Bob awakened when she was adjusting her suspenders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Good morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe greeted with a smile, while Bob could barely wave his hand while yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Now we have work to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said playfully sitting on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob was freaking out, after a night of sleep he had recovered his old demeanor and couldn\u2019t believe what he had done. The shock was so intense that he couldn\u2019t breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Welcome back, that\u2019s the anxious guy I love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa greeted with a cheerful tone, but then realized what she had just said and continued speaking hoping Bob hadn\u2019t realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Breathe in, breathe out, in, out. You remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Bob calmed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No problem, I am becoming an expert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, she smiled, everything was going well, until Tifa spoke again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-As I said, we have work to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Oh yeah, Claudia starts today, right? I can\u2019t wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa felt a bit of jealousy, he remembered that sissy\u2019s name but not hers. She shrugged it off, there were more pressing matters at hand, but she would remember it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-She can wait, I have to tell you about Avalanche, remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvalanche? Avalanche? Avalanche! Bob remembered his mission and the glasses, he hadn\u2019t recorded anything! He was so dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa explained about the terrorists, all the members she knew about, their moves and their bases. Her bar was an Avalanche meeting point and some of them visited it on a regular basis. Bob\u2019s knees were shaking, he had been so close to terrorists without knowing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If Cloudia is coming, I have to open the bar early. So, see you in a bit, you can stay here as long as you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa said after her explanation, purposely misspelling Claudia\u2019s name, she kissed Bob in the forehead and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob realized again Taffy was a terrorist, he had slept with a terrorist! He smirked. He had slept with a beautiful woman, he wasn\u2019t a virgin anymore. He could do anything\u2026 but maybe a terrorist group was too much for him. No, he could do it. Taffy and Claudia were harmless now. Two terrorists down, just some hundreds more to go.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was wearing black stilettos, displaying her toes nails, which were painted in the same blue as her eyes, just like her hand\u2019s. Over her hips she was wearing a dark blue navy skirt, which was of the same color as the strings of her blue thong, which were let visible on purpose. In the upper body she was wearing a light blue blouse unbuttoned to show a bit of cleavage and tied over her muscular navel, her breast looked like the real deal, not as big as Tifa\u2019s but not too small. Her outfit was completed by a black necklace with a heart with the word \u201cClaudia\u201d on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Claudia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob asked after reading the heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yes, that\u2019s me, sweetie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe answered striking her usual pose with her left hand on her hip, winking and doing the victory symbol with her right hand in front of her open eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You are... I wasn\u2019t expecting this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proudly inflated her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tifa appeared and grabbed Bob\u2019s arm, making sure to squeeze it between her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I will take care of this one, Cloudia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said without losing her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Okay, boss bestie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new waitress answered, before going to entertain some other customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I think she is doing okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob said to Tifa, he had been regretting Claudia\u2019s changes, Taffy was her usual self, just that instead of being a terrorist she was fighting the bad guys, her life had improved thanks to him (Bob had conveniently forgotten that he had also made her in love with him, neither he knew the extend of Tifa\u2019s inner changes). But Cludo was completely different: his changes came of Bob\u2019s anger. However, Claudia was happy, yesterday he was all gloomy, but today she was shining. Besides, being a waitress was better than being a terrorist. Bob decided this change had also been for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-She is the boys talk. They love her. I can\u2019t wait to see more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-More?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob asked without understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa realized her mistake, nobody should know that she had only hired the sissy to make fun of him. And definitely she couldn\u2019t let Bob know that she was such a bitch in the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I can\u2019t wait to see her dreams coming true and everybody accepting her new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that was a good one, Tifa thought to herself. But she couldn\u2019t hide her smile when a certain girl with a red headband and a ponytail entered her bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Tifa, I heard you hired a new waitress. I have come to check the goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie said mischievously smiling at Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Welcome, I am that new waitress, my name is Claudia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl run to Jessie, did a spin over one of her heels and stroked her pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Check me all you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa could barely hold her laughter, in fact her lower lip was trembling and her mouth formed a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Jessie looked at Claudia with her mouth wide open and her eyes about to left her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Cloud?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked and them fell to the ground and laughed hitting the floor with her fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being able to hold it anymore, Tifa also laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud was looking at Jessie with a concerned expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customers didn\u2019t know what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Bob was trying to remember if he knew the brown haired girl from somewhere\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He remembered she had told them she wanted to be an actress. The old Bob didn\u2019t have a chance with her, but the new Bob\u2026 already had Taffy. Yes, Taffy loved him, or at least let him play with her breasts, no woman had ever do that. So until Taffy grew tired of him, he would be loyal to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie stood grabbing her sides, still laughing, and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You do know how to get a girl\u2019s attention. I want a beer, blue eyes, and make it quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said slapping Claudia in the ass, then she walked to the counter and sat besides Bob, not for him, but so she could talk with Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What happened to him? I mean, I like some role playing, but this could be a little bit too far even for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-She decided she wanted to be a girl, so here you have her, the new Cloudia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie looked suspicious at Claudia when she got her drink, the waitress stood there, shyly looking at the brown haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Is that so?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie mumbled to herself before looking at Claudia and adding:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I love your new style, you sure rock that skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudia\u2019s face lighted up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Really? Thanks, Jess Jess, you are the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mischievous smile, Jessie added:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Besides, now I can take you to the girl\u2019s dorm. We could have a girl\u2019s night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I would love to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudia happily agreed before she left to take care of some costumers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Nothing faze you, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You can\u2019t blame me for liking strong guys with beautiful blue eyes. Besides, maybe I have just discovered that I like my guys wearing skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls giggled with her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sorry to intrude, I\u2019m Jessie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said looking at Bob while extending her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I am Bob and I have to say you are too far from Gold Saucer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said while shaking her hand, but Jessie\u2019s face froze for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-How do you know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Oh? We met there some time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie sighed relieved, but Tifa was rediscovering the meaning of jealousy, not only Bob remembered the sissy\u2019s name and not hers, he also remembered this little minx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sorry, I don\u2019t remember you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown haired girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don\u2019t worry, it was long ago. I got to say I wasn\u2019t expecting meeting an actress here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-No, I\u2026 I had an accident and quit acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-That sounds rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob could understand, working so hard to get nothing would be devastating, so he wouldn\u2019t bring the subject back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don\u2019t worry, she is a strong girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa pointed out with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Thanks, Tifa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Besides, you had met Cloud here, that\u2019s a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa remarked her words, making sure Bob would understand that Jessie already had someone in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You are right. Then, if you don\u2019t mind, I will take this opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said while running to Claudia and hugging her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa understood Jessie\u2019s words, somehow the minx was thinking that she liked the sissy. It was like Nibelheim again. But she had to take care of something else. Looking at the brown haired she whispered to Bob:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Avalanche.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe every nice girl was a terrorist in disguise. What could he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, the girl was an actress some years ago, how had she changed so much? Then the answered came: the accident, whatever it was. That turned the innocent actress into an enemy of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob decided to use his materia, but how? He wanted to remove that accident, that way the girl would be happier. But if she believed she was still an actress, she would go back to Gold Saucer where she didn\u2019t have anything and he couldn\u2019t go there and convince everyone she had been on stage for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-They make a good couple, don\u2019t you think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa said breaking his thought process while looking at Claudia and Jessie, who where happily chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yes. Yes they do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa smiled, if Bob believed the minx and the sissy were perfect for each other her two opponents would disappear with one strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob realized that if both girls were in love that would make the brown haired woman happy, maybe even more than acting. He had decided her changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat accident didn\u2019t happen. You stayed in Gold Saucer for years until you moved to sector seven\u2019s slums where you met Claudia. You have loved her since you first met\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie\u2019s effects were a bit different than the previous ones, after all the materia was still in its experimental phase: she felt a sudden headache and run outside to get some air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a concern expression, Claudia looked at the exit. Bob remembered he had made Claudia love boys, so he took the chance to make some corrections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou love than brown haired girl, you have liked her for some time but after the way she had treated you since you became Claudia, you are in love with her\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudia lost focus, but no one realized as she was facing the door. Then Jessie entered the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to repeat his mistake, Bob pushed the button on his glasses to record the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Bob\u2019s good intentions, Jessie was still a member of Avalanche and her life was worst than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie wasn\u2019t informed of her father\u2019s accident so she performed in Gold Saucer\u2019s stage\u2026 and was awful, the scenic panic got the best of her and she forgot half her lines, she didn\u2019t move as she wanted and fell over other two actresses injuring them. Her dream was destroyed by her own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie couldn\u2019t come back to Midgar as a failure, so she kept telling her mom she was an actress. At the beginning she was afraid their parents would come to watch her play, but they never did. What kind of parents would never see their daughter\u2019s performance? Anyway, it worked in her favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her failure she wasn\u2019t allowed on stage again, instead she moved to backstage, where she learned about different things that she would use in the future, like explosives, mostly used to make sound or brilliant lights on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with the years her mood changed, she turned gloomy and distant. She couldn\u2019t cheer up when she had to see and help people living her dream every day. She hated it. She hated them. She would never hang out with them, she would rather be alone in her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some years, she finally decided visiting her home, preparing her best smile she entered ready to surprise their parents and maybe regain some of her lost light. But she was the one surprised. Her father was very ill and her mother hadn\u2019t told her to not make her worry. Jessie was devastated and angered and the only suitable target for her anger was Shinra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, her life was more or less the same she had without the changes: she joined Avalanche, used her knowledge to help them and lived in sector seven\u2019s slums. The main difference was that she was gloomier and easily angered. Then she met Cloud in one of the operations, he was handsome and somehow she cheered a bit when he was near, she even tried to goof around as she used to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie entered the bar, she barely smiled unless Cloud was around and now she had to deal with all this Claudia stuff, how could she do it? When she opened the door, the blonde waitress was there, ready to greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Welcome back, honey. Would you like dinner? A bath? Or perhaps\u2026 me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaudia said striking her pose. Tifa fell to the ground laughing, fortunately no one was paying attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse was taken aback by Claudia\u2019s greeting, but then she realized what she wanted. With a smile she answered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd kissed her on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Bob hadn\u2019t recorded anything of this, nor was he paying attention to Tifa grabbing her sides. All his attention was focused on the message that popped after pressing the button on his glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCOME TO MY OFFICE NOW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew whose office it was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He saw Claudia and Jessie smiling at each other, which made him thought he had done something good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped by his house, where he took a quick shower and put clean clothes on, before going to Shinra\u2019s offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the circular building he realized something: he had changed a lot. Just yesterday crossing this door made him nervous, but today he was confident. He wasn\u2019t a virgin, he had power and would use it for good purposes. He was making people\u2019s lives better while stopping Avalnche\u2019s bad deeds. Well, maybe he was a bit nervous, just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his legs almost shaking, he arrived at his mistress\u2019 office. He breathed and knocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Enter at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas the angry answer he received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet was sitting on a soldier while reviewing some papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-At least you can do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood and kicked the soldier on the butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Out. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man crawled his way out of the room. Then Scarlet sent a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Professor Hojo will be here shortly. But before he arrives...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to him, her heels clicking on the floor and her ass swaying as always. Without warning she kicked him in the leg. With a cry, Bob felt to the floor. Yes those heels were definitely made of iron. She kicked him again and again in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-How can you be so useless, you piece of shit? You couldn\u2019t even do a simple job, just press a button and use a materia. You are more retarded than a monkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kicked him again and then put her foot in from of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You are dirtying my shoe. Clean it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he refused she would kick him again, this time in his face. There was only one way to escape: use the materia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have always been kind to me, because, because\u2026 you are my secretary\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what had he just thought? He didn\u2019t want her to boss him around anymore, but the first part would have been enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet step back touching her head, then she looked at Bob and quickly kneeled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I am so sorry, Bobo. I didn\u2019t realize it was you. Could you forgive me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said while helping him stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Yeah. Don\u2019t worry, mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said while coughing. He was about to revert the last change, but he was afraid of losing this nice mistress.<br>\r\nScarlet giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You now you can call me Scarlet or Elsa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob looked at her without understanding, calling her by her name was a thing, but Elsa?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-That\u2019s what you called me the first time. *Giggle* You are so bad with names, Bobo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Oh, right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob remembered something like that did indeed happen, but it wasn\u2019t a happy memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Bobo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Boss Bob, don\u2019t you remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, that was definitely the second part of her changes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Scarlet hit the floor with her heel and demanded an explanation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What are you looking at, old man?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Fascinating, she looks the same and can behave as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed at Bob and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You, guinea pig, what have you changed? Probably your monkey brain couldn\u2019t make such big changes, only something like \u201cbe nice to me\u201d. Yes, you aren\u2019t capable of more. She also called you \u201cboss\u201d, so she believes she works under you, maybe she believes she is you secretary or something absurd like that. Yes. By your face I can tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHojo thought aloud. Bob was amazed, he was right in everything, that man was a genius. But the man in the white lab coat hadn\u2019t ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You, guinea pig, have you changed all her personality or just some random parts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet walked between the men and faced Hojo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Treat him with respect or you will face my whip. But knowing you, it will be more a reward than a punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said with a cold glare. But Bob was intrigued, that man knew more than him about the materia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I just made her be nice to me and believe she is my secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Fascinating. According to my theory, it would be needed a lot of background to change a person\u2019s personality, telling exactly what had changed and how it did. Moreover, to avoid inconsistencies with the current world, those changes couldn\u2019t be too big. For instance, if you are a secretary what are you doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet controlled herself in order to avoid hitting the man, she hated him, but he was an important asset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-This is my office, scum. I am the head of the Weapon\u2019s development division.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Fascinating. What a weird situation. If you are so important, why are you his secretary?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHojo pointed at Bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You don\u2019t need to know unless you don\u2019t want to keep playing with your toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe menaced, but he didn\u2019t step back and Bob was also curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Please, Miss\u2026 Scarlet. Tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at him with an innocent face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You know you don\u2019t need to be so formal, Bobo, just call me Scarlet, without the \u201cMiss\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I will, but please, tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If you say so, Bobo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Hojo with contempt and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Officially I work as the head of the weapon\u2019s development division, being a secretary is something I do in my free time. I asked Bobo to be his secretary so I could help him and we could spend more time together. He is not officially my boss, but for me he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Fascinating. What an unbelievable and improbable development. The only logical explanation is that her brain had adopted itself to her new personality, corrupting her past while changing as little of the present as possible. Why do you want to spend time with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Bob made Scarlet answer. She buffed and angrily hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If you tell someone, there would be no hole where a rat like you could hide. Men are scum, just tools to be used. But some of those tools tried to rebel. They tied me, stripped me, slapped me and were about to rape me. Then Bobo saved me. I am grateful to him, he is the only man more evolved than an animal.<br>\r\nTears of frustration ran through her face, but still she would do what she was asked, even if she didn\u2019t like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Fascinating. So many things had changed in unexpected ways. The brain is truly magnificent. The way events unfold completely changing her past but as little of the present as possible is fascinating. This pose a new hypothesis: the less changes the better results. Complex scenarios could have unexpected ramifications where only some general changed are needed. Why bother creating years and years of memories when a simple \u201cthat didn\u2019t happen\u201d is more efficient? On the other hand, this monkey didn\u2019t want to put Scarlet in a dire situation like what she described, this development could also generate unexpected responses. A cheerful person could become depressive and vice versa. A person who never left town could believe they had traveled around the world but had to come back thanks to some convenient excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor continued his monologue to which Bob paid close attention. If those conclusions were on point, maybe he had made something horrible to Taffy and the girls, but looking back, all of them looked happy and Taffy hadn\u2019t change, just left Avalanche. Then a question popped in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Scarlet, why did I get the materia? There should have been better options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You were the only one compatible with it. It is so unstable that in Shinra only you could use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You fool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHojo shouted at her, but it was too late, Bob already knew how special he was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A cold resolution filled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If you want data, you would be interested in the random function, right professor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHojo tried to flee but it was too late, he stood there with a void gaze for some minutes. Taking this opportunity, Bob added a quick change to Scarlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have never heard of the mystify materia\u201d. If he understood what Hojo said right, this would be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet blinked a couple of times. Touching her face she asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Is there something on my eye? Why am I crying? This will ruin my makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t remember the recent conversation about the materia, so she didn\u2019t feel humiliated and didn\u2019t cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHojo returned, he straightened up his posture and bow to both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If you will excuse me, I have some errands to attend. That beautiful receptionist won\u2019t stay single for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis movements were slow, refined and elegant. He gallantly walked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob feel a bit sorry for changing him, but he could always check later if his life was better. Dating a girl would be a good change for the old Professor. This reminded him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have dismissed the mystify materia project, the only compatible user didn\u2019t even receive the materia. You have wanted to erase all its data for some time now and would do it as soon as you can\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHojo didn\u2019t even stop and walked outside the room. Then Bob and Scarlet heard him shouting:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Why am I not wearing my red clothes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, that certainly looked random to Bob. He then smashed the glasses into the ground and step on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What are you doing, Bobo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don\u2019t worry, it was just a complement that didn\u2019t suit me. Could you throw it in the trash can?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe answered and proceeded to do so.

Or almost everyone, there was one exception: Scarlet, who was walking by his side with confident steps in her expensive heels, she was also wearing her expensive red dress. If people hadn\u2019t assaulted them was because she was one of Shinra\u2019s top executives and they were afraid of her, but if given the chance not only people who were looking for money would attack her, there were lots of hard feelings about Shinra in the slums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob hadn\u2019t realized the attention they were getting, he just wanted to go back with Taffy\u2026 Well, just if she wanted, he wasn\u2019t sure what her feelings were. Besides, he had to make sure that she was happy with her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had told Scarlet that Taffy was a Shinra\u2019s spy, which surprised her, she should know something so important, she then blamed Heidegger. She was also surprised that Bob had discovered something like that, but since he was his true boss she believed he was able to do anything and didn\u2019t give the matter anymore thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was in the bar but Tifa, not even Claudia. Tifa ran to Bob when she saw him, but she stopped midway looking at Scarlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What is she doing here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet full of confidence crossed her arms and slowly replied:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Are you talking about me, wench?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa crossed her arms too, directly confronting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Do you realize this is an undercover operation? We can\u2019t\u2019 have Shinra\u2019s top executives walking in here and then say that nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-She came with me, she is something like my secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob explained. Looking at him, Tifa\u2019s jaw dropped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The head of the weapons department is your secretary? How is that even possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Bobo is the only who can order me around. Got any problem, wench?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet played with Bob\u2019s hair while saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa realized she had more than one problem, just when the minx and the sissy were too busy making out with each other, a new rival appeared. And she even called Bob by a pet name. This was more important than the mission, she had to show this slut who was in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa walked, slowly approaching Scarlet while talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Thanks for your hard work, that way he can come to me sooner, hag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde also walked towards the waitress while answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don\u2019t worry, wench, we have known each other for years, we are very close to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don\u2019t work too much, at your age you can\u2019t keep up with young people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-When you have brains, you don\u2019t need to rely on physical labor, nor in your boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth were face to face. Thanks to her heels Scarlet could look down on Tifa, but the waitress was arching her back a bit in order to press her boobs against Scarlet\u2019s showing whose were bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob could feel the women were fighting, but their words didn\u2019t imply so, which made him wonder if he should stop them or not.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe he was just making excuses to use it. Remembering he couldn\u2019t use it on two targets at the same time, he started with Scarlet, just because she was nearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like that girl, you have just met but you can tell she would be your best female friend. You have been talking about how much you like\u2026 each other clothes\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet face showed a radiant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-That looks good on you, it remarks your curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe praised Tifa, who was taken aback by this change in her opponent. Then Bob did the same to her and she smiled too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Thank you. But your dress looks way better, it has elegant written all over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Oh no, this dress would fit you as well as me or better, but you should have worked a lot to be so fit. I wouldn\u2019t look so good in your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob felt relieved, the women peacefully chatted about their outfits. Unknown to him, both were thinking \u201cI have just met this woman and I can tell we will be best friends. But even so, Bob is mine\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only man in the room was wondering if he should drink something, because he didn\u2019t care about women clothing. Well, he had to admit that Tifa looked hot in that outfit, but she looked better naked; while Scarlet wasn\u2019t so bad when she wasn\u2019t shouting at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women walked to the counter, Tifa looked back at Bob and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Back in a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth disappeared behind a door. Bob didn\u2019t know what to thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some minutes both came back and he was surprised: they appeared wearing each other\u2019s clothes, it was hard to tell before, but they were more or less of the same height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet was wearing Tifa\u2019s white top and black sports bra, which weren\u2019t as filled as with their original owner, but they looked good on her, she didn\u2019t have Tifa\u2019s pack, but she was slim and not covering her navel made it show. She was also wearing the black skirt and the suspenders, as she was a bit taller than Tifa, the skirt covered even less of her legs, showing the black shorts underneath. She was also wearing mid-thigh socks, red boots, gloves, a leather guard in her left elbow and Tifa\u2019s earring. Her blonde hair was free of her usual bum and came down to her neck. Her makeup was more natural than before, almost as if she wasn\u2019t wearing anything, except for her nails which were still red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa was wearing Scarlet\u2019s long red satin dress, her boobs were a bit too big for the neckline, they were pressing against the fabric, which made them look even bigger than before. As she was a bit shorter than Scarlet, the skirt covered her feet except for the tip of the red high heels. Thanks to the shoes, she was now taller than Scarlet. She was also wearing Scarlet\u2019s stocking and all her jewelry. Her makeup looked more professional than before, like that of a business woman, but her nails weren\u2019t painted. Finally, her hair was tied in a bum like Scarlet\u2019s, but as Tifa\u2019s hair was longer, it still covered her back and the lock of hair in the front reached her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth smiled at Bob and asked at the same time:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-What do you think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was speechless and couldn\u2019t answer, which made both girls laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I have to say, this really looks good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa said looking at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I am like a business woman: sexy, elegant, strong and unreachable. And I should wear heels more often, I like them. And the thong too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-But this outfit let you move however you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet said while jumping a couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I could wear this every day, not like my clothes, this is comfortable, sexy and badass at the same time. I didn\u2019t even know there was underwear I wouldn\u2019t be ashamed of showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth smiled at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If you like it, you can keep that outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Thank you, you can keep mine too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I couldn\u2019t, this is far more expensive than mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa answered ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don\u2019t say that. Consider it a gift for our meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa looked away and nodded. Then she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Well, this works in our favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob had been lost for a time, but now Scarlet didn\u2019t understand either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Someone like you couldn\u2019t leave as she came. People out there will kill you. Hell, they could be coming as we speak. Disguised like that no one would think you are Scarlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-But what would happen to you in my dress?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I will manage somehow, don\u2019t worry. But we can\u2019t call you Scarlet, maybe it is an useless change, but better safe than sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Elsa. You can call me Elsa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet answered immediately while shyly looking at Bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Tifa looked at him too, with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Now Bob, you know what will happen to those clean clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man felt he had lived this before as the waitress in the red dress walked to him with a bottle in her hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t you think so, Taffy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*slurp* *slurp*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stopped sucking his cock, slowly retiring her lips until the dick left her mouth, then she kissed its tip and looked up to Bob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Your cock is the tastiest thing in the world, master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cheerfully answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was naked and on her knees, as she should be. Bob could see her big boobs from his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You are right, Taffy. As your reward, you can keep sucking my cock after you shake your breasts for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Thanks, master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cheerfully said while arching her back so he could have a better view, then she shook her boobs from side to side. After that she went back to her beloved cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy used to be called Tifa, she was like any other girl, but she had always had a void in her heart until some days ago, when she had met her master. He looked like a normal person but she immediately knew he could fill her and she knew what she should do. Tifa quickly undressed in front of him, then kneeled with her head on the floor and begged to be his slave. He accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that he hadn\u2019t told her his name, after all she was just a slave, she should only refer to him as \u201cmaster\u201d. After telling him her name, he kept calling her \u201cTaffy\u201d, she didn\u2019t know why, but if master called her so, that would be her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaffy loved serving her master, she cleaned for him, cooked for him, earned money for him. But the best thing was the sex, the first time she saw his cock she thought it was some kind of deity that she should worship, and she loved worshiping master\u2019s cock. Her favorite food was master\u2019s cock, her favorite drink was master\u2019s semen, her favorite position was on her knees in front of master, if she was lucky she could give him a blowjob or she would bend and be her master\u2019s footrest, even sometimes she received the blessing of being his table while he ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was grateful for her lecherous body that allowed her to satisfy her master. She was grateful for her big boobs that master loved to squeeze. She was grateful for her big ass that master loved to slap. She was grateful for her sexual lips that master loved wrapped around his cock. She was grateful for her pretty face that master loved to cover in cum. She was grateful for her thigh pussy that master loved to fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only think she disliked was wearing clothes, a girl should always be naked for her master, unless he asked her to wear something, those were the only acceptable clothes. But when she was outside she had to wear clothes, well, if she had to, she would wear the skimpiest outfit, that\u2019s why she always wore short skirts and revealing tops.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just keep things consistent. Also, the changes don't always need to affect everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start, pick a game, and come up with a storyline idea. Try to be creative, and don't make every path come to the same conclusion. Not every path needs to lead to physical changes. And some of my favorite ideas involve no physical changes.<br>\r\nAs for how things happen, it all depends on the storyline you pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to use any setting of the Final Fantasy series. Any numbered game, or the many spinoffs. Each game counts the whole of their respective spin offs and sequels as well. So, under FFX, X-2 stuff also goes, VII also counts as Crisis Core, Advent Children, etc, IV also has the After Years, and you get the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the case of FFI, you can use either the Warrior of Light version from Dissidia or the character class versions form the original game. Same goes with III in respects to the Onion Knight or Luneth and co from the DS remake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex is allowed, but just don't make every path solely about sex<br>\r\nNo killing off characters<br>\r\nNo ending the story<br>\r\nPlease try to have good grammar and such<br>\r\nAlways use all available option spots, and don't try to force a specific path.</td>",
