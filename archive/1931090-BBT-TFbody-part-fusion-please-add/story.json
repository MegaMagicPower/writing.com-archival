            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It starts out as any normal day with Leonard and Sheldon getting up, taking there showers, getting dressed and eating breakfast. Little did Leonard know Sheldon had started working on something unusual. The thing he was working on was some uni-sex body lotion for his girlfriend Amy Farrah Fowler and his friend Rajesh Koothrappali, cause they both were getting sick of buying lotion over and over again, so they asked Sheldon if he could so kindly make them a lotion that only needed to be used once and only. When Leonard and Sheldon began making there breakfast Penny walk in (Leonard's girlfriend) she asked if she could join them for breakfast Leonard said it was ok but Sheldon made a remark on how she is such a free-loader, Penny then makes a remark back at Sheldon, but he really didn't care for it much. Then Penny brought up on how she doesn't have any body lotion and was wondering if any of them had any she could use. When Sheldon hears about this he thinks to him self that he could use Penny as a test subject for his new uni-sex body lotion. He tells Penny that he has some and gives her the body lotion he made for Rajesh and Amy, after he gives her some Leonard then says that him and Sheldon have to head out for work, Penny then gives Leonard a kiss and says goodbye and have fun at work to Sheldon an Leonard. After they both left for work Penny went back to her apartment and began to get ready for work. When she started getting dressed she began to feel weird, then when she began to put on her black flat shoes for work her foot started to sink into it, she freaked out and pulled the shoe off her foot, when she did that her hands started fusing with her shoe. When this all started happen she began to realize that it must be because of the lotion that Sheldon gave her, she then tried reaching for her phone but then fell into the rest of her black flat shoe. She saw that she had her eyes and mouth in the front of the shoe where the toes would be, she knew his cause she could she her shoe-self on the floor in the bottom right hand corner of her large wall-mirror. She didn't know what to do at the time but then she realized that she left her front door to her apartment opened a little and heard Bernadette asking if she was ready. Penny then began shouting for help from Bernadette, she rushed into Penny's room and saw nothing, Penny told her down here, Bernadette was in shock to see that penny had become a Black flat shoe with eyes and a mouth. Bernadette asked her how did this happen, Penny then explained that it was from the body lotion Sheldon gave her, Bernadette wasn't surprised to hear about it cause she thought Sheldon might be using her as a test subject which he was or getting revenge from all the mean things Penny called him. Penny said I need to get out of this shoe, Bernadette replied that maybe after work she can take her back to her lab and somehow try to get her out of the shoe and back to normal. Penny agrees with it, then Bernadette says she has no room to put her anywhere in her purse so she tells Penny if she could leave her right black flat here and wear Penny to work, Penny says fine go right ahead it can't get much worse then this, little did she know it does.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Dr. Leonard Leakey Hofstadter is an experimental physicist with an IQ of 173 originally from New Jersey who received his PhD when he was 24-years old. He shares an apartment in Pasadena with colleague and friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Unlike his equally geeky friends, Leonard is interested and quite adept in building interpersonal and social relationships with others, and is quite successful with women.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dr. Sheldon Lee Cooper is a theoretical physicist, possessing a Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, Master of Arts, a PhD, an ScD, and an IQ of 187. Originally from East Texas, he was a child prodigy, starting college at the age of 11, and receiving his PhD at age 16. He is cold and calculating, and refrains from any form of physical contact if possible. Sheldon exhibits a strict adherence to routine to the point of exhibiting obsessive\u00e2\u0080\u0093compulsive disorder, performing specific activities on specific days and specifics times, such as doing the laundry on Saturday night at 8:15. Any disruption to this routine distresses him enormously.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny, is Leonard and Sheldon's neighbor across the hallway. Originally from a small town outside of Omaha, Nebraska, she is a waitress and occasional bartender at the local Cheesecake Factory and also an aspiring actress. Her profession and educational qualifications (she had dropped out of community college) are a constant source of disparaging comments from Sheldon. She has dated several men during the course of the series, including Kurt, Stuart and Zack, but her recurring love interest is Leonard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoward Joel Wolowitz is an aerospace engineer at Caltech's Department of Applied Physics with a Masters in Engineering who often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment. Unlike Sheldon, Leonard, and Raj, Howard has no doctorate, and often gets disparaged as a result, especially by Sheldon. He defends this by pointing out that he has a master's degree in Engineering from MIT and that the equipment he designs is launched into space, unlike the theoretical work of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rajesh Ramayan \"Raj\" Koothrappali is Howard Wolowitz's best friend, and yet another genius of the group; his name is usually shortened to \"Raj\". He is originally from New Delhi, India, and he works in the Physics department at Caltech, where his area of expertise is particle astrophysics. He lives in an apartment in Pasadena. As with his friends, he is mutually involved with and obsessed with science fiction and comic books in general, and is usually the one to propose various real-life questions derived from such works, such as the functions of the tails of the Na'vi in the film Avatar. He is also a fan of Harry Potter. Raj hates India, Indian food and Indian music, however, he does appreciate the Indian lullabies his mother sang to him and the catchiness of Hindi phrases. Raj is a Hindu and believes in karma (reincarnation), but eats beef. Raj is extremely shy around women, and finds himself unable to speak to or while in the presence of them unless he drinks alcohol, or he believes he has drunk alcohol. When Penny or Bernadette is around, Raj usually whispers what he wants to say to Howard or Leonard, who then repeats or responds to what Raj says out loud, although at times Howard will embarrass him by saying something completely different and inappropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz (after marrying Howard, nee Rostenkowski): is originally a waitress and co-worker of Penny's at the Cheesecake Factory, which pays the way for her graduate studies in microbiology per \"The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary\". A recurring joke in the series is in reference to Bernadette handling infectious biological specimens before preparing food or making physical contact with people, which eventually results in her and her entire research team spending New Year's Eve 2010 in quarantine. She is of Polish origin and Catholic upbringing and admits that she cannot lie very well because, according to her, the teachers \"kind of whip that out of you\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and is frequently seen wearing a cross necklace. Bernadette is introduced to Howard by Penny after he invoked the \"Girlfriend Pact\". At first, she and Howard do not get along, as they appear to have nothing in common. When they find out that they both have overbearing mothers, they feel a connection. Subsequently, Howard realizes Bernadette presents a real opportunity to develop a lasting relationship and, in an impulsive manner, he proposes to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Amy Farrah Fowler is a neuroscientist and Sheldon's love interest in the series. She has a Ph.D. in neurobiology, with a research focus on addiction in primates and invertebrates, occasionally mentioning such experiments as getting a capuchin monkey addicted to cigarettes or starfish hooked on cocaine. Raj and Howard met Amy through an online dating site after secretly setting up an account using Sheldon's name and information. The site matches her to Sheldon, and the two share many similar traits. Once she and Sheldon meet, she becomes, as Sheldon puts it, a girl who is his friend, but not his \"girlfriend\". They briefly ended their friendship when they got into an argument over whose field of study was superior. The two initially communicate online and via webcam, but at the encouragement of the group, she starts hanging out with the gang in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Leslie Winkle is an experimental physicist who works in the same lab as Leonard. In appearance, she is essentially Leonard's female counterpart, equipped with the black framed glasses and sweat jackets. She is one of Sheldon's arch-enemies, due to their conflicting scientific theories. Though they both consider each other to be intellectually inferior, Leslie is much wittier than Sheldon, regularly calling him \"dumbass\" and besting him in their exchanges. Leslie has had casual sex relationships with Leonard and later Howard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are more characters from the series if you like to add them you can like Stuart, Mary Cooper, Mrs. Wolowitz, Dr. Stephanie Barnett, Dr. Eric Gablehauser, Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, Barry Kripke, Wil Wheaton and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: No deaths, No mind control or experiencing the other person's life through there eyes, Only object transformations such as turning into shoes, clothes, undergarments and or fusing with the object, also body part fusion to such as feet, arms, hands, legs and anything else having to do with body parts thanks.</td>",
