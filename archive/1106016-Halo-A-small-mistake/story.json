You are part of a crew of 1000 Command crew and others plus 300 marines. the ship is outfitted with 2 MAC guns, 12 pelicans and 20 Longsword fighters. \"Okay, all personnel clear the enigne room!\" Captain Jacob Tobruk's voice boomed over the ship wide intercom. Being an anti-fighter gunner onboard the ship with your station near the engine room you reluctantly head to the mess hall and stare out the porthole. the year is 2522, earth is now a planet bustling with people and industry. The USNC ONI teams finally enhanced a normal Slipspace drive to extend to longer ranges. your ship has become a test bed for the new drive. \"all non-essential personnel, head to cryo!\" \"Ahhhh mannnnnnn!!!\" your shipmates groan. while walking to cryo, you hear the sound of a Slipspace drive activating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You start to debate with Scott over which course of action to take, urging him to help you reach a decision quickly, before the unaware titaness inadvertently harms you, or worse.

That left you and Scott with two conflicting options. Your idea is to sidle along the sofa in hopes of getting out of range of whatever was blocking your transmission, while Scott's plan is to attempt establishment of contact between the two of you and her. to you that sounds incredibly risky, but his logic is fairly sound. She was a human just like you, just incedibly larger in your eyes. If she was a decent person, like Scott hoped, she could help you out and perhaps even save the crew.

In a flash of tiny ammunition they open fire on the monster with their arms. The tiny bullets slice into the head and upperchest of your toy, yet it does not seem to leave much of an impact. This turn of events seems to shock the soldiers, though you are not so surprised. Afterall it makes sense for their bullets to be just as small as them. The soldiers seem to pause for a moment, as the devoured commander continues to sink, finally realizing that they truly are helpless in this new world. But they're sense of duty remains firm and they rush the toy with their full energy. Using only their bare hands the marines tear into the plastic vinyl of the monster's chest and tear it free.

I guess there isin't any monster out there that can eat you, huh?\" Your grin grows wider as you reach down and pluck up a single marine from the floor, whom is free from the slime. Without a word you extend your tongue and place him on top. The frightened marine raises his gun and begins to open fire upward, to the direct path that would lead to your brain. The shots strike true, but the \"burns\" are nothing more than mild tickles. More likely to provoke a sneeze than death. Many other toys join in the attack, gunfire rains upon your torso, but it is utterly futile. Your mouth closes over the marine, just as he cracks. The last thing his comrades hear from him is an interrupted scream, followed by a soft gulp. All that remains is a small bulge in your throat. Smiling again your smugly pat your stomach, letting out a loud burp. \"Oops, looks like you can be eaten afterall. You just need the right \"monster\".</span></div></div>",
