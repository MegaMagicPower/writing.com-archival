Silver Creek is named after a creek that has the same name that runs through the town. The town's population is perhaps 3,500. It was once a mining town back in the 1900s but the Great Depression effectively killed it; it's slowly turning into a ghost town now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're 24 years old have have short brown hair and average looks. You work at the only grocery store in town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just love to stargaze with the telescope you got one Christmas when you were sixteen. You never discovered anything awesome like a new planet or anything...not that you're looking to discover anything..you just like looking up at the night sky. You stargaze on a high hill that overlooks the town and the surrounding area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night you're stargazing through your telescope when you spot something coming out towards the woods and get curious. \"Huh?\" you ask. You home in a little closer and see that the creature coming out of the woods is somewhat large. It almost looks inhuman, but you can't get a clear look since the creature is in the shadows, but the one thing you know is that it doesn't look like any Earth animal you see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately run down to check out... whatever that thing was. You grab your coat along with a backpack and quickly throw in a flashlight along with a baseball bat, a hockey stick and some pucks. Then you remember to put in an air horn and super soaker in case the creature in question is hostile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to the outskirts of town and hide behind a chain link fence as you wait for the thing to come forward. From the looks of it the creature was bigger than a human and looked animalistic based on the shadow. The creature appeared to be breathing heavily, as if it was injured somehow. You take a closer look with your flashlight and get a good look and you can hardly believe what you see. The creature looked female in appearance but definitely was no human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of it she was an anthropomorphic hippopotamus woman who had to stand exactly twelve feet tall and very heavy looking given her species. She had long red hair reaching down to her considerable rear and a red tattoo of what looked like claw marks and a crescent moon over one of her eyes. What was really freaky was than she was wearing what looked like a spacesuit with a red vest, blue speedo and black leggings and armlets. On her vest's shoulder was the same symbol that was tattooed over her eye and she seemed to be wearing some kind of belt along with a scouter like device at the side of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo woman then presses a button on the device. \"This is Commander Barrah Nova of the thirteenth Star and Claw fleet calling home Planet Ju-O. My crew and I are stranded on an unknown planet. Not sure if natives are friendly or hostile, but from the looks of it, they don't do a very good job taking care of their planet. I am approaching a nearby village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAliens. Alien animals no less. This hippopotamus woman was obviously leading a crew of beast people flying over head when something happened. But why are these aliens here? What purpose? Are they friendly or hostile?</span></div></div>",

From the context, her name was Barrah, sounded alien enough. You knew you couldn't take on this woman in a fight, so you try to sneak away unnoticed. Unfortunately, fate isn't on your side because your backpack strap gets stuck in the chain fence and you get stuck. You grunt and try to pull the strap out, unintentionally rattling the chain fence in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis alerts Barrah and the hippo woman mutters in confusion. She turns her head and sees the fence rattling before she decides to approach it out of sheer curiosity. The alien woman walks towards you and you hear her thundering footsteps. You manage to pull your backpack free but fall to the ground in the process. As you lift up your head, you see Barrah's large feet and huge thighs right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately spring to your feet and gasp as Barrah looks down on you. You reach into your backpack for the water gun but grab the flashlight by mistake and force the anthro hippo to close one eye before you step back. \"Stay back!\" you yell. \"Alien!\" Barrah just holds out her hands as she walks forward and her stomach shakes. \"Remain calm Native,\" she says. \"I mean you no harm.\" But you panic and take out the water gun and spray her in the face. All Barrah does in response is spit out some of the water. \"Well,\" she says. \"It looks like we landed on one of those planets. Calm down citizen. We come in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now...</span></div></div>",

This one looks a lot like the Elephants of your world if it weren't for the fact she (the very large bust and shapely hips tell you she is indeed a she like the rest of the crew) was standing on her hind legs and was wearing an identical spacesuit as the others, except a pink speedo and purple vest, and carrying some kind of handheld device. The other three Hippos had black speedos and dark blue leggings on. They were watching the trees carefully and seemed to be some kind of security team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor Viola\" The first Hippo (Barrah, you remind yourself) calls out to the Elephant. \"What do you make of this planet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola looks at the device in her hand for a few seconds. \"Atmosphere is exactly like ours. Lots of life signs all around us. Mostly small rodent-like mammals. Wait...I'm picking up something larger, just over in that direction. Could be a intelligent native.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team starts moving toward your direction and you do the only thing you can do, duck further down in the bushes and hope they overlook you.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly as she pointed it right at you it began to beep even quicker, telling Viola that you were right in the bushes in front of you. She still can't see, but stops and calmly calls out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello little one. My name is Doctor Viola. We come in peace, but we seek your help. Could you please come out of hiding and talk with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay hidden, you have no reason to trust these woman and would rather not face them alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear me?\" She squints, trying to spot you, then looks at her device again while moving forward more. \"Hmmm...maybe my reader is faulty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, have you found anything?\" Commander Barrah calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Commander, I think the device may be malfunctioning...oops!\" She doesn't see the log in front of her and trips, twisting her body in mid air as she falls to the earth.

I'm fine,\" she says a she bounces on your tiny body and pushes you deeper into her crack, held out of it only by her spandex uniform. \"Never better.\" She turns her attention back to you. \"God I love being the first one to squash a new alien species into my ass. Especially little ones like you! I can keep you locked between my cheeks all day if I wanted to. And I will tell you a secret little one.

She lifts her tail and looks back at you over her shoulder, held tightly between her massive cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have plenty of time alone together my little living dildo. But for now I'm going to have to share.\" she says quietly to you. Then louder, she calls out \"Commander! You're going to want to see this.\" she says to the hippo woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Barrah approaches curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Doctor?\" she asks. Without a word, Viola spins, revealing your body held securely by her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears that I did in fact find someone, although quite by accident.\" Viola says matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarrah smiles briefly before forcing a stern look on her face. \u201cYou need to be more careful Viola!\u201d she lectures. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t had the treatment yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola nods silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, pull him out of your ass and get him onto the ship.\u201d She instructs Viola. \u201cYou three!\u201d she calls to the hippo women \u201cWe have everything we need! Back to the ship and make sure cloaking is active!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant woman roughly fishes you out from between her cheeks and follows orders. Soon, all 5 anthro women and you are back on the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are panicked. So much has happened in the last hour. One minute you were sitting in your room looking out your telescope and the next you\u2019re crushed under the ass of a walking, talking, elephant! Before you could you wrap your mind around that, you found yourself in the hands of a large hippo woman, held captive on a spaceship invisible to the human eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Barrah smiles at you, trying to help you calm down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not worry human. Everything will be explained shortly. But first, you need to go through a special treatment to ensure your safety.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously looked around at the women, not having much choice, you nod in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarrah hands you off to Viola the elephant. You heart rate elevates as you remember her earlier threats upon discovering you. She grins, understanding your fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs Commander Barrah said, this treatment is for your protection.\u201d The doctor begins, placing you in a box shaped chamber that looked like a clear, drained Jacuzzi with a lid. There were holes and hoses along the side that looked like they were designed for blowing air or water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the lid and continued. You could hear her clearly through the walls of the chamber. \u201cWe will be traveling at very high speeds across great distances little one. Some planets we explore may not be friendly to your body. This is designed to protect you. Once this is done, you will be able to breathe in any environment, no matter the chemical makeup of the atmosphere. Even under water. What\u2019s more, you will also be mostly immune to physical injuries. Your body will take on properties that allow you to return to your normal form, no matter what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your understanding of what Viola is telling you. After everything you\u2019ve seen and been through in the last hour, a little protection seems like a good idea. As she continues, your eyes drift down Viola\u2019s body. For the first time, and from a safe distance, you\u2019re able to appreciate her curves. While normal elephants on earth have wrinkled, loose skin, Viola\u2019s skin was flawless and held her curves tightly. Her breasts stuck out with pride and her ass was round and muscular. She easily surpassed 20 feet in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor this to fully work, you\u2019ll need to disrobe completely\u201d the doctor instructs. She looks at you expectantly. As the look on her face grows less patient, you shake yourself awake and take off your clothes. You feel uncomfortable standing in front of this woman naked and try to hide yourself, but Viola just rolls her eyes unimpressed and presses some buttons on the outside of the chamber. Soon, a purple gas fills the room. You cough, but once you calm down you find that you\u2019re able to breathe normally. Once the gas dissipates, you are showered with a blue gelatin. As soon as it hits your skin, it is absorbed completely. The process finishes and you are dry as a bone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola smiles at you, knowing that the process is compete. She moves toward the chamber, but another member of the crew appears. \u201cBarrah says he is to be debriefed. Meet us on the bridge\u201d she says confidently. Viola nods and the hippo woman quickly retrieves you. She eyes your nude body hungrily, but follows orders and returns you to the bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the bridge, you are once again presented to Barrah. She grimaces slightly and orders one of the hippos to bring you a uniform. You\u2019re surprised to see that they have spandex space suits in your size, but one is presented to you and you dress quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that your safety is ensured, allow me to explain things. We are the 13th Vessel of the Star and Claw fleet hailing from the planet Ju-O.\u201d she begins. \u201cWe are an exploratory crew with a mission to advance our culture\u2019s knowledge of distant galaxies. We are on our customary first mission. Each ship must venture out to a planet where evolution took a different path than it did on Ju-O. The final member of the crew is then selected from that planet. You, Andrew Mercer, are the fortunate earthling who will be joining us on our further missions.\u201d<br>\r\nYou just learned that you were drafted into service as a part of an alien space crew, so the fact that Barrah knows your name already hardly registers with you. You are sure that your face displays a look of shock, but your silence allows Barrah to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe purpose of the 6th crew member varies depending upon the circumstances surrounding their selection and the makeup of their species. I have some initial concerns about your ability to truly perform vital duties due to your lack of size and strength, so until I decide otherwise let\u2019s say you will be our mascot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo girls chuckle at that, but you feel insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMascot?\u201d you ask incredulously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarrah smiles. \u201cWould you prefer toy?\u201d The anthro woman all laugh at their commander\u2019s response and you duck your head in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, mascot is fine.\u201d You respond defeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarrah smiled as she continued. \u201cAs you have already learned, my name is Commander Barrah. This is my ship, and what I say goes. Always. I am not to be questioned. Is that understood Andrew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarrah gestured to the rest of her crew. \u201cI believe you are already familiar with Doctor Viola\u201d the curvaceous elephant woman gave you a knowing smile. \u201cThis is Jackie, our weapons specialist and combat expert,\u201d Barrah continues, gesturing to the only hippo taller than herself. Jackie, like all of the anthro women on the ship, was wide and curvaceous but she her curves clearly hid well developed muscles. She looked at your smirking, as if she could sense your weakness. \u201cSierra is our Science Officer,\u201d the commander said as the smallest of the women smiled and waived shyly. She was only about 9 feet tall, but actually had wider than Jackie. \u201cFinally, Moona is our Navigator and pilot. She is the one who brought us to your planet in the first place.\u201d Moona was about 10 or 11 feet tall, and had a more purple or red tone to her skin than the other women did. She licks her lips and winks at you after she is introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will be spending time with all of us throughout our journeys and missions, but I\u2019ve decided that first\u2026.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You gulp before Viola roughly grabs you with her trunk and you are reminded of the danger you are immediately in already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the doors to the bridge closed, she continued taking you down the hall.

After a couple moments of you not dying, you realize that you can still breathe in the limited air in her cleavage and start to calm down. Her breasts are decidedly less heavy and tough as her ass, and the soft, warm globes mold around your face and squeeze your body in pillowy heaven. Your joy is interrupted by a hard smack on your ass from Viola's trunk as it still sticks out to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep squirming, Momma loves that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thrash around as she spanks you again, and try to push your way out, but stop when you hear the ships PA again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, we are about ready to leave.

Your struggles just made her smile broader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must prepare for departure Mascot. That means everyone must be secure.

You heard the doctor chuckle at your efforts above you and you look up. She's turned around and you see her large, elephant ass hovering above you. She slowly shifts her weight from side to side, drawing out your fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly lowers herself into the chair. Instead of being impacted by her full weight all at once like you were in the forest, you felt her slowly apply her bulk to your small body. You could also feel the difference the \"treatment\" made as well. You felt pain and pressure, but you didn't feel the need to gasp or struggle for air. Your body is compressed immediately, flattened like you didn't think was possible. This must have been a side effect of the treatment, allowing you to survive the massive weight of the 20 foot elephant who was currently crushing you under her massive ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Dr. Viola settled into her chair in the medical bay and secured herself. She shifted in her seat, enjoying the feeling of her ass dragging the human with it as she moved, and sighed in contentment. Satisfied, she signaled Commander Barrah that the Mascot and her were secure and ready for departure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter take off...</span></div></div>",

The top of your feet rest atop her boobs, but the rest of you is out of site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold onto my belly my little toy.

Her curiosity is too much and with her other hand she slowly removes your pants to uncover your erection. \"Interesting, you have those too...\" She murmurs, far too lost in thought to finish her sentence. You reach up and pull your pants back down. Viola snaps herself back to attention and looks you in the eye. \"No physical after-effects from taking off... how do you feel?\" She asks dryly. \"A little confused still, but thankful that I had such a soft seat for the take off.\" The elephant smiles at your cheesy answer. You were no doubt still afraid of what the hell was going on. You were being abducted by aliens, and at least one of them had plans to use you as a dildo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I've already done a few tests, let's get the rest over and done with. This may hurt a little.\" You wanted to ask what she was on about but she grabbed your hips with her free hand and forcefully bent your legs. She bent them the wrong way through, instantly shattering your knees. But there was no snapping of bone or horrifying pain. It barely stung at all and when she let go your legs popped right back the way they were supposed to be. She repeated the process with all your limbs, dislocating them only for them to just pop back into place without any effort. She grabbed your torso and crushed your ribcage, but it was nothing to you. The full effect of the alien treatment began to sink in as you appear to be able to shrug off any pain or punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for one last test.\" She announced. The elephant lifted you up again, this time holding your torso in her trunk. Two large hands grabbed hold of your head and guided it to hers. She pursed her lips a little and planted a huge, sloppy kiss on your face. You tried to resist, but the experience felt strange and... nice? You weren't sure how to feel about this, but Viola didn't wait for you. She pressed her advantage and pushed her tongue into your mouth. She was gentle and hesitant, making sure you didn't panic. She played with your tongue and after a lengthy kiss she released you with a loud smack. \"My word you're good at that...\" She said, a little flustered. She walked over to one of the consoles and hit a button, causing Barrah's face to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Report, Science Officer Viola?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can report the treatment was 100% effective.

I can use an extra pair of hands down here and our mascot needs something to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative, let's see if you can do science, Andrew.\" The screen deactivated and Viola looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola smiled ominously. \"I have just the thing for you...\"</span></div></div>",

To start though, I just need you to look at me.\" You raise an eyebrow at the elephant's unusual command. But if that's all you needed to do, you weren't going to complain. You were quite certain you'd pay for your stay in entirely different ways already. You look at the elephant scientist as she grabs a smooth bracer and clamps it around her wrist. The side of it was adorned with several buttons. You still weren't sure what you were looking for whilst the elephant was messing around with the settings. The device emitted a low hum and Viola slowly seemed to turn incorporeal. At first she looked transparent but in seconds she had completely vanished. Your jaw hit the floor. The 20 foot elephant had just turned invisible before your very eyes. Or did she teleport? Her voice suddenly rang out from the ether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging by your expression the cloaking field works. Now, does it fully conceal movement? Keep a close eye on me. Tell me if you see any weird shimmering effects. I'm still standing where I was, I'm just doing a little dance.\" You stared at the lab wall, trying to discern the slightest hitch in the cloaked elephant's camouflage. After half a minute you had to concede that she was untraceable. You do tell her that you could hear her body shuffling with her movements. Her voice called out from the same spot again. \"Good. Good. Now for the final experiment. Activating sound dampening.\" At this point you had no clue whether or not she was still standing at the same spot. Without sound you'd have no indication of where she was at all. A sudden rush of air past you made you look around. You were confident the elephant was on the move, but amazingly the cloaking device make this humongous animal as stealthy as a ninja. And when she announced her reappearance again, she did so in a spectacular fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no way of seeing it coming. A sudden immense weight connected with your head and pushed you down. You couldn't quite tell if this was the sole of her foot or just her butt. The crushing weight quickly lowered you to your knees, but it wouldn't stop. When you ran out of space to give the heavy surface simply kept going, pressing you against the lab floor. The yielding nature of the smothering surface above you convinced you it was indeed Viola's ass. With no way of seeing her, you had no clue how big the smile on her face was. As if compelled by some invisible hand, your body began to compress and flatten. The large, round surface of her ass made light work of you and soon the elephant revealed herself. \"Well, I think I can safely say I've perfected our cloaking devices. I was able to just walk up to you and take a seat. Very handy for the next time we want to observe the native species of a planet. Especially if I want to observe them up close.\" She said, patting her butt. \"As for you, you passed with flying marks too. Great for kissing and for sitting on, I think you and me will get along just fine.\" You wanted to reply, but you were still being crushed beneath her hefty buttocks. A faint mumbling was all you could manage. Viola chuckles to herself. \"Oh, right. You probably want me to get up.\" She hoists herself off your wrecked body as it begins to twitch and reform. In mere moments you're back to normal with nothing but a killer headache to show for it.</span></div></div>",

Andrew would help the doctor the best he could, by handing massive size tools and parts, while working as her personal seat cushion. And while odd and painful, Andrew was pleased to help the doctor in whatever fashion or matter he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Andrew, I think that's enough for today\" Viola groaned as she stood up from her stool, reveling a flattened Andrew stuck her to butt. Andrew felt like a cartoon character who had just been smashed by a giant hammer, and he knew he probably looked like one too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola reached around and took hold of Andrew with her left hand and peeled the young man off, like an old bandied. Once free, Viola helped Andrew regain his 3-D form being flapping him out like a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a very good job today Andrew, not bad for a primitive\" the Doctor explained as she placed Andrew down on the floor and began to clean up her work station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the praise Doctor, but i doubt i was that much help\" Andrew said, slightly embarrassed by the doctors compliment. \"Don't sell yourself to short, darling. You were a lot of help today\" Viola said as she turned from her desk and looked down at Andrew with a perky grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since arriving on the ship, Andrew was finally able to see the height difference between himself and the doctor. Dr. Viola was a twenty foot amazon, while he was only 5'6 and only came up to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-I appreciate it that doctor\" Andrew said sheepishly, wondering why the Doctor made him feel so flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now why don't you come with me\" the Doctor as she quickly reached down and lifted Andrew up with her trunk. Andrew felt himself being hoisted into the air and being carried out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" Andrew asked, as he whisked away down a hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my quarters, obviously\" the doctor explained as she turned down a corner and approached a massive door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why-why?\" Andrew asked as he was carried into a room that was well suited for a 20-foot giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until your quarters are properly made, your going to be spending the next few nights with me...in her...alone\" Viola said seductively as she placed Andrew in a large seat meant for the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate the accommodations Doctor but this isn't scarceness\" Andrew said as he watched the doctor walk over to what appeared to be a giant mini-bar and began to make herself a giant size cock-tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is Andrew\" the Doctor said just as she finished drinking her beverage \", after all its not everyday i get to share my bed with such a handsome specimen\" Viola said seductively as she began to strip out of her clothes and into her undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew felt himself pitching another tent as he watched Viola undress herself. Beneath that pink uniform and purple vest was a voluptuous giantess whose breast were too larger for her bra and panties that were about to snap from the doctors immense weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola stepped in front of Andrew and stood before the smaller man in all her glory, and Andrew could only stare in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you like what you see\" she said as she turned her back on little Andrew and immediately planted her butt right on his lap. The moment was so fast that Andrew barely had a second tor react as the air flew out of his lungs and he was once again reduced to a 2-D image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew could Viola moan and could feel her bouncing, further flattening Andrew into a paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'll ever get tired of that feeling\" Viola moaned as she parted her legs and took hold of Andrews paper thin legs. With one quick tug, Andrew came flying out from beneath Viola like a table cloth on a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Andrew was out from beneath Viola he thought he would have a moment to regain his shape and composer but that moment passed as Viola began to rub his thin paper body all over herself. Andrew was exploring every inch and crevasse of this woman until Viola finally grew bored and snapped Andrew back into shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was back to his normal shape, Andrew found himself being kissed by the doctor. There lips were locked and without thinking Andrew found himself making out with the doctor, who easily held in the air and carrying him to her over-sized bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola pulled her lips away from Andrew and shoved him down on her bed and jumped on top of him. Andrew was suddenly pinned beneath  Violas massive belly and he could feel Viola bouncing again flattening him out all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew made an attempt to wiggle out from beneath Viola, but whenever he moved Viola would simply push down harder on Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keeping squirming for me, Mama loves it\" Viola moaned until she finally grew bored with that and decided to get off Andrew and let him regain his shape. Viola smiled at Andrew and took note of his massive erection and decided it was time to start undressing him down to his birthday suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now its time for the real fun\" Viola said as she laid Andrew down on her bed and began to crawl on top of him...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was straddling Andrew, her strong legs keeping her body hoisted over his. He regained his normal shape, noting just how little space there was between the looming elephant and himself. His boner stood proudly, poking her gut. She leaned forward a little, her head popping up atop the large belly. Her gaze was filled with lust. She was feeling every bit as horny as him and he was about to experience her lust head on. Viola's agile trunk reached down and patted him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready, little guy, 'cause you're not getting out from under me until I shower you in my climax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew gulps in fear. She was almost four times his size, how the hell would he be able to pleasure that? He didn't get time to wonder as Viola sat herself up, aligning her dripping pussy with his boner. Without warning she let herself drop down on him, his manhood vanishing into her hungering snatch and his pelvis feeling the impact of her moist lips. She bounced up only to smash his groin again and again. Her heavy belly swung up and down along with the rhythm, smashing down on his puny body. Like a massive flabby hammer it squashed him flat. Her butt squished almost all of his legs, leaving only his feet far enough from the action to stay unflattened. The only other part of Andrew not turning paper-thin right now was his manhood, engulfed by wet elephant pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola felt his rod enter her and stir around inside her most intimate places. But as she feared, it was not enough. Still, for being such a good lab partner she could at least reward him by smothering that cock with affection. Her inner walls squeezed and massaged the hardened flesh until he could hold it no longer. There wasn't a hint of air left in his lungs, making his climax completely silent. Viola felt the twitching little manhood burst with pleasure and expertly squeezed every last drop from his balls. As he began to sag it was clear more drastic measures were needed for her climax. She slows down, looming over him again and letting his body reform. With what little breath he had the human stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God. That was unbelievable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you liked it, Andrew. But you're not off the hook just yet.

In mere second Andrew had gone from being a musical instrument to a living basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie had begun to dribble Andrew and took great joy out of her boy-toys pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess this all you really got huh\" Jackie said as she stopped bouncing Andrew and proceeded to balance him on the tip of her index finger and began to spin him in a circle, until she grew bored with that and decided to slam Andrew into the ground so hard that his ball shaped body turned into a pancake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit Andrew, you can certainly take a beating, but hows your stamina?\" Jackie asked as she peeled Andrew off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Above average\" Andrew said as he slowly regained his shape in Jackie's hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, then prove it\" Jackie said as she pressed her lips on Andrew and pulled him close to her chest.

He was still breathing heavily, riding out the rush that was having sex with the overwhelming beast. Jackie had completely drenched his crotch in her release, but that glint in her eyes told him that she still had plenty to give. She walked to the side of the ring and reached out to grab a towel. With a few big swipes she wiped away the large stain between her legs before tidying up the mat. A second towel was thrown Andrew's way and he quickly made work of the mess that was most of his lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You managed to hold on better than I expected, human.\" She said with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you gave me plenty of... encouragement.\" Andrew replied, struggling a bit to find the right word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready then?\" Jackie's smile grew bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" He raises a brow<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round two, silly. You didn't think you were done, did you?\" She picked him off the floor and threw him into a corner, stepping into the other corner herself. \"Now try to apply what you've learned so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled his eyes. The only thing he'd learned so far is that Jackie got off on flattening him beneath her. The hippo didn't seem to care as she dropped all pretense and charged straight towards him. Her jiggling belly approached at great speed, ready to squash him against the turnbuckle. He managed to dodge out of the way at the very last second. He heard the dull thump of hippo colliding with the ring, the turnbuckle letting of an ominous creaking. He'd almost been smashed by that impact. He thanked his lucky stars, but they didn't save him from the followup. Jackie swung around, her massive belly slamming into him and sending him flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact was powerful, dazing Andrew and letting the hippo close the distance quickly. She jumped up and caught him in a huge belly flop, squashing everything below his neck under many tons of belly fat. To her surprise the hippo's victim only let out a loud \"Oof!\" as she pancaked him. She expected him to cry out in fear or pain, but he seemed awfully composed for having someone her size toying with him. He was getting used to this much faster than she thought. Then she felt exactly why he was so seemingly comfortable. Somewhere beneath that endless sea of blubber crushing his body, something was trying to poke up. He was ready for an entirely different round two. She sat up and laughed loudly. Almost all of him hand been crushed flat, but in the middle of all of it his manhood poked up just a little, proudly defying her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, you want to go again, do you? I can't blame you, just look at what you're playing with here.\" She gestured at her large body. \"But I'm going to want a little more than your handsome little soldier this time, Andrew. I also want a little more from you this time. I want you to fight me every step of the way. Struggle, punch, kick, the more the better. Fighty men make me feel soooo good.\" The hippo looks ready to climax at the mere thought of subduing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me what I want and I'll spoil you rotten for the rest of the day.\" The hippo continues, her voice thick with desire. \"And maybe the night too.\" She adds, giving him a huge wink. Andrew shoots back an awkward smile, still a little worried about what the hippo said about wanting more than his cock. What was she about to try and force into that ravenous pussy of hers?</span></div></div>",

Wandering the halls idly seemed like a poor choice, but he didn't have anything else he could do. Finally his eyes fell on a terminal. With some trepidation he put a finger on it and immediately a robotic voice spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello mascot Andrew Mercer, how may I be of assistance?\" The voice rang out from the terminal and Andrew quickly stammered out his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh.. where is my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Searching for room designated to mascot Andrew Mercer, please wait. Room located, follow this hallway and take the third door to your right. Then down that hall and the second door on your right.\" The screen popped up a helpful arrow to determine in which direction Andrew had to follow the current hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" He politely responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are most welcome. Once you have acquainted yourself with the crew, you are invited to get to know <i>me</i> a little better too.\" The robotic voice spoke with a weird inflection. Was there someone on the other end of the line, or did this spaceship just try to flirt with him? That was getting just a bit too weird for Andrew and without saying another word he started to follow the instructions. He walked down the hallway and took the right turn into another hall. Here he took the second door to the right and entered a pristine room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that surprised Andrew was how big it all was. Clearly this room was designed for someone closer to Barrah or Viola in size. Perhaps they didn't expect humans to be this small. To help him the doors were fitted with a second keypad much below the first one so he could use them more easily. He could tell some other adjustments had been made to accommodate for their mascot's size. Though some of the top cabinets would go unused, Andrew was sure he could make it work. Secondly the room was almost shockingly tidy. Everything was laid out neatly, not a spec was out of place. The bunk was already made and to the side he spotted a door. As expected it opened to reveal a bathroom with a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew stepped into the oversized shower cabin and took a long, hot shower to wash away Jackie's juices and tend to his sore body. Nothing ached a lot, but he still felt a little numb from being squashed flat, rolled up and shoved inside the hippo's pussy. He couldn't imagine anything worse happening to him, but these ladies would probably be able to show him otherwise. Almost on command the door opened and someone stepped in.</span></div></div>",

I've heard you had a rough day? I hope you can some time to decompress in your room. Do you like the adjustments I made?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... ehm...\" He stammered, not sure how to deal with the fact he was having a conversation with the large hippo whilst still in the shower, his naked body fully visible. He cleared his throat and finally found his words. \"I appreciate you adjusting the place for me. It's all been so overwhelming so far. Training with Jackie was... intense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra giggled a little. \"Yes, she can be quite direct in her approach. Don't be afraid to return the favor. She loves it when you get a little... forceful in pleasing her.\" Both Andrew and the shy hippo woman blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something else.\" Andrew spoke up. \"I asked the ship computer for directions, but after pointing me the right way I'm fairly sure the computer tried to... flirt with me. Was that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo woman turned beet red and cleared her throat. \"Not quite... I'm not entirely sure how to explain this, but let's just saw that our spaceship is only mostly mechanical and that what you spoke to might technically not be a computer. To put it in terms simple enough for you to understand, the ship itself is sort of... alive. But enough scientific chatter, I came here to see if you liked your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew already regretted asking, his head spinning from the strange answer. \"I do very much, thank you Sierra.\" His answer put a broad smile on her face. When she didn't leave after getting her answers the human began to feel nervous. His voice shuddered a little as he asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else you need from me, miss Sierra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wide-bottomed hippo smiles and more quickly than the man thought possible she removed her space suit, standing before him with not a thread of clothing on her pudgy frame.</span></div></div>",

As Andrew pondered his question, he could feel his body begin to realign while Sierra and Jackie both glared at one another like spoiled children. When Andrew finally regained his strength he was able to stand once more, and as he stood he heard the voice call out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mascot Andrew are you alright?\" the voice sounded both feminine and computerized, and it was coming from the terminal on the west wall. Andrew looked at the square terminal and and merely replied with a nod as he looked deep into the large blue camera lens that was oddly fixated on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's wonderful news, now as for you two\" the terminal said her soft voice becoming hard and stern \"Officer Jackie Flash and Science Officer Sierra Tash, you both knew better than to argue over Andrew. What would have happened had you ripped him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word ripped sent a tingle of fear down Andrew's spine as he watched both woman become aware of there sudden behavior. Jackie, the 14 foot giantess, went from a stern looking bad-ass to looking disappointed in herself, while Sierra bowed her head in shame, simply her massive hips side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, you two should know better. Jackie you and Viola have had your turn with Andrew, you need to remember that the male species needs to be shared with all not just one\" the terminal said as Jackie stood at attention and nearly bowed her head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am...I am sorry\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't apologize to me, apologize to Sierra for wasting her time and to poor Andrew for the pain you put him through\" Andrew watched as Jackie looked from the terminal to him, but he merely shrugged as a gesture of forgiveness, while Sierra smirked to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as for you Sierra, instead of yanking on the poor boy you should have called me. Today is clearly your turn with Andrew\" the terminal explained as a large holographic calendar, that Andrew could not read, suddenly appeared over the terminals face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew glanced at the calendar and noticed that it looked very similar to the one on earth, it simply had different symbols and letters. Each small box had a name written in, all except the seven box, which Andrew assumed to be Sunday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If something likes this happens, then contact me and either the Commander or I will help you.Is that clear?\" the terminal asked as both woman stood at attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" the two hippos replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, Jackie your dismissed. Sierra carry on\" the terminal commanded as the blue faded from the lens, along with the calendar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that woman, fine Sierra have your fun, but I'm requesting double time next week. So remember that!\" Jackie shouted as she stormed out of the room, leaving a confused Andrew alone with the bottom heavy scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That woman, as much as I lover she can be a real pain\" Sierra scuffed as she approached the large bedroom door and punched in a number code that clearly locked the door. Once the door was locked the red skin hippo turned her full attention back to Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where were we?\" Sierra asked as she strut over to Andrew, popping her hippos out with every step until she stood a mere inch from him. Andrew could feel himself getting aroused again as he looked up and the blond hair woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being new to the ship and its crew, Andrew knew everyone on board, but this was the first time Andrew go to really see Sierra. On the bridge she appeared to be a young timid woman, wearing her hair in a tight bun, standing in the corner, looking as if she was unable to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, Andrew saw Sierra for the gorgeous woman she was. \"I think we were some where around her\" Andrew said as he gestured to the bed and held out his hand for Sierra to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pear shaped wonder took Andrews hand and allowed herself to be guided to the bed, where she sat and waited for Andrew to make his move. Unlike, Viola or Jackie, Andrew was given full leave to do as he pleased. So he began by climbing into Sierra's lap and reached out to kiss her. Sierra returned the gesture and began to kiss Andrew in return. Sierra was gentle with her approach while Andrew struggled with the larger woman's exploring tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings began to heat up when Andrew began to explore every inch of Sierra's body. He touched every inch of her smooth, plush skin, while Sierra hands did the same. Both man and woman felt every inch of each other, until Sierra broke off her kiss and scooped Andrew up in her arms and flopped him down on the massive bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Andrew asked, catching his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying something new, I heard your people call it 69-ing\" Sierra said in a confused tone, as climbed into the bed and lowered nether region down on Andrew's face. Andrew could feel the air leaving his body as every inch of himself, from the neck down, become seated by Sierra's massive weight. Thankfully Andrew's head remained intact, but was engulfed by Sierra's soaking coffer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope your ready\" Sierra said as she began to bounce on Andrew, urging him to get to work. Taking the obvious hint, Andrew began to work his tongue like no other. He moved with grace and precision and he knew he was doing something right because he could hear Sierra moan and groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed and Andrew could feel his jaw getting soar and his tongue getting tired form his fluid motion, and it didn't help that Sierra seemed to keep raising her hippos higher into the air making Andrew work harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Andrew heard Sierra let out a moan of purse ecstasy, at first she was tense but in the end she relaxed letting her full weight drop on top of Andrew. Andrew felt the rest of his body flatten out beneath Sierra, who merely laid on the bed shivering in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I never thought 69-ing would feel so good\" Sierra panted as she rolled on to her back, leaving Andrew plastered on the bed sheet like a sticker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...its really something\" Andrew groaned as he struggled to regain his shape and form. Sierra shivered again as she sat up and turned herself around so she could lay down beside Andrew \"But what did you get out of it? I feel like I was the only one having any real fun\" Sierra said, her massive fingers tracing up and down Andrew's decompressed frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i was defiantly having fun\" Andrew confessed as his body began to reform, starting with his head and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But 69-ing means i work down there and you work down here\" Andrew said gesturing to his own nether regions. Sierra looked at Andrew's members and her cheeks became a darker shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean i was supposed to use my mouth too?\" Sierra said as her massive hand reached out to touch Andrews extend member. Her grip was soft, yet firm, and the motion of her hand brought instant pleasure to Andrew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it this way?\" Sierra asked, her hand moving slightly faster \"Or do you want it like this?\" Sierra said as she rolled on top of Andrew, burring his member in her twat, while crushing his waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...I like that\" Andrew heaved as Sierra began to hump. Sierra's massive body and hippos was hiding Andrew's lower half, and her constant motion kept pulverizing it over and over again. Andrew moaned and groaned, feeling pleasure and pain all over again, as Sierra leaned forward shoving her breast in Andrew's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew could feel himself turning into paper again as every inch of his body become encompassed by Sierra's larger frame. In the end, both Sierra and Andrew came at the same time and both man and woman were out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That....was...amazing,\" Sierra panted as she picked herself up off Andrews face, staring down at his flatten-rubbery body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was\" Andrew moaned as he felt Sierra's larger hand run down the side of her face, a drowsy looking growing in her eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a man of many talents Mr. Andrew...I wonder what other talents you have?\" Sierra said as she began to lean forward again, falling right on top of Andrew's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to find out...tomorrow\" Sierra said as she laid on top of Andrew and began to snore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Andrew found himself pinned beneath another woman. Thankfully his face was being smothered by two massive orbs of joy, better than being underneath Violas butt-check again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to move Sierra, you silently thanked the hippo for the treatment that kept him alive, and began to fall sleep. Andrew couldn't help but wonder what plans the scientist had for him tomorrow, and who he was supposed to be with tomorrow. So many questions were running through Andrews head, but in the end he fell asleep, unaware of the glowing blue lens that was staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Andrew squirmed and struggled beneath Sierra wondering when she would wake up, but when it became clear that the red skin hippo was in coma Andrew decided to settle in for a long night...a long night that involved tons of flesh bouncing and squashing him into the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some odd reason Sierra appeared to be a night-bouncer, ever so slightly she would squirm and bounce, her giant stomach crushing Andrews chest while her giant knockers crushed his face.

It took longer than Andrew liked, but Sierra finally noticed the loud beeping and stood up to shut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond hair hippo stretched out her arms and back and let out a huge yawn before she looked down at her stomach and saw a flatten Andrew plastered to herself. Sierra looked down at Andrew and smiled. It was a kind and innocent smile, one that told Andrew that this alien view him with value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning handsome, sleep well\" Sierra asked as she peeled Andrew off her stomach and flapped him back into shape. With a simple switch of her wrist, Andrew was poped back into shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better now\" Andrew groaned as he looked at Sierra's naked body and suddenly found himself getting aroused again. Sierra smiled and leaned down to kiss Andrew, giving him a long and passionate kiss that left Andrew breathless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep in your pants right now darling, you and I have some work to do today\" Sierra said as she turned her back on Andrew and began gathering her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of work?\" Andrew asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a shower first and grab something to eat, after that meet me in my office and ill tell you\" Sierra said as she gave Andrew a once over before living him alone in his quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew took what time he had to himself to get ready. He showered, dressed, and grabbed a massive granola bar from his room to eat. Once he was done, Andrew left his room and set off Sierra's office, grateful that the Terminal gave him wonderful directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra's office, or laboratory, was right beside Dr. Viola's, and once inside Andrew was struck with true wonder. The massive laboratory was filled with devices and electronics that could only belong on an alien ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing\" Andrew exclaimed as he stepped further into the room, unaware of the shadow that loomed over him. In mere second, Andrew went from enjoying the view of a magnificent laboratory to being stepped on by a massive 20-foot woman. Without notice, or warning, Dr. Viola casually entered Sierra's office and immediately stepped on Andrew who went down like an accordion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Viola first heard a squish sound, followed by a feeling of something being stuck to the bottom of her boot. At first she ignored it and kept walking forward until she heard a soft groan and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that my darling?\" Viola asked as he held up her left foot to reveal a disk shaped figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Viola\" Andrew muffled as he was peeled off the sole of Viola's foot and pulled back into his shape. \"How is my favorite boy toy doing today?\" Viola asked as she used both of her hands to pull Andrew apart like a rubber band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better\" Andrew lied as Viola continued to pull Andrew apart, but Viola eventually stopped and giggled as he watched Andrew snap back together and fall into her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy to hear that, i would hate to see my favorite toy get hurt\" Viola whispered as she pushed her breasts together, pushing Andrew closer to her lips and given a kiss. Two kiss in one day, how lucky can one guy be, Andrew asked himself as Viola pulled away from Andrew and place him on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why are you here today doctor?\" Andrew asked as he was placed on the floor and forced to arch his neck back to look up and see Viola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's here to monitor your vitals?\" Sierra exclaimed, as she suddenly appeared from behind a corner, holding a rather large device that reminded Andrew of a laser rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My vitals? Why dose she need to monitor my vitals?\" Andrew asked as Viola walked past Andrew and took a seat on a large reinforced stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your going to be lab assistant today. My last one vanished months ago and I've been looking for a new one ever since\" Sierra explained as she peered down the sight of her rifle, while adjusting a switch on the rifles side<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new one?\" Andrew repeated as he looked to Viola for answers. \"Sierra's last assistant was a mascot from another underdeveloped planet\" Viola explained as she pulled a large hand held device from her jumpsuit pocket and crossed her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened to him?\" Andrew asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her\" Sierra corrected \"And I don't know. I was testing my new device on her when she just suddenly disappeared\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What device?\" Andrew asked, his knee's begin to shake from fear of the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one\" Sierra replied, as she pulled the rifles trigger and struck Andrew with a bullet of light. Andrew felt a bright green beam of light envelope his skin. At first the beam felt warm and safe, but that feeling was suddenly replaced by a sudden urge of pain that followed with Andrew blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Andrew first blacked out he didn't know what happened, but as he gradually opened his eyes he began to recall that he was hit with a beam of light and now he felt different. So what happened to Andrew<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As Andrew stood up and looked around the room he instantly notice two things, one his clothes were bigger and two everything around was bigger too. Andrew took a moment to look at himself and came to the horrifying conclusion that he had shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what happened? Andrew stuttered as he took a long hard look at himself and saw that went from being a five foot man to a three foot man-child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen, was this supposed to happen?\" Andrew asked as he looked up to the two larger women that were standing over him. \"Hmmm...that's odd. This was supposed to make him grow not shrink\" Sierra mumbled as she looked at her rifle and wandered over to her workbench, while Andrew quickly trailed after her and quickly tripped in his oversized pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean it was supposed to make me grow? Sierra what happened to me?\" Andrew asked as he looked at the mad scientist backside. \"To put it simply this device was supposed to make you taller, or tall enough to properly mate with women of our species. But something obviously went wrong and you shrunk\" Sierra explained as he kept herself focused on her invention rather than Andrew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think!\" Andrew snapped as he finally freed himself from his clothes and stood before the two women in his birthday suit. \"What are you going to do about this? Can you reverse it?\" Andrew asked as he felt the thunderous footsteps of the Doctor approach from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't darling, re-engineering the ray gun is going to take sometime\" Dr. Viola explained as she stepped past Andrew and stood beside Sierra, glancing at her rifle and pile of papers on her bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much time?\" Andrew asked wishing more than anything to be back home living his normal life. \"Honestly, it could be anywhere between three days or a week\" Sierra said as she picked up what appeared to be a screwdriver and use it to readjust something on the rifle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three days?! How am I supposed to survive like this for three days?\" Andrew asked as the twenty foot doctor turned and looked down and the three foot mascot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling you have nothing to worry about, yes you are smaller than before, but your still as durable as ever. See\" without warning Dr. Viola picked up her massive left foot and proceeded to curve stomp Andrew into the floor, squashing him into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor that's enough, you've proven your point\" Sierra said as she quickly reached out and grabbed a few tiny parts that had begun to roll over her bench, due to Viola's massive pounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry Sierra, you know how much I love to squish my man\" Viola said cheerfully as she picked her foot up one last time to reveal and pulverized Andrew plastered to the floor. \"Oooow\" was the only word that escaped Andrew's mouth as he slowly regained his normal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that necessary?\" Andrew asked wondering how he was still alive. \"Obviously, but do you see what I mean, you're still alive\" Viola said cheerfully, wondering what other fun things she could do to the smaller man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your point, but I can't stay like this. Is there anything else you can do Sierra?\" Andrew asked as the ships scientist put down her tools and began to think of ways to help Andrew.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not entirely sure, but maybe we can just...stretch him out?\" Sierra suggested with small shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea!\" Viola shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Andrew asked as just as Viola took a step towards and Andrew and placed her massive foot on the edge of his toes. Andrew cried out in pain but before he could catch his breath, he felt a large meaty hand wrap around his waist and head and begin to pull him upward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hows this?\" Viola asked as she began to stretch out Andrew's lower body, his shouts of pain being muffled by Viola's massive palms. \"No, not like that, your just stretching out his legs. Here give him to me\" Sierra demanded as Viola took her foot of Andrew's toes and watched his lower half snap back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine, you try\" Viola said with touch of annoyance in her voice. Sierra took Andrew by his shoulders and looked the smaller man up down, remembering how much fun she had with him the other night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see here, lets try this\" Sierra mumbled as wrapped her left hand entirely around Andrew's squishy shoulders and her right hand around his squishy waist. Immediately, Sierra began to stretch out Andrew's torso pulling and stretching as hard as she possibly could, but the red skin Hippo was not as strong as her taller counterpart and noticed how resilient Andrew's body had become. Finally, Sierra gave up pulling on Andrew ans imply released his upper half and allowed her boy toy to snap back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that didn't work, maybe I'm not pulling hard enough\" Sierra suggested <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe he's just stuck like that\" Viola said, hoping her darling would stay this small.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ow! Ow! Please stop it. It's not working.\" Andrew protested before they would join forces and try to stretch him together. Resilient as he was, that torment left him aching all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Andrew. I'll get to work on fixing this predicament as soon as possible.\" Sierra proudly announced before diving back into working on her machine. \"I think I already know where it went wrong, but it will take me a while to fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three days, yeah... I'll have to just manage to last three days around here.\" Andrew snapped sarcastically. He'd gotten to know what these ladies were up to, and being half-size was the last thing he needed in those scenarios. The smile on Viola's face was as clear an indication as any that she was ready to make use of this little mishap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whilst you work, shall I take care of Andrew? I'd like to do a slightly more... internal examination to make sure there are no ill effects to the shrinking.\" Viola asked, but Sierra wasn't buying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure you'd like to have him internally examine you...\" She sighed wearily, before a sly grin popped onto her face. \"Fine, have your fun, but could you have him back here in an hour? I wouldn't mind a little... examination myself.\" The two towering anthro women giggled up a storm, making Andrew feel nervous. He understood loud an clear what was about to happen and he wasn't looking forward to it. Last time the elephant needed to squash him flat to mould him into a dildo. This time she had no need for such actions. Eagerly the pachyderm reached down and picked him up. Her large hand easily covered his torso and and further protestations were muffled when she hugged him tightly, wedging Andrew's head between her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was brought into a small side room in the science lab. In the distance he could hear Sierra tinkering, occasionally swearing at the malfunctioning device. Viola was quick to lower her pants, holding her toy human close. Andrew could feel the warmth radiating from her nethers, the familiar feminine scent surrounding him. The elephant only had an hour to play with him and she wasn't going to waste a second. She brought the squirming man close, his head pressed against slick lower lips. With his newfound stature he slipped inside perfectly. His body offered just the right kind of pleasurable resistance to her advances. Greedily her pussy demanded more, the elephant steadily inserting Andrew into herself. The walls were as wet, smelly and brimming with power as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola gasped as she felt his body get squeezed by her inner walls. She could feel every detail within her sensitive folds and more prominent than anything else was the distinct bulge between his legs. Andrew was fully erect, his mind addled by the powerful concentrated smell inside the elephant's pussy. He felt the slow rhythm of the doctor squeezing and relaxing. His body was her plaything, fully inserted into her narrow love tunnel. His new size was almost too small for the elephant, but Viola didn't seem to care. Her breath was getting shallow and her heartbeat rising. She gave her toy a few more playful squeezes, each bringing her closer to a climax for the ages. She imagined what it must feel like for Andrew. Her powerful inner walls pinning him down and compressing his body with a strength he'd never expect from her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slickened walls bore down on him with increasing strength. It felt like a weird full body massage, given to him by Viola's pussy. He was unable to track anymore what was going on outside, but judging by the increasing intensity of the squeezes she couldn't be far from her peak. His own throbbing manhood felt on the verge of release too. Suddenly the pressure increased tenfold and he could hear a moan from the outside. If Viola's moans were loud enough to be heard in there, it could only mean one thing. Andrew braced himself and moments later was hit by a flood of warm juices. The crushing grip released and he was carried out in a river of her release, his own orgasm lost in the flood. The elephant was panting loudly, sitting in a chair with her legs spread wide. Andrew had fallen to the floor, but the rush had numbed his senses so much he didn't even notice. Both of them didn't move, catching their breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor was the first to stir into action, standing up to get some towels. She cleaned herself up before tending to the weary slime-drenched human. Andrew was given a quick if rough clean up before Viola disposed of the mess on the floor. She straightened herself out and looked at the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, I think it's time to return you to Sierra.\" She mused, Andrew's head snapping over to the clock with an incredulous stare. She was kidding right? His eyes widened as he saw that the elephant was right. Over an hour had passed. It only felt like a few minutes, but he'd been marinating inside her pussy as her plaything for a little over an hour?! He could scarcely believe it but with a weary sigh accepted it. He shuddered to think how time could have passed so quickly. Maybe it was time to admit that he kind of liked it in there. He wasn't given another moment to think about it as Viola picked him up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope Sierra can sort out her device. I wouldn't mind seeing what you can do closer to my size. But I think we can both agree it wouldn't be so bad if you could be this small again sometime.\" She gave him a big wink, Andrew blushing brightly. They quickly returned to Sierra, who looked up from her work with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news, Andrew. I think I've already managed to isolate the issue. I may be able to fix it a little faster.\" He gave her an awkward smile in return. The hippo stared at the human, then the elephant. Viola failed to hide a small blush and it didn't take long for Sierra to puzzle things together. With a knowing smirk she added: \"And if I'm right, I might be able to use this ray to shrink you too. You know... intentionally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant smiled from ear to ear, eager to play more with a shrunken Andrew. But it was Sierra's day today and with a tinge of reluctance she handed over the human. The hippo held him close and spoke softly. \"Now I'm going to need your help to fix this machine. I need you to motivate me to get this process under control, and for that I want you to be my...\"</span></div></div>",

Besides, you had anticipated something a little more intimate, not that you were unhappy about remaining 3-d for a bit on this crazy ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your assistant?\" you asked in confusion, \"How can I...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra chuckles. \"No honey. Not my assistant, my ass-istant,\" she clarifies, sticking her hips out to the side to demonstrate her point. Your eyes popped open. Sierra's ass could deal some major damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed you gently in an incredibly oversized chair and took a small step back, settling you slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now baby, yesterday I was as gentle and giving as I could be because you had a stressful first day on our ship. I wanted you to be able to relax a bit. But today things are a little different. I've been stressing all day trying to get this machine back online for you...\" she trailed off for a moment. You wanted to protest, that the machine had caused you plenty of stress as well, but  Sierra didn't give you the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swung her hips around and let her huge as cast a shadow over your small body. She put her fingers in her waistband and pulled down her pants, revealing her enormous, bare ass. Using her hands, she parted her cheeks, revealing her cavernous crack to you. You swallowed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm wondering, how willing you are to be giving to me?\" she asked, backing up so her thighs touched the chair. Sierra looked down at you expectingly with a smile, putting her hand to your back and nudging you forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her in uncertainty.  Sierra had been gentle with you, but you weren't exactly eager to go diving into her ass. However, if you refuse, she could easily force you to her will anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She very gently lowered herself further, filling your view even more. You move your hands close to her asshole and try to pry it open. The wrinkled pucker is surprisingly yielding and soon you find yourself able to stare down the empty tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooh... did you practice this? You're doing great, Andrew.\" Sierra moaned, feeling the shrunken man slowly inserting his arms. She kept lowering herself until she felt your face push up against her hole. The hippo grit her teeth and showed off an impressive amount of control of her body. Right before your eyes the smelly hole opened wide and her ass sank down to engulf your head. Your feet were still on the seat of her chair and with some effort you push yourself up. The slickened walls easily embraced your torso, sucking you in. But this left you with nothing to push off from. The heavy asscheeks were too smooth to find any sort of purchase. You were lodged up to your waist in the hippo's hole, but this was as far as you'd be able to manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, human. Don't leave me hanging now. Deeper... please!\" She begged, but you were helplessly trapped. You tried to use your arms to pull yourself in deeper, but the tunnel was too narrow and far too slick to be of any help. You could hear the frustration in her voice and you try to call out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuck, I can't go any further.\" You yell out. But Sierra doesn't hear a word of it. You were pushed too far into her blubbery butt already. The hippo groans, disappointed in the human's performance. She'd hoped he would go in all by himself, but alas, he was so hopeless that she would need to assist him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel her hand brush along your legs before grabbing them both in a firm grip. The hippo was not about to take pity on your trapped position. She roughly plunged you in deeper until only your lower legs still stuck out. With two fingers on your feet she pushed the last of you up her ass, celebrating her victory with a powerful clench. The smelly walls of your prison came to life as they bore down on you from all sides. The tunnel felt a little cramped before, but now you could feel it squash you with such force that your body was moulding itself to fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better. Now I can get back to work. Make sure to keep wiggling, Andrew. Or I might just pull you a little deeper. Who knows, you might even run into my old assistant. Don't tell Viola this, but I know where he went. Right up this booty, never to be seen again. After the insults he hurled my way he deserved it. But you're not like him. You're so much sweeter.\" Her compliments felt hollow with you crammed in such a horrible position. Everything around you shook as she finally sat herself down fully in the large chair, rolling it up to the desk and getting to work on fixing the device. All the while she kept squishing you with the occasional heavy clench. You could tell it turned her on by the lewd moans that followed.</span></div></div>",

The ship had tipped and had knocked Sierra off her feet. The red skin hippo slowly lost her balance and began to rip backwards, and as she fell Andrew felt his stomach drop as he waited for the oncoming assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Sierra hit the chair she heard a squeak and was suddenly hit by a ting of quilt. she didn't mean to actually fall on Andrew, but the damage was done. She quickly got to her feet and turned around to look for her beloved man, but was shocked to see that he wasn't there. Sierra quickly looked around the room but suddenly remembered the last time she fully sat on someone. She quickly reached back around herself and felt Andrew plastered to her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra let out a sigh of relief as she peeled Andrew off her rump and held him in front of her face. Andrew looked like a crushed pancake and appeared to be in a daze. Andrew had thought he would have been used to being pulverized by the larger woman, but once again he was proven wrong as he felt his body ache with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ow\" Andrew whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Andrew, I am so sorry. I didn't mean to acutely sit on you, but don't worry I can fix this\" Sierra said as she held Andrew up her lips and began to re-inflate him like a toy balloon. Andrew could feel Sierra's soft lips on his own, but he could also feel her shoving air into his body. the rush of air filled Andrew out rather fast, but due to his new size Sierra had accidentally filled him up with more air than he need. As soon as Sierra had stopped Andrew was left looking like around beach ball bouncing on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra was still holding Andrew lips her hand palm. Her grip was like iron and Andrew was grateful she had not released him yet, but Sierra was dishearten by her last mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap I didn't mean to do that either\" she said as she scooped Andrew up into her arms and wrapped her arm around his round body. Slowly, Sierra began to squeeze Andrew, letting a slow stream of air flow of his lips as Sierra carefully let the air flow out of them. Andrew could feel Sierra's grip getting tighter and tighter around his fragile body and that's when he realized that he felt like an old Scottish bag-pipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Andrew was back to his normal shape and size, being held rather tightly in Sierra's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Sierra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little dizzy...but better\" Andrew answered as he was gently placed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness, I swear I didn't mean for that to happen. I promise I'll be gentle on our next day\"  Sierra said as a puzzled look appeared on Andrew's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next day?\" Andrew asked as he suddenly recalled his schedule from last night. Each day Andrew was meant to be with a different member of the crew. He spent his first night with Viola, his second with Jackie, and he spent his third day with Sierra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was he spending his fourth day with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It would do little to help him defend himself against the advances of the amazonian crew, but at least he could walk around the ship a little more easily. But before his perspective could return completely the growth stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Sierra exclaimed, visibly confused by this turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was supposed to grow you back to normal. Unless... have we been squashing you so much that this is what your body considers normal now? Unlikely. Let's see what happens if I...\" She trailed off, but it was clear Andrew was about to get hit with her size alteration device again. He braced himself and felt the glow envelop him. But this time nothing changed. He didn't gain or lose an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, Sierra?\" He asked, a little perturbed. The man had hoped to leave all these size-changing shenanigans behind him with the scientist, but now it looked like he would have to endure captain Barrah whilst only being about three feet tall. It sounded like a creative death sentence were it not for the fact that Andrew seemed functionally immortal thanks to their treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what's going on. I'm going to need more time to study this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab door slid open and in it stood the captain, eager for her turn with Andrew. \"Study what?\" She asked sternly before seeing their mascot's unfortunate predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any reason he's half-sized, Sierra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His physiology is proving to be tricky. It's messing with my equipment, as you can see. I should have this solved by tomorrow, but until then I'm afraid this is what you'll have to deal with.\" The scientist explained dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Barrah groans a little with disappointment before calling up a schedule on her wrist-mounted computer. She makes a few adjustments before speaking to her crewman. \"Right, I've swapped your next time with him and mine around as punishment. In the meantime, take what samples you need, he's coming with me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes captain...\" Sierra replied dejectedly. The scientist grabbed a few small beakers and handed Andrew one. \"Spit in it, please.\" She demanded. Seeing the grouchy captain tapping her foot and waiting for him made the man comply extra fast. With some help from the scientist he gave various samples until only one was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last thing I need now is a semen sample.\" Sierra's voice became a little lustful near the end of the sentence. The man gulped as she stepped closer, eager to 'extract' the fluids she needed. But before she could get on with it, she looked up to the captain. Suddenly an idea sprang to mind. It wasn't much, but maybe it could placate Barrah a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, would you like to handle this extraction or shall I?\"</span></div></div>",

Just do what you want and get it over with, I would like some alone time withe the toy\" The Captain said with an irradiated tone that made Andrew feel slightly bad. Did he do something wrong? Andrew was about to ask his question when suddenly, Sierra reached out to grabbed Andrew's arm and began to pull him towards the back room where Sierra would took naps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Captain, Ill make this quick\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra dragged Andrew like he was the play thing he was and stopped in front of a makeshift bed covered in strange device and scattered papers. \"Sorry about the mess Andrew, sometimes my work keeps me here and i just forget to clean up\" the red skin hippo said as she began to take off her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew watched as Sierra begin to take off her clothes and he immediately felt aroused. She started with her lab coat and then her overly tight body suit, once the body suit fell off her shoulders Sierra stood in front of her boy toy in black lingerie so tight that Andrew thought he thought they would soon nap off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" was the only word Andrew got out before Sierra tackled Andrew into the bed, knocking the wind out his fragile 3-foot body. Once contact had been fully made, Andrew already knew he was had been fully flatten by the blond hair scientist and could feel her grind her entire body into his. In the darkness Andrew felt his body fully deflate and become 2-D and felt the doctor pick herself off of him. She looked down at her pancake and immediately felt herself shiver from pleasure and excitment \"I don't think ill ever get tired of that\" she whispered to Andrew as she stood up and began to turn her butt towards him,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew felt immense fear and joy as he watched Sierra turn her butt towards him, the sheer size of it was amazing but he could sense he was about to feel its full weight Andrew was right, in the blink of an eye, Sierra dropped her massive ass on top of Andrew and furthered his flattening and pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to give me a sample Andrew?\" Sierra asked as she slowly parted her massive legs revealing Andrew's feet. Sierra thought she had positioned herself over Andrew's chest instead of his entire body. Oh well, she thought as she reached down and began pulling on Andrew's two legs, stretching them out until his waist appeared beneath Sierra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Andrew's crotch insight, Sierra quickly reached down and began to unzip the smaller man's pants until she could see his member. Unfortunately, Andrew's member had been flatten out, just like the rest of him, but that didn't stop Sierra from getting what she need. Thinking quickly, Sierra began to grind her massive butt further into Andrew's face and then she would pick herself up and then drop down onto Andrew over and over again until her dick was fully erected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra had to smash and smother Andrew a couple times until his penis was fully inflated, but once it was, she gripped it as gently as she possibly could and began to play with it. Over and over again Sierra pulled and played with Andrew's member until she got what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Sierra capped her required sample and placed on the counter next to her bed. She quickly stood up and turned around to see her pulverized boy-toy and his elongated waist and legs. Sierra almost felt bad for what she did to Andrew, but then she reminder herself how much she loved it and didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all done Captain\" Sierra said as she pulled Andrew off her makeshift bed and began to roll him up like a map or piece of paper. Andrew spoke out in retaliation to his treatment, but his mouth and face were quickly silenced once he was tightly bound in the scientist hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra approached the Captain and held out the ships mascot over to the Captain. \"Is he alright?\" Barrah asked as she reached out and took the rolled up man out of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess not, keep working on that machine Sierra, we need our mascot to be back to normal before we reach home-world\" the Captain said as she walked towards the door, clenching her fist a few times to pulverize Andrew's paper form a few times.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip back to her quarters was an uneventful journey for Barrah. She walked with a purpose, like a soldier, and Andrew could feel it. Even in his rolled up form he knew that Barrah was both stern and composed, it was those feaures that frighten him to his core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other amazons, while tall and rough, had a playful side to there nature. Andrew enjoyed that about all of them, but he felt that Barrah was going to be something entirely different. Andrew wasn't sure how long they had been walking, but he knew his trip had end when he heard a door slide open and suddenly close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door closed, Andrew felt himself being unrolled and flapped out like a towel. Normally that would have re-inflated his body, but for some reason he was still flat. \"Dammit\" Barrah said as she turned Andrew around, holding him up to her face by his shoulders \"I've gotta do this the hard way\" Barrah said as she wrapped her fist around Andrew's mouth and place her lips over his and began to re-inflate him. The air being pushed into Andrew's body slowly inflated him but instead of being pumped into the size of a peach ball, Captain Barrah stopped when he was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" She asked as she placed Andrew's legs on the floor, forcing him to look up at her 12-foot stature. \"ye-yes...I-I mean yes Captain, ma;am!\" Andrew said with a salut. Barrah looked down at her mascot and simply scoffed and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save for the others boy-toy and go take a seat on the couch\" Barrah commanded as she walked over to her own personalized bar.Andrew did was he was told and made his way over to a couch that reminded Andrew of the doctors. As soon as Andrew sat down he began to look around the Captain quarters. There was nothing amazing about it, it looked like all the other rooms, but one thing did stick out to Andrew and it was hanging across the room by the Captain's Barrah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pictured frame filled with half a dozen metals. \"Are those yours...captain...ma'am\" Andrew said softly wondering if his question would set her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep...got them fighting the war along with this\" The Captain said as she turned around and pointed the scar on her face. \"Sorry for bring it up...m'am\" Andrew said with a touch of quilt in his voice. \"Don't be, it was one of my finest moments in history\" Barrah said as she stood in front of Andrew and began to pour herself a glass a some green liquid \"And stop with the ma'am's. Were off duty\" she said as she walked over to Andrew. The small man thought the captain was going to sit him like Dr. Viola did on his first night, but the Captain did something unexpected and took a seat beside Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew glanced at the Captain beside him and took in her sight as if he was looking at her for the very first time. She was a 12-foot amazon with rose colored hair, eyes as green as emeralds. Her body was voluptuous and thick, breasts the size of over-inflated beach balls and ass that so big that it reminded Andrew of Sierra's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong? You've been starting at me for while\" Barrah asked as she sipped her drink. \"No ma-I mean no, I was just thinking that you are very beautiful\" Andrew said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain chuckled \"Well thank you, my last mate thought differently\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mate?\" Andrew stated while Barrah rolled her eyes, wondering how slow this man was. \"Mate...its similar to what your kind call as husband\" Barrah explained as Andrew gave her one of those Oh looks and quickly averted his eyes from the captain. Barrah studied Andrew for a moment, he was a 3-foot man from another planet and there seemed to be nothing special about him, but for some reason he found her and everyone else on his ship attractive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think im attractive?\" Barrah asked as she set down her drink, turning herself more towards Andrew, putting her right arm on the back of her couch. \"Well...back on my planet I'm what you would call a FA, a-a fat admirer\" Andrew stuttered hoping he didn't offend the captain. \"So you like bigger women, is that it?\" she asked as she inched closer to Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am\" Andrew said as he watched the captain move closer to him and began to slide her suit off her shoulders. \"I guess that's good\" she said as she leaned close to Andrew's ear and whispered \"I love small men...especially ones I can play with\" Barrah said as she leaned in fast and began to kiss the three foot man. Andrew was shocked by the sudden movement but he found himself enjoying the captains soft lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as there lips parted, Barrah immediately stood up and continued to take off her suit while walking to her closet. \"Stay right there...I'll be right back\" Barrah said as she vanished behind a door. After a few minutes of waiting Andrew heard the door to the closet open and he watched <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The amazonian hippo woman had already taken off some clothes walking to the closet, but now she was wearing practically nothing! Only a thin black thong stopped her from being completely naked like him, but it left little to the imagination. Her breasts were held in a similar situation. A delicate black bra covered them, but the fabric was so thin he could practically see through it. What got his most immediate attention though, was what she was holding in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This here's the 'captain's orders'.\" Barrah said with a playful grin. She showed it off to her mascot proudly. It was a floppy dildo that would put any animal on Earth to shame save for maybe an elephant or a whale. It was longer that Andrew's whole body and fitted with a handle like a baseball bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have a lot of fun, but I want you to listen and obey my every word. If not I'll have to give you the captain's orders...\" She said, her voice getting heavy with desire. \"... by pushing them so far up your ass they'll come out on the other side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew gulped, worried by what the captain had in mind for him. She didn't leave him any time to ponder, clearing her throat and giving him his first command. \"Alright mascot, listen closely. Lay yourself down on the couch, I'm coming in for a landing.\" She said, walking closer to him and leaving the fearsome looking 'captain's orders' propped against a cabinet. Not wanting to risk being more intimately introduced to that thick mass he quickly did as ordered and laid down on his back. He turned himself to meet Barrah as she got on all fours onto the couch. It quickly became clear what she meant with coming in for a landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarrah let herself slump forward, her vast chest looming over the little man like two glistening meteors. They crashed down around his gut, smothering most of his body and squashing it relentlessly beneath their immense weight. The hippo cooed a little as she felt her boy-toy moulding to fit underneath her. But her main interest was his cute little head poking out from between her smothering breasts. She grabbed it with both hands and planted a large, sloppy kiss right on his face. Andrew squirmed and struggled, but the captain barely noticed, slathering him in more drool as her inquisitive tongue tried to find a way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even have to order him to open up, her thick tongue finally hitting its mark and pushing past his lips. Finally he seemed to give up and just let her have her way with him. Barrah would exploit this to the fullest, exploring every millimeter of the inside of his mouth. Were it not so utterly overwhelming, Andrew might even have a chance to enjoy this spectacular kiss. With every regard for modesty thrown out the airlock Barrah hoists herself up. She let out an amused giggle at the flattened man pressed into her couch, his head shimmering with a thick coat of drool.</span></div></div>",

The rush of being inflated was a familiar sensation for Andrew, as he had been treated like this before by members of the crew, but unlike the others Barrah was taking her time. She would inflate Andrew and than stop to let the air rush out of him, but then she would begin kissing him again. Barrah continued this process over and over again until she finally stopped and held a slightly inflated Andrew in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe studied Andrew closely. She held up side down, studying his lengthy, and then she would grip his hands and feet and began pulling him apart testing his elasticity. \"What are you doing?\" Andrew asked as Barrah wrapped her hand around his neck and began pulling it away from his body, making his voice squeak and eyes buldge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like how short you are... i want you to be...bigger\" Barrah explained as she released Andrew's head and allowed it to snap back into place. \"Well I'm sorry about that, but Seirra said she couldn't do anything about it until later\" Andrew said wondering why his neck suddenly felt better after being yanked away from his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say i wanted you taller, i want you bigger...or rather wider\" She said mischievously as she carried Andrew over to the corner of the room and tied his hand to a handle that seemed out of place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by wider?\" Andrew asked as he felt the commander begin pulling his other arm to the other side of the room, where she tied his other hand to a second out of place handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see\" Barrah said as finished tying Andrew's arm into a knot, his body going tout over the strain of being pulled so far. \"I swear you'll enjoy this\" Barrah promised as she approached Andrew's middle half and began to kiss him again, exploring every inch of his mouth until Andrew was lost in oblivion \"Wh-what ever you say captain\" Andrew groaned wishing she hadn't stopped. \"Alright then, get ready...i did this to my last mate and I really enjoyed it\" Barrah said as she began to pull Andrew left leg towards the corner of the room tying Andrew's foot to another handle, putting a greater strain on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barrah this is tarting to hurt\" Andrew groaned as he felt his right leg being pulled to the last corner of the room, realizing that his body was turning into a thin sheet of paper. After tying last free limp to the corner of the room, Barrah rolled onto Andrew's paper thin body and began to jump, using the boy's elastic, paper thin frame, like a trampoline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrewed groaned with each jump and landing, his thin paper body caving in deeper with each landing. Barrah smiled and giggled as she bounced, enjoying the sight of her new toys pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barrah...please...stop\" Andrew gasped with each new bounce. \"Why?\" she asked \"Aren't you having fun?\" Barrah ignored Andrew response by jumping near his paper thin face and landing right ontop of it, smothering it in her wide thick ass. Andrew thought Barrah would start jumping on his face, but Barrah had stopped and was just sitting on top of him, grinding her butt into his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barrah, what are you thinking?\" Andrew asked praying to god his suffering would end and he could just go back to kissing her.</span></div></div>",

Mere seconds later a loud thwack rang across the room as one of the knots she tied failed. She wasn't too surprised, no amount of expert knotwork would last long once she threw her weight into it. Instead she kept grinding her vast ass on top of the stretched man below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barrah... pl~\" Andrew's plea was cut off when she buried it completely under a mountain of assflesh. She let out a delighted murr when all that was left of his words was muffled into silence. With another sharp snap his second limb came free. As much as he hoped this would end his stretched torment, the immense weight crushing him flat kept his body nearly two-dimensional. He'd been squashed thin as a sheet before, but against all odds it felt like this time he was spread even thinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she enjoyed her seat the captain thought up a new game to play. She gave his remaining taut limbs a quick pull, making Andrew yelp in surprise and pain from underneath her. It undid the knots and now she had a sheet of him under her with four stretchy limbs slowly regaining their normal shape. But before they could she took and arm and a leg and pulled hard. The little man's protests were amusing, but she was on a mission. She pulled the elastic arm and leg around her thick thigh and tied them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... hold... still.\" She mumbled to herself as she repeated the process with his other arm and leg. Andrew kept squirming, increasingly disoriented. But when the enormous hippo woman was done she stood up. He had hoped that would be the end of it for now. A moment's reprieve before her next overwhelming act. But when her hefty rear left the ground he went up with it. At first he thought he was stuck because her sweaty buttocks had pressed down on him so hard he was clinging to them. But as he realized what she'd done to his limbs it dawned on the man that this was as intended. She'd squashed him thin as fabric and used his limbs as straps to keep him in place. She'd turned him into a crude thong. He tried to protest, but his pleas went unheard. The only reaction was a slight moan when he yelled out. She was loving this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm... When we get home I'll advice the Council to immediately take over your planet. No human will have to work another day in their life under our care. Unless you count being brought across the galaxy and sold as toys as work of course.\" She laughed at the muffled outrage being expressed by her new thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so dramatic, you'll all be pampered until the end of your days. Aren't you having fun?\" She asked sarcastically, ignoring Andrew's protests. She burst into a short victory dance, her asscheeks wobbling wildly, barely constrained by her stretchy human thong.</span></div></div>",

He felt like he was standing in a storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his time, Andrew wished every inch of his body. It felt good to be able to clean himself and have some privacy, but that moment of privacy came to an abrupt halt when Andrew heard the door to the doctors room open followed by thunders footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrew darling, are you in here?\" Viola asked as she searched her quarters until she heard the running water and stepped in the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew watched the massive anthro woman enter her bathroom and look down at Andrew in his birthday suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we have fun with Jackie today?\" Viola asked as she watched Andrew attempt to cove his privates with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye-yes\" Andrew stuttered as he watched a lustful look twinkle in Viola's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I know how rough that woman can be. She can be a real freak in bed\" Viola said as watched Andrew's cheeks flush from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an understatement\" Andrew mumbled as he turned his back on Viola and continued to rinse off his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? Never-mind, I've come to get you. The commander wants to see you right\" Andrew felt a chill run down his spine at the mention of the commander. That 12-foot hippo made Andrew very nervous for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm about done\" Andrew said when he suddenly felt Viola reach down and grab him by his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said now, sorry Andrew but you don't want to keep the Commander waiting\" Viola said as she proceeded to twist Andrew like a wet rag. Andrew squeaked as Viola wringed him dry. After his intense dry, Viola proceeded to dress Andrew like a doll and quickly carried him to the bridge of the ship. What did the Commander want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As mascot, just about everyone on the ship outranks you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor licks her lips and lifts you easily with one hand around your chest. She doesn't say a word as she brings your small body around to her back and pulls out the spandex waistband of her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Dr. Viola, I thought I'd be helping you in the lab with science?!\" you shout in protest and confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout moving you or releasing her waistband, Viola responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you will be dear,\" she says with a chuckle. \"You'll be a great help to me in my...ah...scientific pursuits here in the lab.

Right now, I just need your assistance somewhere a little more outside of the box,\" she says happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can protest further, Viola releases her hold on you and sends your body plummeting toward her cavernous ass. At nearly 30 feet tall and an elephant to boot, there is plenty of ass available to catch you. Your screams don't echo, as her fleshy backside swallows up the sound just as it's preparing to swallow up your body. You observe two things very quickly as you fall. First, Viola's ass is round, firm, and large. Second, she seems to not be wearing anything beneath her uniform. You swallow hard as you prepare for an awkward landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bounce against her soft flesh and then against the firm spandex to your back before being shoved back against the alien anthro's rump. With a happy moan, the elephant releases her waistband. The spandex immediately slams into her ass, pushing you deep into the soft skin at your front. The doctor smiles as she looks in a mirror and admires the human shaped lump that's visible beneath her uniform.</span></div></div>",

The Weapons Officer responds affirmatively and smiles at you wickedly. You swallowed hard, already intimidated by this monstrous hippo woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs noted, Jackie is 14 feet tall. She has long red hair that is tied back in a ponytail. She has large bright green eyes. Of all of the anthros, she has the smallest face, giving her the most human-like facial structure. In fact, from a distance one could almost confuse her for a very large human female. But up close, there was no doubt that she had a lot of hippo to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all the women, she was large. But as noted, her curves and thickness bellied a massive muscle structure all over her body. Her thighs were wide and hard. Her ass, while massive, stood out like a shelf. There was almost no bounce to it unless she intended there to be. Her breasts would be comparable to a large C-cup on a normal sized woman. Even when standing in a relaxed posture, you could see the cuts of her muscles cutting through her fat when you focused on her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie grabs you as if you were a sack of potatoes. \u201cC\u2019mon little guy, let\u2019s hit the gym\u201d she commands, carrying you roughly. After a short walk, she releases you and you collapse to the floor of what looks like a large training room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie looks (way) down at you and smiles. \u201cThe evaluation consists of two parts.\u201d She instructs. \u201cAttack and defense. How you do will go a long way to moving you out of the position of Mascot.\u201d She laughs. \u201cOr officially moving you to \u2018Toy\u2019\u201d. She smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to your feet. Jackie instructs you that she\u2019ll be evaluating your attacking skills first. She tells you that she will not be utilizing any offensive maneuvers, and will strictly be playing defense. She then gives you the sign to begin. You nod your understanding, but just look up at her, unsure of how to begin to attack this 14 foot tall, muscular, hippo woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie begins to look impatient as you decide on a course of action, so you throw caution to the wind and charge. You swing your firsts full force at Jackie, making impact with her stomach and legs, but hardly even make an impact. You decide you need a softer target. You look up and realize that her eyes are an ideal target. If only they weren\u2019t 14 feet in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you have to move quickly and swing around to her back. You reach as high as you can and manage to grasp the waistband of her thong. You pull yourself up and start to climb when suddenly you feel yourself flying through the air and land on your back with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Jackie and she simply smiles at you. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t expect it to be that easy would you?\u201d she asks smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your mind clear and try to identify one more plan of attack. You slowly circle around the huge hippo woman and smile as you approach her from behind. You sprint at her and leap into the air in an attempt to kick out her leg from behind. But with a shocking display of athleticism, Jackie leaps straight up in the air and leaves you flying past, grasping at air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly make your way back to your feet, completely stumped as to how you\u2019re going to make any kind of an impact against this massive hippo woman. Your thoughts are interrupted by Jackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Andrew, I think I have enough information to make my evaluation now.\u201d She began, walking toward you. \u201cYour attacks were pretty predictable and poorly executed, but you showed a strong spirit and effort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point she was standing just a foot away from you. \u201cLet\u2019s test your defense. I\u2019ll be on the attack and you\u2019ll have to defend yourself. Similarly, you only have to focus on defending yourself. Don\u2019t worry about attacking me at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up, and were once again dwarfed the 14 foot anthro. You swallowed hard as you had no idea how you could begin to defend yourself against her. The question was, how serious was she going to take your sparring session?</span></div></div>",

You're not really sure what type of menacing offensive maneuver to expect from an anthro woman who could swat you like a fly. You tried to prepare yourself for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns around, the offensive attack Jackie decided upon was...sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot abruptly...not a hip drop...not a forceful squash attempt. She simply turned and casually sat as if there were no one else in the room and she was taking a rest on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something you weren't prepared for. You were so curious by her casualness that you couldn't get your body to respond quickly enough by the time you realized that you were directly in her path! Before you could move, you were directly beneath her massive ass, being squashed to the floor by nearly 2 tons of hippo flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled silently and shifted her rear over your quickly flattening body. She sighed contently, with the familiar knowledge that she had her foe defeated. This might have been a record for ease of victory, she thought to herself. It would be a record for speed too if it weren't for numerous insects she swatted with more tenacity than she had sat. Truthfully, she wasn't sure if it would work, but after the pathetic offensive display the human had shown her, she thought it was worth a try. She was glad she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie decided to have a little fun with her defeated opponent and bounced in her seat a few times, ensuring that Andrew was reduced to nothing but a paper thin form beneath her ample ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to do much better than that Andrew. I'm afraid that this might move you even lower than 'Toy' status. You seem better suited as a cushion!\" she laughs to herself as she lectures you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jackie stands and turns, excited to see the result of her victory. She's surprised that the floor is as bare as it was when she entered the room. She looked around, but the human was nowhere in sight. She was sure she had gotten him. Then she craned her neck to look over her shoulder and was able to see the top of his flattened head stuck to the top of one of her ass cheeks. Jackie bent over with laughter. She had to sit again just to compose herself, flattening Andrew all over again. Although he couldn't get much flatter than he already was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thinks to herself for a few minutes. Should she give him another chance? Surely he could do better than this performance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she decide?</span></div></div>",

Her full weight has been pressing down on your much smaller frame for some time, but Jackie knew the treatment would keep you alive. She decided to give you a second chance to prove your defensive capabilities. Surely, Jackie thought to herself, the human was able to do more than stand still and get flattened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving made her decision, Jackie rose to her feet and with a little difficulty peeled your flat body off of her massive rump. She casually released you and let your body restore itself to a 3-D version. She quietly marveled at how quickly you had recovered. After such a squashing, she expected it would take several minutes, but you reformed almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrew,\u201d Jackie begins, looking down at you over her huge breasts, \u201cThat was pathetic. You didn\u2019t even attempt to defend yourself. It was as if you wanted to be crushed by my ass.\u201d She says, cracking a smile. She turns, shoving her huge ass in your face and caressing it with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I\u2019d blame you of course, but we will have lots of time for you to get acquainted later.\u201d She says with a giggle as you shudder. \u201cFor now though, I\u2019m going to give you another shot at proving yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. The last thing you want is to spend your life on this ship as a cushion! You prepare yourself to react as Jackie turns to face you again. She gives you a small nod, showing that she\u2019s ready. You wait to see her attack. You can\u2019t see much of her face beyond her round belly and full breasts, but you\u2019d swear she had a smirk on her face as she planned her first move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you see her massive body start to fall toward you. Jackie has her arms out to her sides and is essentially free falling into a belly flop toward you! Your mind flashes back to the view you had of her ass cascading on top of your body at roughly this same speed and for a few moments, your feet are frozen in fear and indecision. You finally manage to tear your feet off the ground and turn to run away, but her 14 foot frame means you need to cover a lot of ground to reach safety and your hesitation cost you dearly. You felt her large, firm stomach hit you in the back of your head and roughly force you to the mat. The rest of her followed immediately. Very quickly you once again found yourself flattened beneath this massive hippo anthro woman. The pain you felt was immense, matching the crushing weight you were under, but thanks to the treatment you were surviving. You hadn\u2019t yet decided if you were thankful for that or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie simply sighs in disappointment yet again. She rests for a few moments, ensuring that Andrew receives proper punishment for his failure, and decides to make the most of a bad situation. She lifts herself up on her forearms, giving you a brief reprieve and you begin to reform in this short window. But it doesn\u2019t last long. She simply scoots back slightly and drops once again. This time, ensuring that you are directly beneath her huge tits. Each one would make a crater large enough for you to lounge in if the floor had been soft enough. Unfortunately for you, the mat in this gym was not that forgiving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie shifts and shimmies, grinding her breasts all over your much smaller body. Then, as if driving her point home, she lifts herself again and lets herself flop back down on your defenseless body, crushing you flat a final time. </span></div></div>",

Poor Andrew was flatten across her stomach and was experience a great deal of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrew if your not going to take this seriously than neither shall I\" Jackie proclaimed as she peeled young Andrew off her belly, like an old sticker, and grasped the young man boy his legs and head and proceeded in stretching him out like a rubber band. In a matter of seconds Andrew was morpahed into a long skinny rope that Jackie began to use as a jump rope. Andrew was being spoon and twirled around by the massive hippo, and was vastly impressed by her endurance as she continued to toy with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long while, Jackie decided to stop and finally release Andrew, an action that lead to his body being snapped back into shape and form. Andrew groaned as his body returned to its normal form, but his brief moment of relief was short lived as Jackie decided to grip Andrew around his waist and hoist him into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing now?\" Andrew squeaked as Hackie tighten her grip around Andrews small frame, nearly making his eyes bulg out his skull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time food combat practice, and I need a sparring partner\" she said with an evil grin. With Andrew in her grip, Jackie approached a wall with a series of buttons and quickly pushed a small green one that was labeled 'Octagon' and in a flash a large eight sided ring appeared in the center of the room and Andrew found himself being tossed into like an old football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoung Andrew landed in the center of the ring and found himself struggling to stand up, but he found his footing and felt a twinge of fear run down his spin as he watched the fiery red head leap into the ring and land only a few feet from him. The ground shuck from such force that Andrew lost his footing and feel flat in his ass. Jackie smiled at her victim and quickly lunged at him yelling \"Here I come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew could hear the hippos battle cry as he landed in his back and he could see the looming shadow appearing over him, but he was too weak and slow to avoid the massive woman. Rather than jump on and body slam Andrew Jackie thought it would be better to plant her foot firmly in the center of his chest, but Jackie foot was larger than Andrew and she merely ended up crushing Andrew beneath her entire foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie picked up her right leg and looked down at where Andrew was supposed to be, but was surprised to see that he wasn't there, and when she looked beneath her boot she saw the remains a oval shaped boy. Jackie laughed at the coin shaped Andrew and swiftly peeled him and ft her boot like a piece of gum and dropped him to the floor. Again, Andrew found his body returning to its old shape but it didn't take long for Jackie to pick Andrew up and begin stretching him like a rubber band again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrew did you know I have a talent for making balloon figures?\" Jackie asked as she pulled harder and harder in Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a well known talent among those on the commander ship, but beside that, what is your favorite earth based animal? Mine is a  giraffe\" Jackie explained as she finished pulling in Andrew and held his little head up to her lips and began inflating Andrew into a long skinny ballon. Once inflated, Jackie took hold of Andrew and began twisting and turning the poor boy until he looked just like the king neck creatures on his home planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her work Jackie decided to release Andrew from his torment and allowed him to deflate, a process that ended up sending Andrew soring across the room until he landed on Jackies arms fully deflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that was a terrific work out\" she said with a pleased loom on her face, leading Andrew to believe his time of torment was finally over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time  to hit the showers\" Jackie said as she flung Andrew over her shoulder and began carrying him into the back room, where Andrew found himself being hung up on a hook and left to hang while Miss Jackie began to strip down to her birthday suit. Ince naked Jackie walked past Andrew and gave him wink whispering \"Ill be right back\" and after that she was gone and Andrew could hear the hippo turn in the shower and begin cleaning herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed and Andrew was unable to reform himself and was left to hang on the hook, but it didn't Jackie very long to clean herself and step out of the shower. The massive hippo reached for Andrew and swiftly yanked him off the hook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew suddenly found himself being used as Jackies towel. He was used to dry every corner of the hippo until he was sipping yet, but that moment didn't last as Jackie proceeds to wring Andrew out like an old rag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not dry\" Jackie said as she finished wringing out the poor boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for a quick dry then\" Jackie proclaimed as she took Andrew over to the shower rooms Dryer and quickly tossed the boy in and closed the door behind him, unaware of the fact that there clothes already inside the Dryer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half-Hour should do it\" Jackie mumbled as she turned the timer and pushed the button to activate the machine. Andrew could feel the inside growing very hot while his body was being spun in a violent circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in a minute and once your dry I'll take you to the commander to give her my report. See you soon cutie\" Jackie said as she walked away leaving poor Andrew to his fate.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With little choice, Andrew had to remain in place beneath layers of massive clothes, and wait for Jackies return, but the sudden tremble coming from outside the Dryer told Andrew that someone was standing just outside the Dyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew heard the door snap open and could someone's massive hand reach into the Dyer and pull out all the clothes. The motion of moving continued to mix Andrew into the massive pile of clothes, until he was buried in a large basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be all it\" a gentle voice said as Andrew recqonized the voice as Dr, Voila. Eager to be free of his prison and current shape, Andrew decides to call out for the doctor without warning.

The doctor cursed and swore about Jackie while poor Andrew was being crushed into a wrinkled ball of himself. In the s end Viola realized what she still has you in her hand and quickly released you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, I'm so sorry Andrew I can fix this\" Dr. Biola exclaimed as she unfolded your paper thin body and carries you over to a massive sized ironing press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor flipped on the switch to activate the machine and as its warm metal surface descended upon Andrew, she could hear the paper thin boy call out and say \"Wait n-\" but Andrew was to late and Viola didn't have a chance to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMere seconds later, Doctor Viola lifted the giant metal sheet and revealed and even thinner Andrew, who was now fully unrinkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's slightly better\" Viola mumbled as she peeled the loot human off the hot iron and patiently waited for Andrew to reform himself, but the process was slow and Viola didn't have time to wait, so she held the smaller human up to her lips and gently re inflated the boy until he was back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" Viola asked sweetly as she gently placed Andrew back on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much\" Andrew replied happy to be back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now lets see what the damage is to my clothes\" Viola said with a hint of anger in her voice. Andrew slowly approached the basket of clothes Viola had set on the ground and was shocked at how large each piece of clothing appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was a hundred times bigger and taller than Andrew and each piece of clothing belonged to the doctor. With a quick swipe of her hand, Viola reached down a picked out the largest bra Andrew had ever seen in his life, and then he watched the massive elephant woman rip off her shirt and attempt to squeeze into her sports bra. The fabrics stretched as she attempted to squeeze her massive melons inside them. At first appeared the bra would fit but then the fabric began to wrap and shred until the back match finally snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit Jackie!\" Dr. Viola shouted as she stomped her foot, shaking the floor and knocking Andrew on his rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She always finds away to ruin my clothes\" the 20 foot elephant appeared both angry and sad and Andrew couldn't help but ask if there was anything he could do to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not, I'll just have to go bra less until we return to home world...unless\" a thought appeared in the doctors mind as she looked down at Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still wanna help?\" She asked and with a simile on his face Andrew nodded. The moment of peace that fell upon Andrew vanished when he felt the Doctors massive rear end descend upon him and flatten him like Jackie did before her. Andrew felt the massive woman bounce up and down upon him, making sure he was flat enough, before she stood up and peel him off the floor. Andrew was in pain again but the pain only got worse when he felt Viola begin stretching him out to fit over her massive boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Andrew but I desperately need something to support my boobs\" Viola explained as she stretched Andrews arms and legs around her back and began tying them in a knot. Satisfied with her make shift bra, Viola decided to relax her and allow her boons to fall. The weight of each breast had put on a strain on Andrews poor body but Viola was pleased to see that his elastic body was fully capable of holding her girls up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much Andrew, and don't worry this isn't an all day thing\" Viola reassured Andrew as she gracefully walked out the shower room, with her hips pooping and boobs bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter met minutes of being Dr. Violas bra, Andrew couldn't help but enjoy how close he was with the massive alien doctor. Sure he boons were heavy but they were soft and as smooth as he imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good doctor had to quickly reports to the besiege and inform the commander of hers and yours current situation. The commander chuckled at the news of you being bra and decided to wait until they arrived on home world to assign you to your true position on her ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the day carried on as it normally did for the Anthor Crew, and before Andrew knew it the day was over and he was relieaved of his duties as the doctors make shift bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor let out a sigh of relief as she unbound Andrews arms and legs and leg him fall on to her bed. Andrew took a gasp of air as soon as he was freed and was shocked to find himself reforming on the doctors bed. Andrew did a quick survey of the room and was shocked at how large everything was compared to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" was the only word that came to Andrews mind when he saw the room and when he turned too look up at Viola all he could do was stare in awe as she began to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola was an elephant to be sure but everything below the. Eco appeared human. Viola caught Andrew staring at her naked and smiled and asked.</span></div></div>",

The time be shared with Barrah was intense, sexual, and down right painful. With each glorious hump Barrah would flatten Andrew until he was pasted to the bed sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point Barrah had to stop and two flayed Andrew, but that did t stop the night commander from claiming Andrew again and again until she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sad to have there pleasure end Andrew was also relieved,  once again believing he would finally catch a break and rest, but the universe is a cruel mistress. Unlike the other members onbord the ship, Andrews bed was not as large and lacked the proper conditions to both bed and hold Barrah and himself. Luckily, Andrew was now a squishy play thing that could easily share a bed with a 12 foot hippo and her colossal ass. It was during the middle of the night that Barrah decided to reposition herself and roll over to the other side of the bed, but as she rolled she accidentally rolled over Andrew stinking the boy toy to her naked ass like a tatto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew spent the next few hours beneath Barrahs, unable to move, but when an alarms went off Andrew felt Barrah stir and begin to get up. In a sudden rush of movement Barrah was awake and on her feet, she yawned and groaned before reaching around and pulling Andrew off her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a thin piece of paper, Andrew hung in Barrahs larger grip awaiting his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning handsome\" she said as she gave th small boy a kiss.

Once again Andrew was unable to move and now he could barely speak. His muffled objections were to low to hear and were only being ignored as Barrah carried him to a unknown location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are big man\" Barrah said as she unfolded Andrew and hung on a hook by a massive shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it? It's my own personal bathroom. A nice place to get myself nice and clean for today, but it seems I'm all out of wash rags...good thing I have you to help clean me, right big man? Barrah said seductively as she turned in her shower while stepping in with Andrew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agonizing pain and joy Andrew had felt last night had returned once again as he found himself being used as a glorified rag for the commander. Andrew was soaped up and used to wash every inch of the Commanders body, even her more sensitive areas, and once done, Barrah stepped out of her shower and began to wring poor Andrew over the drain. All the water and soap that acclimated during the shower poured out of Andrews twisted body. Once properly squeezed and wringed dry Andrew found himself being tossed over to Barrahs larger bed and forced to watch his commander change into her morning uniform. Andrew watched with delight as Barrah changed but he became greatly considered when he noticed that Barrah was starting to ignore him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barrah aren't you going to help me?\" Andrew asked as Barrah suddenly approached him. She stopped at the edge of the bed and immediately turned around and blooped down on Andrew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Commander too you\" she said as she zipped up her combat boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't have you disrespecting me during operation hours.

The bed was massive and the elephant's backside was immense. There was nowhere you could run to escape it quickly enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola's ass landed a direct hit. Unfortunately for you, this time she was not wearing her spandex uniform to keep you from going to deep. Instead, her lingerie included a skimpy thong that vanished deep between her cheeks. It was as if she was planning for this all along!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Viola landed on you, you were shocked that you were not immediately pancaked beneath her cheeks. But the realization of where you actually were sunk in and may have been much worse. You felt the fabric of her thong come down on your body and saw her thick, full cheeks at either side of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....\" you mutter. It's all you can manage before Viola proceeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe not so good doctor clenches her cheeks, sandwiching your body between them and grinds her ass back and forth on your oversized bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, I just love the feeling of squashing little alien specimens like you into my ass. The deeper the better little mascot,\" she moans as she moves from grinding to bouncing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou no longer feel protected by being between her cheeks. Instead, it means the impacts are coming from all sides and angles. You are a mashed up, mangled mess and are ground and smeared into the silky fabric of Viola's thong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor finally relents in her bouncing and rests her weight fully on you and your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, this is right about the point where we had to part ways originally. Fortunately, now that you've had the treatment, I don't have to worry about how we play. And if you haven't figured it out by now, I like to play <i>rough</i>!\" she laughs. </span></div></div>",

In fact, that weak struggling and squirming is exactly <i>why</i> Viola loved the sensation of trapping smaller species within her ass. The concept of escape kept them going. She's found that the sooner she plunges them deeper, the sooner they lose hope and the squirming slows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola moans deeply and pushes herself to her feet. She doesn't bother adjusting her thong, trusting that her massive cheeks will be more than enough to keep you right where she wants you. But she does need to be in uniform before reporting to the bridge. She picks up her scattered uniform off the ground of the mascot's room and takes her time pulling her spandex up and over her thick legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel every move she makes as you are twisted and compacted between her fleshy cheeks. The chewing gets more rapid as she slowly wiggles her hips to pull the tight spandex over her curves. While she's not moving quickly, each twist and wiggle she makes sends her flesh jiggling rapidly, slamming you over and over again. Once the spandex uniform is in place, her jiggles cease, although you wish they hadn't. The incredibly tight, form fitting uniform compresses Viola's flesh and encases your body with the flesh of her thick rump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she has composed herself and glances back in the mirror before giving her rump a quick slap and walking to the bridge. </span></div></div>",

Andrew took a few seconds to regain his thoughts and reflect on recent events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever in a million years would Andrew think he would be on a ship with a crew of aliens, a group of aliens that appeared to have a strange obsession with him, which Andrew found quiet odd  and flattering. Back on earth Andrew was never popular with the opposite sex but in space he seemed to be some form of babe magnet, however there was a downside to all this and that was the constant wave of pain these giants hippo girls (and elephant) were putting him through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously Andrew wasn't dead from his recent adventures with Jackie, Viola, and his most recent encounter with Barrah, but each event still left a mark on Andrew and he could only wonder how much longer he will last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew suddenly found himself with a annoying stress headache and decided it would be wise to simply let the cards fall where they will and just go to bed.

Almost as soon as she removed her weight from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still in a great deal of pain, but now that your body was back to normal, you tried to stretch and rub your sore limbs to restore normal feeling and sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Andrew, maybe this is partially my fault. I'll admit my attacks were half hearted because I didn't think you could survive 100% of my offense. But maybe my lackadaisical approach led you to be just as lazy in your defense. I'm going to give you one more chance. This time, I'm not holding back. If you don't do better, you might not survive. Even with the treatment.\" she warns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back up in fear as you see Jackie take a more ready offensive stance. This was very different from the casual stance she had taken previously. She nods and you decide that you're not going to wait for her to make the first move. You take off running in a preemptive defense! Jackie smiles. She always enjoyed the feel of the chase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large hippo moved at an astounding speed, but you realized that she was not chasing you directly. She had predicted your movements and ran to cut you off! She slammed into you at full speed with an unbelievably strong shoulder tackle that sent you flying across the room! You slammed into the corner of the gym. You likely would have kept flying had the wall not forced you to stop. As you slid down to the floor, you realized that you had removed some of the wall with your impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie slowly strutted toward you, but realized that you were still conscious. She had expected that to knock you out! She charges at you again but you manage to dive out of the way before she reaches you. With reflexes that you would attribute to a cat rather than a hippo, the 14 foot anthro reaches back and grabs you by the collar, pulling you back and slamming your head back into the corner. She lifts you by the neck and delivers a massive headbutt and lets your body fall to the floor in a heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to try to stand and you've managed to impress Jackie with your resilience. But she decides to put a quick end to this fight. She turns around and once again reveals her massive ass to you. You realize that her legs have cut off your escape routes but her thighs are too thick for you to have a prayer to dive between. Without warning, she moves her hips forward and swings them back with brute force, slamming your face with her huge, strong ass. The force of her ass once again takes chunks out of the wall and you feel your head forced up between her cheeks, despite the presence of her leggings and thong. She bends down and picks up your legs while gripping your head with her vice like glutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles to herself, savoring a final oncoming victory. She kicks her legs out in front of her and lets her ass fall into the mat, crushing you a final time beneath her full multi-ton weight. This time, it's all baring down on your head. She flexes her ass over your head a few times to wordlessly enforce her dominance over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your evaluation is complete Andrew.\" She says smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is Jackie's final recommendation?</span></div></div>",

She double checks every few steps to ensure that your body remains plastered to her large ass. Barrah is surprised to see her back so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a rather easy evaluation Commander. I'm afraid that even the toys we provide our children would put up more of a fight than the human did. See for yourself.\" Jackie said. She waived her hand and highlights from your evaluation appeared for the whole crew. They saw your ineffective punches, they saw you freeze as Jackie effortlessly sat on you and belly flopped on you, and finally they saw her evaluation ending hip drop at the end. The screen goes dark and vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he now?\" Barrah asks. Jackie wordlessly turns around and displays your flattened body splayed out across her left cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went easy on him two rounds in a row, and thought that may have been partially to blame for his lack of defensive aptitude. But when I picked up the attack effort, he was unable to rise to the occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarrah nodded. The commander stood up and signaled for her crew to come closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based on Jackie's thorough evaluation, it would be a great risk to any of us to give the human any real responsibility. From what we witnessed, it seems he has a desire to be crushed beneath our bodies. If that is the case, he shall serve as our ship's cushion. Jackie, please place him on my seat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie nodded in agreement. Viola could barely contain her happiness at this news, it would only be too easy to get the human beneath her now, if she could only pry him away from the commander. Similarly, her fellow crew members were looking forward to their own opportunities to experience the new cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, all you could do was look up helplessly as Barrah's huge hippo ass filled your field of vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm disappointed in your performance Andrew.\" she said, \"Hopefully you can fill this role more effectively.\" she concluded sternly, before callously plopping her large ass on top of your already flat body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed in comfort and shifted her weight across her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" she said thoughtfully. \"This actually feels quite nice. Maybe a human cushion was the best choice we could have made.\" she said with a smile as she sat back in her chair, resting on top of her newest crew member.</span></div></div>",

Your helpless position, squashed flat beneath her ass, gave her all the pleasure she ever wanted and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forced herself to silence a moan as she shifted her ass over your crushed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human cushion was just what this ship needed. Excellent work and evaluation Jackie,\" Barrah said, complimenting her weapons specialist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompliments were rare from the stern commander, so Jackie smiled broadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she wanted to enjoy the feeling of her newest crew member's flattened form beneath her full ass, Barrah knew that keeping him to herself would risk an uprising from the rest of the ladies. Looking around, she sees each of them stealing glances at her greedily. Clearly they are all desperate for their own turn with the human.

She knows it and it's systems better than anyone but me.\" With that, the large-assed, shy hippo let out a soft, girlish squeal of excitement. The other girls sighed out of disappointment or embarrassment for their co-worker. Your eyes turned to Sierra and you saw the joyful look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs noted earlier, she is the shortest anthro on the ship and had the largest ass of everyone but Viola. Those were the two features you noticed first. Now that you took a closer look, you saw that she had breasts that would have been a D cup on a normal sized woman, but were completely to scale with the rest of her large body. She had short dark hair that circled her rounded face well. If she weren't a hippo, you would have found her exceptionally attractive. As a matter of fact, the more you looked at her the more pleased you were with Barrah's choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra jumps to attention, pulling you by the hand to the far side of the bridge, snapping you out of your appreciation of her feminine form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to start here!\" she says in excitement, taking you over to a series of control panels. She gestures at one that's about 8 feet in height and glowing green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This screen connects to the security system of the ship. It recognizes all crew members and allows them access to any room they're permitted in. But you have to be registered into the computer first.\" she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra puts her hand to the screen and the computer responds in a female computerized voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sierra Bigas. Species: Ju-Ohvian. Height: 9 feet, 4 inches tall. Weight: 3,200 pounds. Position: Chief Science Officer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?\u201d Sierra says smiling, \u201cThe computer recognizes me and everything about me. Now we just need to register you. Go ahead and put your hand on the panel.\u201d She instructs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach your arm up as high as you can, but the panel is just out of reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops!\u201d Sierra giggles. \u201cThis whole ship was designed for Ju-Ohvians. We\u2019re all much taller than you. Here, let me help.\u201d She says, lifting you up from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sierra lifts you, you feel her large breasts pressing against the back of your neck, overflowing along the sides of your face. Her hands are softer than you\u2019d expect, you realize as you place your hands on top of hers for stability. You start to feel a bit excited, which surprises you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing impatiently, Sierra wakes you up from your thoughts and you place your hand on the panel. You feel a warmth radiating from it as it begins to register you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAndrew Mercer.\u201d The computerized voice begins. \u201cRace: Human. Height: 5 feet 6 inches. Weight: 165 pounds. Position: Undetermined.\u201d With that, the panel shuts off and Sierra gives you a gentle hug from behind and places you back on the ground. You look up at her curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought undetermined would be a little more kind than Mascot or Toy. I\u2019m sure you have many gifts we haven\u2019t discovered yet.\u201d She giggles blushing. You smile in appreciation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Andrew, follow me. I\u2019ll show you the rest of the ship!\u201d Sierra says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks out of the bridge, explaining how the ships security system will automatically recognize crew members and open or unlock doors they\u2019re allowed access to without the crew member having to lift a finger. She drones on about the different rooms aboard the ship \u2013 Kitchen, dining hall, gym\u2026but all you could focus on was her large ass. It was swaying with every step she took and due to the tight, sheer leggings you could see every jiggle in her cheeks. It was all you could see and larger than your mind could comprehend. You started to feel the excitement seeping back into your mind and you tried to focus on other things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted your attention to all of the changes you had gone through. You thought about your small little town on earth. Would they miss you? Would they look for you? You weren\u2019t sure. You were pretty non descript, even for your small town. You thought about your dreams of seeing the stars and got excited with anticipation of your new journeys and adventures that awaited you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so caught up in your thoughts, in fact, that you didn\u2019t notice that Sierra had stopped walking. You plowed straight into her massive ass! You found your nose and face buried between her mammoth cheeks. In fact, if it weren\u2019t for her thong and leggings, you would probably be shoulder deep in hippo ass at this point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra lets out a surprised gasp as she feels your presence immediately. The gasp is followed quickly by an excited giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnxious are we?\u201d Sierra laughs, clenching her butt over your face and pressing your head deeper between her cheeks with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Andrew. You won\u2019t have to wait long.\u201d She says as she easily plucks you free. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at your quarters.\u201d She explains, pointing to a very large door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy\u2026.my quarters?\u201d you ask, walking inside. You are in awe at the size of the space you\u2019ve been given. It was bigger than your entire apartment! Much less any bedroom you\u2019ve ever had. The bed looked like it could easily fit 4 of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra explained \u201cAll of our rooms are pretty much the same, except for Viola\u2019s who needs a larger room, and of course the Commander has the Captain\u2019s Suite. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so big.\u201d She says logically, sauntering nearer to you as she talks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if you think the bed is too big, I\u2019m sure that we can find someone to help you\u2026fill the space.\u201d She says seductively. She rests her hands on your shoulders and lowers her breasts over your head. As she speaks, she takes you by the hands and gently pulls you toward the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull away and Sierra looks shocked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Andrew?\u201d she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammer for words. You don\u2019t know how to explain to Sierra. You find her sexy, but confusing. Your body and mind seem to be at odds with how to respond to her advances, so you freeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026..I have gone through so much. This is all happening so fast. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for anything like that yet.\u201d You respond, settling on an explanation that you hope will not hurt her, (or cause her to want to hurt you).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you curiously, and then smiles. She moves closer to you again and puts your hands on her own body, moving them up and down. First your right hand moved up to her chest as she worked your left hand down toward her ass, slowly and gently. She groped and kneaded her butt and her breast with your own hands. You closed your eyes and enjoyed the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Andrew,\u201d she moaned slightly \u201cI\u2019ve been on this ship for 6 months with just those ladies. And today you arrived. I need a man.\u201d She cooed. She could tell you were getting excited and were enjoying the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and opened your eyes. The sight of your hands rubbing her hippo flesh startled you. You pulled yourself away again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026..you\u2019re a hippo!\u201d you blurted out before covering your mouth in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, but you hadn\u2019t intended your words to sound so insulting and degrading. Clearly they had come across that way to Sierra. Her look went from one of longing to one of anger. She lifted your short body by your neck and tossed you easily on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were here intentions? </span></div></div>",

She didn't look happy as she kept her eyes locked onto you. She had a small smile on her face as she climbed onto the bed and stood to her full height above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You humans.\" she smirked. \"You think you're so much better than everyone else. That's why no one in the universe wants to go anywhere near your primitive planet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bent slightly, caressing her breasts and ass. \"Most species would look at me and see a sexy woman. You just see a hippo and shudder. You fool.\" she says, \"Well you'll see just how much punishment a hippo like me can deal out to someone who thinks they're so high and mighty like you. You think you're better than me? You'll know your place soon enough.\" she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra slowly and gingerly walked up the bed, stepping closer and closer to your head. She turned so that her ass was facing you and bent deep, peeling her thong from between her cheeks and off of her body. She swung it over her shoulder and let it fall on your face. You were in awe of the sheer size of the massive thong, but quickly threw it off your body in disgust. Sierra then slowly peeled down her leggings and stepped out them one at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, she turned around to face you. She looked down in hunger at your defenseless body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not normally this aggressive Andrew.\" she begins \"But you deserve what you're getting. And I deserve what I'm getting. I could have given you pleasure unheard of on your planet. But instead, the pleasure will be all mine. Are you ready to feel everything this sexy hippo has to offer?\" she asked mockingly and sensually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't move as she stood directly over your head. Sierra bent slightly at the knees and leapt high in the air! You gasped in shock as you saw her start to descend. 3000 pounds of hippo woman was about to land right on your face! How would you ever survive!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sierra knew what she was doing and landed doing the splits. When her pussy came in contact with your face, your head was buried deep between her legs and within her flesh. You were shocked to realize that you were still 3-D, but she was clearly keeping the majority of her weight off of your face. Most of the impact of the drop was absorbed by her legs and large ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, that ass was planted directly onto your chest. As she made impact, your chest collapsed instantly, forcing all of the air out of your lungs out through your mouth. Directly into Sierra's waiting pussy. She gasped as your face pressed into her womanhood and at the impact of the air that was forced out of your body by her incredible weight. She held your head gently, but securely, and pressed it closer into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she kept the vast majority of her weight off of your head, she was still heavy. She slowly shifted her weight across your face. Back and forth, side to side. Every spot on your face was covered by her vagina at some point, and Sierra moaned in pleasure. The shifting grew more rapid and the pressure quickly increased. You felt yourself getting slowly crushed, you couldn't breathe, and your face was being used to masturbate an anthro with the biggest ass you've ever see. How were you surviving all of this? Then suddenly you remembered...the treatment that would allow you to breathe in any atmosphere. Apparently, that included the limited air inside a huge anthro hippo's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're stirred from your thoughts by a muffled voice. Clearly Sierra hears it too as she freezes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she hear?</span></div></div>",

She smiled when she turned and saw you, getting an incredible idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled your body closer to the edge of the bed, turned around, and let her naked ass fall, covering your flat body from head to food.

We must all be secured for departure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSierra turned to the captain and her smile grew even broader. She patted the front of her thong. \"Do not worry captain.

Held tightly by the too small leggings and thong of Sierra. Your body was being pressed into Sierra's womanhood and your lower body was deep between her huge ass cheeks. You felt like you were pushed deeper with each step she took. Finally, the huge anthro sat and buckled in for departure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain looks around, in silent shock over the drastic turn in personality from her formerly shy science officer.

Our 6th Officer will officially be the ship's Sex Toy.\" she said, her response being met with resounding cheers from the rest of her crew. Everyone but Sierra, who was too busy enjoying the sensation of your struggles deep between her cheeks and the folds of her vagina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarrah presses a few buttons on her control panel, approving the changes to your status and calls for composure from her crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everyone secure?\" she asks, and receives a positive response from each member of her crew. Sierra responds for you, reconfirming your status. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Moona! Let's go.\" Barrah orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Sierra slumps back in her chair as the pilot and navigator take them away from earth. Every few seconds, she flexes her massive ass. She desperately wants to return to her quarters, or to your quarters, and to really finish what she had started, but she knew better than to cross Barrah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were breathing just fine, but were otherwise miserable. You were sweaty, cramped, and in a great deal of pain from Sierra's constant flexing. Somehow, Barrah's words made it to your ears through the layers of fat that made up Sierra's huge ass. Your heart sank. Not only were you being taken away from your home planet, you were being forced to become a living sex toy to a ship of anthro hippos (and of course the 20 foot elephant who promised to make you a dildo. Can't forget that!). How could this day possibly get any worse! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of Sierra's loins, her crew mates couldn't help but shoot jealous glances at her. They were jealous that she was assigned to work with the human first and that she had the idea to put him to use as a sex toy first, but they were also thankful that she was able to get his status approved.

She easily buckled you in and made certain that you were secure. Moona stood out from the rest of the crew. She had a purplish/reddish tone to her skin compared to the browns, tans, and grays of her companions. She also had short blond hair that stood as a sharp contrast against her colorful skin tone. Her body was shapely and curvaceous, with thick thighs and a large ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the size,\" Moona apologizes. \"The chair, like most everything else on our ship, was designed for hips slightly larger than your own.\" she said with a shy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just slightly.\" you respond dryly. Your normal sarcastic and witty sense of humor was missing. You didn't know Moona or the other crew members that well yet, so you wanted to avoid angering or offending anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit still as Moona moves a variety of nobs and levers all across the panel that your chair and her chair both face. You can see she's straining herself get everything in place properly and correctly. Eventually, she turns to the commander and informs her that everything is ready for departure. Barrah informs the rest of the crew to fasten in and prepare for departure as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see a large screen appear on the wall behind the panel. Your mouth drops open as the same star system you were observing through your telescope earlier appeared in front of you. You realized that this was your opportunity to live your dreams. You thought you would never be an actual astronaut, but with these anthros you had the opportunity to travel the stars anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou braced yourself for a rough take off, but were surprised at how gentle the departure was even as the stars zoomed past your viewing screen. You remarked to Moona at how calm it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's partially due to the treatment. It helps your body adjust to the speed. But with our ships, the impact should be minimal even without the treatment.\" Moona explains to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Moona, remembering Barrah's statement about the landing. \"Well, why was the landing so bumpy and loud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Moona looked crestfallen and sad. \"Well, I'm afraid that was my fault. It's not easy to be both the navigator and pilot. I was aiming for more of a clearing but misjudged my landing space. I'm lucky we just hit an area of uninhabited vegetation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, not wanting to sadden the large anthro. \"Well, I'm glad you did. If I hadn't heard you, I wouldn't be on the ship right now, and I wouldn't have such a beautiful view.\" you responded, keeping your eyes locked on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona looked up, thinking you were referring to the stars on the screen. But then she saw your eyes on her face and smiled. She unfastened your seat belt and gave you a huge hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Andrew, you're so sweet.\" she smiles at you and you feel intoxicated by her overwhelming embrace.</span></div></div>",

With your permission, I would like to train him to fill that role and to officially change his title to that of 'Acting Navigator.'\" Barrah nods her agreement, but warns that your training would fall solely on Moona. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona returns with an excited look on your face and you just sit there in a confused daze. \"You obviously know your star systems well. With a little training, you should be able to make a great navigator for our ship.

There's no better way to spend more time with my little spaceman.\" she says flirtatiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona is striking, between her curves, colorful skin, and blond hair there is a unique beauty about her you've never seen on earth. You remember that Barrah said that she navigated the crew to your planet in the first place, and that it was her rough landing that led you to investigate the ship. It seemed like there was something drawing the two of you together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went on aboard the ship, you and Moona grew closer quickly. You felt comfortable around her first and she embraced your sarcastic humor. You were a quick learner and became an effective navigator for the ship, allowing Moona to focus on the task of piloting. You learned more of her background and how she became the pilot and navigator of the ship in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also grew more familiar with the rest of the crew. They were a very close group, but none closer than Sierra and Moona who were neighbors on their home planet. You often saw them sharing a knowing glance when they thought you were focused on your star maps and Sierra would often smile at the sight of you and Moona working together so well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie was tough and protective, but liked to relax with the rest of the girls as well. Had she been fully human, she would be described as a tomboy. Nobody at the academy could out wrestle her. No one could beat her in armed or unarmed combat. You quickly learned how to tell if she was having a bad day, and if she had gotten up on the wrong side of the bed you would need to avoid her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarrah was strict, but she kept the crew together well. She allowed flexibility and freedom as long as the crew stayed on task. You had not seen someone cross her yet, and that was a sure sign that you didn't want to see it and you certainly didn't want to be the first to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was Viola. While she was the first crew member you met, before even boarding the ship, she was the one you were least familiar with. Her promise to you from that first day.....\"You will pretty much become my living dildo!\" has hung in your head since the moment you heard it. You were sure to avoid situations that would put you in a one on one position with Viola. In fact, after learning the star maps, the first thing you learned was the process for locking and securing your room to ensure Viola couldn't sneak in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt right at home on the ship, but never more than when you were working with Moona. You had forgotten about your uninspiring life back in your small town on earth as you led the crew through new star systems no human had even laid eyes on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the real story begins when Barrah announces that you've finally reached the destination for the crew's second mission.

His navigation was perfect.\" You blush and don't offer a verbal response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour crew had landed on a known, but rarely explored planet light years away from earth. Jackie had been busy making preparations for the landing party. You had been instructed by Barrah beforehand that you and Moona were to stay aboard the ship to be prepared in case they needed to make a quick departure. The landing party would be Barrah, Jackie, Sierra, and Viola. You hoped that the natives on this planet were large enough to avoid the same fate you did when you first met Viola. Of course, everyone wanted a safe and peaceful exploration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landing party gathers their supplies and quickly departs, leaving you and Moona alone on the ship. There's a moment of awkward silence as you are both wordlessly aware of the chemistry and attraction that has existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona stands from her pilots seat and stretches her legs, emphasizing her curves. Your chairs are right next to each other and she sticks her ass right in your face as she stands. You watch in wordless wonder as the hippo woman puts her body on exhibition for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Andrew,\" Moona begins, \"You never asked me why I choose Earth. Aren't you the least bit curious?\" she asks slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gather your breath, your mind still spinning from the view she presented you moments ago. But after a brief pause you respond positively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona giggles at your hesitation. \"Well, I studied all sorts of different solar systems and life forms at the Academy. I've always found humans to be especially....interesting.\" she says, her eyes slowing working their way up and down your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" you respond with hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona is about to reveal her true feelings about you and humanity.

She was so much bigger then you, and so much more powerful, and you couldn't help but feel safe around her. Her belly, covers in silky smooth material, was warm and soft, you couldn't NOT wrap your arms around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...really think I'm cute?\" You breath out. A slight blush appeared on your face. You found your energy rapidly depleating as Moona continued embracing you. All you could hear was the sound of her breathing. You didn't dare look at anything else besides her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona blushes back and offers no response, but slowly raises you up to her face. You were a little surprised, but not enough to be afraid. She had a big, almost goofy looking smile on her face, and she eyed you with...not greed, but more of with a burning want. You couldn't help but smile back, knowing where she was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and ever so slightly bought you closer to her face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BZZZZT* *BZZZZT* *EMERGENCY* *EMERGENCY*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and then the mood was killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA computerized voice started blaring out of the P.A and alarms started rang throughout the ship. The initial shock made Moona accidents lose grip of me, letting me fall to the floor.\"Ooof!\" You exclaim as you rub your behind. Moona looked down and started an apology, but the computerized voice prompted her to look at the ship monitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" I asked a bit panicked. Moona motioned to the screen, and suddenly, Captain Barrah's face appeared. \"Captain!\" You and Moona shouted, \"What's going on?!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well 'ahem' it appears...that we have severely - cough - underestimated the native species on this planet.\" Captain Barrah responded, with a hint of embarrassment in her voice. You and Moona could hear machine gunfire in the background. \"It appears that we have arrived on a planet not so different from your planet Andrew.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" You ask, but it came out more like a shout, \"Does that mean your fighting humans like me?!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes. With...one tiiiiny difference.\" Captain Barrah now looked, as rare as it was, a bit afraid. Suddenly, Jackie's voice could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moona! Andrew! Get us the hell out of her! They're launching mini-nukes at us!\" She bellowed. It was the first time I ever heard her so fear stricken, even though she covers it with her hearty voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarrah smiled a very weak smile. \"They...are...a couple hundred years ahead of your planets technology.\" A blast could be heard, not just through the intercoms, but from outside the ship as well. \"...and ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare the ship for take off, we're leaving this planet before they actually send in he military and not just a team of paranoid civilians.\" Barrah's face faded away from the screen. You look to Moona and you two share a moment of silent understanding before immediately prepping for launch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona opened the air-lock door and the landing crew came rushing in. \"Better hurry up! We're being followed!\" Sierra warned, and no sooner then she said it an adage of bullets started to hit the exterior of the ship. Thankfully, it was well armored, but it won't last that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone hurried to their seats and me and Moona started the launching sequence. \"What the hell did you do to provoke them?\" You say to the landing crew as the sounds of gunfire got more pronounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola looked away from everyone suddenly and started to thimble her hands/paws/hoofs together. \"I...accidentally sat on one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and Moona completed the sequence. \"Ready?\" I turn to her side to face her. \"Ready!\" She exclaims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well that was anticlimactic.\" You mutter to yourself. All that energy pumping to the launch turned out to be unnecessary. The rockets made for a very easy flight and no sooner afterwards the crew was out of danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoons noticed your dejection and put a thick hand on your shoulder. \"Sorry dear, it can't always be like the movies.\"</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, she appeared to have kept her cool, actually only raising a eyebrow to this sudden bit of information. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\" She replied casually and strutted back to her seat. You almost gagged on your own air as she took it without any other reaction. You stare at her, waiting for some type of reaction, but she is entirely engrossed on the Captain's screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...Moona?\" You quietly whisper to your new friend, \"What are we going to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona beamed down cheerily at me. \"Don't worry!\" She pared you on the head, a resounding blush appears on your face, \"There's just been a change inans that's all! Our spare back up generators will give us just enough energy to take us to another planet where we can refuel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And which planet is that exactly?\" You say scooting a bit closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rubbed her chin and gazed into the star map. \"Well, according to my math, the only planet that has deep deposits of fuel and is in close proximity to us is...\"</span></div></div>",

Captain Barrah was the first to break the pregnant silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMoona. Explain...please\u201d The commanding hippopotamus ordered with common courtesy added on as an afterthought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well!\u201d Moona fidgeted her pudgy fingers as she eyed over the screen that displayed a plethora of numbers that were generally lost on you. \u201cI-it seems that the Planet Earth is...incredibly plentiful in Graveline deposits.

Only that their planet, Earth, is plentiful in it. Moona, set a course for Earth on the double. I\u2019m going to head back to my quarters.\u201d Captain Barrah declared, and rose out of her chair to do just that. Soon, Viola, Jackie, and sierra followed her out, having coming up with a similar excuse, leaving you and Moona alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Moona?\u201d You pat the side of your navigator friend. \u201cWhy did everyone get so quiet when you said we had to go back to my home? I mean, I\u2019m excited too, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d Moon shook her head and turned to face you. \u201cNothing is set in stone, but...when an exploration vessel finds something that may be of use to our race, it\u2019s mandatory that they report back to Jo-Oh, where decide what to do with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Wait\u2026\u201d You said slowly, coming to the realization. \u201cYou mean that Captain Barrah just left, to talk to your...your leaders i\u2019m assuming, to tell them that Earth, my Planet, is rich in the source of fuel that drives your entire civilization?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou Hippo friend gave a sheepish smile and rubbed the back of her chubby neck awkwardly. \u201cThat\u2019s...about the gist of it, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d you said, a little bit shaken at the revelation that on this very ship, in a couple of rooms down from your position, Captain Barrah was deciding the fate of humanity. \u201cWhat happens to Earth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona did not want to answer, but the face she was making told you enough.

You protested feebly, but your pleas only seemed to invigorate her more and more. She moaned more and more excitedly as she licked you. Your hair was soaked with drool and plastered to your forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified beyond words. Moona had seemed so sweet and innocent. You thought that you had a real connection with her, but now this \"sweet and innocent\" girl turned out to be a monster. It couldn't be real. She had to be playing some kind of game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moona stop!\" you yelled. \"This isn't funny anymore! Let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and fluttered her eyes. \"Oh Andrew, I'm never going to let you go. As a matter of fact, I can't bare the idea of sharing you with the crew. I want you all to myself. I want you with me forever. <i>Within me forever</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, maybe you weren't as smart as everyone on board thought?\" Moona suggested innocently. \"Maybe your curiosity of visiting alien worlds got the better of you? Maybe, when I took my eyes off of you for just a second, you decided to explore the planet on your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her in slack-jawed terror. You couldn't believe what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's so many dangers on an alien planet. If you wandered off and got yourself lost, nobody would be surprised if we never found you. Especially if, instead of being in some alien monster's belly, you're in mine!\" Moona slapped her prodigious gut and giggled at the naked fear on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to kill me?\" you asked, voice breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona shrugged. \"Maybe, maybe not. Those chemicals you got doused in are strong. They're meant to help you survive any hostile environment, and I can't think of an environment more hostile than the big belly of a hungry goddess like me, am I right? But even if you do digest, would it really be so bad? To be part of me forever? I remember the way you looked at me. I know you wanted to be with me. Well this way you can. We'd be inseparable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl was insane. Dr. Viola vowed to make you her human dildo, but that was almost tame compared to being the meal for some psycho hippo. Your eyes stung with tears at the betrayal and you wiggled trying to break free of Moona's grasp. All you succeeded in doing was triggering a peal of laughter from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep squirming, Andrew! Keep it up when you're deep inside me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as Moona puckered her lips for a kiss. She kissed you long and deep before she pulled your head into her mouth. Your shoulders followed, leaving your arms stuck to your side and your legs kicking uselessly outside. Moona giggled as she sucked on your body, assaulting your face with her tongue. Her breath was hot and stank of past meals. You knew it'd only be worse once you reached the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of savoring your taste, she sucked you in further, working the top half of your body to the back of her throat. Your arms were inside her mouth now and you brought them up to stall your advance into her body. You pushed against the sides of her throat, but she was too strong, the walls of flesh too slimy. She gulped and your arms went out from under you into her throat. Your face landed on the back of her tongue, which she lifted. You screamed as you slid forward. Another gulp and your head was looking down the black abyss of her throat. Gurgling sounds came from below as if her stomach anticipated your arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona worked your kicking legs into her mouth, tilted her head up and trusted in gravity as she gave one final swallow. You were sent plummeting down, down, down into the bowels of this alien who you thought you might've loved. Moona traced your descent down her neck with a finger. She let out an excited gasp when the rest of your body entered the stinking, slimy prison of her stomach. She breathed heavily, a flush in her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona ran a dainty hand over her stomach happily. She was pleased to see that there were no visible signs of you present. She knew you were screaming and begging her to let you out, but that was only because she could feel the vibrations of your shouts and struggles through her body. She couldn't actually hear what you were saying through her immense flab at all. When the crew returned, they would have no idea whatsoever that you were inside her. The thought thrilled Moona as she walked back to her navigator's chair and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona belched contentedly, the build up of gas the only consequence of your pathetic attempts to escape. She licked her lips as she tasted you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there,\" Moona said sleepily. \"Don't be so sad. Nothing will keep us apart now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona might not have been able to hear you but you could certainly hear her. Your cried as you wallowed in the pit of the hippo's stomach. You were crammed in alongside the contents of countless past meals which had yet to digest. The stomach acid came up to your waist. It tingled and ate away at your clothes, but you didn't know if it was strong enough to break you down too. You prayed that Moona was right and the treatments the crew subjected you to would keep you safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to convince yourself that this was some horribly cruel joke. Maybe Moona was a little twisted, but that didn't mean she was sick enough to actually keep you inside her forever. This could all be some fucked-up roleplaying that she was indulging in before the crew got back. But then you remembered the lie she told you. The story of you lost on an alien world. The perfect cover to explain your disappearance and keep you right where she wanted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, she was just playing! She had to be playing! It was possible, right? Right?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUURP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she just playing?</span></div></div>",

She licked her lips as she tries to collect the last of your taste. \"My Ju-O gods he was the tastiest little thing.\" She looks at her belly. \"So helpless, so hopeless. And he's all mine.\" Moona slurred that last part. Inside, You're still trying your best to convince Moona to let you out. But alas, to no avail. Your words do not escape the hippo's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better hope you can withstand my digestive tract. Because if not... well... adding you ,my cute little navigator, to this beautiful body would make me love every part of it even more.\" The dominant hippo sneered, slapping her belly and causing ripples to form. There may not be obvious visuals of you inside of her, but your struggles can definitely be seen if looked at closely as unnatural lumps and bulges form on Moona's protuding stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to yell at her but her immense flabs of fat make it hard for her to hear youcoming out as muffled noise. \"Hmmm, I wonder...\" Moona pondered. She hoisted herself out of her chair and walked over to the medical bay, adding an extra pop in her step. Her weighted paunch bobbed and jiggled as she made her way to her destination. You were powerless to do anything. All you could do was sit there and take whatever she throws at you as bits of undigested food and acid splash into your almost naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona entered the medical bay and rummaged through many of the drawers and cabinets within. \"Found it!\" Moona said happily. She pulls out a hi-tech wireless stethoscope, inserting the eartips into her ears and sticking the diaphragm (circle thing) on her moving belly. Moona could now hear inside her own stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Help me somebody! I'm inside Moona's stomach!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona giggled to herself as you continued with your pleas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I can hear what you say now! So I'd watch what I say if I were you.\" She said to you and smacked her gut. Jostling it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Moona! Let me out of here! The others will notice that I'm gone.</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The others... they wanted to take you from me! I'm saving what we have together and what we have together is sacred. And I'm going to protect it the only way I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A groan exited her body as soon as she finished that sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What if I get digested!? Then you'll lose me forever!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So be it, if I can't have you physically.\" Moona turned behind her and slapped her fat jello booty. \"I'll have you spiritually, your soul forever attached to my glorious assets.\" You hoped that wouldn't be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<b>COME IN MOONA, ARE YOU THERE?</b>) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona clicked the side of her wrist piece. \"What is it, Barrah?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<b>THE NATIVE HERE HAVE ASKED ME AND THE OTHERS TO STAY FOR THE NEXT TWO NIGHTS. IN ORDER TO GAIN THEIR TRUST WE MUST DO AS THEY SAY. YOU AND THE ROOKIE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE SHIP IS SECURED TILL THEN.</b>) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona couldn't believe it. She has the ship all to herself until her team gets back. She had to fight back her glee and excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Barrah help me I'm inside Moona. She swallowed me whole.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona giggled as she was the only one that was able to hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<b>WILL YOU TWO BE OKAY UNTIL THEN?</b>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, the two of us will be juuust <i>fiiiinne</i>.\" Moona said in a tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<b>OKAY, STAY SAFE UNTIL THEN. OVER AND OUT.</b>) With that the trassmission ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona couldn't take it anymore and started doing a happy dance. This in turned cause your fleshy prison to dance along with her, bobbing, wobbling, and jiggling about. A cascade of acid splashes you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is wonderful. I get to have you to myself and undisturbed for two nights.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Assuming I'm not digested then!\"</i> You spoke aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have you either way so it's a win-win for me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona yawned as she stopped dancing. \"Hoo, I'm tired. I'm gonna take a nap in my quarters.\" Moona yawned again before walking to her room. You started to panic and really started to flail about. This made very visable bulges on her tummy. \"He's at my mercy and no one can stop it.\" She says to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona made it to her room and approached the door, it opened when she got close enough. She entered and started to remove her excess clothing. She unzipped her suit and slid it off of her leaving her with just a thong and a bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad you ran from me, my tasty morsel. I would've let you tap this sexy ass before making my stomach your  permanent residence.\" Moona slapped her butt making it jiggle around like jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>you still can...</i>\" you meeped. \"We'll see.\" Moona smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe climbed into her bed. After she got into a comfortable position, Moona kissed her hand and pressed it on her still bulging belly. She started to rub it about, getting more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you when I awaken, my tasty little navigator.\" Moona as she pats her engorged gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b>UUUUUURRRRPP</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let's out one final belch then heads off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she dreams of you and her in many different pred and prey roleplays.

You panic and try to climb back up the way you came, but quickly realize that idea is a non-starter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acid within Moona's gut has quickly eaten away at your new uniform, but you are surprisingly still in one piece. It stings a bit as it crashes over your body, but you are otherwise no worse for the wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you think to yourself, \"Whatever they doused me with must be some strong stuff. I'll have to thank Viola for that later. Assuming Moona ever lets me out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually grow numb enough to the slight pain from Moona's stomach acid and find a comfortable place to prop yourself up in a seated position and fall into a light sleep yourself. You are startled awake as you feel the pilot starting to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud yawn, Moona stretches and scratches her gut. At the sight of her belly, she smiles, remembering the events just before her nap. She doesn't feel her little navigator squirming around anymore. But she still feels pretty full. She takes the stethoscope she swiped from the lab and presses it to her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrew? You still with me in there little lover?\" she asked. Honestly Moona wasn't sure if she preferred a response or not. She loved the idea of carrying her human lover with her everywhere as added cushion on her ass or a bit more thickness in her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't get rid of me that easy love,\" you laugh in response. Moona nearly drops the listening device in response. He's clearly in a much better mood. \"But how about letting me out so I can tap that ass you were bragging about so much?\" You continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that simply asking or begging to be freed wouldn't do the trick and hoped that playing on Moona's more lustful desires to get you your freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo tapped her belly and thought for a moment.

Heaving herself off her bed she made her way to the ship's dining room. Pressing a button to open the door she walks over to a machine. Her body starts to get goosebumps as she is still in nothing more than her under garments. She places her order and receives a tray full of sweets. It was safe to say that Moona had quite the sweet tooth. Without any hesitation she gobbled down the desserts on her tray. Cheese cake, cookies, and things of that sort all disappear into Moona's maw. Andrew feels something mushy fall on him. He grabbed a hold of it and sees a whitish and red mush. He looks up to where it came from. \"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside the hippo's belly expanded from all that she was eating. Moona puts the tray down before letting out a belch. *<b>UUUUURRRPP</b>* \"I hope it's not too tight in there sweetie.\" Moona kneads her gut for a moment to let it soften up. All she could hear was muffled complaining. \"Oh right the stethoscope.\" She giggles from embarrassment before grabbing the stethoscope from between her boobs and presses it to her belly. Moona repeats the question. \"You can be the most irritating person on this ship. But I still love you for it.\" Andrew said to the stomach walls. \"Aaaaaaw, thank you.\" Moona gave her tummy a big bear hug. This was crushing Andrew in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd better do a bit of maintenance on the ship.\" Moona said. She gets up and groans from the weight of her belly. \"Man I need to break all of this down.\" She rubs her stomach. \"Maybe there's something Viola has in the medical bay.\" Moona struts over to where the medical bay is adding some pop to her steps. Andrew's fleshy prison groans and gurgles as it dissolves Moona's breakfast. \"Oh yeah, I just remembered.\" Andrew said. \"What is it love?\" \"Thanks for injecting me with this stuff. Without it, I wouldn't be as close to you as I am now.\" He kneads the stomach walls. Moona shudders from pleasure at this. \"Maybe there's something in the bay that can help you out more.

Better hope I don't find it or you know what's going to happen~.\" Moona teased Andrew before smaking her ass, watching them wobble about. \"I don't tap that glorious ass you were talking about.\" Andrew retorts. \"Honey, if I made you part of my body. You would be <i>ALL</i> of my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors slides open and Moona enters the medical bay.

Andrew was a bit disappointed by her answer. \"Who knows, you might enjoy being fat.\" Moona teased. She gets up and stretches, exposing her belly for all the world to see. Leaving without putting extra clothes on, she makes her way to the medical bay. \"There might be something fun here I can use.\" She said to herself.

With this, she wouldn't have to share Andrew with any of the other crew members. He would be completely her's. Without any restraint she opened the bottle and started downing it. It tasted like oranges to her. Inside, Andrew was getting doused in whatever Moona was drinking. Her stomach acids begin to recede before draining out completely. \"Not going to make me part of you?\" Andrew asks. \"Maybe, maybe not.\" Moona giggled after teasing the human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out once the other crew members start to come back to the ship.\" Moona rubs her belly before giving it a smack. \"Now then... what to do first?\" Just as she finished that question her stomach growls. \"Sorry Andrew, but my tummy says that you aren't that filling.\" Whether that was a good or bad thing was up to him. Moona walks to the dining hall, her hefty gut bobbing up and down with the weight inside. She presses the button and enters. She struts over to a machine of some sorts and inputs what she wants from it. What came out was a large cheesecake wheel just for her. Grabbing it she makes her way to an empty table. With a bit of force she fits herself in the seat and begins to hork down her food. Andrew gets his naked body buried in sweet smelling mush. Because there are no acids to break down Moona's meal, they'll just sit there until the Acid Slower's effect wears off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona burped after finishing her food. *<b>UUURRP</b>* \"Mmmm, that was delicious.\" Moona moaned while rubbing her tummy in circles.

Andrew responds back with another punch. \"Oh now you've done it.\" Moona grabs her gut and begins to vigorously shake it. After she let's go she watches it jiggle before coming to a light wobble. Seeing no more movement she confidently stands up and places her hands on her hips. \"Had enough in there?\" She hears a meekly groan of approval. \"I thought so.\" She boasted before giving her stomach a quick jostle. \"Now behave yourself in there.

Moona got out of her bed and walked over to her mirror. She turns around and sees that her thighs and ass also expanded, each cheek balloned out and extra foot. Her belly was also a bit rounder than usual. It also ballooned a foot. \"My my, Andrew. You certainly were quite fattening.\" Moona slapped her bigger booty, watching it jiggle about like jello. She turns back to her front and pokes her tummy. Her stomach growled back like a pet to its master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'd make you all mine.

She made her way over to the mess hall, where she could grab a quick snack. Approaching the door, Moona gave the \"enter\" button a quick hip check before struting into the mess hall. \"There may be lots of food here, but what you've fed to me Andrew will never be topped.\" Moona gave her belly a pat, sending ripples through it. The pink hippo strutted over to the food machine, placed her order of some desserts, and walked with her sweets to a table. Moona sat down, hearing the chair under her start to creak. She giggled. \"Mmmmm, I'm loving my new body fat already.\" Moona picked up a big slice of raspberry cheesecake and brought it to her mouth. Licking her lips she opens her mouth and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i><b>WOOSH</b></i>* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething flew out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona felt the object exit her throat and put the slice down. She was a bit shocked at what she sees in front of her. A dimly glowing sphere, about the size of a softball, was about a foot away from her. \"<i><span class=\"cpblue\">Wow, you just keep getting sexier the more curves you get.</span></i>\" the ball said. \"Andrew? Is that really you?\" Moona happily asked. \"Oh! C'mere you!\" Moona brought the ball into a bear hug. When she let go, he was no where to be seen. \"Cutie? Where are you?\" She looks around. \"<i><span class=\"cpblue\">In here...</span></i>\" a muffled voice said. Moona followed the voice to her left boob. \"Are you in there?\" Moona groped her left naked breast. Upon her finishing her question, a few lumps from on the surface of the breast. Moona let out a gasp as she feels this. \"<i><span class=\"cpblue\">Does that answer your question?</span></i>\" you said before phasing out of her boob. \"It's just as I said. Now we can never be separated. My body a labyrinth for you to wander.\" \"<i><span class=\"cpblue\">Oh Moona.</span></i>\" You close in on Moona's face, Moona picks up on it and does so too, puckering her lips. The two of you touch, with you colliding into her lips as she makes an audible *<b>SMOOCH</b>*. This lasts for about a minute before Moona sucks your spherical form into her mouth. Her cheeks puff out a bit. \"Mmmmm.\" She moans. '<i>Still tastes like heaven.</i>' Moona thought to herself. She savored your taste before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<b><i>GULP</i></b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona traced your soul with a finger down into her belly, and bit her bottom lip as she feels you enter. \"Right where you belong.\" Moona said in a slutry tone. \"<i><span class=\"cpblue\">By your side. </span></i>\" you said to your lover. Moona was surprised to hear you. \"Now where was I? Oh right!\" She resumed to eating her desserts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...........................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaahhhh\" Moona sighed. She rubbed her belly after finishing her meal. *<b>UUUURRRP*</b> She belched, accidentally burping you out as well. Moona just giggled. \"Excuse me. Now be a good boy and go back inside of mommy.\" Moona cooed before opening her mouth wide with her tounge hanging out. Not wanting to keep a lady waiting, you float inside of her maw. Moona feels you enter before closing her maw and gulping you down. Again, biting her bottom lip as she felt you enter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink hippo stands up from her chair and starts to walk, adding an extra pop into her steps. \"Well, my little navigator, go on and navigate through my body.\" Moona coos to you, while patting her tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to...</span></div></div>",

She stroked your hair gently, the first gentle gesture she's shown you since being left alone together on the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame you're not a bit smaller Andrew. That way, you could really experience being inside me the way you were meant to. But there's still lots of fun we can have together. Well...\" Moona paused and bit her lip seductively, \"Lots of fun I can have with you,\" she finished with a girlish giggle that was not particularly comforting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona forced your body down to her exposed ass. You shrieked at it's sheer size and depth, causing Moona to squeal in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it amazing Andrew? Don't worry, I'm sure a Navigator like you will know just the right buttons to press,\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Moona pinned your body to the floor with just one hand as she lifted herself over you. She didn't stand to her full height, just enough to allow her round ass to clear your body. She used her free hand to part her cheeks slightly. You cringed at the sight of your impending fate, but your weak struggles were no match for the powerful hippo anthro. Moona laughed as she allowed herself to drop fully on you and moaned as she felt you begin to slip between her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot shifted in place on the floor, forcing your body further within her crack moaning and laughing as you struggled. Finally, she stood. She took a peak at your body from over her shoulder and laughed at your disheveled form, still partly sticking out from her large ass. Now with two hands free, she forced your body fully between her cheeks with ease and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not nearly as relaxed as your new captor seemed to be. You didn't relent in your struggles to break away from Moona's overwhelming ass. This just encouraged her more though, as her smile broadened and she clenched her cheeks together, smashing you between their incredible thick mass. She massaged her cheeks, enjoying the rush of pleasure the dominance she had over your much smaller body gave her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona strode confidently across the bridge, swinging her bare ass from side to side as she walked. She whispered seductively to herself, though you could make out the words through her thick layers of flesh. \"So vulnerable....so hot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Moona decide to do now that she has you where she wants you?</span></div></div>",

Every few steps she clenches her massive ass over your smaller body, ensuring your continued squirms and struggles. She loved the sensation of her helpless human toy trying to fight back within the mass of her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, keep squirming around like that Andrew and I might be tempted to make this arrangement permanent,\" Moona moans, throughly enjoying the power she's wielding over you without needing to lift a finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes her way to her private quarters and plops back on her large bed. The impact pushes you somehow deeper between her cheeks. Moona lays back and relaxes, intent on focusing her attention on her squirming toy. She lays still for a few minutes, but her smile fades as she feels a distinct lack of motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she whines, \"What gives back there Andrew? Why aren't you squirming? You didn't fall asleep on me did you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, you were still squirming. Or, at least trying to. The force of the mattress at your back collapsed Moona's cheeks in around you and eliminated the minimal room for movement you had previously. Moona's cheeks were soft and squishy, but even your attempts to push your way out through her flesh proved inconsequential. She didn't even feel it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph,\" the hippo groans in frustration. She sits up and thinks for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're not going to squirm around there, then I'll just find a way to fulfill what I really wanted in the first place.\" After a pause, she continued. \"I wanted you inside me, and technically, you're not really inside me yet, are you my little navigator?\" she asked with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona pushed herself to her feet and strode back across the walkways of the ship, a very distinct destination in mind. As you felt your hippo captress walk, you started to squirm and fight with renewed vigor. You didn't know exactly what she had planned, but if it involved forcing you literally inside her, you knew you didn't want to stay here to find out what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo laughed as she felt your struggles return. \"That's more like it Andrew. See if you can navigate yourself right up my little hole,\" she laughs, sending her flesh jiggling over your panicked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she reaches her destination. A lab, the same one that held the container that was used to give you \"The Treatment\" in the first place. She starts to shuffle through boxes and cabinets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, Viola or Sierra must have something in here that will do the trick...\" she mutters to herself as she starts up a different kind of hunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she searches, Moona alternates bending over to dig through lower cabinets and standing on her tip toes to reach higher shelves. Each of these movements served to apply a distinct pressure on your body, smothering you between her full cheeks. You felt like your small body had become nothing more than a smear on Moona's soft flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the movement ends as she lets out a happy cry of victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" she exclaims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona plucks your body from between her cheeks. It takes a little more work than she anticipated as you had been squashed thoroughly flat against her large backside. Finally freeing you, she unceremoniously dumps your small body on a large medical cot and looms above you with a sadistic smile on her face. She's proudly holding a spray bottle with a liquid of unusual viscosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said before, you're not quite small enough for the full journey. But this will fix that quickly,\" she says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to escape, but are unable to crawl away. Moona has cut off all of your escape routes and wastes no time before covering your body in the strange liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as you feel your heart leap into your throat and suddenly sink into your stomach. That movement is quickly matched by the rest of your body. You lunge up before collapsing in on yourself. Your vision blacks out for a moment. When it's restored, you look up to the now familiar sight of Moona looming over you wearing a terrifying grin. But something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was.....so....big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona had already dwarfed you, but the sight of her now made you recoil in terror. She had somehow grown to 3 times her original height! She looked nearly as tall as a telephone pole! She sprayed you, how did she grow?! You scanned your surroundings in shock, and that's when the realization hit you. The cot you were on, as well as the rest of the room, were also significantly larger. Moona hadn't grown, you had shrunk! You realized that you had shrunk to less than half your original height, and were likely now just 2 feet tall, maybe even less! At her 11 foot stature, easily small enough for her to do whatever she wanted with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself quickly wrapped up in Moona's large fist. She lifted you closer to her smiling face. You shivered in fear as her lips parted to speak. \"Perfect my little Navigator. Are you ready for the journey of your life?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You looked on in fear as she mulled over her options. She stared at you intently, then looking at her own body. Moona licked her chops, imagining your taste as you slid down her throat. Or maybe your puny tickles as she smothered you in her armpit or between her breasts. She blushed a little at the thought of flattening your utterly beneath her butt or feet. But she practically glowed red at the idea of fulfilling her deepest fantasy: a little human inside of her. With your new size there were so many options, but the hippo didn't need long to know which entrance to choose. She lowered you a little and parted her legs, showing off her glistening pussy. You were overcome with revulsion and awe in equal manner, unable to look away from it. The sheer size of it compared to your puny form was intimidating, all the more so when she slowly brought you closer to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like what you're seeing?\" She coos. You shake your head in response, not wanting to seem attracted in any way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't lie to me, I can feel you getting excited.\" She said with the broadest smile, pressing her finger on your crotch. Your growing erection had no place to hide. Thankfully she seemed nothing more than amused by your reaction. Who could blame you, after all? Moona blushed a little as she opened her hand. You were so close to her pussy you could feel the heat radiating over your body. It was arousing in ways you didn't anticipate and terrifying in all the ways you'd expect a giant dripping pussy to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud moan echoed overhead as the hippo pressed you firmly into the soft, wet flesh. Her slavering lower lips covered you from your waist all the way up to your head, smothering you with love. Moona slowly rubbed you up and down against the large slit, soaking almost your entire body in her warm sexual slime. Suddenly she paused, snorting a little with laughter. You felt it a moment later. Your erection, now rock hard from all the stimulation her pussy offered, had slipped in. It barely managed to reach deep enough, but a subtle prod from the hippo pushed your groin between those thick netherlips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe what you were doing with the titanic hippo, but you're fairly certain this counted as sex. You've never felt more puny in your life, but Moona seems determined to somehow make it work. The immensely potent smell of her sex drains you of all hesitation and you thrust your hips forward into the large folds. Your spirited attempts don't get far, but thankfully the hippo is there to help with a few gentle pushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, little man. I know you want to. You're cleared for launch.\" She says with a barely contained giggle. You slam forward with all your might and blow your load into the hippo. You grunt wildly as the smothering, warm flesh quivers in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... that's nice, isn't it? But nobody flies for free around here.\" Her smile grew a thousand times bigger as she kept rubbing your body against her pussy. You gulp as the hippo makes it chillingly clear:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's her turn now.</span></div></div>",

A sultry smile crawled along her lips as she stood up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, little navigator, you understand the pilot has to be on top of things, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swung you forward, laying you on your back on the cot. Looming over you was her dripping pussy leaking its excitement onto you. You shiver in fear watching the glistening lips descend. With a remarkable amount of restraint the hippo lowers herself down, sparing you the painful impact of all her mass at once. When her pussy made contact with your squirming body it all but halted, slowing its descent to a snail's pace. She wanted to feel her most sensitive spot overpower you, crushing the ability to squirm out of your little body. The thick lower lips covered you from your knees up to your neck, pinning you against the unmoving cot. Her pleasure button was poking you in the chest as everything below your head began to get crushed beneath her love. She stretched the foreplay as long as she could, but eventually all of Moona's weight rested on you. Your body was squashed into a thin sheet by her snatch, and the hippo was far from done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Andrew, you really know how to make a woman happy.\" She said, barely stringing on the sentence between aroused moans. \"Get your face in my clit and start licking.\" The hippo added, unaware of your completely inability to move a muscle. Fearful of painful retribution you try your hardest to crane your neck towards your goal, but it's no use. She's got you utterly pinned beneath her crushing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small mercy comes down in the form of her helping hand, the hippo having noticed your struggle. At least she wasn't mad you were unable to obey, but her heavyhanded solution was anything but pleasant. She scooted herself ever so slightly forward, mashing her clit directly into your face. Licking it as she intended was all impossible, but she didn't seem to notice or care, lost in her own world of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud, howling moan Moona reaches her climax, flooding you in a wave of hot, sexual slime. It didn't appear possible, but somehow her pussy weighed even more heavily on you. The pungent goop clung to your skin and your hair. It would take some effort to remove the thick slime again, but Moona has plans for you.</span></div></div>",

Her smile grew tenfold as she felt you almost stick to her privates, glued on by her sexual release. With a small splat you fell back down onto the cot, joining the small puddle of slime left behind by Moona's climax. The towering hippo smiled, seeing you struggle to even sit up in the sticky goop. Your body was glistening with her release and the smell alone made her loins feel warm all over again. It'd been a long time since she felt something as arousing as a little human squirming beneath her. Your slowly fading resistance as her pussy squashed you flat was the stuff even her wildest fantasies couldn't dream of. But as she saw you floundering in the slimy puddle it was all too clear that she wanted more. She needed more of this little man. Without a word she stepped back to you and turned around. A thick glob of her sexual fluids landed on you as her dripping pussy once more lowered itself towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took considerable willpower to not just flatten the man, but the sensation of slowly smothering him was worth it. Heat built up in Moona's crotch, causing her to moan and shudder. Every twitch brought down more weight on your body, mercilessly flattening it beneath her most intimate area. But she wasn't content with it anymore. She lifted herself up ever so slightly and shifted forward. Panic gripped you as the slime-glazed lower lips hovered over your head. Having her clit shoved in your face was unpleasant at best, but at least that position allowed you to breathe. When she brought her crotch down again you were helplessly smothered beneath its warmth. Only your legs remained free to twitch whenever she leaned in on you a little more, disgusting squelches echoing from between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horror didn't abate as she rode your face with her massive pussy, small spurts of her release lubricating the action. The thick lower lips grew ever more heavy as she crushed you into the cot. Your body felt close to two-dimensional and the worst was yet to come. You felt it clearly when she lifted herself up, her parted lips coming back together. You felt it... you felt them... squeeze. Your puny squashed body was slim enough to fit between her lower lips. You weren't the only one surprised by this revelation. Moona reached down, her thick stubby finger rubbing along her sensitive area to confirm what she was feeling. If he was small enough to do this, then maybe she could take this a step further. Her finger found its way to the back of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelp in fear as the stubby digit pushes you against the soft, slime-soaked flesh. She was rubbing your head against her most intimate regions, moaning loudly overhead. Just when you think it couldn't get worse you felt her body open up. Barely any light could reach you, but it was enough to show your her love tunnel was opening up right before you. You wanted to protest the utter ridiculousness of your position, but the hippo pushed your head inside. Suddenly your face was completely surrounded by her inner walls and their first reaction was to squeeze so hard you feared you'd faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoona shudders as her womanhood bore down on the little man. She'd only popped his head inside and already she felt on the verge of another climax. But if this was the effect of just his little head, what heights of pleasure could be reached if she just pushed him in a little bit more?</span></div></div>",

She'd played with many a dildo in her life, but one that actively struggled and squirmed within her brought the sensation to a whole new level. Even just taking in Andrew's head already brought pleasure without compare. His every move sent shivers down her spine. In spite of barely being able to see straight from the sheer intensity of the pleasure her mind can only think of one thing to do. She needs more of this wonderful little man inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold on as best you can. What part of your body isn't slowly squashed flat as a sheet of paper is now being clamped down upon by her sopping wet pussy. The pressure is intense, but pain is completely absent from the picture. The doctor's concoction is really being put through its paces here. You're fairly certain the immense bulk of the hippo crushing you should have at least some effect, and it wouldn't be pleasant. Granted, your whole head being crammed into her vagina isn't much of a step up. You hold your breath, desperately trying to avoid getting her love juices in your mouth or nose. The smell alone would stay with you forever. No words could describe Moona's musk, but the volume of her slime present here made sure you wouldn't be able to smell anything else for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the weight on your body diminished, the hippo was standing up a little. Though in your situation this could be a prelude to things getting worse as much as things getting better. You felt two stubby fingers pinch your waist gently. Was she about to pull you out and thank you for everything you'd done for her? You felt her peel your flattened body from her lower lips but your head didn't get pulled back. Instead she dashed your hopes by pushing, sliding your head even deeper until you were in up to your waist. Her inner walls allowed your passage before bearing down on you again. Moona wasn't done yet as she let go of your waist and planted a finger on your butt. Again her love tunnel loosened and she pushed the remainder of your body inside. She plunged her finger in deep, making sure your legs went in completely, entombing you in the moist heat of her pleasure cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream and curse, but her slime was everywhere. The last thing you wanted was to taste her arousal too. It was bad enough already to be completely drenched in it. Muffled moans reached your ears and the walls around you began to clamp down once more. The pressure was unbelievable. You almost pitied any hippo men putting their manhood inside this vice. But if they're as turned on by pressure as Moona was they might consider this a plus. You were too busy being horrified at the effects of it. Your body was still getting crushed, her inner walls slowly squeezing your form into a thin strand. All you could do was hope that she'd reach her climax soon. You barely finished the thought before the heavy squeezing halted. The hippo's howling moan was a prelude to a torrent of thick slime rushing over your body. It was unbearably hot and slippery. You were in the middle of her pussy as she reached the height of pleasure. It tried in vain to clamp down on you and hold you down. But even with her climactic release helping you, is it enough?</span></div></div>",

She releases the spandex material which pushes you tightly against her skin with a loud <i>snap</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself plastered to the enormous ass of an alien anthro elephant, and what's worse, one that seems set on making you her private sex toy.

The doctor can hardly suppress her excited smile as she feels your feeble struggles against her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Barrah declares this initial exploration a dud, but do they have further plans for Earth?

The anthropomorphic hippo responds affirmatively and starts trekking in towards you immediately. You swallowed hard, already intimidated by this monstrous hippo woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she casually walked towards the bush you were hiding in, you noted some thing's about her appearance that you didn't notice before. Her absolutely gargantuan breasts, which projected several feet away from her, bounced in her red spandex jumpsuit, to supposedly handle her mammoth mammaries. It was doing a poor job though, despite it flexibility,as the fabric was tearing in several places as boob-flesh cascaded forth. Heck, if you looked hard enough, you could scarcely see her nipples press up against the straining fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shadow of her giant rack, an extremely well-fed, fully-covered up, blubbery belly wobbled along, love handles and gut pouring in all directions of her jumpsuit shorts, which looked painted on. Although the shorts itself was still containing the amount of butt cleavage, you could tel the fabric of the jeans itself was tearing, several seams having popped against her vast hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her lumber closer, the forest seemingly shaking with her weight and her footsteps leaving craters in the depressed forest floor. She was, you had to admit beautiful, with her stunning green eyes that almost glowed in the nighttime atmosphere, and her red hair that cascaded down her back in a ponytail. Although in that outfit she looked like a girl trying to be fashionable, but whose curves were just too much to pull it off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered how the she had gotten in that suit in the first place. Her figure must have made clothing herself difficult, since anything she wore  would have most likely struggled against her outrageous curves. You smiled to yourself, imagining the rest of the hippo's tugging desperately at Jackie's supposedly modest top, her gigantic breasts bulging out just refusing to be contained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back to reality, you saw the gigantic hippopotamus come to a halt in front of your hiding bush, her massive shadow slowly loomed over you ominously, blocking out the moonlight from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie\u2019s massive belly spilled over you, knocking over the tree behind you as it took up space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked from the monstrous, fully-exposed gut bulging in front of you, up at the gargantuan, balcony-like rack stretching out overhead. jackie\u2019s bosom was so enormous, it nearly pressed against the tree canopy of a tree she hadn't knocked over yet, forming a roof over your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm...this planet's natural flora is very weak \u201d she said amused at the tree's feeble attempt to stay upright, but you could only really see her smiling eyes looking down at you, since her giant breasts blocked most of the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh Crap! She's staring down at me! Maybe, she hasn't seen me yet, though.</i> You think to yourself, trying to remain optimistic about the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf a simple tree cannot withstand simple body contact, I wonder what would happen to this little bush\" she smirked, turning her massive form around, giving you a perfect view of her large, muscle laced ass, before your world went dark as said ass heavily sat down on your small form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SMAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie smiled, feeling her giant rear end wobble from the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disappointing, the plant barely put up any resistance. It was like it was asking to be sat on\u201d she said, rubbing the massive, spandex covered belly that spilled over her lap.</span></div></div>",

As a large, muscular, weapons specialist there was little she enjoyed more than easily exerting dominance, even over something as simple as vegetation. She shifted in her seat, enjoying the feeling of the flattened shrub beneath her massive ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she felt something else. Something moving in the way a plant would not. It was almost like a feeble attempt at resistance. Had she found the native, she wondered to herself. Allowing herself a few more comfortable wiggles, she stood up to give the bush a closer examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled broadly when she sawyer crushed form tangled in the shrub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so it wasn't the plant that wanted to be sat on, it was you!\" she remarked happily, but quietly. \"Well, allow me to grant your request. But first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled, but between the pain you felt and the bush that held you, there was nothing you could do but watch as Jackie pulled a vial of some odd colored liquid from between her breasts with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm don't usually play the role of a medic, but this should at least toughen you up some,\" she said, forcing your mouth open and pouring the liquid down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately felt the pain subside substantially and a rush of adrenaline course through your body. You started to pull yourself free from the bush, but before you could get away Jackie lifted you by the head as if she were palming a basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, about your request,\" she mused, letting your body fall to a clear area on the floor before once again presenting her imposing ass to you. Her smile grew broad as she let herself fall back over your small body, crushing you with her large muscular backside on impact. She happily bounced and wiggled over your flattened body, now knowing exactly who she was dominating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" she observed as she continued to smile, \"Even less resistance than the plant. You must be enjoying this native.\" </span></div></div>",

I think there's something you would like to see!\" You heard your captor say, although her voice was muffled through all of her fat crashing down on your comparisonly frail and meager form. Whatever it was she injected you with, It certainly made your situation more tolerable. You could no longer feel your pelvis cracking into individual pieces, and although it still hurt, it just wasent as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most strangest thing you noted, however, was how easily you were actually breathing. Some point earlier, while Jackie was shifylting her massive rump around you, your mouth accidentally opened in a desperate cry for help. Naturally, the only responds you got was a mouthful of butt-flab. It wasn't...really bad, when you think about it, but what was weird about it was you weren't fading out from lack of air. The airtight space between your body and her rear end did not leave room for a single breath. But strangely, as if your physiology had changed, it seambed breathing wasent a nessesity anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt Jackie's enormous weight release it's vice grip on you. Strangely, as you were once again exposed to the world, you felt cold. You shivered as you realized, rather embarrassed, that the situation you were in before was a much warmer alternative then the triffid, icy freedom of the night air. You looked up and saw the alien hippo's smug face, grinning at you as you writhed in cold. To her right was the steely expression of the first alien, Captain Barrah you think she's called. She was eyeing you like a child would Eye a toy in front of a store window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jackie, It has appeared you have found out native.\" The head hippo said to Jackie, her eyes never once leaving your body. \"...Can it talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, and without thinking, you decided to speak up for yourself to prove that you could, indeed, talk. However, you would come to realize later that was a bad idea, as you felt a splitting headache start to come on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The economy of course...being of primary...concern...\" you spoke, not really knowing what if was you were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Barranquilla made a displeased look. \"Oh great, Jackie. You broke it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax. I have him the serum, following protocal, he's perfectly fine. If anything, he faking it. Watch.\" You saw to your horror Jackie's heavy and padded foot slowly form a shadow over your body as she lifted it up above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could offer even the slightest bit of protest, her foot came defending down on your body. Specifically, in your crotch. \"See, he's perfectly-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!! WHYYYYY WOULD YOU DO THAT!?\" You scream at the top of your lungs as you felt the most extreme pain in your entire life. Even the pain of Jackie sitting on you before she injected you with the endurance serum didn't even compare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...oops.\" Jackie said quietly as she saw you weigh in pain of the forest floor. \"I thought he was stronger then that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackie. Get. Your. Foot. Off of his balls. Now.\" Captan Barrah instructed coldly. Wincing, she obeyed, lifting her pudgy foot off of your now definatley broken pelvis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself slowly black out, the pain being absolutley too much to bear. The last thing you saw was Captain Barrah's hand reaching out for your flailing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, my head.\" You rubbed your head as you slowly woke up. You found yourself in a room, no longer in the forest. It was pure white all around, and the various sets of equipment scattered around you could only mean you were in some kind of infirmity. \"Geeez, what happened?.. oh yeah, anthropomorphic hippo aliens from space. And an elaphant.\" Yiu tried getting up from your bed, but you felt a sharp pain in your crotch that kept you bound to your mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, your finnaly up. Good.\" You heard a voice from behind you speak. Heavy footfalls filled your ears as the owner of the voice came closer to you. You couldn't really hear well, still waking up, but as the figure came into vision, you could clearly see who it is...</span></div></div>",

That includes the one you are currently working solo, on President's Day. For most holidays, your park was incredibly busy making a full ranger staff very necessary. But based on your northern location, you saw very little activity on winter holidays due to the extreme cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in the ranger station trying to keep your 5'8 body as warm as possible. Suddenly, you felt the whole station rattle! Your area was not prone to earthquakes, but this definitely felt like one. You rush out of the station to survey the damage. To your surprise, everything seems fairly normal. Then your eyes fell on something very out of shape. An enormous aircraft that dwarfed your ranger station had settled into a landing just a few yards from your door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush back inside and pick up the phone inside the station to call for help, but drop the receiver as you find no dial tone. The wires are all connected fine, it seems like the craft is somehow interfering with your communications. You hear a noise outside, and wander back out the door to observe the strange craft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door has opened up and 5 statuesque creatures exited. You looked on in shock as they all have a resemblance to animals you are not unfamiliar with at your park. The exceptions are that they all are walking on their hind legs, have shapely feminine features, and all seem to eclipse at least 12 feet in height. They are also all dressed in some kind of form fitting space suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tallest of the group, at over 15 feet tall, is a bear anthro. She had the thickest features, particularly in her strong legs and firm, round ass. Next in height was a stately deer, being female she lacked horns, but her slim waist led up to an incredible rack and tapered down to a full ass. Next in line was a shapely red fox, or a vixen in this case. She had a sly look on her face and her suit did little to hide her incredible curves. Following her was an intimidating looking skunk. Her long, bushy tail flowed out from behind her suit, leading to an enormous ass. She had the widest hips of the group, and you shuddered to think of the powerful smells it could deliver. Finally, the \"smallest\" one at just 12 feet tall was an incredibly curvaceous squirrel woman. She had thicker thighs than all but the but bear and the largest chest of the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held the door open just a crack, allowing you to observe the alien visitors, hoping they hadn't seen you. Suddenly, one of their heads turns sharply, and she heads straight toward you and your station. Which anthro has spotted you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let's spread out and find him. But be careful, he's small. Don't let him slip past you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear growled angrily, bristling at being given orders by someone smaller than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who suddenly nominated you to be captain Viv?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the vixen could respond, the deer interrupted. \"Easy Bella, Viv is right. We need to canvas the area and get out quickly,\" she said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella sighed in frustration, but stepped down. \"Yes Captain,\" she said reluctantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViv turned and her smile grew broad as she quickly made her way to the location she knew kept you hidden, the small ranger station. You locked the door and retreated to the center of the room. Unfortunately, the weak door wasn't built to keep out 13 foot tall anthros, and the vixen easy pushed her way in. Before you could scramble away, she was all but on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello human,\" she said with a sadistic smile, putting her arm around you and holding you close to her shapely body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Vivian, third ranking officer of the Starship Fanged Explorer. But I'm hoping that finding you might help bump me up to First Officer. It'll certainly score points with Captain Diana, and it would be significantly more than that brute Bella ever contributed.\" she said, getting slightly side tracked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are unable to respond, mostly because Vivian has your face pressed up firmly against her body. She realizes the reason for your silence and relaxes her grip enough to allow you to breathe. After catching your wind, you introduce yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I'm Parker,\" you begin nervously. \"Wha....what are you doing here? What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian's smile grew. \"What I want...is you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all you needed to hear. You desperately tried to pull away from the fox, but even her relaxed grip was too much for you to break free from. Your escape attempt made her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going anywhere except back with me Parker. Now, the Captain did request us to be quick, so unfortunately I won't have the one on one time with you here I was hoping for,\" she said, rubbing her breast and crotch with her free hand. \"But I'll find a way to get it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a deal for you Parker,\" she continued, \"Once you're back on board our ship, Captain Diana will ask you to select your overseer. Your...primary companion so to speak. Request me and obey me, and I promise you there will never be a day you regret it,\" she said, licking her lips seductively. \"But request someone else, especially Bella, and I will use every ounce of energy I have to ensure your misery.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles at you, waiting for you to respond. It's not as if she's really giving you much of a choice, but how much do you <i>really</i> want to trust this fox?</span></div></div>",

She used her left arm to hold your back against her chest, and wrapped her right hand around your own. \"I believe this is how you would seal it in your culture,\" she explained, pumping your arm up and down in a rough approximation of a handshake. You got over the initial shock and were about to answer, when suddenly she brought her head down, stuck her tongue out, and <i>licked</i> all over one half of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's how we'd seal it in mine!\" She said cheerfully, while you sputtered and searched for words. She pressed you back against her suit and started walking immediately, and then lifted her free arm to start talking into what you can only assume is a comm device hidden around her wrist. \"Recon to Captain, Vivian here.\" She said. \"I've secured the package and am en route to LZ now. Request permission to board, over.\" Almost without delay, the suit beeped twice and flashed red around her forearm, shortly followed by the Captain's voice. <i>\"Captain to Vivian, permission granted. Over.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the comm went silent, you looked up, thinking to ask your captor about her companions. Before you could say anything, however, her wrist lit up and started beeping again. <i>\"Captain to star-pack,\"</i> said the voice. <i>\"Mission complete. All hands, report to conference room for debriefing and reassignment. Over.\"</i> \"Vivian to Captain,\" the vixen answered. \"Confirmed. Over. Confused?\" She added, looking down at you as she walked into the clearing where their ship was parked. \"Let me explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship's interior turned out to be every bit as massive as it appeared from the outside, and even Vivian's 13-foot stride needed a couple of minutes to cover the distance to the conference room. Most of the trip was by a single hallway, with plain, featureless doors made of some dull, tan-colored metal lining the walls at regular intervals. As you went, she briefly told you about their voyage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to Vivian, they were a part of the Pan-Arboro Systems Alliance, sent to study and document one of a number of planets suspected to harbor alien life. At first, they'd thought that Earth was too dense a planet to expect anything out of, and the voyage would be just a routine check and return. Instead, it seems, they showed up several months ago to find that life-forms here were very similar to their own, and had simply evolved to be much smaller to offset the higher gravity. She said that studying your species' tech and culture had taken much longer than expected, and, being strictly forbidden to reveal themselves in any way, the crew had quickly grown restless from being cooped up on the ship, stuck together in orbit for day after day without pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Especially</i> since it's all ladies, here. Ugh, don't even get me started.\" She continued, rolling her eyes. \"The guys all wanna sign up for invasio- well, anyway. Long story short, we were always gonna bring one of you back with us when we were done here. Part of the end-game was to see if we can cooperate with whatever species we find, so the first step is seeing how you get along as a part of our crew.\" She started petting you absentmindedly, rubbing your head with her palm as you tried your best to process all of that. This was a big deal! Your actions here could very well serve as the basis for your entire species' intergalactic relations! ...and so far, you've been licked, abducted, and petted, in no particular order. You really hoped it was just a cultural thing. Your legs dangled freely, forgotten, as Vivian turned the final corner to your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's where you come in,\" she finished. \"It's a bit early, but when we picked up your bio-readings so far out from any others, with an open window for getting in and out unobserved, well...\" She slapped her hand on the door at the end of the hall, which popped right open to reveal a large, open room with a massive round table in the center, and several figures loitering around it. \"Welcome to the crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were four other women already inside the room when you entered, and Vivian introduced them all after setting you atop the table and taking a seat right behind you. Surprisingly, all of these looked mostly human, but for a few key points. According to Vivian, this was because they were part of a slightly different race from her home planet, known as \"chimera types\" to her people. \"Careful,\" she warned. \"They may <i>look</i> a lot like you, but I assure you, they're not. They're more... wild, than the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Bellatrix, the cook. She's a slender 12-foot tall woman in a spacesuit like Vivian's, with long brown hair, a nervous manner, and a pair of long, brown rabbit ears protruding from her head. She looked away quickly after saying hi, and started scratching an ear with one of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Monica, the ship's mechanic. She's an easy 13 feet or more, though it's hard to be exact because she's perched atop a stool, squatting with her feet underneath her, showing you a muscular build with a medium bust and lithe, well-toned buttocks. Wearing a spacesuit so tattered as to be almost unrecognizable, Monica has short red hair and an easy smile - so easy, in fact, that you noticed her carefree manner just before you registered that she also had the feet and tail of a chimpanzee. \"Lil' guy like you might come in handy in the engine room,\" she noted cheerfully. \"Y'should swing by sometime, I'll show ya 'round!\" Then, as if remembering something, she stopped and frowned. \"Or, well... <i>walk</i> by, I guess...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was thinking about it, Vivian quickly moved on to Kaylie and Melanie, the last of the bunch. You hadn't noticed them before because they were sitting on the floor, while you were focusing on the two at the table - but once you've seen them, you double-take. Kaylie, who's head of security, is a lean, fit young woman between 13 and 14 feet tall, with shining silvery hair that goes down to her shoulders, and a set of kitty ears sticking out atop of it. She has long, slender limbs and perky curves, and the uniform she wears - a tighter, more form-fitting version of the other crewmates', dyed a deep black, - does absolutely nothing to disguise them. She sat with her knees out and feet together, a long, silvery cat's tail waving back and forth as she played with the girl in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl she was playing with was Melanie, the ship's quartermaster. At a glance, she must be around two feet tall and stood encircled in the gap made by Kaylie's legs, warding off the larger girl's hands and trying not to laugh as they tickled her. She has long, messy blond hair with matching mouse ears and tail, and a voluptuous build under the regular ship's uniform. She didn't answer when Vivian called their names, doubling over to catch her breath while Kaylie looked up and fixed you in a set of wide, golden-yellow cat's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, Kaylie had jumped onto the table to land in front of you, clearing the full distance and landing on all fours with hardly a sound. \"Why, hello little one~\" she purred, looming over you. You noticed her fingernails were black in color, and pointed. She leaned down until her face was right in front of you, still fixing you with that expressionless stare.\"H-hi,\" you stammered, stepping back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylie crept lazily forward to match you. \"You're a lot bigger than my other toy~\" she went on, and you realized she was <i>actually</i> purring. Before you could react, she'd opened her mouth to reveal a set of pointy white fangs, and darted forward to lick your face with a rough, pink tongue. You heard Vivian's laughter from behind you, and then her arm reached around to pull you back against her chest. \"Alright, enough of that,\" said the fox. \"Pinky here hasn't been treated yet, and I can't have him getting hurt. Besides,\" she grinned playfully, as her other hand came around to start petting you again. \"He's not <i>your</i> toy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat won a hoot of laughter from Monica and a shy giggle from Bellatrix, while Kaylie turned indignantly and jumped back down to her original spot on the floor. \"Hey!\" Melanie objected. \"That goes for me, too!\" And then Kaylie sat down and picked her up in both hands. Ignoring the smaller girl's protests, she stretched out the top half of Melanie's suit and pulled it down to her waist, and then started purring again while licking all over her back and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the room went silent, as Captain Diana walked in flanked by the bear, skunk, and squirrel you recognized from earlier. Getting right down to business, all four of them sat down at the table, and Diana briefly went over the situation. Mostly she just repeated more of what you've already heard from Vivian, but when she mentions overseers, you get distracted by the sight of Vivian casually licking the back of her hand. She catches you staring and winks, making you flush with embarrassment, and you turn away to see that everybody's looking at you expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um. Right.\" You fumble, trying to remember the question. \"Overseer... yes. About that. Could mine be Vivian?\" For a tense moment, the Captain says nothing, and you start worrying that you've been found out. Then she shrugs, and turns to Vivian. \"Officer? Yes, I see you're fine with that arrangement. Very well, over to you then. But starting with the treatment, please. Wouldn't want to lose him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treatment, as Vivian explains while carrying you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vivian held you against her chest with one arm while walking, and while you tried to follow what she was saying as much as possible, it was hard to pay attention to words like \"noninvasive subatomic energy transference\" and \"polyaromatic biomatrix formation\" because, honestly, her boobs kept bouncing against your head. At one point, she stopped to ask you if you got the idea. Somewhat embarrassed, you told her that you didn't, and tried asking her to let you walk from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, nope!\" She laughed. \"As your Overseer, I'm responsible for your safety and all kinds of things could happen to a little guy like you down there!\" She put on an exaggerated playful tone for the last part, like grown-ups use when they're talking to little kids, and used her other hand to shove your head against her breasts while she said it. You tried to resist, shouting out some muffled protests, but she easily laughed off your puny efforts and just kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally let you up about another minute later, you were in a small (for her, anyway) room with a dial pad by the door, and a white circle marked out on the floor in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's what you need to know\" she says, gently setting you down on the floor by the circle in front of her. \"The 'treatment' is a chemical process that will make you super tough and durable, but to do that, it has to use some of your body mass. You'll get smaller.\" She adds, as if you need an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got that\" you answer irritably. Your damn traitor dick had started hardening while she was smothering you with her tits, and you've been awkwardly half-crouching to conceal it, desperately wishing it to go away again, since she first put you down. Of course, first contact with a new sapient race was bound to lead to some... embarrassing misunderstandings. You tell yourself that that's all this is, and you should try to just power right through it. It may have <i>seemed</i> like the overseer was making advances on you, but that was probably just how it looked from a human perspective. That was probably perfectly normal behavior in their own culture... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you mean I'll burn some fat, or what?\" You ask, only partly stalling. You're in pretty decent shape as it is, but if some super-advanced alien steroids were gonna burn another pound or two for you then hey, why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Vivian shakes her head in answer. \"Nope! Some of everything\" she tells you. She puts her hands up and holds them, facing each other, about three feet apart. \"Same proportions, smaller scale\" she clarifies, moving the hands a little closer together as a demonstration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you think you'd misunderstood, but then it hits you and you realize she's serious. \"Smaller!?\" You cry out in disbelief. \"You want to make me even <i>smaller</i>!? That's crazy! How is that supposed to be safe? You're all friggin' huge next to me already! Bad enough if one of you trips and lands on me or something, as it is!\" Vivian starts to lean down and reach out to grab you, but apparently thinks better of it and holds them up to make calming motions at you. She looks uncertain, like she doesn't know what kind of movement will set you off. You sigh. \"Alright\" you say, grudgingly calming down. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Look, it won't be <i>that</i> much smaller.\" Vivian tells you soothingly. \"No telling exactly how much - it's different for everyone - but I lost about twenty percent of my body mass when I got it, and I'm an extreme case. Captain Diana, for example, she only lost four or five. That's about what most people lose. And as for safety-\" she holds up a hand as you get ready to cut in, stopping you short. \"In return, you'll get proportionally stronger, and <i>exponentially</i> more pressure-resistant. That includes impacts, strains, tears - even cuts, to some extent. As a bonus, you'll also get much better night vision and water retention, corrosion resistance, and metabolic activity. That means a drastic reduction in the amount of food and air you'll need to eat and breathe.\" She adds, seeing your reaction. You hesitate, and think for a moment. That actually sounds like a pretty good deal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty percent?\" You finally answer, after thinking over the pros and cons for a while. The way she was talking, you were basically about to get a bunch of superpowers from this treatment - what's another foot or so, when you're so much shorter than the rest of them already? Besides, you kind of doubt that they're really going to let you refuse. Captain's orders, after all. So you might as well try to get it done on your own terms...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty percent. Honest.\" Vivian holds her right hand up, in a comical impression of somebody taking an oath. \"Like I said, I was an extreme case - but if you somehow lose more than I did, then I promise I'll have it reversed if you want. Okay?\" \"Fine,\" you sigh. \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to strip off your clothes and go stand in the middle of that circle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any clothing will get fused to your body if you're wearing it. Look we have miniature suits onboard, okay? Should be one or two that are small enough for you, afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some coaxing, you grudgingly turn around and undress in front of Vivian, keeping your back turned towards her regardless. Suddenly cold and feeling increasingly awkward without your clothes, you start walking forward immediately without looking back, wanting to get this whole thing over with. You're pretty sure you can feel her leering at your back - and nothing can leer quite like a 13-foot-tall vixen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you imagine, anyway, as you stand in the middle of the sumo ring-sized circle and stare determinedly at the far wall. Suddenly there's a clamor above you and you look up, startled, to see a ceiling panel retract, revealing several large metal nozzles pointed straight in your direction. Without warning one of them starts hissing, and then everything goes dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM. BOOM.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open your eyes, you're lying face down on the floor. You're groggy, and all your vision is blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM. BOOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a loud booming noise behind you. It's getting louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM. BOOM.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head starts to clear, and your vision starts to focus. You start to climb onto your hands and knees, and then a massive, powerful red-colored fist swoops down from above and wraps around your torso. You're swept up and around in a blur, and then you stop, suspended in midair, in front of the incredibly enormous vision of your Overseer's grinning face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can think is: '<i>Warm</i>', as your head's still clearing. Her grip fits snugly under your arms and all the way down to your thighs, but your head, shoulders, and legs feel cold by comparison. Only when she's breathing in, though, since you're close enough to her face so that the hot air washes over you in a breeze whenever she exhales. It feels nice, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, you sober up and start to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, WELL!\" Vivian's laughter booms out at you, as you start to panic and struggle wildly in her grip. \"ISN'T THIS EXTRAORDINARY? YOU'RE EVen smaller than Melanie, now!\" Halfway through, she seems to realize how loud she's sounding, and starts to soften her tone. She's right. You figure you're about a foot tall, give or take a couple inches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was more than twenty percent!\" You shout. \"That was WAY more than twenty percent! Undo it! Change me back!\" You stop flailing, and grab tightly with both hands to the index finger that she has wrapped around you, holding on and literally trying to get a grip. You had a deal. She would be reasonable. You just had to calm down and talk it over, and everything would be okay. This was just a temporary setback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of mock innocence on her face was not helping you in this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty percent?\" She says innocently. \"Silly Parker, that was WAY less than twenty percent of MY body mass! I said if you lose more THAN I DID, remember?\" She laughs as you start shouting in protest, and effortlessly talks right over you as if she hadn't noticed. \"AND BESIDES, WITH HOW EFFECTIVE THAT TREATMENT WAS, YOU MUST BE PRACTICALLY INDESTRUCTIBLE! HERE, WATCH THIS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout asking for your permission, she grabs your right arm between a thumb and forefinger, and then <i>pulls</i> it from your shoulder. For a horrifying moment, you think it's going to tear off... but... it's fine? To your bewilderment, you see your arm pop out of its socket almost painlessly, feeling only the discomfort of the strain she's put on it by pulling. Then you watch as it stretches out over several times its length like a rubber band, before she lets go and sends it snapping back to its original shape. The impact knocks the wind out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments your arm's reformed, but Vivian still isn't done with you. Grabbing your legs with her free hand, she opens her grip around your waist, and then brings you up to her eye level for a closer look. \"Hmm,\" she muses, examining your crotch. \"Gosh, the little guy sure is shy isn't he? No wonder you were trying to hide him.\" She laughs. Your dick's shriveled up in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll make him come out!\" She declares, suddenly pulling back the top of her spacesuit and dropping you inside. You land between her warm, soft, furry mounds before the suit snap back into place over you, leaving you in darkness. Immediately you fall down deeper as Vivian grabs her tits in either hand and pulls them apart, only to slam them back together again and squeeze. You have the breath forced out of your lungs and are left stuck to her left breast, flattened by the impact, as she pulls them apart again for round two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey wakey, Little Parker!\" Vivian sang, as she mashed her boobs together repeatedly. \"And I hope you're a lot bigger than you look, or 'Big' Parker's going to have to fill in for the job.\" She added under her breath, knowing full well that you could hear. \"Finally get a man on the ship, and he's fun-sized for my convenience!\" She laughed as she left for...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Vivian squashed you with her boobs over and over on her way back to the conference room, you came to notice that your eyes quickly got adjusted to the darkness in her cleavage much better than, you think, they actually should. There really isn't even any light at all getting through to you inside her essentially skintight suit, but on the rare occasions when you're able to peel your face away from her left breast before getting smashed back into it again, you're able to get a pretty clear (if dimly colored) picture of your surroundings. Like how you're hanging over empty space whenever the tits pull apart, for example, and that the only thing keeping you from falling right between them and down to her pelvis in those moments is the fact that the rest of your body's still flat and sticking to one of those tits. Well, that was certainly something worth thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it was terrible, because you hadn't got used to your new body yet and so you kept thinking that you were about to die. For instance, the pressure itself wasn't really painful - actually, your surroundings were really yielding and soft. But your brain wasn't used to the idea of your body feeling that much pressure without some kind of damage, and so it flooded your neurons with danger signals every time and caused you to panic, even though you didn't feel any actual harm being done (although feeling your bones pop out and bend and stretch like rubber was definitely pretty weird). Similarly, you didn't actually <i>need</i> to breathe - not as far as you could tell, anyway. But you were still trying to do so out of habit, and so you freaked out for a while when your couldn't inhale because your flattened lungs didn't have time to re-inflate between squeezes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you realize you weren't actually in any danger at all, you're able to relax, and even secretly kind of start enjoying the ride. Okay, granted, downsides include: extremely bumpy ride, can't move, not getting a say in any of this, and really... weird sexual implications vis-a-vis involuntary &amp; unsanctioned boner development while in unrestricted, full-body direct contact with foxfur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side: warm, soft, squishy, boob-shaped... they're boobs! And they're <i>huge!</i> No one could blame you for appreciating that, you think. It sounds better if you think of your captor as more of a giant foxy alien than a giant alien fox, though you couldn't really say why. Fondling animals was weird; fondling aliens was just kinky. That's all there is to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, you don't really have much time to think about it. It seems like you've just settled in when the ride stops, and you get momentarily blinded as the vixen pulls out her suit collar and peels you off of her tit, dragging you out into the light with your chest pinched between her fingers. As your eyes adjust to the sudden light you see she's standing in an empty hallway, just before the extra-large door that you recognize as leading to the conference room. Or one that looks just like it, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian speaks to you cheerfully but using obviously hushed tones, as if she's trying not to get overheard. \"Ooh, well look at that!\" She whispers mischievously, pointing to your erection. You immediately try to hide it with your hands, stammering an apology and somehow feeling like you're the one at fault here. (You weren't, but in your experience there is never any justice in these circumstances.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on now. Let me see\" she grins, using one hand to hold your legs while the other one pins your arms above your head, \"I helped make it, after all!\" You give up struggling as she grins, realizing you're getting nowhere, and try pleading instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vivian, come on. This is unprofessional.\" You whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian nods. \"I agree\" she says, suddenly serious. You sigh in relief, thinking you've finally made your point... But then she smiles and adds: \"But I won't hold it against you. Lucky for you, MY people aren't so uptight about that kind of thing! It just shows you want to get off on me - so what?\" She snorts. \"You people lie to yourselves all the time, pretending not to be something that everybody knows you're all hard-wired to be.\" Her eyes roll dismissively but she lets go of your arms, and you quickly use them to salvage whatever's left of your modesty as she keeps on talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kind of want to interrupt but think this might be helpful info, for understanding these anthros' culture and society. \"Really, you people are so silly\" she was saying. \"When you pleasure yourselves, it's just shamefully self-indulgent - but when you do the same thing to someone else when they aren't asking for it, it's horribly selfish and even criminal? Tell me how <i>that</i> makes any sense.\" \"Wait,\" you say. \"So you're trying to tell me that <i>raping</i> people, in your culture, is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a big deal, yeah.\" She says. \"A little impolite, maybe, but... so what? See how we're dressed? That's cause we know there's no point in hiding it when we have those urges. Everyone else gets them too, don't they? We don't see a need to make a whole big fuss over it. Sex is just sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my people do think it's a big deal.\" You tell her. \"And we think it's wrong to force yourself on other people, so if you wouldn-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah!\" Vivian cuts you off irritably, waving a hand in dismissal. \"But you're on our ship now, so you're gonna have to get used to our way of doing things. That's the whole point, remember? To see if people from your planet can learn to work with our Alliance people. We're the more advanced civilization, after all. No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your point,\" you admit. \"But you're asking a lot, it sounds like. What if I can't go along with all of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then you'll be seen as a non-cooperative species.\" She frowns. \"Which means we'll send out invasion and subjugation forces, and trust me they'll be a lot less well-behaved. Better it didn't come to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You abducted me against my will,\" you point out. \"And also blackmailed me, and then manhandled and molested me without my permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Deal was, there'd never come a day where you regret choosing me. Day's not over yet, Parker. You'll see. I'm about to show you to the others again, now that you're cleared on safety issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at the door as she said so, and made to reach out her hand. \"Got any more advice, then?\" You ask. \"Any more important things for me to know about?\" She thinks a moment, and nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't masturbate. Ever.\" She tells you seriously. You frown, about to tell her off, but she gives you a look that says she isn't joking around on this one. \"We've all been stuck on this ship together for a really long time now\" she says, \"and not one of us has beaten off in all that time. It's considered terribly disgraceful for our people. If your urge is so bad that you can't hold out any more, at least get someone else to do it with, and you'll both have it taken care of instead of just one. Even if it means getting a partner of the wrong sex, at least it's not just yourself. Yuck!\" She makes a face and shudders, as if disgusted by the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far we've been making do with each other every now and then, plus whatever the deal is with Kay and Mel exactly, but I can't even tell you how excited everyone was to have a male around the ship for once. Right now they're all on their best behavior, because we know this is a lot for you to handle at the moment, but you should know that it isn't easy for them to hold back like this either. We're used to being a lot more direct with what we want - like me,\" she grins. \"And I've just been taking it easy on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all being quite understanding, in the circumstances. They're trying not to force anything else on you for now if they can help it. So if they ever find out that they've all gone out of their way to give you some space 'til you were ready, only to find that you've been ignoring them while taking care of <i>yourself</i> all along... well, it's what you people would call 'a slap in the face', only worse. <i>They'd</i> never choose a pleasure toy over <i>you</i>, even though you're basically the size of one and freakishly bald all over, and tailless.\" She frowns at you, in her palm. \"Get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it's not like there's a point in arguing. \"Yeah\" you answer. \"I guess.\" In other words, your planet's future would likely come to depend, among other things, on your compliance with occasionally serving as a sex aid for eight gigantic alien females, with varying degrees of animal features, who incidentally found it very important that you be virtually indestructible in the meantime. You try to tell yourself that doesn't sound awesome at all but behind your hands, which are held over your privates, something twitches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian seems to notice, and raises an eyebrow at you knowingly. \"We can cover that up for now\" she smirks, closing her fist around your waist and legs. \"Otherwise, someone will take it as an invitation.\" She slaps the door with her free hand, and takes you into the conference room as it flashes blue and pops open. \"Recruit's been treated, Captain\" she calls out right away, coming to a stop before the table. \"Compatibility was unusually high - likely equal to or even greater than Ensign Melanie's, based on his appearance.\" She flourishes you in her hand, to a round of gasps around the table and a couple of astonished titters. \"I'd like to clear him for registration.\" She smiles proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the stately deer could answer, the curvy skunk anthro speaks up. \"Respectfully Captain, I disagree\" she declares. \"As the ship's doctor, I should at least examine him first, just in case. Some aspects of the treatment may not have worked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As the scientist, Suzy, I assure you they have!\" Viv retorted. \"I did some testing, Captain, and I'd stake my promotion on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and who said you were up for promotion Viv?\" Growled the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana spoke. \"We'll see\" she said gently, smiling. \"Viv, go ahead and...\"</span></div></div>",

That should satisfy our physician for now\" said the Captain, shrugging slightly. \"I'd rather not make this transition any more stressful for the native than it has to be, and he seems to trust you well enough already. You know the stories they tell each other about alien visitors and medical exams\" she added, with a wan smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella snorted. Suzy rolled her eyes. Bellatrix tittered shyly and looked away, pawing an ear, while Monica laughed outright. Kaylie didn't even look up; she just put Melanie down on the floor, and then pounced on her when she made a run for the table. The tip of her tail swayed back and forth in the air as she crouched over the hapless mouse girl, pinning her to the ground with a hand. But Vivian was completely stonefaced. \"Captain.\" She answered tersely, without the slightest hint of amusement. To your surprise, you saw that her hackles were slightly raised, with the fur around her neck and shoulders lifting just a little bit out from the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the other anthros in the room looked over and saw it too. The laughter died. The room went quiet. You could have heard a pin drop. Slowly, Vivian turned her head to face you, growing visibly calmer in the process. \"Is that okay with you, Parker?\" She asked, to your surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough shocked, you recover quickly. \"Oh, yeah?\" You answer bitterly. \"I get a say, now?\" She looks wounded by this, but shakes her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only for who does it,\" she admits. \"I was trying to get it done with as... painlessly as possible. I should have known that you'd have to go through it again anyway. I'm sorry.\" She sounds so pitiful that you actually start to feel kind of sorry for her. Then she takes a deep breath, gathers her bearing, and looks you dead in the eye. \"I won't do it if you don't want me to.\" She declares. \"Orders are orders so it has to be done, but I want you to know that <b>I</b>, for one, won't do it unless you say so.\" She looks around defiantly, daring anyone to object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly you're the victim here, but... looking around, you see that most of the crew is either looking at her with sympathy, or looking away out of embarrassment. The only exceptions are the Captain, who looks conflicted, and... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella steps forward with her fists clenched, hackles raised, looking angry enough to spit. \"Like hell you won't!\" She roars. \"You have your orders, now-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Enough!</i>\" Diana slams her fist on the table, silencing everyone. Even Kaylie stops playing around and looks up at her, frozen. Diana turns to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vivian's right\" she says. \"Parker, I apologize. I know it's late, but would you rather undergo a formal examination? Better late than never, as you people say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to Vivian, who looks at you worriedly, and then turn back again to the Captain. \"No. It's fine,\" you decide, albeit hesitantly. \"I can trust her... I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana nods. \"I think so too, which is why I've just decided to make her my new First Officer.\" Bella sputters in shock and anger as she hears this, but Diana ignores her and turns to the rabbit-eared girl instead. \"Trixie, how long until we're ready for takeoff?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-six to ten minutes now, Captain. Minimum six, ideally ten\" the girl stutters, pawing an ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana nods. \"Right\" she says to Vivian. \"There's your time frame, let's get this over with.\" \"I only need one.\" Says Vivian, grabbing you with your head and chest in one hand, and your legs in another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout preamble, she pulls the two apart, stretching your body to several feet in length. \"Elastic,\" she says, walking over to a stool and pressing your head end into it. Then she sits on your head, stretching the other end up towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tensile\" she says, laying your taut-stretched legs across her lower jaw. She pulls them across her teeth, then pulls them down on each side, like dental floss. \"Shthock,\" she mouths awkwardly, before lifting her rear end up slightly from the chair. Suddenly free, your head snaps back into the rest of your body, flying up and slamming into her teeth with incredible force. She lets go of your legs as well, and then slowly starts to close her mouth. \"Comprethhive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her lips come closed around you, your top and lower halves are still stuck between her teeth on either side, and your midriff is stretched thin across the middle and over her tongue. Once the mouth's closed her tongue comes up, and starts pushing up against the obstruction - you. <i>'I'm stuck between her teeth'</i> you think, as your waist and shoulders get caught on either side. <i>'She was just flossing with me, and I'm literally now a thing that can get stuck in her teeth'</i>. And then you pop free at each end, and feel your top and lower halves snap back together. Well, that's a relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour relief doesn't last for long. Your head and arms, as well as your legs and knees, were hanging outside Vivian's mouth before, but get drawn in past her lips as they're pulled back together again. There's not much room at all, until you feel the warm and slimy surface of the tongue shift from under you, squeezing your body against the bumpy roof of her mouth and rearranging until you're splayed out facing forward, where you can almost lay down completely flat without pressing against the insides of her teeth or the back of her throat. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was all just for show. Next thing you know, the tongue shifts and throws you sideways, where the teeth part and then come down with you between them, flattening a dent into the length of your body that was as wide as your fist. Then her cheeks push you back in and her tongue folds you over, only for the teeth to come down and stamp another indentation in. This happens over and over, until your body's become as soft and shapeless as the piece of chewing gum that she's treating it as. At that point she sticks out her tongue, with you balled up on top of it, to show everybody what she's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahh!\" Says Vivian before pulling her tongue back in, and closing her mouth again to let you reform your shape within. A few seconds later she pushed your head out between her lips, showing everyone that you were fine. You looked around and blinked wildly, trying to shake the saliva out of your face before she pursed her lips and sucked you back in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough?\" She asked the Captain, after cramming you into one of her cheeks so she could talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so\" said the deer. \"Suzy?\" She asked, turning to the skunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit unorthodox\" said the physician, reluctantly, \"but I suppose it's good enough for a preliminary.\" Vivian nodded. She was making some rather strange motions with her tongue and cheeks now, but nobody moved to question her. Seemed like she knew what she was doing, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...which is why she could have you pinned between her teeth and cheeks, technically raping you with her tongue rubbing back and forth along your crotch, and get away with it all right in front of everyone. The last person to pick a fight with her over you had been Bella, and she'd immediately been demoted for it. Vivian's expression gave away nothing at all as she moved you to climax, and your gasps and moans never make it outside the confines of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gathers the resulting fluid together in a pool with her spit, and then releases draws you back in from her cheek and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pinned lengthwise against the outside of Vivian's teeth while her tongue worked between them, sliding up and down your front from groin to face, you struggled and strained but weren't strong enough to even budge against the muscles of her jaws, tongue, and cheek. You ended up with one arm trapped against the top row of gums and the other against the bottom, and the same with either leg, effectively straddling the gap between her smooth, white molars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour new darkvision had kicked in a while ago, and you saw as well as felt the rows of teeth come apart in front of you to show the slick, shiny, soft writhing tongue beyond. \"N-no! Don't...!\" You cried - but not too loudly, as it slid out toward you for another pass. \"Nnno- ohhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twitch of the cheek pushed your head in between her teeth, which gently clamped down to hold you in place while the tongue pressed against you sideways. The hot, slippery, bumpy muscle moving along your skin felt great in general, and downright irresistible against your cock and balls. You shouted more feeble protests and objections, but with your face pressed into the wet squishy tongue, they were so muffled that you could barely even hear them yourself, and you achieved nothing but a mouthful of her saliva for your trouble... so you did it again, and then again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you climaxed. Your shouts gave way to a general groan, and your whole body arched and went stiff for a second - at least, as much as it could, given the circumstances. You squirted several times into her mouth and then collapsed, totally spent for the time being, after your load was blown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really care very much when her jaw opens up, and you're dumped right back onto the center of her tongue - splashing right into a pool of spit, in fact, which you're all but certain you've just jizzed in. You don't even care when she gathers a whole bunch of more saliva in with it, and washes it all back and forth over your body before sucking you dry and swallowing, and then spits you out into her waiting hand. You blink repeatedly in the sudden light, looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room and occupants looked much the same as before, and Captain Diana met your eye as Vivian, - looking for all the world as if nothing unusual had happened at all, - held you casually in her palm. It feels different, though. Compared to the warm interior of the fox's mouth it seems cold and rough out here, and vacant. Now that you've adjusted to the constant booming voice, breath, and smacking, slurping flesh in that environment, the silence outside feels oppressively empty. Honestly, a part of you almost wishes you could have stayed in there a while longer - and it's not even just your dick this time, as your recent experience has left it soft and feeling sated for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the captain's voice snapped you out of your reverie. \"Parker\" she asked, \"how are you feeling? Any complications we should know about, as far as you can tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself shaking your head in denial. \"Umm... no\" you answered. <i>Should I tell her? Does she already know?</i> You wondered. <i>I should... right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for some reason, you didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana nodded her head, and held out a hand. \"Register new crewmate: Recruit Parker, Clearance Level Six\" she commanded. A small device on her wrist lights up and scans over you with a red laser, and then projects... a blank, red square as a hologram in front of you. Then the words 'RECRUIT PARKER / HUMAN / MALE' appear at the top, just over another line that reads 'INSERT BIOMETRIC SAMPLE'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Place your hand in the open area and hold,\" the doe explains. \"That will register your genetic makeup in the database, so you'll be able to identify and access any area you've been cleared for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, it feels solid. The hologram blinks for a few seconds, and then dims slightly as the feed scrolls up to read: 'ERROR - CALIBRATION FAILURE / SAMPLE PURITY LEVEL BELOW SPECIFICATIONS'. You look quizzically at the captain, but she seems just as surprised as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange\" she says. \"That's never happened before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other crewmates seem just as confused until suddenly, the squirrel - Charlotte - bursts out laughing. \"Oh, I get it!\" She exclaims, as the others turn to look. \"Don't you see? It's the spit! He's covered in Vivian's spit!\" She howled with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlotte, this is a 20-CMI scanner. You can't just fool it with a bit of saliva\" Diana said crossly, enjoying none of the humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but you can mess up a calibration with it - if you're as small as he is!\" She pointed at you, guffawing so hard now that she doubled over and had to sit down. \"To him that's like a half-inch layer! The scanner thinks he's, like, ten percent Viv! Ah hahahaha!!!...\" You glared at her, flushing red with embarrassment as everyone else on the room tried, with varying degrees of success, to keep a straight face. Trixie giggled quietly into her hands while giving you a look of heartfelt sympathy, which honestly made it worse. They just <i>had</i> to rub it in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana ignored them, turning back to address you when Vivian spoke up instead. \"I'll dry him off, Captain\" she said, sounding slightly embarrassed. \"Least I can do, seeing as it's my fault.\" You were about to object, seeing as you were damn well capable of drying yourself thank you very much, when her hand closed around you and cut off your reply. Grabbing her tail in the other hand, she rubbed you swiftly but gently on the bushy appendage using it like a rag... or, arguably, using you like a comb. Either way, it's soft and warm and dry and gets the job done quick. It's just a good thing you're not allergic to foxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There\" she says, opening her palm face-upwards to let you stand again. \"Just traces of me on him; it should work now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does; this time the hologram flashes green when you put your hand to it, and the display reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'BIOMETRIC PROFILE COMPLETE. ADDED TO REGISTRY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRANK: RECRUIT / CLEARANCE: 6 / POSITION: []'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana nodded. \"About that, Overseer. Any leads on assigning the new recruit? Not that I can think of any, given his stature\" she muttered ruefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Human services!\"</i> Charlotte blurted out suddenly, as if she'd been holding it in for some time, and collapsed in another fit of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers soon join her. Even Diana shows just a crack of a smile as Vivian raises an eyebrow meaningfully at her, though you're not sure what the joke is. Sure, you're probably not the best person to put in charge of hiring staff around here, but it's not <i>that</i> funny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Anyway</i>, no.\" Vivian gets right to the point, steering the course of the meeting sharply back on course. \"I actually think his current size could be a lot more useful than the original - before, he wasn't big enough for ordinary tasks, and he wasn't small enough for anything else. Now... well, there could be advantages. I'll need some time to think it over\" she said, serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana nodded. \"All right, then. Now, about his dress-\" she looks at you and grimaces, as if it brings her some discomfort- \"I must admit, I still have some difficulty overlooking this species'... natural appearance. Quartermaster, can we adapt a suit for him? That should help to conceal the more obvious deformations; baldness, missing tail, what have you.\" She turned, receiving no reply. \"Quartermaster?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no two-foot tall mouse girl at the far end of the table. There was only a thirteen-foot tall cat girl lying back with her hand on her belly, and purring contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps sensing that something was wrong, her ears perked up as the room went silent, and she sat up and looked around wide-eyed. \"Meow?\" She emoted, positively radiating innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate her again, didn't you?\" Diana sighed, frustrated, closing her eyes and pressing her hands against her temples. Kaylie, contriving to look pitiful, opened her mouth and held up one finger to stall for a reply, but Diana was having none of it and stood up abruptly. \"ENOUGH. We don't have time for this. Viv, we'll have to clothe your human later. Kaylie, you're on floor duty until one of us can get a look at Melanie - no napping or resting until then. Trixie, get us back in orbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone else, we're taking off - get to the bridge or to your quarters, now! Move! Move! Move!\" She shouted and clapped her hands at the last part, clearing the conference room of anthros in a hurry. Only Vivian remained, holding you, hesitating for just a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" The captain cut her off, speaking brusquely. \"You can bunk together.\" She looked the pair of you up and down, critically. \"That's what you were going to ask, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly interject: \"You know, I don't think that will be necessa-whoah!\" A slight shift in Vivian's palm caused you to lose your balance and fall over suddenly, interrupting your reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian smoothly cuts in as you break off, easily drowning out any attempts to finish your point thanks to her overwhelming size. \"Just safety concerns of course, Captain.\" She says, with obviously disingenuous sincerity. The kind that usually has \"wink wink, nudge nudge\" added to the end of it. \"Because of his size, and the rest of the crew, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" The captain rolls her eyes and gives a brief, exasperated smile in return. \"Look, I don't want to know alright? At least, for now\" she hints, coyly. Vivian closes her fist around your chest, preventing you from objecting as the captain shoots you a wink. \"Do take care of her, Recruit. She's my First Officer, you know,\" she quips, before turning on her heel and walking out. \"Dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Vivian teases once she's gone, smirking and loosening her grip on you. \"Always nice to have options, isn't it?\" Yet another victory for the 13-foot vixen. \"Now, we're about a minute to takeoff - just enough time to show you your quarters and where you'll be sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't fail to notice that she said that as if those weren't the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre they?</span></div></div>",

After all this practice you're finally starting to get used to all the wild, crazy motion when she stops, holding you out in front of another plain, unassuming door like most of the others you've come across before. This time, however, little lights flash across its surface when you look at the door, lighting up to say: RECRUIT PARKER, [UNASSIGNED] in blocky red letters. \"Here we are!\" The fox tells you cheerfully. \"Now, just put your hand on the door to open it. It's officially your room, so you'll be able to get in and out of it anytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door whisks apart at your touch to reveal what probably would have been a tiny, plain little closet of a room, if you'd been anywhere around the size of Vivian and the others. \"Bunk, flight-seat, retractable sink.\" Your guide tells you, pointing at each item in turn. \"It's not much, but I think I'll take it\" she adds, grinning mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" You ask her, wincing painfully as you see another one of her antics coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour suspicion is confirmed as she laughs and wheels out of the room, you in hand, letting the door sweep shut again behind her. \"I mean, of course, that as your Overseer, I've been given access to this room too\" she tells you with a smirk. \"And since you won't be using it yourself really, in any case, well...\" the next door she stops at lights up to read 'FIRST OFFICER VIVIAN, RECON'. At her touch it opens up to reveal a much grander, more spacious set of living quarters, with nearly a full-sized bed at the end with some actual furnishing, including desk and chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\" she adds, her voice taking on a lustier tone as the door sweeps shut behind her. \"You'll be nice and safe in here...\" She sweeps the hand you're in up and down over her body as she says this, and begins fondling her breasts and crotch with the other. You look back at the door with a frantic glance, and the words \"NOT AUTHORIZED FOR ENTRY\" pop up underneath the label. You're sure you know what is coming as she strides toward the bed, and the only thing it fills you with more than excitement is fear. \"Hold on, hold on, Vivian - wait!\" You call, desperately stalling for time as the bed frame draws closer. \"Slow down just a min-nngh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout pausing, Vivian lifts you to her gaping, salivating maw and licks, running your whole face and chest over the hot, slimy tissue. Again and again she repeats, without pause, slurping and even sucking on your body like a candy, making sure to gather extra-large globs of spittle from her drooling mouth with which to coat you with. After a few chaotic seconds she lets go, pulling you up into her mouth completely where she works you back and forth, savoring the flavor as she swiftly gets undressed. \"MMM, THAT'S THE STUFF PARKER\" she pants, warm air rushing past as her voice booms around you. \"NOW THAT I'M FIRST OFFICER, ONLY THE CAPTAIN AND I CAN GET THROUGH THAT DOOR... AND NOW FOR THAT ONE-ON-ONE TIME, MY TASTY LITTLE TREAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing onto the bed on all fours, Vivian spat her tiny human out onto the mattress in front of her, crawling toward him deliberately. Meanwhile, you took a moment to gather your bearings after the sudden fall and tumble, and turned around to see the massive vixen looming over you, stark naked, breasts swinging freely, crotch glistening at the lips, closing in on you with an intent, hungry look in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo of course, you turned and ran, not even thinking about it - about anything, except how overwhelmingly helpless you are before all of that. Behind you, Vivian smiled, amused and somewhat delighted by your efforts. The foreplay was half the fun, after all. She let you go a short distance and then pounced, letting herself fall flat onto her stomach, dropping her huge body down on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd barely made a few steps before you felt the rocking behind and a giant shadow appeared overhead, causing you to stop and turn around just in time to be knocked back and smashed into the ground by her huge, swinging breasts. \"NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY LITTLE PLAYTOY\" she scolds you mockingly, sitting up with you flattened body stuck to her own. \"TRYING NOT TO GO WHERE I WANT HIM...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crosses her legs underneath her and grabs ahold of both breasts in her hands, smashing them back and forth and working you between them. After a couple of seconds of this she stops, leaving you stuck facing outwards across the right one, which she lifts up to her face while craning her neck down, sticking her tongue out just to tease your crotch for a second with the tip. She smirks with satisfaction as it swiftly becomes the first part of your body to re-inflate. As expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the rest of your body snaps back into shape, and you fall tumbling from her cleavage, unstuck. You try to snatch at some of her fur as you bounce off of her midriff, turning. But the momentum rips it out of your grasp, and you fall down between her crossed legs to land right where she wanted you, cupped in her palm, which she swiftly uses to shove you right into her...</span></div></div>",

You have just enough time to recognize the sight of the inevitable, and then the hand you're in moves swiftly inward, pushing you into the glistening organ. You vaguely struggle, mostly just from force of habit at this point, as the irresistible force of her strength presses you to the slippery folds and starts rubbing you up and down over the length of the slit, paying special attention to holding your head up against it with an outstretched thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly the vixen's having the better experience of the two of you, given the moaning you can occasionally make out through all the grinding noises your body makes against her fur and the way she's staring off with her eyes closed, which you can occasionally glimpse at times before her thumb comes back and shoves your head between her lips again. Suddenly the pressure against your head is lifted, and you think you're being granted a reprieve until the hand slides you up to where you're face-to-clit with a large, glistening knob, easily the size of your entire fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see that Vivian's staring at you desperately, pleading in her eyes. You hesitate for half a second, and then her thumb comes back and pushes your head against the clit. \"<i>Lick it</i>\" she repeats again, rather more urgently. \"That's an order!\" Her voice starts to take on just the semblance of a growl, which scares you. Scares you even more than the thought of cunnilingus with a giant, horny fox anthro. Slowly, reluctantly, you manage to bring yourself to open your mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S IT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but she's already lost patience with you. \"I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU, PARKER\" she says sternly, closing her fist around your waist and lifting you up to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But- but...\" You open your mouth in shock and protest as she scolds you, which felt pretty unfair of her all considered. She responds by squeezing you until your middle body caved, forcing you into silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU WERE DOING SO WELL, AND THEN YOU HAD TO GET ALL DISOBEDIENT ON ME!\" She sighs, shaking her head. \"TYPICAL, REALLY. WELL, NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THIS THE HARD WAY-\" what does she mean, has this been the easy way? You wondered, as she started lowering you back down to her crotch. \"NOW BE GOOD, AND I'LL FIND A WAY FOR YOU TO MAKE IT UP TO ME TOMORROW\" she finishes, shoving your legs up to the thigh inside her slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it really hit you just how trapped you were. You didn't just have to make it through the night; this was your life now, for the forseeable future. Locked in a room with an enormous fox lady, on an alien ship, which has almost certainly left the planet already by now. Also, now the fox lady is sticking you into her vagina. The only way you could be more completely trapped is if she went ahead and put some pants on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing you know she's changed grip, holding you by your chest between her thumb and forefinger, using it to pump you in and out of her eager cunt. \"THAT'S RIGHT, STRUGGLE!\" She gasps at you, rather needlessly, as you try to fight getting pushed any deeper with every time she pushes you in. She lays back and starts to moan, writhing in pleasure as you kick and squirm within her. She pushes you in up to your chest, very slowly, savoring the motion before suddenly letting go, leaving you stuck with only your head and arms remaining outside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking perhaps she was finally done, now that you aren't being held anymore you put your arms down to your side, and try to pull yourself out of her pussy by the lips when suddenly she moans again, and the python-like grip of her vagina closes around your lower body and <i>pulls</i>. Your eyes go wide with shock as her inner muscles pull you in her up to your neck, and you start to fight them for all you're worth. You can't go in there - who knows when she'll be letting you out? If she'll be letting you out? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to stay outside. If you can keep at least part of your body outside of her, maybe you can leave when she's finished. She's squirming and thrashing almost as hard as you are, breathing heavy, like a woman possessed. She'll be exhausted, just like you - maybe even enough to just leave you where you are, when it's over. You have to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, agonizingly, you start to make some progress. Vivian's thrashing keeps intensifying all along, and you feel her heartbeat growing harder and faster through the vibrations in her flesh, but you're able to inch your way out to your shoulders, and then you leverage your arms against her labia to brace yourself against the pull from below... when suddenly a shadow casts over you again. You look up, dread in your eyes, to see an outreached hand approach, fingers spreading to come down over your head and shoulders...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! C'mon, no!\" You shout, but it doesn't matter. Vivian doesn't even hear her little prize calling as she rests her fingers on your shoulders, feeling you fight desperately to get her off while she lays back with her eyes closed ('Good boy,' she thinks, pleased). Then, taking her time and relishing the motion, she finally pushes down with her middle finger on your head, feeling your arms give way and your body slip down, into her depths, to be massaged and maneuvered and played with by her inner workings - and the other way around, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've lost all grip and all leverage you had, sliding easily into the passage with the finger pushing down on you, unable to gain any purchase on the smooth, slimy walls. She doesn't stop pushing once your head is submerged inside her, but keeps going, extending the full length of her finger to keep on pushing you until your arms slip inside and the lips close over the length of her finger, ahead of you, leaving you in darkness with nothing but the sound of her pulse and her moaning all around you. She holds you down with the finger, keeping it there as her passion intensifies, reaching levels you didn't think possible to reach before finally, with what feels like dozens of rhythmical contractions spaced out over more than a minute, she finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian lies still and gasps deeply, catching her breath, before she finally takes the finger out of her vagina and rolls over onto her side, closing her legs together with the tiny Earthling still inside her. \"Now that's a good little Recruit, Parker.\" she mutters sleepily, sure that you can hear her from within. \"Keep that up, and I may not have to punish you after all...\" She drifts off into a sound and dreamless sleep, leaving you to crawl back out of her on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but can you? And even if you could, then <i>should</i> you? The only way out of this room was a door locked with her (and the Captain's) DNA signature, and she might just be upset if she woke up to find that you weren't where she'd left you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a long time, everything goes calm and rhythmical. The sound of the giant vixen sleeping all around from inside your prison isn't quiet, but it is gentle and steady. You find that you're dozing off yourself in the warm, dark confines, and accept it. Hell, you're exhausted, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently sleep, like oxygen, is just one of those things that you don't really seem to need much anymore, because you wake up a short while afterwards in the same place, same position, and with just a slight hint of stiffness developing in your flexed and outstretched joints. Twenty minutes, thirty, who knows. All you know is that you're sure you'll be smelling like fox pussy for at least the next month to come, no matter how much you try to shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leverage whatever you can purchase you can, and try to shove your way forward through the tight, squishy tunnel. Just up ahead, though, it's sealed shut tight - and you're rocked with a sudden jerking motion as Vivian gasps very slightly in her sleep. You freeze, dreading whatever new game she'll have dreamt up when she awakens... but she soon settles down again, and everything goes back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving onwards, you find that the entrance has loosened up again, and you're able to belly-crawl the rest of your way out between her lips and drop down between her legs to the mattress, and into the cool, sweet freedom of fresh air blowing over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumbling moan comes through from behind you, raising your hackles, and you look back in panic for a second as the fox's hips shift around slightly before settling down and getting comfortable. It may have taken way too long, but you're finally starting to realize that it was a mistake to have cooperated with the vixen. Each next step on this path has only taken you in one direction: deeper into her clutches. And whatever she did to you, she'd always successfully managed to manipulate the Captain into thinking it was <i>your</i> decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt she'd have some kind of excuse for making sure the rest of the crew didn't get to speak with you tomorrow... or the day after, or maybe even ever again. Not to mention all her not-so-subtly telling you you'd been locked inside her room, and all her talk about obedience and punishment and orders and what not. Almost as if she was planning to keep you in here as some kind of secret, tiny bondage slave. You shudder at the thought, even if a secret part of you does get kind of turned on by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it's not the part that makes all your decisions, and so you turn around and make your way over to the edge of the bed, looking down. Realistically, based on everything else that's happened so far, escaping her would only become harder and harder every time you let an opportunity go by. Case in point: You're even more tiny and powerless now than you were when you first met her, and now you're barely even any stronger than her vagina. Well... it wasn't all bad news. You had some other things you could do, now. Taking a deep breath, you launched yourself off of the edge of the bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and landed on the floor, unharmed, barely even fazed by the impact. Not bad. You made your way over to the door quickly, just short of running, in case she'd heard the wet splat of your fluid-covered body hitting the metal - but apparently, she hadn't, and you reached it without any issues. You noticed that the words \"NOT AUTHORIZED FOR ENTRY\" were no longer on the door where they had been, which gave you hope for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd been thinking: Earlier, someone - Charlotte, you think - had said that the biometric reader wasn't working because you had some of Vivian's spit on you, which had her DNA in it. Well, now you're covered in Vivian's DNA for sure, no two ways about it. If you press your hand up against the door, then it might just mistake you for her, and let you out of here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes it?</span></div></div>",

With a hiss and a ding, the door slides open and you silently cheer until you hear Vivian move around. Seeing that she was moving around for adjustment, you sigh and quickly rush past the door when it starts to hiss, closing you inside if you stayed any longer. Now outside of 'your' room, you realize how really small you become and start exploring. For what seemed like several minutes of quietly peering into storage rooms and mostly walking down long, even for the Amazonian sized women, you stop by a door nearby to rest. While resting, a pattering of feet quickly moving on the metal floor arises your attention to the direction you were heading and soon see the white catgirl running towards you with her hand on her butt. She was worried as the reason becomes obvious to you as short but  wet farts exited her black suited rear and doesn't seem to have noticed you. Stopping right in front of the door you were at, she pauses as she tries to get in and releases a massive fart, which literally takes your breath away and you gag as the door opens up for her to get in. After regaining your air, you wait outside of the 'newly discovered' bathroom, hoping to talk to her until you remembered what happened to the quartermaster and shiver at the thought when the door hisses open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylie did a walk of shame, her head low and her movements slow while holding her stomach. You watch her walk away until you hear the door open again.<br>\r\n\"What the hell, Kaylie! You could have waited until I met the newbie to eat, you gluttonous cat! Thankfully, I spiked myself with laxatives. That will teach her not to get too carried away!\" Melanie mutters to herself, walking out wet and smirking at the end until she noticed you.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi there! Didn't see you there as I was complaining to myself, which makes myself look crazy, but again, you're on an alien ship with actual aliens, though you saw us on your planet, though not really us, but feral counterparts to us, who don't talk or wear clothes, like you, not the talking part but clothes bit you...\" She says quickly until you raise a hand to stop her.<br>\r\n\"I just want a shower and some clothes. I hear you can provide the last part to me,\" you said, Melanie becoming red at her becoming perplexed.<br>\r\n\"Of-of course! Follow me!\" She said, embarrassed at her ramblings and avoiding to look at genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking some routes designed for Melanie for quick travel and arriving at her quarters room, you both take a shower, though not together and you finish before her. Drying up, you see two sets of suits awaiting for you on the couch as you walk in, one for Melanie and the other, a green version of the other suits, definitely for you. Just as you finish putting on your suit, you hear Melanie come out and you look away from her.<br>\r\n\"It looks good on you, newbie and it's much better than the naked look you got beforehand, though I'm a bit disappointed at you for not looking at me, but you have been living with different rules, so it'll take a while for you to get use to it. But, as a reminder, you kind of have to get use to it quickly or the girls might feel hurt because of it and never masturbate on your own,\" the mouse girl warns as she puts on her suit and you soon face her after she's done.<br>\r\nLooking at her now, you now realize that she's taller than you, as you face her exposed cleavage and you blush at her tits when she goes to sit down. Joining her, you two start some small talk about your lives and both of you amaze each other about your own experiences until the abduction.<br>\r\n\"That was interesting, miss...\" You said realizing you both failed to introduce each other.<br>\r\n\"Melanie, the quartermaster,\" she replies, smiling at your company.<br>\r\n\"Parker, the cadet, I guess?\" You answer nervously.<br>\r\n\"Nervous? Been there, done that! All I can say is, just do your best and you'll get use to things here as time goes on,\" Melanie advises, you mentally taking notes.<br>\r\n\"Like being eaten?\" You ask, Melanie frowning at your question.<br>\r\n\"That's something not all people get use to and even I'm not fully use to being lunch for everybody, especially Kaylie,\" She answers honestly, making you nervous.<br>\r\n\"You mean everybody on this ship ate you before?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep, and then some, though it's either accidental or on purpose, but mostly accidental, because of my small size. Though Kaylie does it on purpose because of her youth and innocence, but you'll get to see the 'Melanie Experience' soon enough, until grow back to your original size, so buckle up!\" She said bluntly.<br>\r\n\"Already started, as Vivian put me up her snatch!\" You said, Melanie giggling a bit.<br>\r\n\"Know that feeling, though I was horny at the time, so it didn't bother that much and it does explain why you were covered in a white fluids. Anyway, we got things to do right in the morning(?), so how about you rest here for now? It's going to take a while for you to get back to your room and I think Vivian's going to be pissed when she finds out escaped, Parker,\" She asks, worried about you.<br>\r\n\"I think I'll take your offer on the couch then,\" you said, Melanie smiling back at you.<br>\r\nOnce the couch is set up, you two chat for a bit more when you feel the need to rest and you two go to sleep right after.

Apparently you were out pretty deep last night, because at some point she must have climbed onto the couch and picked you up without waking you. It was easy to forget after, uh, sharing a bed with Vivian, but even the mouse girl is nearly twice as tall as you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts an arm to ruffle your hair for a moment, while holding the other one around you. \"How are you feeling? Comfy? Slept okay for now?\" Despite being so forward, it seems like there's genuine interest there. Unlike the triumphant, leering grins you're used to getting from Vivian, this girl's smile is mostly kindness and concern, with just a hint of amusement in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh, thanks. Uh, soft... bed...\" You answer awkwardly, propping yourself up and turning to face her. \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what to do about the arm around your waist, you elect to just ignore it for now, keeping your free arm by your side. She looks a little embarrassed all of a sudden as well, and self-consciously loosens her grip. \"I may have... had some trouble sleeping for a little while, but it turned out okay anyhow\" she confesses. \"Good thing, too, 'cause we have a crew meeting coming up in a bit. But there's enough time to play around a while first, if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking a little hopeful, she nods down at the bulge in your pants, making you flush as you suddenly realize how little your jumpsuit actually conceals. You kind of don't have the heart to tell her it's just a morning thing, and not there because of cuddling with your head between her boobs. Recent experiences have made you very wary of rushing into these kinds of decisions with your new alien shipmates / abductors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she <i>is</i> really warm and soft. Unlike Vivian, this girl's been nice and she actually seems pretty cool - and you'd be doing her a favor, right? Right. Gotta help out your friends sometimes, make sacrifices, take one for the team, etc etc. If you hadn't been imprisoned in a snatch by one of them last night, it'd be a no-brainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your mouth, you tell her...</span></div></div>",

Again, you're reminded just how massive everything else is around you as you look across the vast expanses of floor space to the towering doorway and the equally towering cat-girl swiftly and gracefully stalking through it. All laughably huge in scale next to the couch that had obviously been made for someone of Melanie's height, but still managed to look big next to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanieee! <i>Heeere, mousey, mousey, mou</i>- ohh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cuts off, surprised, as her gaze zeroes in on the couch down on the floor in front of her, and she breaks into a grin, showing off her fangs ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylie lifts one hand up to the wall beside her automatically, setting her hand on it and causing the door to snap shut behind her while Melanie subconsciously shuffles back to the end of the couch, pulling you with her. \"What do you <i>want</i>, Kaylie?\" She calls out, managing to sound annoyed but also slightly nervous as the giant girl steps toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Kaylie puts her hand over her heart and contrives to look offended as she crouches in front of the couch, looming over you. \"Me?\" She asks, with mock sincerity. \"Why, I just came down here to check on my dear little mousey, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap, Kaylie!\" Mel snaps back, cutting her off. \"You know the Captain will be angry if you eat me again before we get there, so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" Kaylie drops the act and rolls her eyes for a second, exasperated. \"Actually, I was just going to play around a bit and then offer to take you there, but-\" you gulp as her eyes fix you, and her smile returns - \"~nyeow I know why Viv was running around looking under everything earlier... I was wondering why she wasn't just enjoying her new toy for the time being, and why she wasn't in a better mood already! Hah!\" She laughs out loud, seeming to find the whole thing hilarious. \"She was <b>pissed!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, realizing that you should have seen this coming when you broke out of her room in the first place. But what were you going to do, just sit there? At least now you have some witnesses who can confirm that you actually <i>wanted</i> to get out, so she won't be able to get away with keeping you trapped in there forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what now?\" You ask, leaning back against Melanie as she seems to relax and loosen her grip on you slightly. Truth be told, you'd rather have this conversation while not sitting in anyone's lap, in general, since it's hard to act dignified when you're in that kind of position. Neither of them seem to care much about it, though, so you figure it'd just be more embarrassing to call attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie quickly backs you up, as the cat girl puts on a thoughtful expression: \"Listen,\" she tells her, \"can you help us out a bit here, and keep quiet about this for now? At least until she's calmed down some? I mean, he's got to go back eventually, rules are rules and all that, but the rookie's still new here and you know how she gets. Right now the only ones who know he's missing are us and Viv, and she's not going to tell everyone she's already lost her new recruit. So if we just don't bring it up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" says Kaylie, thinking it over. \"Well, when you put it that way...\"</span></div></div>",

Looky what I found!\" Kaylie squeals in joy.<br>\r\nVivian was angry, worried, and scared at you for leaving her, praying nothing happened to you. Hearing Kaylie, she was definitely not in the mood to deal with her.<br>\r\n\"Not now, maybe later!\" \"Not even for teeny, tiny, Parkie?\" \"Kaylie, don't!\"<br>\r\nNow curious about what the hell is going on, she turns to see you in Kaylie's grasp as Melanie finally caught up to you, though it was too late.<br>\r\n\"Gee...

I'll make sure he won't be lost <b>ever again</b>.\" Vivian said, her eyes darkening towards you.<br>\r\n\"Nah, just making us even, that's all!\" She replied, Melanie looking at you with apologetic look.<br>\r\nLooking at the fox before you in dread, you were scared of what she plans to do when an angel calls them, Suzy.<br>\r\n\"Vivian, would you bring Mr. Parker to the med bay, please,\" the skunkette asks them through the intercom of the ship, Vivian growling at this.<br>\r\n\"You're lucky that your punishment has been delayed,\" Vivian growls silently to you before heading towards the med bay, Kaylie and Melanie following them out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news, you'll be back to your original size, but still keep your abilities,\" Suzy said, much to everyone's surprise.<br>\r\n\"Seriously? I can be big again?\" You ask, Suzy nodding her head as the other girls grimace at this, for different reasons.<br>\r\n\"Turns out there was a hardware problem with the machine for a long time and I just discovered it after we left Earth. I left a report of it to the captain, so if you want the details, you can find it in the data logs.

Wait, where's Kaylie and Vivian?\" Suzy asks, getting out of her station before noticing you both and gasps.<br>\r\nLooking back at Suzy, you realized you were back to normal size, while Melanie grew beside you as she temporary freaks out.<br>\r\n\"I think I know where those two are,\" Melanie said, once she calmed down and holds the shrunken forms of Kaylie and Vivian.<br>\r\n\"Why mousie so big? Wait, why I'm small with Vivi here?\" Kaylie asks, both shrunken girls freaking out.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Parker, about that thing from before... I'm really sorry about it and won't hold against you, so can you take care of me? Please, without any evil intentions?\" Vivian asks, you figuring out what she's asking and you nod your head in agreement.<br>\r\nAs for Kaylie, she was scared of the mouse girl's silence as she tries to figure what's going to happen to her, now that the tables have been turned on her, while Suzy is scribbling in her notes something.<br>\r\nWhat does Melanie do now with her new found power over Kaylie?</span></div></div>",

All day, whatever you want. No laxatives this time, even.

With a deep sigh, you finally get up from Melanie's lap, pushing her hands off of you. \"Look, I appreciate it, but you don't have to do that for me,\" you tell her, standing up, as she looks surprised to notice that she was still holding on to you. \"From what you've been saying, I'll have to deal with her sooner or later anyway, right? Might as well get it over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, come on, it's no big deal!\" Melanie tells you, holding her hands up in protest. \"Honestly, don't worry about it! Kaylie's not so bad, really, once you get used to her-\" the catgirl pouts at this and sticks out her tongue out at this, indignant - \"but even I wouldn't want to deal with Viv when she gets angry! Just stall a few hours and then get back to her on your own terms, when she's calmed down. It'll go <i>way </i>better for you. I don't have anything else to do after the meeting today anyhow, so you'll just owe me one and we'll call it even, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems pretty certain, so you decide to concede. \"Well, okay\" you say reluctantly, \"if you're sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am\" she answers firmly, satisfied.

Okay, so Parker, stay out of sight while we're go-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylie darts down and snatches her up in her mouth, bringing her jaws down over the smaller woman's hips in a flash and cutting off the rest of her speech. Not a moment later she's leaning back, head towards the ceiling, and you watch the flailing pair of legs between her lips sink down once, twice, and then disappear altogether as the cat girl works her mouth a couple times, then swallows. The whole thing takes barely more than a second, and then she's grinning down at you, golden cat-eyes fixed on your frame as she traces a path down her throat and belly with one fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, <i>nyew</i>bie~\" she tells you teasingly, her silvery tail raised up and twitching beside her shoulder as you back up against the couch. \"I'll cough her back up when we get to the meeting... or will I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs and bends down over you, putting her hands down on either side of the couch and bringing you face-to-face with the glistening maw that had just finished devouring much larger prey than yourself. You shudder, in spite of the waves of hot air and laughter washing over you, as she licks her lips and backs away a bit. \"All rrright,\" she purrs. \"Time to go now, so let's hide you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You gulp loudly as the enormous cat girl looms over you. Not that you hadn't believed your new friend when she warned you about 'getting to know the Melanie Experience soon enough', but you still dreaded getting to know it quite so soon. \"You know, I can just hide myself...\" you try squeaking out, pressing your back against the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylie leans forward and you flinch back, expecting her to snatch you up in her jaws like she just did with Melanie. Instead, she swipes at you with a clawed hand, snatching you up in a fist. She pulls her jumpsuit out at the top with one hand while lifting you up with the other, and cheerfully tosses your screaming, flailing body down the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tumble down her neck and come to rest under the swell of her left boob, Kaylie laughs and lets the suit snap shut over you. The cat-girl's pert chest and butt are on the smallish side, especially compared with some of the rest of her crewmates, but her uniform is even tighter and more form-fitting than theirs are, and you can't even budge an inch with it crushing you against her tit like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylie purrs with satisfaction as she feels her tiny human plaything try to push against her flesh. The sight of the near motionless man-shaped lump fighting for breath in her suit made it all the more enjoyable, but all good things come to an end, and in the end you were much too visible in your current location. Using some unseen, zipper-like mechanism, Kaylie pulls the front of her suit apart from the top down, shaking you loose from the flap in her chest area and sending you tumbling down her body yet again. She laughs as you land in the hammock-like crotch of the suit and bounce back from the elastic, throwing you into a mound of silvery pubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not n-eow, Pinkie~\" she winks down at you, grinning mischievously, before reaching down to cusp you in her palm. \"Butt...\" she giggles as if she'd just said something clever, and then pushes you against her crotch. Thinking you're about to be sent on your second vaginal tour in less than two whole days, you try to reach out and grab at the hair as she starts rubbing you on it, but it tears out of your grip as you start moving swiftly downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping her little toy pressed against her with her hand, the giant cat-girl moves you down in between her legs, and then up and around the back side, so that you're held upside down under her tail, between her cheeks. She stops and holds you there for a second, both to savor the moment and to give her toy some time to figure out what was happening. Moments later, she's rewarded with tiny screams and renewed struggles against the top of her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing moved away from her pussy had calmed you down somewhat at first, and you'd even admired the view for a bit when you'd been slid alongside the cat-girl's booty. While certainly a hell of a lot smaller than some of the other women's aboard the ship, Kaylie's butt was nicely toned, and had the perky shape and firm-yet-soft look of someone who worked out an awful lot. You'd bet that she could crack walnuts between those cheeks! Just then, you realize that she's been holding you there for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Kaylie gleefully shoves you hard between her cheeks the moment you start shouting for her to let you go. Her ears go flat against her head, and her tail arcs straight up into the air, curling at the tip, as she revels in the sensation of having your squirming body swallowed up in her delighted derriere. You're thrust into fleshy darkness, the hand propelling you not even slowing down as you're crushed from either side by the cute, perky cheeks you'd just been happily admiring only moments before. The space gets tighter and tighter as she works you further in, until you can barely move or breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylie starts to purr as she thrusts you along, enjoying the buzzing sensation your screams make in her ass along with the massaging of your movements. She doesn't have time to draw it out, however. Just when you thought your bones were going to give out and you'd be squashed flat between her cheeks, you ram face-first into a wall of wrinkly flesh, where the insides of her cheeks come together. You instinctively try to push away, as the finger behind you starts rubbing you against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're able to get one arm up in front of you, and shove hard. But instead of pushing you away, the flesh beneath your hand opens up into a hot, slick ring of muscle. You slip inside up to the shoulder, as you realize in horror what is happening, before it clamps down around your arm like a vice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaylie yelps as her sensitive asshole is suddenly penetrated by her human toy's arm, reflexively clenching around it as she jumps in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a muffled yowl make its way through all the tons of flesh around you. You're thrown into chaos for a bit as the giantess's sharp, clawed fingers withdraw from your back, while you experience a brief in-ass earthquake of sudden movements and crushing flesh. You scream and try to pull your arm out of your captress's tightened asshole, but it's no use. Your puny body is no match for the giantess's unyielding sphincter muscle, and you're trapped in place between her rock-hard glutes in any case. You're crushed so hard for a moment, you can't even breathe, until she finally relaxes her cheeks around you and lets you scream into her flesh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving inadvertently pulled her hand away in shock, the giant cat-girl now turns around to examine her handiwork, keeping her sphincter locked tight around your arm as she does so. She flexes her anus a couple of times, as if her ass was chewing on you a bit, playing with its food, and is rewarded with even greater amounts of buzzing and squirming below. Neither sight nor sound of her little play-toy shows itself beyond her cheeks. \"There, almost completely hidden!\" She calls down cheerfully, playfully slapping herself on the butt a couple of times. The shockwaves travel through the cheeks and end up smacking you back and forth in between them, which makes you struggle to free yourself even more, to her delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, she started to cough up her other toy, the mousey girl, only to stop halfway through so she could feel her slide down into her belly once more. Melanie was too used to being toyed with by Kaylie to keep on fighting it like Parker did, but she could still be coaxed into moving around in there sometimes. Teasing her with regurgitation was a good way to get her all riled up, she found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Melanie started acting up in her belly as soon as she found herself gulped back down again, and Kaylie smiled contentedly while she purred with satisfaction. This caused Melanie to stop moving right away. Though she secretly rather liked being massaged  by the vibrations inside the cat-girl. while she purred, she was still annoyed at being swallowed up before the meeting and didn't want to give her the satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, thought Kaylie. Time to wrap up here, anyway. She's already running a little behind, haha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just one more thing and off we go!\" She calls out, ears perking up cheerfully as she reaches down to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The aliens have you surrounded and there is a 12 foot tall skunk woman waiting for your response with a threat lingering in the air. They really haven't left you much choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK!,\" you call to Suzy, \"I'm coming out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear her acknowledge your response, but don't feel much comfort in your decision. Pushing your doubts aside, you put on as confident of a face as you can and exit the ranger station. When you make it outside, you realize that Suzy hasn't backed away much from the exit. The door closes behind you and you look up at her smiling face. At her close proximity, you can barely see it past her large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there native,\" she says with a smile, \"What's your name?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P....p.....Parker,\" you stammer in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Parker,\" she says, bending over to speak with you face to face. \"As you probably heard, I'm Suzy. You made a wise decision coming out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands back up to her full 12 foot height and her ship mates join her in a close circle behind her, continuing to ensure that you have no clear route of escape. Suzy turns, exposing her large ass to you. You're confused by her actions, you thought that by giving yourself up you would escape being sprayed, but it seemed like she was preparing to spray you anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further warning, Suzy's long tail wraps itself around your head and pulls your face into direct contact with her huge backside. You squirm for escape, but are not nearly strong enough to get away as her tail has a firm grip on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saved yourself some trouble and me some work by coming out on your own, but I'm afraid that I'm going to have to spray you anyway. It's customary,\" she says with a laugh, releasing her scent directly into your nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly filled with adrenaline and your struggles intensify, but succeed in just slapping at Suzy's round ass. You feel your hands sink into her flesh as you try to push away, but can't find a way to separate your face from her butt. As your mind finally forces you to inhale, you realize that Suzy's spray is somehow different from the many skunks you had encountered at the park. You were no stranger to skunk spray, and this was no typical skunk spray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't smell good, but it was far from what you expected. There was a level of floral notes to the scent, but almost as if it were being used to cover some kind of a chemical smell. Your mind focused on the floral aspect of the odor, and felt a level of comfort overcome your body. Your slaps and punches against Suzy's ass turned into gentle rubs and massages. To her friends, you looked as if you were groping her large backside. The other aliens smiled, this was not an unfamiliar sight to them. You felt your body begin to grow weak and your head started to spin. Before you knew it, you had passed out completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you find yourself lying flat on a large cushion, almost like a cot in a medical area a school nurse might use, but it was much larger than any cot you've ever experienced. Your eyes shoot open wide as Suzy's smiling face enters your view. You try to get up and pull away, but find that you're tied down and bound to the cot! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy laughs and waits patiently for you to calm down. Satisfied, she stands up, looming over you. You swallow hard, intimidated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've probably realized by now Parker, I'm a little different from the creatures you call skunks on your planet,\" she says, caressing her curves seductively. \"But it's more than just what you can see. You see, your Earth creatures have only really mastered one type of spray. You're familiar with it?\" she asks with a smile. You nod in confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, a fully evolved specimen like me has near limitless manipulation over the scented spray I can deliver. As the ship's science officer, I have a vast chemical knowledge, and I can create whatever concoction I desire within me before I release it, depending on the desired effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy pauses, allowing her words to sink in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one you received was very important. You'll be traveling with us very far from your home. It knocked you out while it was bonding with your body, but now that the process is complete, you'll be able to survive in any atmosphere and endure nearly any injury. Observe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she concludes, she turns, allowing her huge ass to hang over your prone body. Before you can offer a protest, she lets herself fall onto you, pressing your body beneath her weight. Only your head is visible beneath her thick curves. You would have expected to be crushed with several shattered ribs from the impact and her weight, but to your surprise, you felt...fine. Well, you could feel your body compressing slowly beneath her weight and it hurt, but not nearly to the degree you would have expected. Suzy bounces in place a few times giggling before pushing herself off of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Nothing to worry about!\" she exclaims happily as your body quickly re-inflates and you fill your lungs up with air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" you begin, trying to tread delicately. \"Not that I don't appreciate the demonstration Suzy, but if it's all the same to you, I'd rather get back to work. I didn't have any space exploration plans this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be a little tricky at this point Parker. You were out for quite while and we left your planet at near light speed hours ago. But don't worry,\" she says, caressing her full backside, \"I'm sure we can find plenty to keep you busy right here,\" she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to wrap your head around what is transpiring, when Suzy interrupts your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't have to worry for a second Parker, my spray will ensure you are perfectly protected. So how about a little thank you?\" she asks expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill uneasy, you stammer, \"Yeah, you're right. Thank you for that Suzy. But...I have to ask, was it really necessary to keep my face planted against your ass when you sprayed me? As close as we were, I'm sure I would have gotten enough without it right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy smiles seductively. \"Necessary? Not at all. But with a cutie like you it made it so much more fun for me. Now let's get back to that gratitude you owe me,\" she says, drawing even closer to your cot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You know what's coming, but Suzy seems to be enjoying drawing the process out. You see her ass coming closer as she slowly lowers herself over your face with a deep sensual moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmhmmmm, a perfect fit,\" she coos as she releases her cheeks and allow them to slam over your head. Her ass is large enough that she was able to rest her backside on the cot, meaning your head has been literally swallowed up by her backside. While it has gone dark, you can tell that there is room to spare if you had been larger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now as I said, I expect a thank you,\" she says, it's more of a demand than a request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she crazy? You've already thanked her. What does she want from you? And what does swallowing up your head with her enormous, if sexy, ass have to do with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she read your mind, Suzy continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means I expect you to start kissing human,\" she says growing irritated. She clenches her cheeks forcefully over your head, emphasizing your limited options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recoil mentally, but are physically unable to move.

She finally sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realize that I can spray you with a mixture that will make this exactly what you want to do.

I need a little <i>passion</i>!\" she commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing any other option, you find the will to make yourself to kiss her soft flesh more forcefully.

You find your legs secured around the skunk's shoulders while she slips your arms beneath the top of her skintight uniform. Smiling, she clenches her cheeks as she stands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks back at the cot quickly and her smile grows broader seeing it empty. Suzy puts her hand to her ass and forces your face deeper between her cheeks before she starts her walk to the bridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in no position to protest as the amazonian skunk carried you like a cross between a thong and a backpack. She had a noticeable sway to her hips as she walked, possibly intentional and for your benefit.

The rest of the crew could hardly contain their laughter at her response. The deer just rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are hopeless Suzy.

She secretly creeps away from the rest of her group and approaches your closed door as her friends are distracted by other things. With a curious smile, she lightly knocks at your door. You remain still and silent inside. Not hearing any response, the anthro visitor tries the knob. To her surprise, the door swings open. You lower your head to your hands as you realize that in your panic and shock you neglected to secure the lock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" the squirrel woman asks gently, ducking her large body through the door frame. \"I know I saw someone in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes scan the room and quickly fall on you. Her smile grows broader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she squeals in excitement and moves toward you rapidly. You backpedal in fear, which surprises the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't be scared of lil' ol' me!\" she says happily. \"I promise my friends and I are friendly. We aren't on some kind of conquest mission or nothin',\" she says with a laugh. There is a distinct twang to the sound of her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her imposing figure. \"The....then why are you here?\" you ask nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs your arm and drags you to the window of your ranger station, her friendly smile still clear on her face. \"You see my friend Bella out there? The big one?\" she asks you, indicating to the bear. You nod silently, uncertain about where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's the youngest gal in our lil' group and today is her birthday!\" she says happily. \"It's a pretty big one too, just old enough to imbibe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a confused look. \"Imbibe?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods happily. \"Yup! Finally able to join the party wherever, whenever. So we figured we'd take her out for a fancy celebration and cruise around the universe. Musta taken a wrong turn somewhere though, cause we ended up here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hardly believe your ears. These five anthro women were on some kind of alien 21-run! You looked back out the window and focused on the bear. Now that you are aware of it, you realize that she has a bit of a sway to her walk, as if she's had one too many drinks already. It was a look you were already pretty familiar with from the summer barbecues you've seen get out of hand at the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm so glad I found you! The party was gettin' kinda lame without any fellas around,\" the squirrel said. \"You'll be popular with everyone, I'm sure. But we best hurry back before they all leave without me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind freezes. This woman intends for you to be some kind of party toy for her tipsy friends! This can't end well for you. You don't even know the squirrel's name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, all this time and I didn't even introduce myself. I'm Charlotte,\" she says with a smile. You are too stunned to manage a response, but she reads your name off your ranger uniform without skipping a beat. \"Now let's get to it Parker. Let's see, what'd be the funnest way to introduce you to the party?\" she ponders. Whatever she decides, you're in no position to resist.</span></div></div>",

She looks around the ranger station for a box of some kind, but there's nothing there she could use to conceal you from the bear. She sighs a little and tugs on your arm, demanding your attention again. With a slight blush on her cheeks she says: \"Well, I can only think of one place to put you. In here...\" She pulls open the suit she was wearing. The material was plenty stretchy, but you'd be pressed up to her fuzzy body. That sounded harmless enough, but you had other concerns. You finally find the courage to ask Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I going to survive this little party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel gasped a little. \"Oh my gosh! Of course you are silly man.\" She seemed a bit offended by the very idea, but soon mellowed out. She realizes you'd probably never seen anything like them before. \"I have an idea, drink this.\" She hands you a tiny vial of strange purple liquid. It was tiny in her hand, but to you it looked like a 2-liter bottle. You hesitantly pull open it to be greeted by a sweet and very tasty smell. Your concern about the mysteriously fluid vanishes as you begin to drink it. It tasted delicious. You didn't have to finish the whole thing before Charlotte requested the vial back. \"This should make you damn near indestructible for... about a week in your time.\" You smile awkwardly, one more question rolling over your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are going to drop me off back here afterwards, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you want to live with us.\" The amazonian squirrel says with a giggle. \"For now, let's get this party started.\" She let go of you, letting you walk out the door of the station. Outside she carefully picked you up and slipped you into her suit. Not wanting to 'spoil the goods' meant Charlotte would put you right with her curvaceous tits. Even when the suit snapped back into place their softness was unabated. Most of your torso was squashed between them, their fuzzy surfaces molding themselves perfectly around you. With every move the soft fur of her skin brushed against you. She was walking back to the others, her present for the bear stuffed into her suit.</span></div></div>",

Finally being old enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear chuckled in response. \"It's great. Even greater with all of my friends out here. I'm guessing the plan was planet Vegas-5, but this is nice too. A bit more quiet.\" The squirrel giggled a little. \"It's a bit lonely though, don't you think? Not a man in sight.\" She could barely contain herself, knowing she was carrying a man around. Bella raised a confused eyebrow, wondering where the squirrel was going with this. \"Is everything alright, Charlotte?\" The squirrel had to present you quick before she'd fall over laughing. \"I'm okay. In fact, to celebrate, I brought you a gift! Tada!\" With a flourish she pulled open her suit and yanked you from your soft prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God. He's. So. CUTE!\" Bella exclaimed. She stood up to grab you with both hands. Each of her furry mitts eclipsed your head in size and they held you tightly. She held you eye to eye and planted a kiss on your cheek. Next she wrapped you in a heavy hug. Her arms were just as soft as Charlotte's, but the strength beneath them was terrifying. You're confident that if it weren't for the squirrel's little potion, Bella would have snapped you in half in her embrace. You sank into her large body, finding this overwhelming hug surprisingly pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirrel broke the silence again. \"Even better news, ladies. He's agreed to join us on our little road trip.\" The vixen replied snarkily. \"He'd better, I think he's a little stuck to Bella.\" The others laughed a little before packing up and preparing to go back into their ship. As you were held by Bella you saw them abandoning the still burning campfire. Your park ranger experience came through and you softly chastised them about leaving the fire unattended. The skunk rolls her eyes and clicks a button on her suit. The campfire suddenly vanishes completely. \"Just a hologram\" She added before walking off. Bella, still holding you tightly wrapped in her arms, walked with Charlotte and the vixen to the bridge of the ship. The squirrel hopped into the pilot seat and flipped a few switches. One pull of a lever and you were in outer space. You could see the Earth beneath you. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

Any headway you made was quickly demolished with another ounce of her raw strength. Instead you were curious what was going to happen to you now? Even if you were the best escape artist it wouldn't be enough. You were in space. Only a handful of other people could ever make that claim, and you didn't even want to be here. These amazonian forest creatures still scared you in spite of their apparent friendliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, I'm going to get to know my 'birthday present' a little better.\" Bella announced, turning away from the others and walking down a hallway. Charlotte shouted from a distance. \"Go easy on him, leave some for us.\" Bella just giggled, then she saw your mortified expression. \"She's just kidding. You're gonna love it up here. And once our little road trip is over we'll land again where we picked you up and drop you off. Sounds fair?\" Left with little in the way of options you quietly nod. \"Or if you wish, you can stay with us. But let's not get ahead of things.\" The bear's constant smile would be disturbing if it wasn't so unrelentingly cheerful. It was almost as if her happiness was making you happier, briefly forgetting her crushing hug and the fact that they just abducted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few corridors Bella turns into a small room. It was equipped quite soberly, but it felt homely all the same. You were carried to a bed that seemed large even by the bear's standards. After minutes of struggling to breathe you were finally dropped onto the soft surface. \"Alright, I know Charlotte already dosed you. In case she hasn't quite explained why, it's to make you able to handle things like this.\" She turned her round butt and sat down right on top of you. Her huge asscheek pressed you flat onto the bed and pushed you deep into the soft fabric. When she stood up again the bed and you neatly formed back into their previous shape. You nod fiercely, making sure she knows you don't need another demonstration. Or do you? That wasn't half bad as far as experiences go. Wow, what were you saying? Is this a side-effect of that potion? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella sat down next to you and exchanged an awkward stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... now what?\" You sheepishly ask.</span></div></div>",

Her maw encompassed half your head and her tongue was eager to make contact with yours. It dove in past your lips and rubbed past yours. Still overwhelmed, you tried to fight off the bear, but she barely even noticed your resistance. She leaned even further into the kiss, holding one hand behind your back to cradle you. As your senses caught up with events you tried to resist even harder. Things were going so fast. Fifteen minutes ago everything was normal, now you're in space kissing an amazonian bear-woman. How did you life go this wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a more insidious thought rose up. Is this really so wrong? The alien nature of your partner notwithstanding, she was good at this. Her tongue left no part of your mouth unsatisfied. With a degree of grace you'd never expect from a bear she drew you in. Saliva leaked all over your head. She was nothing if not excited to kiss you. Slowly you began to get used to the idea of returning some of that passion. Your tongue had been passive about this so far, but gently you began to push back against the bear. You could feel her reaction. She wasn't able to speak or emote much, but you could tell she was very happy. You threw your arms around her, unable to wrap around her large body completely. She responds by hoisting you into a comfortable embrace. Not for a moment does she interrupt the intimacy between your tongues. Slowly she drags you along the soft surface of the bed, placing you in the middle of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body begins to buckle under the pleasure. She quickly lowers you down and supports herself on her hands and knees. She doesn't want to squash you. Not now, not when she's this close. Her maw opens a little wider, as though fitting more of your head in there would help. Slick lips contour the area of your face exposed to her hot, moist breath. Drool is leaking all over your face. The smell doesn't even register. Both of you are united in passion and flame. As seconds tick by you begin to feel tired. But you refuse to disappoint your ursine companion. You would not give in first. Finally Bella disengages her large maw, letting you lie on your back. Your head is soaked in bear drool, thick strands of it still connecting your face to hers. But you've never felt more alive. Why, what and other questions no longer plague you. That was entirely worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella stares down into your eyes.

Only too late did you recognize that she had no plans to move you out of the way as she smiled down. The bear leans in for one tiny smooch on your forehead before pushing herself up as hard as possible. At the apex of this little skip she held out her arms as if she wanted a hug. She wouldn't have to wait long as gravity brought her 15 foot body down on top of yours. You had just enough time to stretch out your arms before your whole body got smothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" was the only thing you could say when a metric ton of bear came down on top of you. Her slightly husky form moulded itself to you, squashing you heavily. You felt yourself compress and flatten beneath the weight, but the alien potion was working it's magic. Besides your arms only your head poked out from under the bear. It was right besides her own and you could hear her softly murr in delight. Apparently squashing you as flat as a pancake was just as enjoyable as that amazing kiss from a minute ago. Probably something to keep in mind for the others, should you get close with them. You breathe quickly, trying to use your crushed lungs as best as possible. Bella responds by shuffling around a little, moving her massive bulk all over your body. It did little to help your situation, but she loved the feeling of you being helplessly pinned beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the immense weight settle down. It let you notice a few other things, chief among which was the warmth. Bella's furry body was hidden behind a space suit, but it's insulating prowess was very much present. A warmer, softer blanket you had never felt. If only it didn't also weigh a ton. Second was the slow breathing coming from beside you. It was clear to you she was tired and very quickly falling asleep. The eerie prospect of spending several hours pinned and squashed was very real. You absent-mindedly wrap your arms around her and begin to think. Is it wise to ask her to get off of you or is it better to let sleeping bears lie.</span></div></div>",

You were considering giving her a piece of your mind, but that would have to wait. For now a gentler approach would yield the most success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, miss Bella. Can you let me free?

Saliva leaked down from the upper jaw in long slimy strands. Alcohol-soaked warm breath washed over you, making you feel queasy. The fetid stench reminded you off the fact she had been drinking and might not be able to make out what you're saying. Before you can explain your wishes to her, the large bear closes in. Her head approaches and her wide open maw fills most of your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long yawn Bella closes her jaws around your head. Her slobbery maw holds onto your head with a remarkably gentle grip. Her ferocious teeth could probably slice it clean off, but she was very careful not to hurt you. Your sigh of relief was short-lived as a low rumbling preceded a booming belch. The fetid air from her stomach was unimaginably foul, polluting your lungs and causing you to pull back your head. You wanted out of here. You'd gladly take ten more bears squashing you over this hellish torment. Mostly asleep, the bear woman suckled on your head, her large tongue plastering you with saliva from all sides. Stinky alcohol-infused breath assailed your nose, turning your stomach a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only sound left in Bella's room is her slow breathing. Your efforts had failed to wake her and now she was slurping and suckling on your head like it was a large, complaining pacifier. How long do you have to endure this?</span></div></div>",

You had no way of telling how long it had taken, but eventually even this disgusting position couldn't stop you from falling asleep. Exhaustion can accomplish many things it seems and as she hugs you tightly and suckles on your head you manage to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat feels like mere minutes later the suckling intensifies. The tongue seems possessed with intent, trying to snake its way into your mouth. Shortly thereafter a large paw grabs you by the neck and pulls you free. You look up to Bella's quizzical face. Looking around you see no clocks. Checking the position of the sun isn't an option either on this spaceship. You were so dazed you couldn't tell how long you'd slept and whether is was morning already. Maybe she was awake because it was, but maybe she'd just woken herself up with the realization she was suckling on someone's head. Her eyes were wide open and she seemed mostly confused. With every passing second her smile curls up further until she finally explodes into laughter. With tears in her eyes she takes you to her mirror. In it you see the reason for her amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair looked like it had been glued in place right after a hurricane. Thick bear drool dripped off every strand.

You look up to her with confusion. Was she really impressed by your taste in hairstyle? As you thought it the realization struck that she was being a bit more literal. A shiver ran down your spine as a ravenous hunger could be seen in those big eyes of her. Regular bears already proved dangerous, now you were faced with a bear woman twice as tall as any bear you'd ever seen. You gulp loudly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yes,\" Bella said, eying you disturbingly while licking her chops, \"you have <i>exquisite</i> taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tugged at your collar, trying to disguise your panic. You gave a weak laugh, \"Heh, thanks, I've always been on the stylish side. If you'd like, I can style your hair--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella didn't seem to hear you, as she silenced you by running her tongue over your face. You gagged and spat as some of her slobber got in your mouth. You'd no sooner spit it out then she licked your face again and again, like a human lollipop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So good,\" she said, in between licks. \"So scrumptious!\" She gave another lick and squealed in delight at your flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to turn your face away so you weren't getting a mouthful of tongue, but you were unable to stop her from licking your cheek over and over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" you squeaked pathetically. \"That's enough! I can tell you're hungry, so why don't we head to the mess and get you breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think,\" <i>Slurp</i>, \"I'd rather,\" <i>SLURP</i>, \"have breakfast,\" <i>SSSSLLLLLUUUUURRRRPPPP</i> \"IN BED!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella couldn't hold back anymore. You screamed as she opened her maw wide and shoved you right inside. It was a tight fit, but somehow she managed to fit your entire body into her mouth. She moaned in happiness as she tongue ravaged you, teeth lightly chewing you but not enough to break the skin. You fumbled and flipped over as she worked you around her mouth. Every now and then you managed to get an arm free or pop out your head and take a breath of fresh air, only for Bella to slurp you back up with a giggle. You eventually realized she was purposefully letting you get a taste of freedom only to take it away. Not that that made a difference to you. Playing or not, you tried your best to get away every time. After the eleventh time you succeeded in popping your head out, you heard a sound that sent shivers down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grrrrrrrrrwwwwwllllllllll</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thic bear's stomach growled longingly. It wanted to food and it wanted it now. Bella frowned and ran a paw over her hungry belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm schorry,\" she said, through a mouthful of food and drool. \"I waschn't pwanning on dis, but yo jus scho... <i>delichious!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Please! You said you'd let me go home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kno' but... I can't resist! Goobye lil guy. Thank yo scho much fer bein my birfday treat! Yo're da besht gif I've ever gotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to plead again only for Bella to slurp you into her mouth like a noodle. You screamed as she moved you to the back of her throat, the growling of her stomach getting louder and louder. You tried to stop your descent by grabbing at her tongue but it was too slimy for you to get a good grip. With a loud <i>glrk</i>, her throat contracted and your legs disappeared into her esophagus. Another gulp and now only your head and shoulders remained in her mouth, your head touching her uvula. You wait for the final gulp to send you to your doom... but it didn't come. Instead, you felt Bella walking. Had she reconsidered? Was she going to let you out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was soon revealed as she opened her mouth. You saw your horrified face staring back at your from the bathroom mirror. There was a flash of blinding light and you blinked away spots. You realized she'd just taken a picture of your final moments! Bella waved goodbye and you opened your mouth to scream only for her to swallow one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sent plummeting down a slick, wet tunnel and deposited in a cramped stomach filled with gastric acid and beer from her first night as a legal drinker. You kicked and punched at the walls of her stomach, pleading for her to let you go, but Bella only ran a paw over her stomach delicately as she posted the picture of you descending her throat online. She posed to take another picture, showing herself with a full belly, and posted it as a follow-up. After all, what girl doesn't like posting their meals online?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a gurgling in her stomach that moved up her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!{/ i}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed in relief at the expulsion of gas. She did feel a little bad about what happened to you, but... technically they'd offered you a spot on their crew. It wasn't her fault your spot turned out to be in her stomach. With that thought, she giggled, and then got ready for the day, putting on a new spandex suit. Fifteen minutes later, she made her way to the mess hall, her stomach still engorged by your presence and jiggling from your struggles. Her friends were already seated and eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Birthday Girl!\" Charlotte said. \"Where's that studly gift I gave--oh no,\" she said, seeing the bear's bulging stomach. \"Tell me you didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella answered by opening her mouth and giving off another colossal belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BBBBBRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella giggled as Charlotte slapped her forehead and the rest of her friends groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Bella!\" Charlotte said. \"That was the only guy around and you ate him! I don't even know if the shot I gave him will let him survive being digested!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And none of us got a turn to play with him!\" the vixen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Bella said defensively, \"he's <i>my</i> birthday gift. I don't have to share him if I don't want to, and I decided I wanted him as a special birthday snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made you a cake yesterday!\" the skunk girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer something a little meatier,\" Bella giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the crew glowered at her, not saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Bella said innocently, hoping to turn the topic away from her still-squirming stomach, \"we still going to Vegas-5?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes the crew move on and let Bella enjoy her birthday breakfast, or do they demand that she let the human out so they can all have a turn playing with him?</i></span></div></div>",

Goodness, you're far too cute for that. Come, I'll get you something to eat too. You must be starving.\" Your belly grumbled in agreement, making Bella laugh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to a machine embedded in the wall. It looked a bit like a microwave, but with a lot more buttons. The large bear began tapping them and the device hummed to life. She pushed one last dial to full and hit the big green button. The device hummed a bit louder for a few seconds then let out a distinct 'ding', signaling it was done. Bella opened the hatch and pulled out a plate of sandwiches. They looked expertly crafted, making you salivate almost instantly. You look around to see a table at which you might sit, but the bear just plants her big butt back onto her bed. She barely missed you when sitting and her butt weighed down on the bed so heavily you slowly slid towards her. When you bumped into her side she looked down and smiled, handing you the plate of sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" She cooed, taking a pair of sandwiches for herself and loudly chowing down on them. You follow up on her excellent suggestion, digging in yourself. You wished your mouth was bigger, so you could eat more of these amazing sandwiches. They were perfect in every way. One after the other disappeared from the plate whilst Bella was content to watch her little human eat his fill. She nabbed one more sandwich before leaving you to finish the remaining ones. The bear wanted something a bit more... substantial for her breakfast and approached the machine. She tapped in her desired order and not a minute later was greeted by a steaming meal of roasted venison. When she turned to face you again a sly smirk crept onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done? Just put the plate on the floor, honey.\" She spoke with a soothing voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leaned down to put away the plate you didn't notice the large bear walking up to you and turning around until it was too late. With a big sigh of relief Bella sat down on her bed, this time planting her big butt right on top of her little human. You felt your body flatten beneath the weight, sputtering out barely legible protests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, a meal like this is amazing. The only way to make it better is by having somewhere special to sit. And you are just the cutest little cushion.\" She wiggled her but, grinding you into the soft fabrics of her bedsheets some more. \"Now you just enjoy yourself down there whilst I get my breakfast sorted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella got busy with her large meal as you were forced to endure being sat on. None of your protests ever elicited more than another savage grinding beneath her overwhelming rear. You felt yourself compress further, the heavy bear slowly pressing you flat beneath her. Even when she finished eating, the bear just sat in place, relishing the feeling of her little human squashed under her bottom. Only when the intercom announced it was time to meet on the bridge of the ship did she finally get up. You made an involuntarily wheezing sound as air could finally get back into your lungs. She just laughs at your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, wasn't that fun, human? Now, for the next dilemma. How am I going to get you to the bridge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a weary sigh you already knew that whilst having you just follow her would be the easiest solution, Bella was looking for a more 'fun' alternative.</span></div></div>",

She rubs her full features with both hands in a sexy display. Maybe whatever she \"imbibed\" hit her with a bit of a delay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to what?!\" you shout, leaping off the bed. But you're nowhere quick enough to be out of Bella's reach, even in her slightly intoxicated state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me lil guy,\" she cooed, standing and hugging you close to her 15 foot tall form. \"I think you're a cutie, especially since you're <i>sooooo</i> much smaller than me,\" she said flirtatiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're unable to resist her as she flung you back onto the massive bed and followed quickly, towering over you even while on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I come lil guy, I hope you're ready for all of me!\" she hollered wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella let her arms and legs go completely limp and her body crashed on top of your own, smothering and smashing you on impact. Though she was muscular and extremely powerful, Bella's body felt soft. Her breasts impacted your face while the rest of you was squashed beneath her belly. It was like being under a ton of pillows. Soft, but heavy regardless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the bear moan above you as she rocked from side to side, enjoying the sensation of steamrolling a person who was just over one third her height. You struggled to breathe, but found that you were fine without oxygen thanks to whatever it was Charlotte injected you with. It eased your fears about immediate and certain death, but you still felt far from relaxed as your body slowly flattened beneath the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella eventually rolled off of you and stood, giggling as your body reformed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? All better,\" she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to respond, but before you could the bear turned and showed her large, space suit covered ass to you. You gasped, knowing what was coming. As she slammed her massive rear on top of you, your only relief was in the knowledge that you were on the outside of that suit. All you could do as you felt Bella hop happily on top of you was to curse your position as a ranger that put you in this predicament while your body was again crushed and flattened beneath Bella's incredible weight. You wondered if, even with Charlotte's injection, you could survive a week of partying like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, you're so soft Parker,\" Bella cooed from her seated position on top of you. \"I wonder what we'd need to do to convince you to make this permanent,\" she asked aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFat chance of that, you thought to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more little game little man,\" she said as she finally stood up and smiled at your reforming body. She lied down on the oversized bed, this time next to you. She put a large, strong hand on your shoulder and pushed you down her body. You tried to resist, but you were no match for her strength. Eventually, the bear had you right where she wanted you and she forced your head between her incredibly thick thighs. Each leg was the size of your waist! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a moment to mentally prepare yourself, Bella squeezed. She laughed at the ease your head collapsed between her powerful legs. She relaxed her muscles, but her legs still held you firmly in place and you were unable to move or reform before she flexed again. She repeated this action, eventually moving into a rocking motion. As she rocked, more and more of your body was pulled between the vice like grip of her legs until your midsection was being pressed and your head was left being pushed into her now familiar ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy, tipsy smile, Bella released her hold on you and held a finger to her mouth as she thought about what she should do next while your body again returned to normal. </span></div></div>",

She undid some of the clips locking the parts of her suit together. Soon her body was revealed. It was a beautiful shade of brown, the bristly fur looking pristine and clean from head to toe. Your thoughts wander as you imagine what such a thing might feel like. Though with her preference for being way too close with it probably wouldn't take long for you to get some first hand experience. With gusto she removes her pants and boots too, leaving her without a thread of clothing on her well-rounded body. You felt something stir within you. No, it cannot possibly be. It must be the alien concoction those bastards dosed you with. You are n\u00f3t feeling attracted to an amazonian bear woman. As much as you tried to deny it to yourself, Bella took one look between your legs and knew the truth. The tent you were pitching down there could not be denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn!\" She said with a drunken hiccup. Her large hands reached for you and you quickly dodged her grab. \"I'll get these myself!\" You protest. Bella grumbles and stands back. \"Just be quick or I'm coming in there to help you.\" You were about to strip naked for this woman. But that was better than having her rip all your clothes off. With lustful intent she watched you undress. A small strand of drool leaked from her maw, though that could just as easily be the booze. Far more disturbing was that you could spot something leaking between her legs too. You felt burning red with embarrassment when you finally took off your boxers, letting your erection wave free. The sight of the naked bear and her slavering pussy only made it worse. You weren't into this, you weren't into it at all. But your member was harder then it had even been. Angry, you shout at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that filth you put in me make th\u00eds happen too?!\" You yelled, pointing at your dick. Bella laughed loudly, shaking her head. \"That's all you, and I'd say you've been busted, friend. For all the playing coy you are ready to go.\" Your protests grow louder and more panicky as she slowly walks towards you. Her gyrating hips are almost hypnotizing you, their shapely forms twisting and turning so very smoothly beneath the soft fur.

How will you get to enjoy all of this beautiful birthday girl?\" she asks as she sits on your crotch and caresses her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as you feel her flesh make contact with your crotch, both in sexual pleasure and in shock from the pressure and weight she applied so quickly and easily. Your instinct told you to push back, but as you did you felt your crotch just sink deeper between her cheeks. Bella feels your erection asserting itself and moans in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, feeling feisty huh?\" she giggles. \"I'm not sure that I'm ready for you to go quite that far yet, but I'd be happy to give you a personal, guided tour,\" she says with a tipsy laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella pushes herself just slightly off of your small body and twists around so that her legs wrap around your head. You look up in awe at her large ass and dripping crotch, both looked like they were ready to engulf your face. Bella plopped her ass down onto your defenseless face, only to lift it immediately and replace it with her pussy. She rubbed her crotch across your head only to send it slipping deep between her cheeks. The bear couldn't seem to decide where exactly she wanted to focus her attention.

Your boner stood more erect than ever before and Bella had not missed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot damn you're nasty, little man. Any more and it'll explode.\" She kept giggling, feeling your struggles intensify beneath her.

You'd love for her to stop, but you'd settle for just a second to breathe right now. Your flailing arms tap her large thighs, but the only reaction it inspires is for her to squeeze her legs together. The fuzzy walls kept you firmly contained as she intended to ride you until her climax. The longer she went, the more your face was glazed in her love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a howling roar she climaxes all over your face.

The injection saved you from any lasting damage, but it apparently couldn't keep you conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien bear woman collapses in a heap onto your unconscious body panting heavily and happily. She plays with your hair with her fingers, showering you with compliments before realizing that you are unable to hear them. She smiles down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest up little human. You earned it, and you're gonna need it,\" she said, her smile growing broader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella started to reclothe herself, not bothering to do anything with your discarded attire. As she lifts up her tight pants, she pauses, glances at you, and grins, her body filling with lust and desire all over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up sweating, and no matter how many times you blink you just can't seem to get your eyes adjusted to the darkness you're in. It feels like you're wrapped up in a soft, but very thick, blanket. The heat is intense, and then the smell kicks in. It's damp, musty, and....oh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the memories of what happened before you passed out come rushing back as the smell of Bella's sex fills your nostrils. You try to move, but realize that the \"blanket\" you're wrapped up in has you held tightly. While your experience with these aliens is limited, it's not hard to figure out where you're at. Your guess is pretty much confirmed as Bella clenches her massive glutes, squeezing her ass around your significantly smaller body. She knows you're awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear muffled voices from outside Bella's rear, but can't quite make out what is being said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh! He's my birthday gift, it's my birthday trip, and I'm keeping him!\" Bella demanded emphatically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a whole week Bella?

Besides, your birthday ended a few clicks ago anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella pouted silently, figuring that she probably wasn't going to win this round. But maybe she could make a play for one more turn with her toy before she had to let him go...just the sensation she got from his meek struggles and squirms deep within her crack was enough to give it a shot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end....what is decided? </span></div></div>",

We've got everything on board to turn the rec room into party central. We can dance with him, sit in the lounge and tell eachother secrets and gossip. Maybe he'll get lucky and get smooches from one of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or all of us...\" Charlotte added, licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit! What do you think, girls? Shall we party like it's going out of style? Let's show the human how things are done outside of planet Earth, before he thinks all we do is sit around campfires for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the others start nodding in agreement, looking at you with playful smiles. You feel a shiver running down your spine. Just one of these amazonian anthro women was a handful. Dealing with all of them during a party could only go wrong. Especially if they started getting drunk. But your attention was peaked by the suggestion that these anthros have a few party tricks unknown to you. Perhaps this could be interesting. You barely feel a thing from Bella's heavy escapades from last night, so you should be safe if they party wild. Whatever may happen, it'll probably beat being one of their personal toys. At least this way the others might interfere before you pass out again. Taking the initiative you shout out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella laughs loudly, hearing the muffled yell coming from her pants. She reaches in and grabs your leg, yanking you free from your sweaty, smelly prison. Dangling you upside down she lets you see the happy smiles all around. \"Even the human is on board. Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all get busy transforming the spacious rec room. Tables are set aside and the big lounge sofa is brought in. You fulfill the critical role of being Bella's buttcheek warmer once again as she had crammed you back into her tight pants. The lighting is switched out for something with a bit more mood and music is played on the background. The alien tunes sound strangely similar to smooth jazz, making you wonder if they stole it during their visit or if jazz was an alien invention brought to Earth. The bear unveils the party room to you and puts you down on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, is it human? Room for dancing, drinks and snacks aplenty and the best company this side of the galaxy.\" They all giggle as you look around the room. It doesn't take long before the guest of honor is required. What do they want from you?</span></div></div>",

Not wanting to disappoint your hosts you shuffle onto your legs and take your place amidst all of them. It was intimidating to share a dance floor with these strange creatures, each of them easily measuring twice your height. Though there was a small upside to being so relatively small. All around you were big, beautiful butts swinging to the music. You felt yourself get weirdly aroused by the sight of them, and your attention had not gone unnoticed. You see them staring at you and quickly try to distract them by busting a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that? It looks fun.\" You breathe a sigh of relief, thankful your dance didn't turn out to be some profound insult in their culture. Soon all the amazonian anthros were trying to mimic your moves with varying degrees of success. Things seemed to liven up until Bella tripped over her own legs and stumbled to regain her footing. Her big body couldn't be stopped and came crashing down. Unfortunately you found yourself square in the landing zone and with a big <i>THUMP</i> she mashed you into the floor with her butt. The large bear woman instantly got on her feet, apologizing for squashing you flat and peeling you off the floor. You didn't offer a word as your body reformed itself from it's paper thin state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry, little guy, didn't mean to sit on you. Your dances are just so... odd.\" She says with a bright blush. You squeeze out a polite smile and hold your aching head. Unfortunately it seems this little accident had only emboldened them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I think I'm going to trip too...\" Charlotte yelled, letting herself drop down. You sidestep her butt slam at the last moment, letting her slam down on the hard floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves you right.\" The skunk snorted before gyrating her big hips closer to you. Up above she winked at the vixen, who offered a big grin in return. With a smooth flourish Suzy took another step towards you, putting you in the danger zone. You didn't realize the threat until you snuck a peek at her rear, only to find it on a collision course with you. \"Boop!\" the skunk giggled as she bumped you away, sending you stumbling towards the fox. Vivian turned around and immediately slowed her pace until she had you right where she wanted you. Just as you found your footing once more you realize it was the vixen's turn to bump you with those soft buttcheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like being hit by an enormous fuzzy pillow, bouncing you towards the bear. For her turn, Bella bumped you so hard you were nearly sent flying, her massive buns launching you towards Charlotte. The squirrel took an extra step to the side and aimed her next bump to the deer, not wanting her to be left out. \"Hey captain, catch!\" She yelled out as she sent you hurtling towards Captain Diana's swaying rear. Without interrupting her dance she gave you a light tap with her left asscheek, sending you back to the middle of the dance floor. All of them exchanged smiles, making you feel really nervous. If getting bounced around by those big butts was part of their 'dance', what else did they have in store for you during this party?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, time for one of our time-honoured party customs.\" Bella announced. Her tone made it hard to discern whether she was speaking the truth or making this stuff up on the spot. Whatever it might be, you prepare for the worst.</span></div></div>",

The skin tight suit held her breasts securely, but you still had a bit of room to move and breathe between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed a sway to her step as she walked, maybe she had indulged more than you initially realized. As you tried to push these thoughts aside, you hear her squeal and your world shifted rapidly. In her hurry to sneak you onto the ship, Charlotte had tripped and was falling fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she impacted the ground, you were fine.

Since you were somehow her favorite relative, she left her massive property to you. Unfortunately, that property was an old farm that was in great disarray, it was overgrown with weeds and most of the buildings had started falling apart years ago. You've spent the past few months trying to get the property in shape to be ready to sell. It was no easy task, as it was secluded far in the country and you had long since moved to the city some two hours away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were driving your luxury car down the highway to that property tonight. You received a call from the police about several unusual disturbances on the property around midnight Friday night. You didn't have much choice but to make the long drive to ensure that some group of unruly teenagers didn't undo all your hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reached the dark farm and pull out your flashlight to walk through the property. You don't see any unusual damage, but as you turn the corner your eyes fall upon something that is very much out of place. Some kind of enormous....space craft?! It's lights are off, but it's just sitting there in the middle of the old cow pasture. You turn to run back to your car, but hear a rustling noise and see the outline of a large, female creature examining your automobile. You abandon your car and head toward the brush. Your hands nervously grip your flashlight, but you don't dare turn it on. You try to wait patiently for the creature to leave your car so you can make your escape when suddenly, you see another large creature heading directly towards you. You have no idea if she's seen you yet, so you do your best to remain quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of anthro animal is it that will eventually discover you?

As you're trying to take in her shapely form, you're grabbed by your collar and yanked roughly out of your hiding place. Suddenly you're looking face to face with a much larger horse with long dark hair, a clydesdale by the looks of her muscular build. She smiles at you and then turns to address the smaller horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done Becca, you were able to distract the human enough that he didn't even hear me approach from behind,\" the clydesdale said. The smaller horse smiled proudly. You swallowed hard and squirmed to get away, but the muscular horse that held you had you secure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you Captain,\" the smaller horse said shyly. \"It was your plan that helped us succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clydesdale's smile broadened. \"I've told you rookie, call me Kristina.

They just settle themselves in on the poor creatures back without a care.\" Her eyes narrowed as she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say we show him what that feels like?\" Kristina asked her younger ship mate.

With confidence she leans on it, pressing you down on your knees. Her strength was intimidating as she slowly pushed you on to the ground. You were lying flat on your belly by the time the horse stopped pushing. She walked over you, heavy footfalls stomping down either side of you. She made it very clear those feet could be put on your back if you decide to act up. Paralyzed with fear you do the one thing you know she approves of: you stay still. Kristina responds by lowering herself over you, sitting on her knees to spare your back her heavy weight. But as time passed she slipped her legs out to the side. The result was her large butt inexorably lowering down on your back. Much like the hand before it simply commanded your body to get down. But you quickly ran out of any more space. Just as she was going to rest her weight on you the large horse pauses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do better... Becca, help me out, will ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up in horror as the smaller horse of the pair took on a similar position just in front of her superior. The captain held onto her with a loving embrace as the two readied themselves to squash you flat. This was going to be it, wasn't it? Squashed to death beneath two huge alien horse women. That's one hell of a way to go. You were snapped out of your melancholy by a sharp pain in your ass. You looked up to see Kristina discard a syringe. She looked you dead in the eye and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only want you humiliated, not dead. This is just a bit of personal stress relief. You're coming with us after this. And by all means, try running. We'd love to get another ride of shame after this is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith you all juiced up the horse ladies continued their evil plan. Two sets of buttcheeks descend upon your back, slowly moulding themselves to your form. Before long the overwhelming weight began to make itself known. It hurt like you would not believe. A persistent, dull aching, slowly moving back and forth along your back. Things couldn't get much worse until the horses decide to ride you a little harder. They lift their considerable heft off your back only to slam it back down with force. Each blow knocked the wind out of you, leaving you groaning and gasping for air. After half an hour of this utter torment the pair finally lift their butts off your back for more then a few seconds. Regular breath felt like a revelation. A good number of your ribs had cracked but Kristina's concoction made you almost completely numb to it. Only intense pain could shoot through the suppression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecca had already gotten back on her feet. But Kristina was a touch more spiteful then that. She stood almost to full height before pretending to slip and bringing her weight down upon your feeble little spine. A loud crack signaled another broken rib or two. Has she had enough?</span></div></div>",

An idea was bubbling up in the Clydesdale's brain. Something more to subject you to. She looked over to Becca and told her to leave. \"I'll handle this guy, you go out and look for more. Maybe we can find another for business.\" She turned to face you. \"So we can use this one for pleasure.\" You gulp, then grit your teeth in pain as Kristina grinds her heavy butt down on your torso some more. With a quick \"Yes ma'am!\" the smaller horse woman is on her way, leaving you with just the larger of the two. Wistfully she sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eventually that mixture I gave you is going to make your bones more resilient and more malleable. It takes time to reach its full effect, how much depends on species. It sadly means you won't do that satisfying little crunchy sound when I sit on you. Because make no mistake, human. Your kind has proven to be very good for sitting on so far. I should thank you for bringing us this revelation, but I have more things I want to try.\" You consider protesting her treatment of you, but you really don't want to give the cruel horse woman any excuses to hurt you more. She already seems unconcerned by your well-being, something she gladly shows by scooting herself backwards and flattening your crotch beneath her uncaring butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile she grabs your shoulders and hoists you up, your legs still firmly pinned by her rear. She had spread her legs and you found yourself between a pair of mammoth thighs. For a second you believe you could even see the Clydesdale's amazonian pussy poke through the tight-fitting spacesuit. You weren't given more time as she slammed those huge thighs together, instantly enveloping your arms and torso. Only your head poked out from this crushing vice. Kristina kept carrying that unsettling smirk on her face as she closed her eyes and listened intently. You wondered for a moment what the horse was listening to when you felt the muscular vice of her thighs bearing down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small and distant tinge of pain shot through you when the first rib snapped. The Clydesdale was careful enough to measure out the pressure and not crush you all at once. She wanted to listen to each little pop. One by one your ribs buckled under the strain of her powerful thighs. Each stung a little less than the last. The effects of the injection were becoming stronger. Even her weight on your legs seemed an afterthought at this point. Just to be safe you ham up the pain by overacting, wailing and groaning. \"This should barely even hurt anymore, human. Shut up and let me listen.\" The sadistic horse commanded. Her joy in hearing your bones snap was making it hard for her to be precise with her crushing. In an earsplitting cacophony the rest of your ribcage collapsed. Kristina moaned with delight, looking down at you and squeezing even more. She already smashed all your ribs, what more could she hope to... Your thought was interrupted by the sound of your arm snapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy snort the large horse put all her strength into the final squeeze. Both your arms broke in several more places as you felt your whole body compress between those immense thighs. When she let go you flopped onto the ground like a bag of bodyparts. But in truth, none of her vicious squeezing had hurt at all. You only felt the obliterating pressure. Much like how you could only feel your body regenerating itself now. Kristina hadn't moved from her seat that was your crotch. An unsettling amount of warmth radiated from between her legs and her breathing seemed faster then before. You try not to think about what that might mean. When your torso is back in one piece the Clydesdale seems to have regained her self-control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a lot of fun, human. Let's go in to space and have even more fun.\" Her taunting was interrupted by a voice in her earpiece. She quickly issued commands you didn't understand and returned her attention to you. \"There just one more thing I want to hear crunch...\" She said as she reached down for your head. Two large hands took hold of your dome and began to squeeze. With a distressingly loud crack your skull collapsed and you blacked out immediately. With the same ease as the rest of your body your head reformed itself. You awaken...</span></div></div>",

Behind the fuzziness is an immovable surface, like a wall. No, wait. Upon closer investigation it does move, but not much. Your brain needs a moment to piece it all together when a voice overhead completes your realization. That large horse woman has stuffed you in her space suit! The voice was unquestionably Kristina. The same sadistic horse that sat and listened as she broke all of your bones. Her serum had prevented nearly all of the pain and you felt completely healthy. Her voice sounded rushed and hasty. After her conversation had ended she seemed to be in a hurry. Her large body moved, forcing you to move along with it. You had little choice with the tight outfit strapping you against her. A few doors later she stopped and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you took your sweet time. I almost began to worry crushing your head would kill you. You need punishing for scaring me like that. A good chance to see how far the serum has progressed.\" Her large arms introduced themselves with heavy pressure on your back. She was hugging you through the thin fabric of her spacesuit. Quickly the large horse woman ramped up the potency of her hug. A crushing squeeze stressed you to your limits once again. But where she would have cracked every last one of your ribs before nothing happened. You felt yourself compress under the merciless hug, but your bones seemed to have gotten flexible enough to just roll with the punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, you seem to have grown completely immune to pressure.

For now just live with the fact that me and the others are going to take turns with you, doing whatever we desire. You can object if you like, but I doubt any one of us will care.\" You begin to realize the callous machinations of the large horse were just the tip of the iceberg. She had so much more in store for you. \"I don't need much of you right now, human. Just squirm a bit for me whilst I smother you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to raise one of your dozens of questions but your world spun around. The horse woman rested herself on a long couch, pinning you beneath her. Her weight alone was enough to make you feel uncomfortable. Her slowly grinding your body into the soft fabric of the couch was downright unsettling. Kristina loved the overwhelming power she had over the puny human. He could be made to do whatever she wanted. Just flattening him almost seemed like a waste. What does she do with you next?</span></div></div>",

The dull pain kept radiating through you, but you could feel it slowly fade. Becca noticed your surprise, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you've figured out that you've become very hard to kill. Now before you get cocky, I hope the last few minutes did demonstrate that you are still very much able to feel pain.

Because let's be honest, we both saw that Kristina has way more planned for you.\" The idea of having a friend on this interstellar trip was appealing. Not going on this trip in the first place sounded even better. Before the horse can conjure up a game, you throw her a suggestion that you think might end up in your favor.

I may not be the captain, but I'm not stupid,\" she says with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can begin to plead your innocence, Becca continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you really want to play hide and seek, we will.

You're completely pinned against her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on little human, that's not a great hiding spot you have there!\" Becca laughs and shakes her chest, causing her bare breasts to collapse over your body again and again as she begins to count down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you grit your teeth and start to move. You're not really sure where you're heading, just down. You realize that her sleeves and leggings are going to be far too narrow for you to navigate.

She seemed dumbstruck as to how to respond. Should she be offended this human dared to suggest these things? Or should she just drop the pretense and get to the good stuff? And just what would that good stuff do to you? So many questions buzzed around your mind, but all of them scattered. Becca squatted down before you, looking you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do you think you're worthy of having pleasure with us?\" You don't see any other outcome. You dispel your uncertainty and nod. \"We will see about that. I shall administer the test. She quickly grabbed you and threw you over her shoulder. With grace the large horse woman snuck into the facility. She avoided the other guards to avoid having to answer questions about the human slung over her shoulder. Home wasn't much further. There the little man could be tested properly and... intimately. With due haste she picks up the pace and arrives at her spaceship soon enough. Here too she dodged the chatty crewmembers and headed straight for her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were crudely dumped onto the bedsheets whilst Becca made sure you two would not be interrupted for the next half hour. The large horse woman leans in and eyes you curiously. Her pants had gone missing and her underwear showed a distinct wet patch. Quickly she grabbed you and brought you close to that intimidating moist spot. You were horrified and disgusted, and this was only the start. She threw you onto the bed and straddled your tiny body on her knees. She was sitting quite far forward. A drop now would have her privates smashing down on top of your gut. You wince a little at the idea. Thankfully the trial didn't contain any heavy squashing for now. The massive weight of her privates pushing down on you keeps you firmly in place but doesn't make the effort to properly squash you flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of overwhelming teasing Becca finally did the test. \"If you want to start off on the pleasurable parts, you'd better show that you can take as much as you can give.\" What hellish tasks await you?</span></div></div>",

No extra light when we go searching around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay as still and as quiet as possible, not wanting to be seen. She's extremely close at this point. It's all you can do to keep from dropping your flashlight and sprinting away when you truly make out her form. She looks just like a cow would on earth! Well, if a cow had learned to talk and walk on it's hind feet. The closer she got, the more you realized she had some distinctly human features. Instead of a relatively rectangular body, her body was curvaceous with a shapely ass and thick thighs. At the ends of her arms, where you would expect to see hooves, were hands. Or at least, they resembled hands covered in black gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer outfit was extremely tight, built to display her curves. It was colored purple and black as if to help her blend in with the night sky. As you observed her, you realized that her outfit had been built to allow her large udders to hang freely. But instead of drooping heavily as you might expect, they stood out firmly from her body. Their pink hue stood in sharp contrast to the darker colors of her outfit. She was clearly searching for something, but you weren't sure what her goal was. You certainly hoped it wasn't for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow woman continued her complaining, oblivious to your presence. \"Just once I'd like to land at mid-day and search in the sunliiiiiiaaaah!\" her complaining was cut off and replaced by a shocked shout as her leg was tangled up in some brush and she fell. Forward. Toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, this would have been your cue to get out of there. But her fall happened so suddenly that you were frozen in place, unable to move as you saw her large body topple toward you. Her udders seemed to grow as they filled your vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOMP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed on your body, covering you completely on impact. She groaned in pain for a moment and cursed the brushes that made her fall. You struggled for air beneath her, her udders enveloping your face making oxygen inaccessible. The alien seems to feel your struggles, and her groan turns into a pleasurable moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, well hello there. Maybe that fall was fortuitous. You were quite well hidden little earthling,\" she said, not bothering to lift herself off of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed herself onto her elbows, but let her breasts still smother your face. She giggled as she felt you struggle to push them aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having some trouble little guy?\" she says with a smile. \"It looks like we can call the search off, you're exactly what we were looking for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she presses her chest together and lifts herself off of you, but you go with her, carried up by your head which is still caught between her massive mammeries. The cow laughs and her chest bounces, taking you along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These girls have been called eye catching before, but I don't think it's ever been quite so literal,\" she laughed, before turning and heading back to her ship. </span></div></div>",

You haven't known the woman for a long time, but from what you can make of it, she seemed nice enough: clumsy and somewhat flirtatious, but nice nonetheless. You shudder at the thought of seeing her angry side, and decide you'd rather not bring it out of her. You turn to face the cow woman, and see her putting away what seemed to be a lasso, assuring you that you made the right choice; had you kept on running she would have just roped you up, and who knows what would have happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you changed your mind sweetie.\" The cow uttered, a genuine smile appearing on her face as she made her way toward you, as you were currently too stunned to do anything at the moment, only now realizing the sheer size of the cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please don't hurt me.\" You hear yourself whimper. It was a stupid request, seeing as the cow was much larger and much stronger than you, and could do whatever she wanted to you, but it was the first thing that came in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow woman let out a small giggle, leaning down so that she was face to face with you. \"Don't worry,\" the cow responds, \"I promise I won't hurt you...er-not intentionally at least.\" You mind wonders back to the incident where she fell on you a while back, and you can't stop yourself from letting out a small fit of laughter. It seems the cow remembered as well as you, and joined in your laughter. After she finished, she let out another smile on her face, this one somehow even bigger than the last one. \"I think we got off on the wrong foot before cutie, How about we reintroduce ourselves?\" The cow asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you reply glad to see that you are on good terms with the cow, \"My name is Steven.\" You continue, extending your arm for a handshake. You didn't even have time to react before the massive bovine grabbed your arm and pulled you into what you could only describe as the mother of all hugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's nice to meet ya Steven!\" The bovine says as her plump breasts nearly engulfed your entire head. \"I'm Taura, and I have the feeling that we're going to get along <br>\r\n<i>just fine</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug wasn't nearly as bad as when she fell on top of you, but you were still smothered, although you found yourself enjoying this. Soon enough, Taura let go of you, and you let yourself collect your thoughts. You had no idea whether or not she purposefully put you between her boobs, but there was no denying one thing: she may be a cow and from another planet, but she had a great pair of tits. Realizing what you just thought, you took a few steps back from Taura.\"Wait!\" you call out to her, prompting her to give you a look of concern. \"Before we do anything else, can you do one thing for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaura's smile returned, \"Sure thing Stevey! What do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad to see she was still friendly, you  chose to ignore her new nickname for you and reflected on Taura's question: what did you want? There was a million things going on in your head, but you soon decided on one thing.

It would stand to reason that this human had never seen any of her species. \"I don't have to tell you I'm not from this world. I think the spaceship kind of gave that one away. I am part of a team of scouts and explorers. We seek out lesser civilizations and investigate their potential. Usually this is done from afar, but we felt extra tests were required on a more... personal level.\" Her awkward smile almost made you forget she had you trapped between her boobs. You wanted to ask another, but Taura interjected. \"Now it's my turn. Why are you so small?\" What was that supposed to mean? \"Small? This is average height for a human. As for why we're all this size, I have no idea. Maybe your heightened civilized brain can figure that one out.\" The cow was a little annoyed, squeezing her breasts together just a little to add some squeezing discomfort to your stay. You remained undeterred in your curiosity. With some trepidation you asked her the big question that was burning on your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of tests are you planning on me? Are you going to stick a probe up my butt?\" Taura laughs at your suggestion then looks eerily contemplative. You might have just given her an idea. The cow snaps back to the moment and shoots you a broad smile. \"Nothing painful, don't fret. It's just that whenever we want to induct someone into our little federation, we've got to make sure they can handle it.\" Your eyebrows rose further. \"Handle what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that on average, you'll find us aliens to be a lot more... hands-on in our relationship. Even among friends we share acts that you would consider exclusive to the most passionate lovers. If you need any proof of that, remember that we met not ten minutes ago and you're already wedged between my tits.\" You shudder a little. Being this close to the cow was one thing, but she made it sound like she was expected a lot more out of you. How would you even keep up? \"I understand what you're saying, Taura. But I do worry my... stature might have me come up short.\" She giggled at your pun. \"Don't fear, we'll give you some special treatment. It will make you nigh on indestructible.\" You felt a strange lack of relief. Even if you'd be unharmed, she was still talking about abducting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last question.\" You suggested. Taura wanted to move on, but with a weary sigh she humored you. \"Will I ever see my planet again?\" The cow was flabbergasted. What in all of the worlds was he talking about? Then she realized the issue. \"Oh no silly. You'll only be with us for a month. After that we should have a very clear picture of the usefulness of humans in the Federation. Though I must say, the preliminary research is encouraging.\" She winked at you and jiggled her chest. Her bouncing mounds bumped you back and forth, squeezing you a little whenever they collided with you in the middle. You as the representative for all of humanity. Stars shone in your eyes at the idea of such fame. You didn't even hear her mention that refusal to go with her meant she'd have to eliminate you as a witness. It didn't matter to you, you had your mind made already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taura, I'd gladly come with you.\" The cow smiled and carefully stood up. Her impressive rack held your weight remarkably well, the bovine occasionally squeezing you playfully. She walked into the spaceship and spoke to you again. \"Now that we're aboard, what do you want to do first? Introduce yourself to the rest of the crew or get your alien booster shot to make you tough?</span></div></div>",

She radios to her crew to call off the search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a volunteer ladies. Administering A22 serum and confirming test sequences.  If everything is successful,  we'll meet you on the bridge,\" you get a bit nervous at the mention of tests,  still unsure of what that meant. But before you can ask, Taura produces a large needle from her utility belt and you go pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your reaction, Taura laughs. \"Oh...yeah we weren't expecting you to be quite so small. Let me adjust this,\" then with a squeeze of her hand, the needle becomes gelatin before reforming in a much smaller size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The A22 serum is designed to do to your body what happened to the needle, minus the shrinking part,\" Taura explained with a smile. \"Essentially it will allow your body to adjust as needed to any circumstances. As you heard, I'll have to confirm it worked before we board the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in confirmation of your understanding. Without further word,  the alien cow woman gently presses the needle into your neck. Your vision gets cloudy for a moment and your legs feel very unsteady, but Taura supports you until you adjust, can stand in your own, and your vision has cleared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your host for the next month and realize something is off.

When did she pull off her pants?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaura smiles, \"Ready for that test?\" she asks, bending at the waist and shaking her round ass in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to stammer a response, but none comes. Without waiting for further confirmation, she launches herself up and backwards, landing her soft ass directly on your much smaller body. You flatten instantly any groan in pain as Taura shifts and moos happily on top of you. After a few painful moments, she stands to her feet and watches happily as your body restores itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Test 1 complete!\" she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TEST ONE!?!\" you yell. \"How many tests are there and why the hell did you flatten me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her smile still plastered to her face, Taura responds casually. \"There's just one more test. And how else do you expect me to confirm that A22 worked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe logic was...relatively sound, but you were not happy. Before you could protest further, Taura bent over again, this time gripping her cheeks and exposing her large crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for test 2. Get in.\" she said casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, you cannot seriously expect me to just walk myself into your ass,\" you protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaura stood and shrugged. \"Why not? You're the right size and it's a perfect way to test your ability to function with limited oxygen. Unless you'd like to try a more cramped space on for size,\" she said excitedly, her hand moving to her crotch. You recall what Taura said earlier about her species being more hands on. She wasn't exaggerating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N....no, you're right. Your ass makes perfect sense,\" you relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile returning, the cow again exposes her massive crack to you. You move slowly and hesitantly towards her, but Taura is impatient and grabs you by the collar, her strong arm forcing you between her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfied sigh, she stands, clenched her cheeks, and pulls up her pants. Sealing you completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I could have just covered his mouth and pinched his nose, but this is soooo much better,\" she says quietly to herself while enjoying your squirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, confirming that you had not passed out from lack of air, Taura announces that you've passed both tests. The serum worked and you can safely board her ship. But does she let you out of her ass first?</span></div></div>",

You signed up for a full month of this. Not much for it then. You'll have to learn to like this or it's going to be a very long month. Desperately your mind tries to shift this torment into something positive. There have got to be some redeeming qualities about this. The warmth was something. You had to admit that it was comfortably warm inside of Taura. You could feel everything move with surprising elegance, the narrow fleshy tunnel pulsing around you. If you closed your eyes you could almost imagine it as a full-body massage. With your eyes shut you also picked up on her heartbeat. It was a relaxing rhythm, making you feel more at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaura approached the spaceship to find the others already waiting for her. \"Where's the subject?\" The large horse woman asks. She simply responds by slapping her big butt. The other aliens all roll their eyes and giggle. \"You're unbelievable Taura, you only just met him.\" Your captor shrugs it off and boards the ship. They all take a seat on the bridge and quickly the ship blasts off. Your fleshy home shuddered and shook during takeoff, making you feel a little nervous. Taura's heart beat faster. She'd bounced on and off many planets before, but the rapid launch procedure was always a bit of a rush. She excused herself off the bridge and walked through the bright corridors to a room with a biohazard warning written in alien script.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room looked like a small laboratory, several tables had odd-looking setups for complex experiments. Taura was more interested in the large chamber in the back. The glass door slid open and she walked in. The cow removed her pants and squatted down. With a grunt she began to push. The squishy walls around you pressing on your body, squeezing you back out. With surprising ease your slime-covered body slid out of her rear. Before you knew what was going on, Taura had sealed the door, locking you inside. Through the glass she spoke. \"Decontamination, we can't have any Earth diseases and stuff travelling with you. Just hold your breath, that'll make it tickle less.\" You weren't about to second guess her on this alien contraption and quickly sucked your lungs full of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud beep was the precursor for shower heads on all sides to hose you down with warm water. You were amazed the aliens got the temperature just right and even more that they'd installed such a feature. Next, a glowing red grid descended from the ceiling. It pushed away the water on your body and clothes and left you giggling a little as it tickled your skin. The glass door slid open and Taura walked in. She pulled up her pants and was holding a datapad, tapping it and staring at you. She didn't have to say a thing, you already knew this was another test. \"How do you feel?\" She asked. \"A little confused, but not because of what just happened.\" The cow nodded appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, follow me.\" You walked out of the laboratory into a nearby room. It was almost breathtakingly barren. A small living room with a bed, a desk and a cupboard. \"Sorry for the size of everything. Again, we hadn't quite anticipated you to be this short. In that cupboard you'll find some new clothes. Please put some on now.\" You were surprised. Quickly you look up to her and ask why. Taura rolls her eyes. \"Because they'll fit you better, now if you're done asking silly questions get to changing.\" It dawned upon you that she had no plans to leave the room. You ask her gently if it would be alright if she waited outside for you to change. \"Why? Are you afraid I'll see something I'm not supposed to see? Because if so you're going to be in for a few major surprises in the next month.\" You gulp loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this is taking too long. Here, let me help...\" Taura sighs. She grabs you and puts you on the bed. With all subtlety thrown out the nearest airlock she grabs your shirt and rips it apart, tearing the scraps from your body. Your denim pants prove just as fragile in her strong hands. Your socks are the only thing she removes without shredding them in the process. You meep with embarrassment as a large hand grabs your crotch and pulls away your boxers. They too are pulled to strips and discarded. You're left lying on your back, not a thread of clothing on you. Taura hovers above you ominously, hunched down on all fours. Her warm breath washes over your chest and head. You blush at the intimacy of the situation, but Taura has got other ideas. Then again, maybe she'd earned a little fun with him.</span></div></div>",

The first and simplest of them all was simply to lie down. But something didn't feel right. Seeing you lying there, shivering and distressed made her realize her mistake. Taura quickly stood up and undressed, commanding you to stay put whilst she slid herself out of her spacesuit. It takes mere seconds before she stands before you in her full undressed beauty. Her short soft fur looked strangely inviting, cloaking her in cream and hazel patches. No time was wasted before she was back in her old position, menacingly hovering her large body over you. You felt a little more at ease now that the sterile space suit had been replaced with her naked skin. You looked up at Taura, curious about her plans for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, so nervous. You're going to have to learn to calm down a little around us. Here, let me put you in the right state of mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her with a dumbfounded stare. What the hell was that cryptic nonsense supposed to mean? Taura only offered a smile before lowering herself down. You twitched a little when the first bits of warm fur brushed against your body. In moments she covered you like a living, breathing blanket. Her large body weighed heavily on you, smothering you beneath her soft gut. Your little resistance boost seemed to cope with it well. Without the painful amount of weight to worry about you slowly begin to see the positives. Taura was undeniably nice to cuddle. Her soft bosoms were mushed just atop your head, brushing against your hair. It almost feels like a pity she didn't lower herself any lower to wrap your head between them. With every little movement her large body shifted a little, the soft surface rubbing against you. Your manhood seemed to love all this attention, quickly rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth downstairs had not gone unnoticed by the cow, who felt your little soldier pushing up against her belly. \"Wow, you caught on quick. Just put your hands around my chest and let me work the magic.\" Wait, was she suggesting you two start doing it? You only met her half an hour ago and she was from outer space! You want to suggest slowing it down a little, but your instincts have you wrap your arms around her furred body. She wasn't even from this planet yet everything about this felt strangely natural. You cuddled with her a while longer whilst she moos softly and contently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted herself back on all fours to get in position for her 'magic'. What parts align?</span></div></div>",

Then you head back to the city and buy the biggest bottle of booze you could find to forget all about this. You kept running along the dirt road, seeing a small patch of woods up ahead. You could probably hide in there. But the cow woman wasn't close to done with you. She'd started to move, slowly walking towards you. She opened up one of the pockets on her utility belt and pulled out a length of rope. Despite her alien nature, it looked no different from normal rope. The cow woman deftly tied one end into a knot, pulling the remainder through a loop to create a lasso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still gaining more distance from her, frantically pushing yourself past your usual meager stamina. Adrenaline had you racing for your freedom, not bothering to look over your shoulder at your pursuer. She smiled as she lined up her throw. It seemed like a scenario from the Wild West, just with all the actors in different places. The cow about to lasso a human. Her smile grew just thinking about all the other things she'd do to her catch. With a deep breath she pooled her concentration, paying no mind to anything other than the feeling of the rope in her hands and the sight of her quarry running down the dirt road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lasso arced gracefully through the air, hitting the bullseye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she saw the loop hit home the cow pulled hard. It instantly snapped tight around your waist, tying one arm to your side and pulling you off your feet. The sudden reversal in movement was a little painful, as was the rough landing on your ass. The cow woman kept reeling you in, the strong pulls on her lasso stopping you from untangling yourself. She kept slowly walking towards you, a broad smile growing on her face. When she was finally within arms reach of her struggling, dirty prey the cow wasted no time. Her grip was rough and uncompromising as she tied up your other arm and both of your legs. Satisfied with her handiwork, the cow woman picked you up and threw you over her shoulder. With a triumphant grin she began to head for the spaceship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun. Thanks for that, little man. Let's have some more fun on the ship.\"</span></div></div>",

Her breasts, or udders in this case, hung freely from her clothing. She had a dangerous look about her, and you weren't going to wait around for her to track you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fight or flight instinct overpowers you, and there was no way you were going to take on this alien cow woman one on one in a fight. You took off running like you'd never run before. Not toward your car, not toward the ship, just away. Branches and bush slap against your arms, legs, and even your face, but you don't care. You're not paying any attention to any obstacle in your path in your rush to get away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat proves to be your biggest mistake. You hit a large, fleshy wall and bounce backwards before falling on your butt. You look up and see a smiling face of an intimidating pig anthro standing above you. She is apparently the creature you just ran into. She's clearly a female as she exhibits well rounded curves, although her breasts are significantly smaller than the cow's you were running from. Her hips and thighs were significantly thicker. You swallowed hard and tried to back away, but the alien creature grabbed you and stuck a needle in your neck before you could move.

You didn't go to any fancy schools or have a typical degree or what people would call funding, but that didn't stop you from pursuing your passion. You built your own lab and filled it with every technological gizmo and gadget you could find. You even hired your own intern! At least, that's what you called the high school kid whose van you relied on for transportation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne evening after dusk, you were toying with a piece of technology you recently purchased from Craigslist. It was a pair of goggles, similar to night vision. But instead of reading heat signatures or allowing you to see in the dark, these goggles tracked ultraviolet radiation like that given off from the sun. It wasn't cheap, but you had to have it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you focused your goggles on the sky, you saw something move. You whipped them off and shifted to your telescope, but saw nothing but clear sky and a few early stars. Returning to the goggles, you definitely noticed some kind of a planetary body that was moving. It wasn't consistent in shape, as if the radiation was impacting it differently constantly. You realized there was a reason you couldn't find it with your telescope, this was a spaceship that was cloaked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing some quick calculations, you tried to determine its trajectory. It seemed like it was heading for a clearing not far out of town, and you had discovered it! You called up all the local news outlets to alert them to your discovery, the ship's arrival had to be documented! But they were familiar with your \"work\" and laughed you off, disregarding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you wouldn't be discouraged, you called up Sam, your intern, and instructed him to pick you up in exactly 30 minutes. He wasn't nearly as excited as you were. Never the less, you gathered every camera and recording device you could find in your lab and loaded them into Sam's van when he arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued tracking the ship with your goggles as Sam drove, confused about all your excitement. You hadn't fully revealed what you had learned yet, couldn't risk him backing out from fear of course. You arrived at the clearing minutes before you anticipated the ship would get there and started to set up your equipment a good distance from the van. You didn't want Sam ruining your shot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sam felt a disturbance and a heat in the atmosphere as a hot wind blew through the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh....Shane?\" Sam asked nervously. You ignored him and focused on the source of the wind. The ship was landing! You would finally be proven right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creatures within the ship wasted little time and opened a large door. Huge beings who seemed to eclipse 10 feet in height started to exit the invisible craft. That was about all Sam could take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shane!\" he called, \"We've gotta go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonesense!\" you responded, \"This will be my greatest discovery Sam!\" You called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned to look at your intern, you saw him slamming the door on the van and peeling out as quick as the old vehicle would let him. You just smiled, it was a good thing you didn't tell him about this earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by Sam, you didn't realize that the aliens had debarred their ship and had all seen you, exposed in the middle of the clearing. For the first time, you started to feel nervous as you observed the excited look on their faces. In shock, you realized that the group all resembled animals native to earth, but walked, acted, and were built as if they were human women. There was a rag tag look about the group, they didn't quite seem to fit together. It was as if this ship were a life boat from a bizarro world version of Noah's Ark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing back any thoughts of escape, you filmed and snapped pictures furiously, documenting each one. The first one off the ship was a powerful looking kangaroo, with incredibly thick, muscular thighs. She was followed by a curvaceous, thick seal woman with both long legs and a finned tail that tapered out from her lower back. A serious looking beaver woman followed her, and her tail was exposed in a similar fashion to the seal's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the beaver was a creature who looked like she was clad in red armor, but you realized that she was an alien version of a lobster. Her hands were exposed within her open claws. A thin waisted mink followed her. The mink's large hips and breasts stood in stark contrast to her narrow waist and she walked with a confident, seductive sway with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all held devices in their hands, something you didn't recognize that peeked your curiosity instantly. One of them gestured for you to come closer, with an inviting but provocative look on her face. Your legs mindlessly started carrying you closer to them, planting one foot in front of the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich alien do you approach?</span></div></div>",

It struggled to contain her breasts and the top was clearly torn to allow them room to breathe. Her shorts were similarly originally much longer, but were modified to fit her round ass and cut off high on her thick thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clumsily walked toward her, staying locked with her seductive gaze until you could barely see her eyes beyond her large chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your feet stopped moving, the seal wrapped her arms around you and pulled you to her body, forcing your face into her belly.

Her big body is resting on top of you, its considerable weight pinning you down. With someone of her amazonian stature you expected this to hurt, but her pudgy self squashed you without a hint of pain. Her vast tits had your upper torso pinned while her hefty gut saw to pinning your whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up to see her peering gaze again. The same seductive eyes that lured you to her in the first place. She didn't say anything, content to just watch as you woke up. As detail began to return to the world you noticed one more thing. Her supple skin gently brushing against your own. All but your boxers had been removed and her top had gone missing too. Her smooth surface was impressive to feel, even with all the weight behind it. With her every breath it shifted and moved against you in subtle ways. Your enjoyment of this had not gone unnoticed. With a smile the seal began to wiggle a little. Not much was needed, you could feel her large body shift over you. Left to right, sometimes rising up only to brutally squash you again. You were at her mercy, and you loved it. Finally, she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you wiggle for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to obey and began shuffling, but she had you pinned. You wanted to give her more, but pathetic squirming was your only card. It seemed to be enough to satisfy her to your relief.

She giggled loudly, wrapping her arms around your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I are going to get along great.\" She said, shoving your head into her ample cleavage. \"I agree\" you replied, but all the seal heard was happy, muffled gibberish. <br>\r\nYour playing around was interrupted by a loud beep from the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he awake yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I think he's going to like it here with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring him to the bridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, just give me a few more minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have twenty minutes, then we want a piece of him.\" Giggling could be heard before the voice channel closed.

Just one tip: never ask the kangaroo about her pouch. She's always very eager to give humans a closer look and it's a lot stuffier then it looks.

Your breathe more rapidly and look up nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we only have 20 minutes, no point in wasting any more time just looking at each other right?

Except this time, you were being pressed against her full breasts as opposed to her soft belly. You squirm and struggle for breath, but make little impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh I love your little squirms Shane!\" Silver squeals in delight, \"You humans are just so cute. I mean...once you get past the weird baldness and everything,\" she laughs, holding you even tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're shocked that you still conscious and haven't blacked out from lack of breath. Come to think of it, there's been a list of things that Silver has done that you probably shouldn't have made it through conscious. Whatever she did to you, you're grateful for it. Although you question how much of it was for your benefit and how much of it was for her own. Your scientific curiosity urged you to find out more about it, but you had much more pressing concerns at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to love it with us up here Shane,\" Silver smiles, relinquishing her hold on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....up?\" you ask?

I know we seem a little thrown together, but we always have each other's backs. We'll expect the same from you of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can ask Silver what that means, what the group is, or what their expectations will be of you, you feel a large hand on your shoulder. Despite your protests, you're pushed down lower on the mattress. You see Silver's belly appear in front of you, but only for a moment, as your journey is apparently not complete. She continues forcing you down until you're face is just a few inches away from her fabric covered crotch. You look up, but can't see much beyond the seal's large belly and her enormous breasts that stick out beyond that. Her face is completely hidden from your view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a laugh, Silver flips onto her other side revealing her thick ass, struggling to remain contained within her cut off shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have my back Shane?\" she says with a laugh, slapping her large ass and letting it jiggle in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, completely baffled by what you're supposed to say. You felt an urge of excitement coursing through your body, but began to sweat nervously. You would have been much more comfortable with one of the many gadgets in your <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">garage</span> lab than you were face to face with Silver's sexy, jiggling flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not given the opportunity to deliberate over the most appropriate response for very long as Silver starts to move again. This time, you see her massive ass begin to roll toward you. Her shorts make contact with your body and you begin to panic before the seal stops and pulls back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, silly me. Now that we've met, no need for these to get in the way right Shane?\" she asks with a coy laugh before tearing off her tight shorts with much more ease than you would have thought possible. With a happy sigh, her steamrolling ass moved toward you once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to create some distance, but your response was much too late and her backside covered too much space. You found yourself pinned helplessly between the Silver's thick cheeks. She sat up, adding to the weight that bore down on your much smaller body. She clenched her cheeks over your significantly smaller body with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wiggle for me Shane,\" she said with a happy laugh as she bore down on you. </span></div></div>",

A loud giggle made it to your ears as you felt their hefty mass shake and shuffle. You had no say in their movements. You were simply there to be dragged around for her entertainment. At times she stopped moving just to settle her immense weight on top of you, leaning back to add as much as physically possible to your torment. You could hear the heavy-duty bed struggle to keep up. You expected to hear your bones failing to keep up, but here too it seemed that the alien treatment prevented any harm. You could make a mint with this stuff back on earth. Silver seemed confident enough in her inability to harm you, happily bouncing her much large body on top of yours. Merely flattening her little toy started to bore her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seal got on all fours, allowing you to breathe again for a few precious seconds. A large hand grabbed your shoulder and flipped you over. You were lying on your belly below Silver's much larger belly. She quickly smooshed you into her bed by letting herself drop down. With a laugh she crawled up and sat on her knees. Her butt was hanging low enough to brush against your legs. A playful smile curled up along her face as she slowly spread her knees to lower her bottom. Gentle brushing became merciless squashing as she flattened your lower body. Again she bounced her amazonian butt bounced up and down, squashing half your body. With a hammy southern accent Silver spoke with barely restrained giggling. \"Yeehaw pardner! We gotta go a long way an time's a wastin. Giddyap Shane, my trusty steed!\" A heavy hand on your back completed the seal's corny playing around. You try to raise a smile inbetween the heavy buttslams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the intercom crackles on again. \"Silver! Haul ass to the bridge for briefing! Now! If you're not here in five minutes you don't get to have him for a week!\" The voice on the intercom sounded irritated. The seal sighed deeply, rolling her eyes. \"Welp, looks like our little private session is over. But don't worry, I'm sure I'll get to ride you again, if you know what I'm saying.\" Whether it was an accident or part of her spiel you don't know, but you felt her lean forward to get off of you and her pussy briefly pressed against your butt. You're a little flustered but quickly straighten yourself up as Silver slips back into her suit. With a grumpy scowl she grabs you, throws you over her shoulder and walks out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the large corridors she walks until she reaches a big door reading 'bridge'. She pauses for a moment and speaks to you. \"Just don't do anything stupid and you'll be fine.\" It'd be helpful to know what would be considered stupid among these aliens, but there's no time for that. Silver puts her hand on the console and the door slides open.</span></div></div>",

She handily flung you onto it's surface. The awkward silence amidst all of you hung uncomfortably in the air. Finally you break the ice with a stammering \"hi?\" Almost all at once the alien creatures burst out laughing. Great, they're not just amazonian aliens with a passion for squashing, they also like pranks. You're beginning to doubt whether it was such a good idea to approach them. The Kangaroo clears her throat and speaks in a commanding tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am captain Kelly-Ann. I supervise these misfits on our arduous journeys. We travel from planet to planet to examine the local wildlife and establish contact with sentient lifeforms. I see my crew brought in a fine specimen to represent what was it... humanity.\" You weren't sure if the kangaroo was being sarcastic, but it was probably best to stay on the captain's good side. She continued in a more condescending tone. \"If you ever feel hurt, do let me know. Unlike our slacking ship doctor I've actually followed the three week seminar on human biology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" the beaver yelled. \"I don't need some seminar to teach me about humans, they're not that hard.\" She and the kangaroo stared daggers at eachother for a few seconds before she turned to you. \"Hey there... Shane was it? I'm Vivie, the doctor keeping all of these nutjobs in one piece.\" She reached out to shake your hand. You respond in kind but wince at her immensely powerful handshake. \"Oh, sorry. Forgot how puny your little bodies are. Good thing Silver already gave you the serum. One of my finest creations. We could all dogpile on top of you and you would be able to walk away unscathed afterwards.\" You quickly assure her that the seal already did more than enough to convince you of its effectiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lobster woman was next to introduce herself. \"I'm Claudia and I take up the role of quartermaster on this ship. I keep track of every piece of equipment on board and make sure our things are in perfect working order. If you need anything, be it extra rations or something for your room, please ask me.\" She the put on her most sultry smile. \"And if you want a little fun, definitely ask me.\" Booing and jeering followed before the next crewmember spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already know my name. What I do aboard this scrapheap is maintaining all parts mechanical. Thanks to my handiwork we have about 20% more power in our engines and free interstellar TV.\" The others begrudgingly nod their heads in approval. \"When I'm not squeezing power out of engines I love squeezing some love out of little humans like you.\" You gulp loudly. You know what she's capable of and by now it's becoming clear that not only was there going to be more of this, the others were likely to join in on the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly the slender mink spoke up. \"Melinda is the name and going fast is my game. I'm the navigator and pilot for this ship. If you need to get from A to B in the smallest amount of time, I'm your gal. And if you need smooching in ways you'll never find on Earth, I'm also there for you.\" You were taken aback a little by the forwardness of these aliens. Was that just a common thing among all aliens or was this bunch a special case. Whichever it may be, you were in for one hell of an adventure. Immediately following introductions a large argument erupted. Naturally it could only be about you. Everyone wanted a piece of this fancy novelty. After much deliberation the choices were narrowed down to Vivie and Kelly-Ann. They needed a tiebreaker and both had the same idea. Why not let the human choose? Will you join captain Kelly-Ann for the foreseeable future or is Doctor Vivie going to look after you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took a solid half hour of heated debate before Vivie and the captain settled their argument. You were starting to fall asleep when the beaver woman approached you. She was going to be your caretaker for a while. The others grumbled a little still, but accepted that they'd all get a turn. Maybe the doc could get him to open up a little bit. You were still cautious around all these amazonian animal women. Their overt flirting was making you feel more than a little uncomfortable. Vivie motioned for you to follow, staying silent for now. Once you were outside of the busy bridge of the ship she began talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a scientist, hmm? I doubt you'll be able to assist me in much beyond hauling goods.\" She eyed you up and down, smiling broadly. \"Good thing you've got other... assets I might have use of.\" It amazed you that a beaver woman as well-endowed as her saw anything attractive in you. Compared to her everything about you had to be downright puny. Or were all the beaver men also pint-sized? The two of you approached a double door and for once it didn't automatically slide open. Only when Vivie placed her hand on a pad did they soundlessly slide into the walls. This was without a doubt her laboratory. Complex chemical setups and half-built alien tech were littered on a dozen tables lining the room. The middle was left completely clean and looked a little different from the normal tiling on the floor. No doubt some alien contraption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First we're going to do some in-depth examining on the effects of the serum. Stand there please.\" The beaver woman absent-mindedly pointed at the large central pad. With a touch of hesitation you stepped onto the smooth surface. The floor below you hummed softly as Vivie turned around, holding a glass tablet. You could see streams of data rush past, but the alien language made it impossible to understand. Graphs and images shot by lightning fast, but Vivie seemed to understand what she was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, no deviations or mutation markers. Physical capacity remains minimal, though unchanged. No internal or external side effects. Good news human, you're perfectly healthy. Maybe lay off the alcohol for a bit, but otherwise the serum seems to have worked flawlessly.\" You breathe a sigh of relief. Whatever alien medicine they gave you wasn't going to make you catch some strange affliction. Vivie wasn't quite done yet though. \"That's all good and stuff, but as a man of science you know that this sort of data needs to be verified by multiple sources. So let's see how well you're doing.\" You did not like where this was going. The beaver woman stepped confidently towards you and raised a foot. With some rough guidance you were forced to lie down on your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the smooth surface below. It was still humming away softly. Above your view was filled with the large looming butt of the beaver woman. She quickly got down, leaving almost no room between those round buttcheeks and your body. With a sigh of relief she finally sat down completely, squashing you into the floor. Vivie paid no attention to you, staring intently at her tablet. It showed a live feed of you under her as well as a host of information about your vitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heart rate and breathing elevated, possible side-effect of fear response. What's this, a buildup down below. My my, I think he likes it.\" There was no hiding your slowly growing erection from her scanning equipment. You blush a little, admitting that you think she's quite pretty. Now the beaver woman was blushing. \"Thank you Shane, but I won't be getting off of you any sooner.\" You snarkily respond. \"I've got a 'buildup' downstairs that says that isn't a problem.\" Vivie giggles a little before concluding her test. With a weary sigh she looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, two creatures of science like us... we should do some studying together. What academic field do you want to explore with me?\"</span></div></div>",

You started to voice your opinion, but the Beaver silenced you quickly by scooting back and planting her rump squarely on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wiggle, Vivie spoke again. \"What do you say Shane, you want to help me finally get my certificate?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour response came out just a muffled buzzing against her amazonian ass, but the doctor took your response as an agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic!

The beaver eyed your crotch hungrily and she dove onto your body, covering your face with her crotch and wrapping her breasts around your erection. On impact, your body shivered with pleasure and you moaned loudly. As the doctor felt your voice against her crotch, she clamped her thighs around your head and moaned in response. She continued to massage your cock with her soft breasts and enjoy the sensation of your throbbing penis while your face massaged her pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, that was nice Shane.

You were amazed at how she carried herself with such grace even at her incredible stature and with her obvious strength. You marveled at the hard red shell on her back that came to a curved end just above her waist - how it looked almost like removable armor - before giving way to her long, thick thighs covered with what looked like soft, smooth flesh. Her skin was a pale shade of red which gave way at times to a creamy white color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long brown hair that flowed wildly over her shell, her shoulders, and down onto her chest. Two long antennae sprouted from the midst of the forest of hair. Her chest matched her legs, full and soft but very large. They wobbled slightly as she walked off the ship. Her arms were also incredibly muscular and, as you noted earlier, ended with closed claws that revealed very human looking hands deep within them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face started to reveal a smile as she observed you making your way forward her. Once you were within arms length, you absent mindedly raised your palm as if you wanted to rub her firm, muscular stomach. Without warning, she gripped your wrist in a closed claw. Her grip was tight enough to secure you, but she was clearly holding back in an effort to avoid breaking your wrist or snapping off your hand. You were thankful for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello human, what is your name?\" she asked in a stoic tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh....Shane,\" you respond. \"I....I'm a scientist. Can....can you let go of my wrist?\" you plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lobster ignores your request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A scientist? How interesting,\" She moves her other hand, the one holding the odd device, into your field of vision. \"Are you familiar with these here on your planet?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile wincing in pain, you shake your head no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd, and yet you are a scientist. They are quite common on our planet.\" She moves the device out of your eyesight and reaches her long arm around to the back of your neck, where she places it gently against the top of your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will make your journey with us much more...feasible,\" she said with a smile before locking the device in place. You felt a sharp but small pain as the device gripped your neck and several small needles pressed into your spinal column. You immediately felt a tingling sensation running up and down your spine, but it quickly subsided. You breathed a deep sigh of relief as you feel the alien has also released her grip on your wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shoot open in shock as you look to your hand and see the lobster's claw clamped on as securely as ever. But the pain is nearly non existent. How...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to feel dizzy.

Wait, furred? They were wearing spacesuits when you met them. You try to look around and see that she had changed into a more casual outfit. A small shirt that showed off her impressive rack and a pair of ragged shorts struggling to hold on to her ass. She felt you wiggle and looked down at you. Her strong arms shifted around your body, cradling you like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back. Shane, was it? My name is Melinda. You've probably already guessed that me and my friends aren't from earth. In time I'm sure we'll tell you a little more. For now it's important we make sure you get used to life on our spaceship. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clutch your aching head. \"Like you've stepped on my head.\" Melinda raises an eyebrow and responds. \"That's a little uncommon. It can happen as a side effect of the acclimatizing agent I gave you.\" You only caught some of those words. \"The what... you mean that shit you injected me with? What was in that stuff anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink stopped walking, making you gulp for a moment. Did you just say something wrong? She thinks for a moment before speaking. \"It helps you with living on this ship. Aside from making you much less susceptible to atmospheric changes and a host of poisons it does this.\" The mink flipped you around in her arms, pressing your head into her rack and wrapping her arms around your waist. She hugged you tightly. You weren't sure what she was trying to demonstrate yet. So far all you got was a nice hug. You resist the urge to motorboat those glorious furred mounds, but only just. The mink grunts and suddenly you feel her hug intensify a thousandfold. An amazon like her with arms that powerful would easily snap you in half, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mink relented and explained. \"You're now able to resist much more pressure too. Probably a good thing around us.\" You asked her why but she seemed to conveniently miss the question. Instead she put a hand behind your head and held you face to face with her. \"One last thing; do try to enjoy the ride.\" Again you were left confused when the mink suddenly planted a big kiss right on your face. Any thoughts about how utterly weird this was were shattered as you were caught up in the most pleasurable kiss you'd ever received. You didn't know if it was the injection, her natural talent or the fact that you hadn't been kissed in years. It was a slice of heaven, making you feel almost sad when it had to end. Melinda went back to cradling you and walked to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are James, but most people refer to you as Jimmy. You dropped out of college following our first semester due to lack of funds and have been finding ways to make ends meet since. You were always the type to float below the radar of people and the system, slightly below average at just about anything. Your sub-par height seemed to fall right in line with that, as you stood at just 5'4. As frustrating as it was at times, it did come in handy when you were faced with desperate times. It was easy to avoid your land lord at rent time or even avoid paying bills at restaurants and slipping past security at the local store for necessities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, you found yourself having trouble sleeping and decided to go out for a walk. You lived alone, so you weren't worried about disturbing anyone. You thought over how you arrived at this point in your dull, boring existence and lost track of time as you walked. You must have been out mindlessly wandering the town for at least an hour! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a bright light flashed over your head, snapping you to awareness. You followed the movement of the light to a local park and couldn't believe your eyes! There, just 50 feet away, was an alien ship in the middle of the empty park in your small town! Were you still dreaming? You pinched yourself and the pain reassures you that you are very much awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet are frozen in place as a door and ramp form on the side of the ship. You weren't sure what you expected, but the sight of the beings exiting the ship certainly was not it! A group of 5...beings exited the ship. There was an air of familiarity about them, but you couldn't place it at first. They were certainly female and had a level of humanoid features about them - the way they walked, the curves in their womanly bodies, and even their facial features. But they were definitely not human. Then it hit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese creatures bore an insane resemblance to creatures from video games you played and anime cartoons you watched as a kid. They were....pokemon?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the creatures, regardless of the species they resembled, were massive. Both in height and build. They were all at least 12 feet tall and extremely curvaceous. As you looked them up and down in awe, you realized that none of them were wearing space suits, revealing their incredible chests along with their full round asses and their thick thighs. Even if they weren't powerful pokemon, they would be incredibly intimidating creatures. They all walked upright, even if their species in the games did not. You shuddered as stood in shock at each one. And these were just the first few off the ship. With a ship of that size, who knew how many other types of pokemon would be on board. Maybe even a \"legendary\" or two...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to place the names of each creature as they strode confidently off the ship. It had been a while, but you had a nephew who played the newer games so you were exposed to even recent generations. The kid would go on and on about the latest pokemon he caught or tried to catch, and no matter how hard you tried to tune him out, a lot of that information sunk in and stuck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first, and largest of the group, was a Snorlax. This was different from the images you were used to seeing on the screen, as her bright brown eyes were wide open. Still, she had a familiar thickness to her curves that was reminiscent to the creature in the games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was similarly curvacious. She resembled a female sumo wrestler, with a stern look on her face. She had sizable breasts, but the majority of her weight was in her thick thighs, ass, and her pudgy belly. This was Hariyama. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third was incredibly tall, bigger than even Snorlax. She resembled a blue brontosaurus, but if a brontosaurus were made of sparkling crystal and walked on just two legs. Her long tail swished behind her regally and she had a multicolored fin that ran down her neck and back. You recognized her as an Aurorus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth was tougher to identify. She had long white and gray fur, or hair, you didn't know what to call it, all over her body. She looked similar to an Absol, but her look was slightly off. She had what looked like wings on her back and the long hair flowing off her hair covered half of her face. Suddenly you realized that this Absol was likely in what was known as her Mega form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fifth and final member of the crew who exited the ship was stunning. She had the look of a professional dancer, but with incredibly thick hips and long, flowing green hair. It took you the longest to identify her, but you remembered a pokemon your nephew had gone on and one about. This was her! Her name was Tsareena. In person, at her incredible height, she was truly a sight to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, one of the alien creatures spotted you. You hadn't exactly done a great job of hiding. Your feet were still frozen in place, but the woman approached you with a smile. You couldn't exactly identify her intention as she confidently strode toward you. Which anthro pokemon is first to catch you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now that you and the Snorlax were essentially face to face, you barely registered the immense size difference between the two of you. Just to look eye to eye, the Snorlax had to bend over while also at the same time giving you a very personal view of her cleavage, which just so happened to be the only part her uniform failed to conceal. You see a very small zipper in between the cavern of her bust, desperately trying it's best to contain the Snorlax's breasts: a task which seemed it was miserably failing at. You wonder for a second if the Snorlax purposefully bent over to give you that view or not. It was at this point that you also remembered that she was talking to you, and probably wanted a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There were so many questions in your head, who was she, why was she here, why does her and the rest of her crew look like Pokemon? Despite all this, the only thing you managed to utter was, \"uh...H-Hi?\" You also managed to wave your arm about, as to accentuate your greeting. The Snorlax let out a giggle, which if you were honest with yourself, was pretty cute It also caused her...well everything to jiggle as well, there was no denying it, this woman was <i>huge</i> both in height and weight. You thank your lucky stars that she appeared to be friendly, her hips alone were so wide that if she were to sit on you, no one would even see you. You shudder thinking about what else this behemoth of a woman could do to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she were sensing your thoughts, The Pokemon tried to soothe your mind. \"Don't worry hun, I wouldn't hurt a cutie like you.\" The Snorlax cooed,  \"say, what's your name sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeet still frozen in place, you try your best to respond to the alien, \"James, my name's James.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James hmm? I like that name, perfect for a lovely man like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but blush at her complement, so far things were going great between the two of you...maybe too great. It made you wonder if she was really being honest with you, for all the smiling and giggling, she could be hiding an ulterior motive. But she wouldn't do that! She's too nice for that, or so you hoped. \"Say James,\" The Snorlax called out to you, breaking you out of your train of thought. \"It's awfully cold out here tonight, don't you think?\" She had a point, It was the middle of the night, and like the idiot you were, you forgot to bring a jacket. Next thing you knew you found yourself shivering. \"You poor thing, you must be freezing.\" the Snorlax cried out, her sympathy appearing to be genuine, though that didn't last long as she perked up a moment after getting on her knees so that she wouldn't have to bend over to see you, which even then she was still taller than you. \"I have an idea! I'm pretty warm myself, so I'm sure of you give little old me a hug, you'll be warmed right up!\"  Her arms then stretched out, inviting you to her embrace. \"Come on sweetie! Give me a big hug!\" As tempting as her offer was, this was still a small voice in your head telling you not to trust her, even though she's given you every reason to trust her. Even now her smile didn't seem to show any sign of trickery. She was right about one thing though, it was freezing, you had to make up your mind, fast. In the end, you decide to <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Was the Snorlax women lying, or was she being genuine? She sounded genuine, but that could just mean she's good at lying. You looked up at the massive Snorlax, seeing what it wanted and were greeted with soft, caring, brown eyes. You thought them almost beautiful for a split second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at Snorlax women and with a nod a smile, signaled the go ahead. It giggled with delight and hugged you, lovingly and tightly but at the same time gently as to not hurt you. You laughed and hugged her back, your body becoming covered in the Snorlax's spandex covered breasts. They were soft and warm, and contorted over your body in a calming embrace. You sighed a bit, nuzzling into the massive boobs. The Snorlax purred at this, nuzzling you in return for your kindness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can come up with a response for what was happening, the Snorlax turns around and starts to walk toward the spaceship with you in her arms, the others following suit. Her fat arms coil around you  - around your feet, your calves, your thighs, and your waist - keeping you in place against her as she rests your head in her cleavage, giggling softly and poking at her furry breasts with a finger. Blushing heavily as the Snorlax\u2019s arms surround you in a hug, you can\u2019t do much more other than stare at her tits as you try to comprehend just what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, your vision was overtaken by a sudden influx of florescent light as she the Snorlax entered the ship. You realized that despite the Snorlax's obviously loving and caring nature, she panned on abducting you. You insatiably wanted to protest, but you found all of you energy being sapped away as the hug continued, the warm flesh of the snorlax lolling you to sleep. Soon enough, your form went limp and your head rested gently on the Snorlax's breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you passed out, you heard the Snorlax's voice one last time. \"My name is Rose by the way.\" She whispered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you found yourself...</span></div></div>",

You were awake, but your eyes refused to open, the comfiness of your surroundings too good to pull away from. You don't know what you did to your mattress, but right now it easily beat any higher end beds. Your whole body was surrounded in plush warmth, soft enough that your body just sank into the mattress, with the slightest hint of firmness to keep you on top. And then there were the pillows, best pillows you've ever had! You usually slept on just one pillow, but for some reason you had two tonight. You try to recollect when you managed to grab another pillow, but the soothing softness of your situation made you swiftly forget. Your pillows were just as warm as the mattress, and cradled your head perfectly to ensure maximum comfiness. Damn your bed was amazing right now, you couldn't help but get yourself deeper. You wrap your arms around as much of the mattress as possible, hugging yourself deeper while nuzzling your head deeper into the canyon between the two pillows. You let out a sigh of pleasure:this was the life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom below you you heard your bed giggle in response to your movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second...beds don't giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes bolt open to see another pair of brown eyes looking right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sleepyhead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to make a break for it, but the Snorlax seemed to anticipate your movements, as her arms quickly wrapped around you, pinning you to her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on James, everything's okay, Do you remember me? My name's Rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to struggle, but her softness added with the warmth of her voice sapped any notion of resistance. She seemed nice enough, for some reason you knew she wouldn't hurt you. Soon enough, the memories of your first encounter started replaying in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I remember now, sorry about that Rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose simply chuckled, waving off your apology, \"No reason to be sorry sweetie, you just woke up. Speaking of which, you slept longer than I did! And people say Snorlaxes are heavy sleepers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, guess I did fall asleep...Hey, where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose simply used her arm to guide my head toward a window, we were in space!!! Well duh, she came from a UFO, that was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My group is in charge of finding and preserving different kinds of flora all across the universe, though I have to say, Earth's flowers are my favorite. They also have cute boys too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at her kind words, deciding to return them in kind. \"W-Well you're cute too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! And they're gentlemen too! It's not <i>exactly</i> in our mission statement, but from time to time we pick up some cuties along the way to keep us company for a bit. Say the word and I'll bring you right back home...unless you want to stay with me of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she says this, Rose lowers the arm wrapped around you until it's on your rear. She then presses you down, making you give her belly a little hump. So she did feel you down there, it wasn't your fault! Any guy who was wrapped in tits bigger than their own head would do the same thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to change the subject, you mention something she talked about. \"You said something about others on the ship, don't you think I should meet them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose's demeanor quickly changed, her usual calm soothing self became nervous, it was obvious there was something she wasn't telling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I would hold off on that for a bit longer, mostly because...\"</span></div></div>",

Is a whole spaceship full of anthro Pokemon girls that all were pining after you? You felt a little overwhelmed by all the want that was placed on you, not used to being the center of attention. You decided that your best course of action was to comfort the closest of them to you right now, the cute Snorlax that gave you your most comfortable sleep in recent memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose, I know we don\u2019t have all the time in the world, but we still have right now.\u201d You smiled, returning the embrace Rose offered you in earnest, her ample bosom slightly engulfing your face. \u201cI know we\u2019ve just met, but I really want to get to know you. I think you\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve ever met who ever made me feel...special. All my life I lived just underneath the scope of focus, and then you walk in and...it's like I've just been sleepwalking through life until last night.\" The big Snorlax blinked her soft eyes at you before smiling possible the warmest and genuine smiles you've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she had been planning to do this since last night, or maybe she was overwhelmed by emotions, but she suddenly slid you past the valley of her bosom to bring you to her face...for a kiss! It was so sudden, the cute Snorlax had planted her lips on yours and slowly slipped her tongue into your mouth. After a few moments, you let yourself relax and returned the act of affection, feelings stirring inside you as well. Your member, against your will, managed to get some rise as she gently invaded your maw, but aside from a tiny gasp, she didn't mind. In fact, it was like she was almost flattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a full minute of this, Rose finally relinquished her hold on your mouth, returning her tongue back in between her lips and leaving a little drool trail in between your two faces. Giggling, she licked up the last remaining threads of saliva while you were red in the face. Did that...really just happen? You certainly felt like it could have happened, but maybe you were still on earth, dreaming about someone who actually thought you were worth the time of day, worth a kiss on the lips. You pinched yourself, then again even harder, and then you realized that you were definitely wide awake. You had gotten kissed by an anthro Snorlax from space...and it was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" You trailed off, trying to find your train of thought amidst a sea of euphoria. \"Wh-what do you wanna do first, Rose?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had begrudgingly made up your mind, this was too good to be true, there was no way all the Snorlax wanted was a hug, there <i>had</i> to be an ulterior motive, and you weren't going to stick around to find out what it was. As you made up your mind, you focus your attention to the Snorlax, her arms still wide open, expecting you to join her, not knowing you already made your decision. Although she did seem to sense your hesitation, \"C'mon sweetie, I promise I don't bite!\" She joked, soon after laughing at her own words. Looking into her eyes, you almost lost all the willpower to refuse her, absentmindedly taking a step forward, though soon enough, your senses come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as you might, all you could say to the Snorlax was, \"I-I'm sorry.\" Immediately afterward turning around to run as far away as possible from her. Even though you couldn't see her you could tell that this was not the reaction she was expecting. \"Sweetie, wait!\" She cried out in surprise, she was probably going to try and grab you, something you could not let happen. Sure enough, you felt her hand touch yours, but only for the briefest of moments. In that moment though, you swore that her hand was the softest thing you ever touched, softer than any pillow or mattress; it made you wonder if the rest of her was that soft, though you quickly dismiss the thought, instead focusing on escaping the same Snorlax you were fantasizing about. You had the element of surprise on her hand, you started running while she was on her knees, so you had some time to cover some ground before she could start giving chase to you, but soon enough you hear loud \"THOOM\"s behind you. Shit, she's not giving up easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, please!\"  the Snorlax called to you. It was gut-wrenching to hear her say your name like that, though you quickly remind yourself that if she caught you, she could wrench your guts, you run faster, but is it enough?</span></div></div>",

Your eyes grow wide as the Hariyama strides toward you with a confident and intimidating look on her beautiful face. You notice that outside of her massive chest, there is very little jiggle in her flesh as she walks. That meant her enormous body was...all muscle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you, and what are you doing here?\" the massive pokemon asks, towering over your much smaller body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm nobody,\" you answer honestly. \"My name is James, and I was...I was just out for a walk when I saw your ship,\" you finish with a fearful, stammering voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" the Hariyama responds, looking you up and down in near silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence and the stare of the Hariyama is too much for you to bear.

Why not stay, enjoy your time with...all of us?\" she asks, with her smile growing broader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I do mean <i>all</i> of us,\" she adds, turning and caressing her incredibly large, round ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, your mind urges you to get away, but another sensation is urging you to stay. The sight of Hariyama's thick backside, just above eye level, excites you. You know she would be more than you could handle, but the temptation is almost too great.

The hallways were made of a sparkly platinum, the floor covered in a jet-black carpeting.

Don't look so nervous, you won't feel a thing.\" Her reassurances did little to ease your concerns. She'd already openly admitted she was going to abduct you and wipe your memory. For all you know the huge pokemon was going to probe you. You weren't a fan of butt stuff at the best of times, this was just insane. You began to wiggle a little in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there little man, I don't want to hurt you.\" You pay her warnings no mind. She lifts you up and angrily glares at you. \"Now you listen up you little pest! Either you stop fussing right away or you can spend the rest of this little trip in my mouth whilst I suckle on you like a lollipop!\" The prospect of being assaulted by her large slobbery tongue was enough to scare you into obedience. \"That's what I thought.\" the pokemon huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amount of corridors the two of you traverse is strangely large. The ship didn't look that big on the outside, but the vast maze of hallways and rooms is impressive. Along the way you see all manner of pokemon working idly in their chambers. You recognize plenty of them, though they all share the same amazonian size of your captor. Even some of the pokemon you know to be little and cute would tower over you. Finally Sophie reaches the research station. It was completely empty and cleaned up to an almost obsessive degree. Not a speck of dust in sight and everything sorted and stacked to the millimeter. The Aurorus could tell you were impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, isn't it? Everything in perfect order. Everyone aboard this ship knows well to stay the hell out of my research room. If I find so much as a tissue out of place there will be hell to pay.\" She grumbled to herself a little, seemingly recalling past experiences with the other pokemon aboard the ship. Quickly her frown melted and her attention focused back on you. \"But that's not something for you to worry about. All you have to do is lay here.\" The large pokemon lays you down on a padded table much taller than you. Obviously it was meant for amazonian ladies like her. Sophie snaps on the bright overhead light and inspects you closely. You do your best to lie still as she pokes you in your belly and tries to assess your health. Only when she hooks a finger into your pants for a quick inspection do you protest. She laughs it off and concludes her examination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in good health, but in the interest of safety you are getting a resistance booster.\" She produced a fairly large pill for your size. \"Just swallow this and you'll be good to spend the remainder of today getting to know me better.\" Wait, was she flirting with you? You immediately lost your trust in her 'medicine'. You had no interest in being roofie'd by a pokemon today. Her calming smile quickly turned sour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, if you're not going to co-operate, I'll have to use force.\" She pins you on the table and crams the pill down your throat. In spite of your fierce struggles you are forced to swallow, coughing loudly. You feel strange, your whole body itching from the pokemon medicine. Sophie quickly demonstrates the effects by grabbing your arm and twisting it hard. But no bone snapped and you didn't even feel pain. No matter how much she twisted and pulled, you were completely fine. When she let go your arm sprung back into its regular position like it was made of rubber. \"Good, that will keep you from being accidentally stomped, sat on or otherwise killed beneath us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mischievous smirk she continued. \"Because you were such a jackass earlier I think some punishment is in order. So you're going to help me with some of my human research. I'm looking to find out more about how quickly a human faints in certain situations.\" You didn't like where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat situations did Sophie have in mind?</span></div></div>",

It felt no worse than accidentally slamming your leg into a salon table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the foot was lifted again, letting your body knit itself back together. \"Ow, that hurt! What was that for?\" Sophie looked down at you and scoffed. \"Quit bellyaching and don't move. You're getting another stomp for each centimeter you try to escape.\" She walked over to one of the desks and jotted down some observations on your behaviour. Her resistance booster worked well. The Aurorus glanced at you a few times while writing down her findings. Finally she opened a new document and read it closely. It was her next human experiment. From your position you were too far away to make out any of the text. But the simple diagram showed a large Pokemon sitting down on a small human. To hell with that, you're not going to let her sit on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reading the instructions for this experiment the Aurorus began to walk towards you again. You had to find a way out of this. You did not want to have her squash you under her butt. But if you take even a step she'll trample you flat for escaping. And seeing her disdain for you, she'll probably then just sit on you all the same. Her front leg is almost upon you and lifts over you ominously. Only at the last moment does Sophie sidestep you, grinning a little. Now you were underneath her swaying body. She couldn't see you here. This was your only shot at escape. Above you the pokemon was barking orders. \"Just lie down and let it happen. If you want to, you can wiggle. It'll help me determine when you pass out.\" You play coy, pretending not to know what's about to happen. \"Are you going to probe me?\" The Aurorus stopped for a moment. \"Not yet...\" she spoke absent-mindedly. You fear you may just have given her ideas. Another reason not to linger around this monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hefty butt sways into view as Sophie prepares to bury you under it.</span></div></div>",

She was going to squash him flat to really put her resistance booster to the test. She was confident in her science and almost certain the human would survive. What she hadn't noticed was that she spent so much time gloating it had given her victim time to crawl out from under her and run for it. Only when she sat down did she notice the distinct absence of a wiggling human beneath her massive rear. She glared angrily around the room. If that little pipsqueak was still here she was going to make him regret disobeying her for the rest of his days. She got up, thundering around the room with heavy steps, looking under the tables and behind the cupboards. Finally her temper failed her completely and she roared out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I find you again, human, I will stomp you so flat you'll forget what it's like to be three-dimensional!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear some of her angry yelling, muffled by the winding corridors. You had a small headstart, but the large Aurorus would be able to gain on you quickly. If she found you, there would be no mercy from her. She'd probably spend the rest of your time here testing how well you handle being stomped, probed or worse. The large maze of winding corridors was both a blessing and a curse. It would be hard for Sophie to give chase or even run in the right direction. But you were facing a serious challenge just getting off the ship. Even with your wits about you the large network of corridors would be difficult to navigate. Paired with the constant dread of turning a corner and facing the enraged Aurorus you weren't sure how to proceed. You couldn't linger too long, that was certain. This was a spaceship and the Pokemon on board were very clear about this just being a visit. If they take off with you still on board there'd be no escape from Sophie's wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour strategizing is interrupted when you hear a distant rumble. It sounded like a large Pokemon in a big hurry. Fearing it might be Sophie coming for you you look around for an escape. You try your luck with one of the large doors. There was a panel next to it which presumably opened the door. It took some skill to shimmy up the wall and smack the panel before falling down again. The immense door hissed and slid open. You reckon it was at least thirty feet tall, but your awe would have to wait. You enter the room to find a small living quarters. The oversized furniture makes you feel that bit extra puny. Thankfully it also provided many potential hiding places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut are you alone in this room?</span></div></div>",

The door behind you slides shut, leaving you to stare in awe at the large Pokemon. An eerie silence hangs in the air as the two of you try to scope out eachother's intentions. The towering creature probably stands as tall as the door, her vast body a vibrant shade of purple and dripping with a thick slime. You couldn't tell where the slime started and her body stopped. Was she composed entirely of the stuff or was this simple some trick of the eye. She leaned down a little and spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H... Hi there.\" You stammer out fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you lost?\" Her voice has a deeply concerned tone to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little... I just came across this ship and a Pokemon abducted me!\" You weren't sure if it was smart to tell her all this, but her worried expression made it hard to lie to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you poor thing. It must all be going so fast for you. I bet whoever took you in must be really worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing she's worried about is how flat she's gonna squash me when she finds me.\" You say, a little irritated at the thought of this giant potentially turning you over to Sophie. The Goodra's response is to giggle a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no way to treat visitors. I'll keep you hidden for now. Will you let me have a closer look?\" She reaches out her hand, beckoning you to step forward so she can pick you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're hesitant at first, but her gentle smile wins you over. You let yourself be surrounded by the thick digits as she carefully wraps them around you and lifts you off the floor. Her hand is big enough to cover most of your torso. The soft skin feels mushy and a little damp to the touch, somewhere inbetween slime and smooth skin. She raises you up to her face where her large eyes inspect you closely. She seems amused by your diminutive form, petting you with her other hand. She brings you close to her big round muzzle, smelling gently to take in your scent. She didn't really tell you why, but she praised your delightful smell. She softly bumps you against her round noggin before lowering you to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I try a kiss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoah, that took a sudden jump forward. You mind reeled with questions, not the least of which being whether it is appropriate to be kissing people you only just met. Maybe Pokemon had different boundaries to such things, but she was going much too fast for you. She did however ask for your permission. It presented you with a predicament. Either you could refuse, but being at her mercy may make things quite dangerous for you. But if you let her have her way, she might see that as a green light for far more intimate interaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what the hell, one little kiss won't matter that much...\" Your pondering took too long and now the pursed lips were incoming. They smacked against you and moulded themselves to your body. Your entire head was pressed between them as you took note of how amazingly comfortable and yielding they were. The only downside was the slimy drool being smeared into your hair. But if it meant being kept away from the Aurorus you'd take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, little guy. That was nice. Do you want to play any more nice games with me?\" You look at her wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a toy just to play with... and I would like to find my way off this ship before it takes off to space.\" The Goodra looked sad but understanding. Suddenly an idea sprung to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I made you a deal. I happen to know this ship will leave in two days. I can get you outside without anyone noticing. But, I want something in exchange for your escape. I want to play with you until then, any game I can think of with no backtalk from you. And I do mean \u00e1ny game...\" She blows you a kiss, making you feel increasingly uncomfortable. As you think on her offer she keeps whispering in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think of all the fun we could have together. As you've already experienced not all Pokemon are as friendly as I am. Do you really want to go back to wandering the halls hoping you'll find an exit and not some meanie that'll squash you?\" She had considerable difficulty keeping a straight face on her last sentence. It came as no surprise to you that her 'games' would probably include a fair bit of smothering or squashing. But you only had to hold fast for two days in the hands of what seemed to be a very gentle Goodra. Most other creatures aboard this strange vessel probably wouldn't extend the same courtesy. If it meant not being abducted along with all these giants you would gladly take the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, if you can get me off this ship before it departs then I am yours to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you couldn't resist my offer... and me...\" She giggles loudly. Was this her idea of getting into a relationship with you? No time for questions as her pursed lips approach again and smooch you. Just as the Goodra wants to start playing the door slides open. It's Sophie! With fury in her eyes the Aurorus stares at you. The towering slimy Pokemon notices your fear and cups you close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't have him, he's mine now! He promised me I could play with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Sophie react to this situation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I suppose I still owe you one.\" It's quickly dawning on you that these two giants have some history together. It's probably just about the only reason Sophie didn't immediately explode in anger at being denied her little victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe furious Pokemon was still seething. That obnoxious little human had eluded her and found the only force on this ship capable of stopping her. She would have her revenge for this. On top of all the payback this human already deserved. A vile snicker escaped her at the thought of torturing you with her enormous body. She turned around and prepared to stomp off. Sophie's spite knew no limits and though she might not be able to get you, she knew Grace well. The Goodra might not be looking to hurt you, but she knew just how to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll love him Grace. He told me he loves to play, especially when the playing gets rough.\" The slimy grip around your torso tightened a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The Goodra looked at you with great interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, he told me all about it when we were playing around in the lab. The rougher the better, he's not into it unless he's begging for mercy.\" Again the hand holding you tightened its crushing grasp on you. You protest loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no I'm not. I never said anything like that. And we didn't play, you just threatened and squashed me before I escaped.\" Grace wasn't having any of it. Either she didn't believe you or she liked the prospect of playing rough too much. Your words meant nothing as she held you up to eye level. Sophie added one last detail before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I gave him the resistance booster already, so there's absolutely no risk of breaking him. He can handle anything you throw at him. Squash him, eat him, absorb him into that big body of yours, he'll be fine. It'll still hurt, and that's the way he likes it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that piece of advice the Goodra clamped her hand down hard, unleashing her full titanic strength. Pain surged through you and you let out an uncomfortable grunt. She released her grasp and squeezed again, treating you like a human squeaky toy. Her smile had never been bigger and with Sophie out of the picture you were now the focus of her attention. Curious at the potency of the resistance booster the Goodra reached in and grabbed your legs with her free hand. Without mercy she pulled, stretching them out and giggling at your contorted face. It stung all the way down to your toes and with a comical thwap they sprung back into their default position after she released them. She snorts with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great, why didn't you tell me sooner you liked to play rough? No matter, the deal still stands. But oh boy can we play so many more games now. How about we get started right away. Let's see how much fun a big girl like me can squeeze out of you.\" Her gleeful giddiness was terrifying to you. A few honeyed words from Sophie had turned your rescuer into your worst nightmare. You had no chance to speak out against her, if only because her squeezing grip left no room for air in your lungs. You doubt Grace would listen to you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith barely contained enthusiasm the large Goodra throws you down onto the ground. Making you beg for mercy is her new goal. How does she start?</span></div></div>",

I'll show you just how much I can make you hurt!\" The excited Goodra lifted her foot over you and giggled ominously. It didn't take a psychic to see where she was going with this and you desperate roll onto your feet before she brings it down on you. In the back of your head you knew it to be a futile effort, but something compelled you to try anyway. You had just about scrambled on all fours when the soft surface of her sole touched your back. The expectation of a heavy bonebreaking stomp stayed out. Instead Grace very carefully lowered her foot down. Your efforts to stay on all fours were pushed down without any sign of struggle, the unyielding surface forcing you flat on your belly. Weight began to pile on as the foot connected to the ground and the Goodra began to lean on it proper. The sole engulfed you, cutting you off from the outside. You could hear the Pokemon gleefully mumble to herself, but no a word could make it through the thick mass of her foot. Your body felt weird under the extreme pressure, but one thing wasn't dimmed in the slightest. Pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream out in agony as you feel your innards rearrange themselves to accommodate the overwhelming weight. Your tormentor seems disappointed and the soft surface above you begins to move. The monstrous mass rolls you along, mangling your limbs as she grinds her foot back and forth. Finally she reaches her goal and your head pops out from under her sole. Again she leans down to produce a loud shriek from you, this time much more satisfied with the results. The searing pain alleviates only when she lifts her foot high. Your broken body folds itself back into its original shape quickly, barely any pain lingering from the savage torment you'd endured. Only when you're back in one piece does she bring her foot down hard. A devastating stomp flattens you out like a piece of gum and the worst was yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel good under there, now let's have you squirm in there...\" What the hell did she mean with that? She quickly made her intention clear with another stomp. But the harsh, crushing surface was gooey and malleable. You felt it surround you and pull you in. You were inside her slimy foot as she stomped it down much like before. Much of the weight that flattened you before was still present, but your every scream now provided her with a strange pleasure as it tickled the slime around you. Seconds ticked on and you began to panic. Surely you needed oxygen still. The slimy prison was skin-tight, leaving you nothing to breathe. As seconds turned to minutes it became clear to you the resistance booster had eliminated your need for air too. Fear of suffocation subsided, but the Goodra was still dancing around with you absorbed into her foot. Each step sent another wave of pain through your body, your muffled screams vibrating your gooey prison in the most pleasant ways for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally done tormenting you underfoot she raised your prison and let you push your way out of the sticky slime. \"Come on, don't you want to leave my foot? I can leave you in there if you love it so much.\" You hurriedly struggle your way out and coated in a wad of slime you fall down, hitting the hard floor with a wet splat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more for the road.\" Grace giggled as she stomped down, the sole once again rigid and unyielding. When the light in her room shone on you again you could no longer see any feet waiting to flatten you. Instead a large hand came down, grabbing you in a crushing vice-grip. You are brought up to the Goodra's malicious smirk and with a broken voice you plead her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... no more... I'll do anything... just stop crushing...\" Your sentence was cut off with a powerful squeeze, forcing the air out of your lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear you like it too.\" She giggled. \"Now what shall we do next?\"</span></div></div>",

All you could offer were pleading eyes as the towering Goodra pondered her options for her tiny toy. She looked at you suspiciously, then looked down behind her. A broad smile formed and as you connected the dots in your head your eyes widened with fear. Grace saw the terror in your expression and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, little man, that's a great idea. My butt would love to get intimate with you. And with your puny size, there's enough room for all of you downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't waste another word and held you down in front of the immense cheeks. A small fart burst out from between them. It smelled weirdly synthetic, like burnt rubber. The penetrating stench stung your nose, but the Goodra didn't lower you there to smell her rear. She wanted to get physical and with distressing speed she rams you between the jiggling cheeks. The powerful grip of her hand dissipated, but she'd wedged you deep enough for her heavy buttocks to take over. They clenched together with monstrous force, flattening you a little between them. Your body proved surprisingly resilient, just the way she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace had no end of fun with you stuffed between her buttcheeks. She enjoyed your pathetic squirming and frequently clenched her cheeks together to make sure you didn't get to move too much. After every crushing squeeze she listened for muffled screams as she gave you the mercy of air, only to crush it right back out of you with another murderous clench. Soon she thought of other ways to make your stay in there miserable. She began to sit down on her bed, sending waves of terrible pressure your way. Farts became more frequent and your tiny coughs filled her with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she took hold of her own rear, a large buttock in each hand. She pushed them together, delivering more smothering force than you'd ever experienced up to this point. Worse yet, she began to move each cheek up and down, grinding you between their shifting surfaces. The pain was intense as your body began to lose it's shape, flattening between the vast buttcheeks. Finally, when you could barely be called three-dimensional anymore, the torment stopped. Things returned to normal, about as normal as your position could be. Overhead you head the Goodra speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, little guy. For the next little game you're going to climb in even deeper. If I don't feel your hand somewhere on my asshole in one minute, I will take you out and sit on you until you beg me to put you back in. Or maybe I'll chew you like a piece of gum, I'll think of something. Point being, if you don't get crawling right now you're in for even more torment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you succeed in winning her little game? Or do you fail to please her? Will you even play along with the sadistic Goodra?</span></div></div>",

You grit your teeth and begin crawling in what feels like an ocean of rubber. The smooth walls offer little help as you try to find your destination. You weren't wholly certain if you were approaching her asshole, but by the sounds of her increasingly louder moans, you were headed for something nice. Unabated you kept going, trying not to think about what other place you could be moving towards. At times your progress is painfully halted when Grace feels like squeezing her cheeks together. You can only groan in suppressed distress as she torments you with her rear. The stench of her strangely synthetic farts gets ever more potent in the sweltering prison deep between her buttcheeks. Finally it reaches a peak as you find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goodra's pucker, a foul smelling pit of despair that made disgusting squelching noises with its every movement. Trapped within the darkness of her butt you had no clue what it looked like or just how big it was. All you knew is that you wanted to be away from it more than anything else. You reach out and lay a hand on the twitching muscle and Grace shuddered with pleasure in response. Now for the big question. Did you reach her pucker in time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're good, human. I gotta admit, I wasn't really looking at the clock when I said you had a minute, but this is fast enough to spare you from being my seat. How're you holding out in there?\" Her voice was dripping with glee and malice, excited to have you in such a humiliating position and even more thrilled that you apparently liked it. You had to convince her otherwise or this was only going to get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely even finished your train of thought before two fat fingers plunged themselves in with you, pinching you around your waist. They pushed aside the big cheeks enough for a few rays of light to shine in and illuminate the horribleness that is her asshole. You wish it'd been kept in darkness as the monstrous pucker twitched with every move, clearly excited by your presence. It looked unnervingly... hungry for some reason. A chill ran down your spine as it squeezed out another tiny fart directly in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Grace do next?</span></div></div>",

The Goodra's pucker seemed almost possessed, gurgling and flexing more and more erratically as you were brought closer. You fear the worst as the towering Pokemon forces you to stare at the unholy chasm before you. Between flexes of the muscular ring you can see the dark depths behind it. They come ever closer as Goodra milks the moment for all its worth. Maybe the farts were making you delirious, but the longer you stared at her asshole, the more it seemed to hunger for you. The squelches and gurgles emanating from the slimy hole filling you with terror. Part of you begins to wonder if Grace even cares whether you like this. She was enjoying herself far too much doing this to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she has you close enough that the flexing ring brushes against your head. A powerful wave of pleasure shook her to the core. The foul pucker got even more excitable, opening and closing frantically, like a hungry maw chomping at the bit to devour you. With a lewd moan you were pushed headfirst into the greedy hole. Foul slime soaked your body in a brand new coat of her rotten stench as the muscular ring worked its hardest to pull you inside. Within the rectum was a remarkable amount of space, but almost no light. You felt the pinching grasp of her fingers fade, replaced by the crushing strength of her anus. It held onto you like its life depended on it, only relenting to pull you in deeper. With frightening efficiency it drew you completely into the bowels of the beast, sucking your body into its horrid embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were finally fully inside of Grace, you began to crawl around, exploring your situation. You couldn't see anything in the dark tunnel. It was too narrow for you to stand up, forcing you to crawl on all fours, desperate for any form of relief. Sadly the only relief found within your prison was that of the Goodra whenever a blast of foul gas blew past you. Glimpses of light teased you with an exit, but the strong ring that guarded the exit was unrelenting. Your attempts to pry it open only seemed to arouse the Goodra, who would push a fat finger inside to rub you against the slimy walls of her rectum. He large tongue was hanging out of her maw, slimy drool pooling on the floor of her chamber. Grace's new butt toy felt so amazing, she couldn't wait to play with it more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls around you began to close in. Soon even crawling on all fours was no longer possible, forcing you to go prone. From every angle the slimy surface began to constrict your movement. It took the mighty bowels mere seconds to completely restrain you, holding you with crushing force. Out of the darkness before you only a small, near-silent fart was heard. The stench that suddenly surrounded you was so horrifyingly noxious that you began to feel lightheaded almost immediately. Never in your life had you smelt something so foul. You begged for mercy, the slimy walls reacting with only more squeezing strength. A second fart sealed the deal, knocking you out within the Goodra's bowels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you wake up?</span></div></div>",

The front entrance? Being pushed into my slimy sex tunnel and used for my arousal?\" She held you close to her gooey pussy. It looked neat and organised, but dripping with slime. You couldn't tell how much of it was just natural Goodra slime and how much was her leaking with pent up lust. Her voice sure made it sound like the latter. If you weren't pinned tightly in her grip, you'd shudder at the thought of going anywhere near there. And she didn't want you just near it, she wanted to slide you inside. You had no idea what was going to lie behind those shimmering labia, but you knew that you'd do everything to make sure you never had to experience that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or the backdoor?\" She swung you around her wide hips and used her free hand to part her asscheeks a little, revealing a tightly clenched pucker. As you were brought closer it opened up, letting out a small fart and letting you peer into the dark abyss just behind it. The more you were held near it, the further it opened up, almost waiting to receive you. The stench was unbearable. Thankfully you were lifted away from the horrid smell and back to her face. Grace looked with glee and curiosity at the squirming little man in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... I can't tell which you found worse. Tell you what, I'll give you a few moments to decide as I lube you up.\" Lube? What was she talking about? You remained uncertain as her iron grip faded, her hand opening and letting you breathe normally for a moment. Her other hand meanwhile wandered to her belly, scraping some of the slime off it and bringing it to you. She kept watching you intently, making sure you wouldn't do something silly like jump off her hand. You gasp in terror as she presents the large wad of slime to you and scream when she brings her hands together, dunking you in the goop. She rubs her hands tightly, smearing the slippery substance all over your body. Some of it even slips into your mouth, surprising you with its sweet earthy taste. Grace cups her hands, letting you sit in a small puddle of her slime. She looks at you again, her eyes laser-focused on your every move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what will it be? Ass?\" You shake a little at the thought. \"Or pussy?\" You flinch at the word, giving her all the confirmation she needs. \"Hmmm... you make this hard, but I think the winner is the pussy! Good choice human. I can't wait to feel you inside me, squirming for my pleasure.\" Your objections are cut off by her hand once again grasping you tightly. With disorienting speed you are brought to your destination, getting a close view of the Goodra's snatch. Her hand opens and pressed you against the sensitive surface, taking care to rub your body against her squishy clit. Not even a finger of you is inside of her and she already moans like she's about to climax. She ups the pressure, squashing you against her most intimate parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! I hope you like... my body... because... it really... likes you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she parts her netherlips and your feet slide into the warm depths. Grace moves her hands away to look at her human toy, stuck up to his waist inside of her. His kicking legs were pure bliss for her and she could barely wait for the rest of him to join in. But there was fun to be had here. Seeing him slowly sink further into her snatch was hilarious to her. Even her pussy was stronger than this puny little man. Does she sit back and watch her body deal with this on its own or does she quickly push you inside so the real fun can begin?</span></div></div>",

And you were going to be the source of this pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you there wasn't any joy to be found. The only remote shred of solace you had is that Grace would probably not be able to kill you with this. The thought of your life ending by being sucked into a giant pokemon's pussy was too embarrassing. You hope that the resistance booster would protect you against whatever laid ahead. Despite best efforts not to give her too much pleasure, whenever the slimy tunnel pulls in another inch of your body you squirm instinctively. The warm slime engulfing your legs makes it hard to distinguish whether it was just her slimy body or if she was so aroused you were practically bathing in her sexual fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep squirming, human. This feels amazing. Feel free to scream and panic too. After all, you are getting eaten by my hungry pussy.\" She laughed loudly, her whole body shaking and her pussy clamping down to make sure you don't slip out. When it was back to business it began to pull you in faster. You try to get on Grace's good side by obeying her request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please! Not in there. Take me out, before you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though you spoke the magic password the slimy walls parted further than ever before and pulled the rest of you in completely before smothering you in their slickened embrace. The Goodra let out a deafening moan, feeling your whole body inside of her. Her breathing grew short and erratic, feeling her pleasure build up to boiling point. Inside you were exposed to powerful squeezing clenches and an eerie sense of movement inbetween. It felt like she was still trying to draw her human toy deeper into her pleasure tunnel. You could hear her speak to you, but her words were too muffled by her own body. It further served to reinforce the idea of you being pulled deeper into her huge form. It took you by complete surprise when the next squeeze forced your head past her pussylips and into the open. You had no idea you were this close to the entrance. It made you fear just how deep she could take you without you even noticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stop now, human. Bring me pleasure like no-one else on this ship can. Do this for me and I'll grant you a tiny break before we continue playing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA break! That might be the opportunity you needed to inform Grace of Sophie's deceptions. You could only pray she'd believe you, but it was a chance to tell her the truth. A chance to end this horrorshow. But in order to earn such a moment you'd have to please her first. The hungering vagina quickly drew you back in, submerging you into the Goodra's crotch once more. With no other way in sight to earn your freedom, you sigh reluctantly and begin wiggling as best you could. Whenever she squeezed you the walls had you pinned and motionless, but inbetween those powerful squashings you could bring her the release she was looking for. Muffled moans informed you that you were on the right track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you succeed in satisfying her urges? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Throughout it all you try not to think about the smell or the taste of your surroundings. It was gross beyond measure, but this could be the key to putting an end to this madness. With all the will you can manage you struggle and fight your surroundings. They fight back by frequently bearing down on you from all sides, the Goodra's warm slime squelching all around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace was on the very edge. She just needed one little push and she'd reach an orgasm she wouldn't soon forget. The little human she plunged into her pussy was providing pleasure in spades. She was already thinking of ways to reward him. Maybe she should put him right back in after his little break. Judging by the struggles, he's loving it in there. The Goodra reminded herself to thank Sophie for this lovely human. But her thoughts turned to nothing more than a blur when the human inside her managed to thrust his knee in just the right place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Goodra's shrieking moan was a precursor to her climax. You didn't know what you did to set it off precisely, but you were subjected to the mother of all squashings. Her walls bore down on you so heavily you feared not even the resistance booster would be enough to keep your ribs from breaking. After the squeeze came the flood. A veritable wave of thick, pungent slime rushed past you, carrying you along. Your head was the first to emerge amidst a stream of arousal. With her voice no longer muffled by her body you could hear her moan out loud. The noise was deafening for your tiny ears. The giant Pokemon's epic climax carried you further out of her body. She held a hand near her snatch and caught your slime-drenched body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were utterly exhausted by the intense torment the Goodra had put you through. She brought you up to her face. Her smile was vast, still merrily basking in the afterglow of the orgasm you helped cause. You feel dirty in so many ways, not the least of them being soaked from head to toe in incredibly smelly goop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.... you... you earned your break.\" She said, out of breath still from her climax. This was the time to tell her. You wipe away the worst of her slime from your face and speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grace! Please listen to me! Sophie lied to you!

She looked down upon you and smirked before kneeling down in front of you and tries to pet you with a finger. She then starts to speak in an alien tongue that you couldn't make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Don't worry little bug, we won't hurt you, we just want to take you back for studies\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pokemon reaches down for you, you panic and try to run away. You managed to get far, but tripped over something in the process. You then look back and notice that her paw was already above you, getting ready to pick you up. You yelp and try to push away, but she manages to pick you up and looks over you with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Erf, didn't think about how to carry you back...sorry little one, hope you don't mind...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't make out her alien language yet and keep squirming. Eventually, you notice her moving you to her back and towards her chubby butt. You blush at this and try to slip out of her grip, but only manage to get her to drop you down, right between the butt cheeks. You then hear her chuckle as she lightly clenches on you, giving you a light hug as she starts to head back towards the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cindigo\">\"Now be a good little bug and don't try to escape cutie...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, between her butt cheeks, you try to get out from between them, trying to push against the cheeks as they clamp on you. As you push around, you feel your hand sink into a warm hole and meep, finding out you just pushed against her anus. You then get a big whiff of the smell that seeps out and noticed that it had a...sweet smell to it? You couldn't put a finger on it and keep rubbing your hands over the pucker, hoping to try to escape, but only causing the pokemon to moan out under her breath...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of being pressed against her anus, you manage to get pulled out and notice you were in...</span></div></div>",

You blinked at the bright light you were exposed to. As your eyes adjusted, you realized you were in a large, brightly lit room. As you looked around, you realized that all 5 of the anthro pokemon you saw exit the craft were in the room with you, and all of them eyed you hungrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA regal sounding \"Ahem,\" drew your attention to the front of the room, and your jaw dropped. Sitting in the front of the room was an immistakable pokemon - Mewtwo! Her silvery gray fur glistened as she sat confidently on what could only be described as a large throne. Although she was sitting, there was no mistaking her size or curves. This woman dwarfed every one of the pokemon you saw initially, including the one who secured you within her ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeated beside her was another \"Legendary\" pokemon - Lugia. Her chair was slightly smaller than Mewtwo's, but she was no less intimidating. Her white and blue feathers cloaked her body, but couldn't hide her massive rack or her thick thighs. She wore a concerning smirk on her face as she looked on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMewtwo interrupted the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to excuse Akiko,\" she said calmly, gesturing to the Absol whose hands you were resting in uncomfortably. \"She hasn't yet mastered your planet's language or customs. My apologies if she startled you,\" she said with a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the captain of this ship. As you would never be able to pronounce my real name, you may refer to me as Captain Mika. To my right is my First Officer. You may refer to her as Commander Kimiko. As you stumbled upon our landing party, you will be joining us for the remainder of our mission,\" she said gently, but sternly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to protest, but snapped it shut, thinking better of arguing with a 25 foot version of the most powerful creature in the pokemon universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our mission is to visit and study less advanced planets, stealthily,\" she said, shooting an irritated glance at the Absol and the other members of her landing party. \"We cannot risk your civilization learning of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your misgivings and concerns, you didn't really have any option but to nod meekly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as this ship was not designed for creatures of your...weak stature,\" she said arrogantly, \"You will need someone to escort, protect, and instruct you on how things go on this ship. While that someone may change, you will begin your time here with...\" </span></div></div>",

Possibly in reaction to your squirms, the Pokemon raises her rear a bit, helping to pull you deeper up into her ass. The last thing you see is her mountainous butt cheeks before the hole closes up with a sickening squelch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside, the soft walls keep squeezing and massaging you as you sink deeper into the Pokemon you unknowingly have started to fall for. Eventually, you reach a big chamber that's large enough for you to stand in, but the smell is twice as strong as it was outside. You attempt to wake up the sleeping Pokemon by pounding on the walls, only for them to tighten up on you and your hard on.

You could barely see her face over the incredible breasts that her corset-like top struggled to contain. Her bright brown eyes shined brightly from what you hoped was a friendly face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a few steps back to try to get a full look at her, but stumbled in your backpedal. Tsareena giggled politely as you fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh, be careful there little guy,\" she said with a light laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were speechless on the ground before the beautiful pokemon, unable or unwilling to move from your position on your backside. As you looked up at her, her long legs were the first thing that caught your attention. It looked like she was wearing incredibly tall, beyond thigh high, pink boots, but there was no noticeable seam. As you looked closer, you realized that those were her actual legs! Her thick thigh muscles rippled as she shifted her weight in place. As your eyes made their way up her body, they fell on her hips and ass. The Tsareena from the games your nephew play have a waist that bulges out on all sides, but this one was different. It looked like she was wearing a flowy skirt that rippled gently in the wind with ease. That is, until you caught a sight of her backside. While it was loose and flowy in the front, it was form fitting and clingy in the back, revealing a thick, round ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaped in awe of her regal stance and her incredible curves as your eyes moved up to her narrow waist and her full chest, finally making their way to her smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like something you see cutie?\" she said with a friendly, inviting smile. \"Let me help you up,\" she offered, extending her hand down to you. But is she as friendly as she seems? Or does she have a dark side lurking?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">First, if you haven't read Falcon's great interactive \"Anthros From Space\", I'd recommend it. You can find the link here:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1976512-Anthros-from-Space\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1976512-Anthros-from-Space</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was having a conversation with Falcon about his preferences for his story and he prefers minimal squashing interaction. It's a great story without squashing, but he was kind enough to give me the OK to make a spin off with some of the chapters already in his story and take the basic foundation for his interactive for a Squashing focused story, which is what you see here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe base concept is the same. You are a human who is visited by Anthro's from another planet. They have plans on taking you to their home world. Here are a few rules to keep in mind: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The human earthling should always be male and always <i>at least</i> 18 years old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The alien anthros should always be female, at least any that are interacting with the primary character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- While this is a squashing themed story, any type of smothering or dominating is allowed and encouraged with a few exceptions: NO toilet interaction and do not kill the main character, even if he's submitted to an experience that normally would kill him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Even if the anthros are based on animals that would normally be smaller than a human, for the purposes of this story let's keep them around Amazonian size at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No short one/two line chapters and try to keep choice chapters to a minimum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I've deleted the humanoid alien option and replaced it with an anthro pokemon option. The humanoid option didn't get any traction, I'm hoping this one gets more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's really about it for now. I reserve the right to add to this if necessary. Please enjoy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </td>",
