She had been waking at this time of the morning for as long as She could remember and her memory was a good one. Infact she could rec-elect the frist assignment her trainer had ever given her. Of course back then her trainer hadn't yet evolved. Her human had been a young man in those days. Weighing a hundred thirty pounds less . With three and a half feet in growth missing from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWake me before the sun rises tomorrow. A young man. Who would become Her trainer had told her. When she staggered half dead into his campsite. And you'll have a home with me for as long as you want it. Otherwise this will be the last time your allowed at my fire. The boy had then pushed a plate towards her. The remains of what he had been eating. A gigantic fish. She would later come to know as Seaking roasted over the flames. With the matter settled. The boy pulled down on the crown of his black hat. Until the brim covered his eyes. Then stretch out by the fire. Since that moment onwards waking her trainer before the Sun was to rise. Had become apart of her daily ritual. For he had saved her. He had changed her. And she was greatul. <br>\r\nFor at that time in her life. When an unknown child had offered her that plate of food.  She had been nothing. Just a small, starving Meouth no bigger than a bread box. Not smart enough or strong enough to find her own food. And not even coveted enough to be kept by her original owner. Her original owner had been known as Master Level Breeder. A artisitan so competent in their craft. That even as an infant. She had been viewed as a failure.<br>\r\nThe day after she had been hatched from the egg. Her original owner had sent off her blood test. In order to get her status results. While waiting for that test result to come back she had been pampered and cared for. For three entire weeks. Then came the day that her original owner had brought in the evening mail and inside it was the test result that would change her life. Her original owner saw the test sitting atop the stack of mail and called a friend to come over. When The Friend got there her original owner had read the results out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffensive capabilities. Vastly superior. Both Friend and Owner had smiled and grinned at this pumping their fist into the air and saying that's what I'm talking about. <br>\r\nNext. Defensive capabilities. Inferior Grade 4. Not a problem her original owner had said looking to her. If I did everthing right. You won't even be taking any hits at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial A? Asked the friend greedily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has the nessary traits to be potentially superior. Her original owner read off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClose! The friend said. Rubbing her tiny ears. <br>\r\nWe came damn close. With this one. Both Friend and Owner seemed to be disappointed by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it's not a complete wash. The Friend said. Whats her chances like to stave off Special attacks looking like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormal at best. Her original owner had replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friend waved a hand at this brushing this fact away. Its not like we cared about that anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat we care about with this breed is the speed. How's the speed look?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this question. Her original owner had grinned. We got that one right on the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour joking. The Friend had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope, see for yourself. It says it right here in black and white. Her original owner passed the paper to his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho whistled shrilly before exploding form his chair in a ball of energy. Speed. Exceeded all know limits. Holy crap we cracked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight. Her original owner said proudly. Now we know how they accomplished it here in the Obsidian Region. We just got to keep trying until we get the right nature. And the correct special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhats her Nature? The Friend asked. In that tone humans take when there about to hear something they don't want to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdamant. Her original owner replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn shame. The friend said. If we wanted a physical attacker She'd be the perfect specimen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour forgetting the best part. Her Owner added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhats that? The friend asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nType. Dark, Electric. A true Obsidian Variant. With the egg move Chain Speed. Actually freaking Chain Speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friend began pacing the room as if he was on to the sent of something. So that's how they do it. Alright. Now that we know. The secret. What should we do about her. Sell her? Some people would pay a lot of coin for an Obsidian variant with Chain Speed. Back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo way. A pokemon like this they'll try and take it to the circuit immediately. We wll make more coin if none of those bum on the Professional Circuit knows what we're planning. After all.  What trainer in their right mind going to be scared of a Persian. Espically the frist time they lay eyes on it. I'll take her to the woods tomorrow battle her till she can't battle no more. Then bury the mistake.<br>\r\nAnd that is exactly what her original owner did. He found the clearing. Not far from where she had battled a gigantic creature named Grayados. It was the frist time she ever battled anything  and the frist time she lost. To her credit. She managed to hit the raging creature three times before it finally gripped her in its teeth with a sickening crunch. The raging creature then  shook her tiny body most savagely in all directions. Then with a roar she would never forget it flung her bodily. She sailed for several minutes through the air. Her broken body landed in a clearing inside the forest. Her Owner found her.  There serval hours later. Without so much as a word he dug a shallow hole beside where she had landed and placed her inside. Then with her still mewing pleading with him to help her. He heaped dirt on top of her. She lain there trapped by the weight of the dirt for the longest time. It had been horrible unable to move in that way. And if things hadn't changed that's where her life would have ended. Right there in that hole. If not for a miracle. She had heard the sound of a battle raging above her. A young man had slapped something furiously hard and yelled Dig. A monstrous creature moved to and froe under the ground beneath her. When it erupted she like most of the ground was pushed to the surface in its wake. This allowed her to crawl free. In the distance she saw her Savior a young man standing beside a massive creature.  She later found out that creatures name. It was called Steelix. It had taken her a day to catch up with the youth. By the time she found him he had been sitting by the campfire eating his Seaking Supper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the Persian was in motion. The frist thing She did was to go into the kitchen. Inside the kitchen she found the door to the Icebox had popped open during the night. The machine just wasn't holding together any longer. And for some unknowable reason her human refused to fix it. Saying something about. How when he decided to go into town they'd get a new one. She pressed her weight against the door until she heard the distinct click of the latch shifting into place. Next, She leaped high into the air landing on the counter.  The counter was made of hard woods and so never once had it even creaked under her weight. She moved across the Counter cautiously. Careful not to disturb any of the items on top of it. Not that it would have mattered to her Trainer anyways. The only item he'd get upset over if it was damaged was the coffee pot. She was quite certain of that She could have knocked everthing else on the Counter.  To the floor in a fit of rage and her trainer wouldn't even so much as raise an eye lid when he walked in this room. He'd just stop. Look at the mess she caused chuckle to himself  saying something to the effect of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I take it.  You didn't like the way things were arranged either Vase. Well good for you. To tell you the truth I haven't been to thrilled about all that stuff either. Just haven't been able to work up the rage. To do anything about it myself. Then he would step around the items on the floor and grab the coffee pot. And retreat to the porch. Outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow,  the coffee pot was her intended target. She placed her nose beside the machine and inhaled deeply. The aroma of fresh coffee granules filled her nostrils. That meat her human had loaded the machine the night before. Purposefully,  She lifted one massive paw high into the air. Her retractable claws extended outwards. Her nails were sharp enough to cut slits into solid steel.<br>\r\nOnce those nails had been the pride of the Obsidan Circuit Competition. Inflicting wounds so vicious and brutal upon her opponents. That creatures with the ability Thick Fat were still getting sliced to the bone. She had used them to crave grooves into solid Rock pokemon such as Golem. Yes. Trained and wild pokemon alike bared the reminders of an encounter with her. The devastation she caused in battle had become such a concern for other trainers.  That Nurse Joys from other regions had petition to have her removed entirely from the Professional Circuit. Only twenty Pokemon in history had that distinctive praise heaped upon them and she was one of them.<br>\r\nNow she used those claws for a different purpose. Gently she brought her paw downwards until it rested upon the switch of the coffee pot. Click. The switch sounded. The Coffee Pot turned on. Next she prowled her way into the living area. The youngest human always left the remote to the T.V. lying on the floor for her. A novelty item. With only two gigantic buttons. She stepped on the button with green lettering. The TV turned on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinued in chapter 2. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the Coffee being made and the TV turned on.  There was nothing left to do, except wake up Her Humans. The aging Feline moved silently through the house. Until She reached the door of her sleeping trainer. The door was closed. Not that it mattered to her. Her trainer had long ago installed elongated handles on every door inside the home.  Because he always kept the doors closed. Pushing upwards rapidly with her front paws. She flung the top half of her body into the air. While keeping her back paws firmly planted on the ground. The top half of her body balanced in mid air for a complete second before beginning to come downwards. In that second she shifted her trajectory to have her paws strike the handle of her trainer bedroom door firmly in a downwards manner. The latch clicked and the door pushed open slightly against her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room were many amenities. One of the four walls was filled to the brim with books and shelving. Another wall had a gigantic dresser and mirror combo. The obese piece of furniture was around ten feet in length and nearly running from floor to ceiling in height. Her trainer had struggled the day he'd brought it into the house. He had beamed however when he presented it as a gift to his spouse. The far wall from the door had two items. The frist item that one would come to was a desk. Her human use to spend hours sitting behind this desk. Every evening he would be hard at work plotting out the next steps. That would be required to turn the land they lived on  into fertile framing land. Now that he had everything he wanted. She barely ever saw him sitting behind it any more. Besides the bed was a leather chair.  Many a nights since his wife's accident. Vase had found her human asleep in that chair instead of in the bed. Once years ago while his son was still an infant. She had woke him up from sleeping in that chair. Her human had smelled of the strong drink that he sometimes would pour small amounts of into her bowl. Groggerily her trainer had leaned foward scooping her up in his arms. He buried his face into her fur and cried there for what seems like an eternity. As he wept he kept saying things like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVase you just don't understand how empty the bed feels now. <br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t known what to do. She had never seen her trainer breakdown before.So she had just lied there and let him weep. Now however her human was asleep in the bed. Snoring away as loud as any  Snorlax. She Gripped his hand in her teeth snarling gently as she tugged at his flesh until he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood morning Vase. Her trainer said. Sitting up on the side of the bed. And how are you this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVase purred softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally? Her trainer said. Incredulously. That good. Huh. You know one of these days Vase your going to have to tell me your secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVase snarled ferociously. At this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFine keep your secrets if it matters to you so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer trainer got up. I'm going to start breakfast. Why don't you wake the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hissed at this. Fine twist my arm why don't you. If you can manage to wake him. You can have Oran Berry pancakes for your breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVase smiled to herself.  Her trainer was crazy. Sometimes she would make noises just to see what he'd say next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Vase went down the hall and entered Rock's room. The boy had the coldest room in the house he was sprawled beneath four blankets and was still somehow shivering. The child was more of a challenge to awaken than his Father. Vase attributed this to the drop in temperature and the fact that he stayed up late most night reading comic books, listening to audio books,  or playing games on his hand held device. His father never once complained about these things. He had warned him once though. Saying. If missing your sleep interferes with your work around here you\u2019ll be done. I won't stand for it. Otherwise knock yourself out.<br>\r\nVase gripped a mouthful of blankets set her legs and began pulling in a backwards manner. It took her a second before the boys weight gave ground. Unfortunately for Rock. The boys leg was tangled in the covers and he was slowly dragged from the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock Marrone hit the ground hard. He lay flat on his back. Next to the bed where he had went to sleep in.  The frist sound He heard this morning besides the sound of his skull thunking off the hardwood floor was that of a cat roaring  triumphantly over him. One large paw already covered a portion of his chest. Rock opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne, two, three. He counted I'm pinned.  You win this round Vase. The Cat removed its paw and smacked him playfully with its tail as it turned to exit the room. Rock! His father shouted. Breakfast will be ready shortly. Stop playing with the Cat and eat something. You have chores to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen don't I have chores Rock though. Then answered Ill be right there. The boy clambered from the floor and sat down in a chair besides the bed. Reaching over he turned on a light. The cat might see well in the dark yet he sure couldn't. The room flooded with light. Next Rock turned on the radio. The station was set to 103.5 on the F.M. dial. The morning show host had just went into her speil welcoming any ealy morning listeners to the broadcast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is Obsidian in the Morning. With your host the one and only. D.J. Nightingale. It is currently thrity minutes past the four o clock hour. And we are about to get back into the tunes. Remember this is the only rocking radio station in the Obsidian regions deciated to keeping you updated with all the going and comings. Happening througout the Obsidian Region. We will be posting that news at the top of every hour. Now back to the music. Rock and roll began blaring through the speakers. Rock left the chair crossed the room and found his work clothes. The knees in his work jeans were worn out. Skin showed through spots in the fabric. He put on a team shirt that read blood, sweat and steel. The Obsidian way. Then headed off to join his father for breakfast. His father had a hardy breakfast of pancakes on the table. Rocks were Chocolate Chip. While his fathers were plain. Two places at the table were set with the pancakes piling up nine high on each plate. Three different brands of syrup sat on the table. Rock sat down and noticed Vase already munching away on a stack of Oran Berry pancake. Beneaththe table. Rock cut into his own. Before speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know Mr Leonard says you treat that cat to nice. Rock began. Part of Rock still felt sore with Vase for dragging him out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYea. His Father said. Looking up from his plate. Leanord really said that did he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes sir that exactly what he said. Rock replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell the next time Mr. Leanord speaks ill of my Persian. You tell him. I said. He's never owned an animal in his life worth being nice too. Then ask him how many tournaments on the Professional Circuit his animals have ever won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I say that. Rock said defensively. That will just make his kid angrier with me. She already dosent like me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy do you think she dosent likes you.? His father asked through a mouthful of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell. Rock began we use to be ok. Until last year when she got a pokemon. And you told me you needed me to stay and help out with the chores around here. Then she started hanging out with those trainers from the Ground Walkers. They were recruiting new members offering a pokemon to anyone who joined there gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurst set there listening to his son talk. Really little Julia Leonard had joined the Ground Walkers. He couldn\u2019t believe his ears. They were the sixth worst criminal organization in the region. What in the world could have possessed her to join so far down the list of organizations. All Hurst could think was that Her Father Jason Leanord might have been out of the game for some time sure. And he might have been small time compared to most. Yet his reputation wasn't trashy enough to warrant this level of ignorance from anyone. The Leanord name should of had enough weight to get her in somewhere fancier. Than the Ground Walkers. He got up from the table and grabbed the phone off the wall. He dialed a number then hung up he repeated the process two more consecutive times then returned to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho were you calling. Rock asked, his Father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lotter office to see in my trainer Id number won anything. The line was busy. Speaking of busy. His father said shifting the subject. Your going to be busy all day. I finally bought that piece of land from old lady Duncan our property line just grew around three and a half acres. I want you to take the big rope from the shed. Put it a shovel, one axe, a pri-bar and the plow in the back of the wagon. Then hitch the wagon to the Tauros and go start clearing it of those stumps and rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a huge project Rock said. I be lucky to finish it. In three weeks much less a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood!  Hurst said proudly. I see your getting better at negotiating. You say three weeks. Is the earliest you can have a dent in it. I'll go as low as two. Have in done in two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucker Rock though. If I work hard enough I'll have that done in a week and a half then be able to sit for half a week in the shade. Ha I got the best of you this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock finished his breakfast and headed outside. Vase slipped out the door and began to prowl around the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGive em hell Girl! Rock encouraged. As he pelled off in the opposite direction and headed towards the Shed. Once inside the large shed.<br>\r\nRock led the Tauros out of his stall. Then told the large animal to stay close. He then dragged out the massive wagon. Harness the Tauros and hitched him to the wagon. Quickly he gathered the tools his father told him to take. And a few he didn't. Then hitching the Tauros to the wagon he climbed aboard and said head towards the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
