He was happy with them, they accepted him, demon and all. And then, there was HER. Of all the things he remembered, her personality stood out in his mind, it was so much like his own, She was fiercely independent, sarcastic, direct, brutally frank, and confrontational. carefree and adventurous, and she was very tomboyish in the way she acts and dresses, loves battling and takes great pride in her earth-manipulating skills. She was always eager to prove that she is as strong as anyone else, she was born blind and she didn't let that stop her. He also remembered how he loved being around her since she didn\u2019t know him or judge him as the village idiot or the carrier of the Nine Tailed Fox like most of Hidden Leaf Village did. She was like him in that they both we treated differently since they were born because of things that made them different that they didn\u2019t have control over. He was shunned and hated for what he was by the villagers while SHE was treated as weak and helpless by her family. Naruto never asked to carry the demon and SHE never asked to be blind but they got used to it over time and even turned it into an advantage that made them stronger than most. They took what made them different and made themselves stronger with it. Both had always been treated different and wanted to be treated as normal people not a blind helpless girl and a village idiot with a hated demon inside them. The one place where they had found someone who wouldn\u2019t be biased by what they were was with each other. Suddenly, a hole in the ground opened up right under him. As soon as he got up to his neck, the ground closed around him, trapping him. Naruto's eyes widened, was this an earth-style jutsu? No...he knew this technique. But...how on earth did she here?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ninja-boy. Remember me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed and gulped at the same time. There was no mistaking that voice, they had traviled together, they had shared eachother's secrets, and among other things, they had sneaked into the Earth King's party acting as a couple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toph?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nToph came around into his fild of vision. Smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is your village? Nice place, I like the giant mountan with the stone carvings on on it best. Well...second best.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt himself getting redder in the face by the second, Toph could tell of course, she could feel vibrations to tell a person's bodly reactions to know if a person was lying of embarissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...about you leaving me behind...\" Toph's good good mode disappered, she frowned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toph, please! I didn't WANT to leave you! You can tell when a person's lying! I wanted to stay! Honest!!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph knew he was telling the truth, but she still wanted to have some fun with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ninja-boy. But I want to enjoy you, after all, you took part of me with you when you came back here. Now, I think I'll have some foot-fun with you, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced, Toph walked everywhere barefoot, so her soles tend to get quite a bit....dirty, grimy, slimy, filthy, smelly, and sweaty. soiled to the level were they were black. Not to mention Toph liked being covered in dirt and mud if she had the chance to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph picked one of her ideas to make Naruto go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToph made Naruto...</span></div></div>",

And those problems were currently towering over him with a sneer on her face. Naruto  finally took the time to look at his tormentor. She had ocean blue eyes, dark skin that indicated a life in the sun and dark brown hair, it was braided into a long braided into two... What could something like that be called...? Was hair-loopies a real word...? She also wore clothes made out of blue material. Naruto had to admit to himself, despite how she'd treated him and the nasty smirk on her face, she was quite attractive. Those thoughts about her were cut short as her foot lightly slammed onto him and pinned him under her with just enough pressure to keep him imobile but not enough to hurt him. His head was between her big and second toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think its past time we were introduced, I'm Katara.\" she said in a friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto Uzumaki...and why have you been doing this to me?!\" Naruto shouted up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara sighed and looked at him with remorse. \"To be honest, its nothing personal, I just need to vent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then told Naruto all about what happened to her mother and that Fire Nation solidger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...this guy that killed your mother...did you...?\" Naruto asked in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt happy for her when the giantess who was now rubbing her feet aganst him to massage her feet shook her head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so...you don't have a killer's eyes...there's no blood on your hands. For what its worth, I think you made the right choice and I'm sure your mother would say the same thing.\" Naruto said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara smiled at him as she used his head to massage between her toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You know...I had a friend who sold his soul for reenge...he had a near utopea-life, and he threw it all away because he wanted to put blood on his hands...I tired to stop him...I failed of course, seeing as the only way to stop him would be to kill him...I regreted not being able to stop him, but I'm glad he's still alie.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara's eyes went wide at this information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I'm guessing you shrunk me and have been using me as a scapegoate because you refuse to kill.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara nodded and Naruto smiled up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...my little fox-faced friend...mind if I keep ypu as my foot-property?\" Katara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Naruto nodded and Katara gave him a soft, gentle, grateful, and bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing he'd just perminitly condemed himself to belonging to Katara as her personal pet for the rest of his life, Naruto sighed as Katara held him up by his head between her toes.

Although he\u2019d ultimately accepted his new position in life as plaything for Katara\u2019s feet, it didn\u2019t mean he was going to actually enjoy it. At the same time, he didn\u2019t want to make Katara upset in any way. He eventually decided the only thing he could do was to always outwardly appear to be happy servicing Katara\u2019s feet, no matter how hard that task proved to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026.don\u2019t you worry about it\u2026\u201d Naruto began despite his voice always being somewhat muffled by Katara\u2019s monstrous toes. \u201cI\u2019m just glad to\u2026\u201d his sentence began to trail off, and he gulped before continuing, \u201cTo have the <i>honor</i> of <i>indulging</i> your <i>lovely</i> feet,\u201d he finished, having force himself to spit out the words <i>honor</i>, <i>indulging</i>, and <i>lovely</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara didn\u2019t seem to notice the difficult time Naruto had with his last sentence, or if she did, she didn\u2018t feel the need to mention it. \u201cThat\u2019s great Naruto\u2026\u201d Katara responded before pausing abruptly. Naruto, unable to Katara\u2019s full face from his current position, wondered what could have made the girl stop all of a sudden. Did she see something, or was she just deep in thought? Naruto would soon come to find that the latter was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Naruto, I just thought of something. I should probably come up with a new name for you.\u201d Katara finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wasn\u2018t quite sure if he hard correctly. New name? Before he could stop himself he blurted out, \u201cWhat? Why would you do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you see,\u201d Katara started, \u201cyou\u2019re my pet now, and that means I\u2019m going to be treating you as such. If you still have a human name, then I\u2019ll have a harder time truly thinking of you like an animal, and that just means I might be more resistant to using you in the various ways I may need to in order to calm myself and get over whatever is really bothering me. I may want to put you in situations that I would never subject another human being to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was shocked. This girl was really something. He had already pledged himself to her, or to be more apt, her feet, for the rest of his life, and if that wasn\u2019t enough, here she was talking about renaming him. She basically wanted to strip him of what little humanity he had left so she could have an easier time of abusing him without feeling guilty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to yell and berate her for being so callous, but since he was practically the size of one of her calluses himself, he figured that wasn\u2019t the best course of action. Besides, he had already promised himself, and Katara unknowingly, that he\u2019d do all he could to appease her. He couldn\u2019t let her ever fall far enough into despair again that she\u2019d seriously consider taking revenge on another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that sounds like a great idea,\u201d Naruto gritted between his teeth. \u201cDid you have anything in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking about just calling you <i>Foot Pet</i>,  seeing as you are my <i>pet</i>, and you are going to be spending your life taking care of my <i>feet</i>. It\u2019s just simple and easy to remember that way.\u201d Katara answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWhat have I gotten myself into?\u201d</i> Naruto thought as he mentally beat himself up. \u201c<i>Foot Pet? How utterly humiliating.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d just love to be called Foot Pet.\u201d Naruto begrudgingly said, making his voice sound as happy as possible. \u201cAnd Miss Katara, I also think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress Katara,\u201d Katara corrected him as she interrupted his sentence midstream. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing I was thinking about. It would really be a big boost to my self esteem if you referred to me as Mistress Katara when addressing me from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn\u2019t believe what he was hearing. <i>Mistress Katara?</i> Having him shrunk down to be used as a toy by her feet wasn\u2019t enough? Sticking him with a degrading name like <i>Foot Pet</i> wasn\u2019t enough?  Now he had to refer to her by the title of <i>Mistress Katara.</i> Even if was to help keep her on the path of righteousness, Naruto felt that last stipulation was a little much. He just had to see if he could change her mind on this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I really have to call you Mistress Katara?\u201d Naruto asked, not caring if Katara could sense the desperation beginning to seep into his voice. \u201cI mean, your self esteem already seems very high to me and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea!\u201d  Katara cried as she interrupted him once more, a distraught and reflective look appearing on her face. \u201cI don\u2019t let it show very often, but I\u2019m really not very confident about myself at all in some respects.  I already told you about my mother, and I how I couldn\u2019t save her. But that\u2019s not the only time I\u2019ve been powerless in my life. Some time after my mother was killed, my father left my family to go fight against the Fire Nation, and I couldn\u2019t do anything to stop him. I lost touch with him for several years because I was too weak. And then later, when I started to travel the world, I had no one to teach me Waterbending. I eventually convinced a Master to teach me, but only after he brutally beat me in a fight and proved he was my better. And even then, after that, a friend of mine almost died because I didn\u2019t have the strength to protect him in battle. He was fatally wounded, and it was because of a mystic power, hardly my own doing, that he somehow survived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHaving both your parents gone?  Not having anyone to help you realize your full potential? Almost losing a friend because you weren\u2018t strong enough to protect them? God, it all sounds so familiar.\u201d</i> Naruto thought sadly to himself. <i>\u201cI still absolutely hate having to refer to her by a fancy title, but I guess it\u2019s worth it if I can help her feel she has a little power for once in her life.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, <i>Mistress Katara</i>,\u201d Naruto said, taking the plunge and getting used to the taste of those words on his tongue, \u201cYou have <i>total control</i>  over me now, so there\u2019s no reason to worry about being helpless any longer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto must have gotten through to Katara, for her melancholy state dissipated, and she immediately perked up, shaking a little after hearing his last words.  \u201cWow Foot Pet, you really are good at making me feel better!\u201d Katara declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought he may have heard Katara directly call him by his new name for the first time, but he wasn\u2019t sure. He was still off the ground in the grasp of her toes, and her new shaking around was starting make him rather dizzy. He had to get her to put him down with offending her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress Katara,\u201d Naruto called out, \u201cIf it pleases you, could you maybe set me down on the ground? All this shaking is making me dizzy, and uhh\u2026..if I\u2019m dizzy I won\u2019t be able to take care of your beautiful feet as well I should.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara stopped moving around when she thought she heard parts of the tiny boy\u2019s plea. \u201cWhat was that Foot Pet? Set you down? My beautiful feet? Oh, I get it. You really want to get started on learning how to take care of my feet at your new size.\u201d At that she quickly moved her leg once again, this time to the left. Naruto couldn\u2019t tell where she was putting him, but all of a sudden her toes spread apart and he dropped from the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his new, smaller stature, Naruto felt like he was falling a couple of stories when, at most, it could have only been a couple of inches.  He was glad Katara had heard his request, but he just wished should would have moved her foot closer to the ground before releasing him. The landing was sure to hurt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter falling for some time, Naruto eventually landed on the ground, or what he thought was the ground. The first thing he realized after coming to a stop was that his landing didn\u2019t actually hurt at all, surprisingly. He was very thankful that whatever piece of ground Katara had dropped him on was very wet and squishy. The next thing noticed was how dark it was.  He was surrounded by walls all around him except for above. \u201cDid I land in some sort of well?\u201d he muttered to no one in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after the surprise of falling so far, so fast, vanished, and the shock of landing somewhere unknown passed, did the smell finally hit him. Right away he covered his nose, breathing as little as possible. <i>\u201cOh god what is that awful stench?! Sick!\u201d</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara looked down into her boot at Naruto covering part of his head and thought he was acting very peculiar. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me the fall into my boot hurt your nose Foot Pet. I know you\u2019re stronger than that.\u201d Katara called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto heard this and quickly panicked for several reasons The first reason he was panicking was due to where Katara had said he was currently standing. <i>\u201cHer boot? Well that\u2019s just perfect.\u201d</i> he thought sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second reason he was panicking was because if Katara figured out why he was covering his nose, she might get upset that he thought her boots stunk. Instantaneously, he uncovered his nose, breathing through his mouth best he could. \u201cI\u2019m fine Mistress Katara. The only reason <i>I\u2019m not</i> hurt is because you\u2019re so very smart and dropped me into your boot where I could land with ease,\u201d Naruto yelled out in a sickeningly sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it is good I dropped you in my boot Foot Pet,\u201d Katara giggled, \u201cbut that really wasn\u2019t my <i>sole</i> concern. Get it? <i>Sole</i> because you\u2018re my <i>Foot</i> Pet\u201c Katara said still giggling, now at her own joke. Eventually her laughter died down and she continued. \u201cI was more focused on putting you in a place where you could really get close to, and take care of, my feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto exhaled dejectedly. \u201cI should have seen that coming.\u201d He then looked around, still trying to pay as little attention as possible to the overwhelming smell that permeated Katara\u2019s boot. He couldn\u2019t see much due to lack of light, but he could still walk around. He moved a little, feeling himself sink into the wet, spongy floor with every step, before lifting his leg and stepping along.  The thought of the ground being wet with what he could only imagine was the Waterbender\u2019s foot sweat made his stomach churn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gradually noticed the floor of the boot was somewhat higher near the walls, and the light shining from above showed the ground was a little bit lighter there as well. This was opposed to the floor in the middle of the boot which was lower and much darker. The only thing Naruto could come up for the differences in elevation and color was that was he was walking around on what was a massive copy of Katara\u2019s foot,  imprinted on the sole of the boot from being worn so long. He decided to get some information on his new prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress Katara, if I may ask, how long have you had these boots?\u201d Naruto questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFoot Pet, why do you want to know something as pointless as that?\u201d Katara questioned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn\u2019t expect a question in response to his question, and he didn\u2019t have answer on hand that Katara would likely find suitable. He hastily made something up. \u201c Mistress Katara, I er\u2026uh\u2026wish to know everything I can about your feet so that I can better tend to them. This includes what vessels you bless with their presence from time to time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cI\u2019ve got stop putting myself in situations where I have to suck up to her. I\u2019m running out of big words.\u201d</i> Naruto thought after trying to answer Katara\u2018s question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight blush found it\u2019s way to Katara\u2019s face. \u201cFoot Pet, I can tell our relationship is going to please me for years to come. And to answer your question, I\u2019ve had those same boots practically forever from when I lived back at the South Pole. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already discovered, running around the snow back in the day, and fighting to save the world in the them during recent times, has made the insides kind of dirty. They\u2019ve held up pretty good all things considered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto considered the phrase kind of dirty the understatement of the century. <i>\u201cA disgusting imprint of your foot darker than a black hole in the depths of the universe is more like it. I\u2019d be surprised if light can escape these things. And\u2026\u201d</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s thoughts were interrupted when Katara continued speaking. \u201cI\u2019m getting bored Foot Pet, so I think it\u2019s time for you to actually get to work. Better lay down, because here comes my foot.\u201d Katara, doing as she said she would, began to lower her foot into her boot. Naruto just looked up in horror, watching the massive girl\u2019s foot descend upon him. He then thought of one last thing to say to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMistress Katara, before you reward me with your foot, I feel it my duty to inform you that you seem to have forgotten to put on your socks.\u201d Naruto yelled, hoping to make hell just a little bit more bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara just laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you Foot Pet, but I don\u2019t wear socks. I did at South Pole where it was very cold, but I haven\u2019t needed them since then in the warmer parts of the world. It hasn\u2019t really been a problem, except for the fact that my feet get really sweaty and smelly without them. It bothers my friends some, but a girl has to just let loose every now and then.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s jaw dropped. <i>\u201cNo socks? Smelly? Sweaty? Oh no no no no.\u201d</i> was all that his mind could come up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky for Naruto, Katara didn\u2019t immediately continue moving her foot down. She seemed to be thinking about something before speaking. \u201cFoot Pet, you\u2019ve handled yourself nicely so far,\u201d Katara said while smiling, \u201cso I\u2019m graciously going to give you a choice.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wondered just what she was planning now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to let you choose where you want to be and what you want to do in my boot. You can either lay down in the middle of my boot and massage my sole while I walk, or you get to the end of my boot and clean whatever gunk and jam I have between my toes.\u201d Katara then finally continued lowering her foot into the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn\u2019t know what to do. Being directly in the center of the boot while Katara walked would probably hurt, a lot, but cleaning the jam between her toes at the end of the boot would just be the absolute lowest point in his life. Naruto had to choose quickly, because Katara\u2019s foot didn\u2019t look like it was going to let up. Quickly, he decided to\u2026 </span></div></div>",

He certainly didn't seem the type Amon worked with. She eyed the teenager before her as he yawned, he looked more bored than anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy had spiky blond hair and on his face were three marks on each cheek that looked like whiskers. His pants were a dark shade of orange, held securely in place by a black cloth tied around his waist. His upper body was now covered by a common, short-sleeved Earth Kingdom tunic, with the only difference being that instead of the usual green, yellow or beige color, it was white. And to top the whole thing off, over it he wore a black and orange over-shirt. Clearly, the Metalbending Police Force had confiscated his equipment and that was the source of his annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" Lin Beifong demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yawned and looked at the Chief in annoyance. \"I told you twenty times now: I. Don't. Remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin grit her teeth, looking ready to explode with sheer rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up...then what do the anti-bending revolution members call you?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her \"Ok...that I can answer. They call me \"Spiral\" for some reason.\" he shrugged and leaned back in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked at the blond and raised an eyebrow at him \"How did these guys catch you anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpiral shrugged. \"I just don't see how Amon is going to do it. Unless he's planning genocide for benders, I just don't see how he aims to equilize everything...I suggested he take anger management classes and his lapdogs beat me bloody. These guys swooped in and cuffed me while my wounds were closing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra snorted as she tried not to laugh. \"And you don't remember anything, i take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged again \"I woke up in a crater that was fifty feet deep and twenty feet wide and I'm expected to remember anything? Amon's boys found me and I was drafted after beating the crap out of of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Avatar nodded. \"So Spiral...if you get your memory back, what'll you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged yet again \"Not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked at Lin and took her out of the room for a few minutes and came back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Spiral...you're being turned over to Korra here until we figure out what to do woth you. However, due to you having information on the Equalists, you can't leave.\" Lin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"House arest with the AVATAR as my warden? Is that suppose to be a good thing?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra grinned at him and he felt his blood chill. Somehow he knew this was going to be bad. He raised an eyebrow at the police chief \"...you gave her permission to get all that I know about the Equalists out of me by any means she deems fit, torture included. Didn't you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin nodded. </span></div></div>",

Spiral jerked his head back, coughing and hacking a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh...I thought waterbenders would put more of an emphasize on bathing but...phew!\" Spiral gagged. Then a sudden flash of red light coming from his body blinded Korra and she threw up her arms to shield her eyes! Once the spots stopped dancing in front of her eyes, she looked at where Spiral had been standing and blinked for a second, dumbstruck, before bursting out laughing so hard tears leaked from the corners of her eyes at what had happened to her prisoner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had turned into a small, two-foot-four-inch tall fox! He was mainly slate-gray in coloration with red and black accents on his head and feet. the ears of Spiral's ears were triangular with dark insides, and it has a large, whorled scruff of fur on its head, tipped with red coloration. His blue eyes appeared to have lost their pupils, and his eyelids and circular \"eyebrow\" markings were red. He also possessed a ruff of black fur around his neck, and Spiral's limbs were tipped with red. His tail wass bushy, and when the fox opened it's mouth, small fangs can be seen developing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpiral glared up at Korra, though in his current form, it only caused her to laugh even more at how cute his new form was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" she said as she once again shoved her feet into his face, causing him to get his second wiff of them and he backed up, gagging, before he turned back to normal with a popping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear: you're as crazy as Amon!\" Spiral snapped, throwing his hands in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, I said I was sorry Spiral.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually my real name's Naruto...\" he muttered before he could stop himself. Then froze in horror and turned pale as snow in a matter of seconds as he clapped his hands over his mouth. He didn't just say that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his attention to Korra, he saw her eyes widen and then an evil grin split her features as they both realized that Korra's idea worked about shocking his memory back with the smell of feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! It worked...you at least know your name now. Guess that means a bit of \"Aromatherapy\" is just what you needed after all...fox-boy!\" Korra laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto backed up nervously \"Uh....ahahah....ya know what? Having memoris is overrated anaways. Um....GOTTA GO!\"<br>\r\nHe turned and bolted, only to fall flat on his face as he tried to run. Looking as what caused it, his jaw dropped. His ankles were submerged in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN EARTHBENDING!\" Naruto swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra swaggered up to him with a broad smile \"Naughty, naughty...trying to escape. Guess that means I have to punish you.\" she said in a sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sue me, your feet reek as bad as Fire Lord Ozai was a psychopath!\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Korra frowned. \"That so? Well...guess that is as good a time as any to tell you that the only kind ofg bending I still need to learn is air.\" she said and picked up the fur boots she wore while back home at the south pole and put them on. It was too hot to wear them...and of course Korra knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping on her fur boots, Korra then started preforming katas with as many kicks in them as possible, flames launching from her feet and legs as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...please not that...!\" Naruto whimpered. Korra smirked.  The thick fur boots added onto firebending was going to make her foot oder unbareable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good six hours later, Korra slipped her boots off and walked up to Naruto. \"Time to disipline the fox-boy!\" she laughed. </span></div></div>",

Each time her big toe tapped against his forehead it shot a plum of foot odor into his nose.  After a few minutes of this Naruto finally collected enough of his wits to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way am I going to lick your smelly feet!\" he screamed up at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked down, staring harshly at Naruto with a deep frown on her face.  \"It sounds like you think you have a choice,\" she said with a tone of finality that left no room for argument.  She brought her foot over his face and began to smother the poor boy with it before lifting it off him.  This continued for five minutes before she pulled away to allow him a breath of air that didn't smell like foot.  \"Now that you understand who's in charge, stick out your tongue and get to work licking up my footsweat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto begrudgingly oblidged.  His tongue darted out quickly for a timid lick.  Her foot tasted horrid and the salty taste of her sweat caused tears to well up in his eyes.  After looking up at the young avatar, the blond realized that this wouldn't cut it and began to lick her foot with gusto, much to his regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better, now, take a big whiff of my foot and I'll show you something really cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe obeyed, and her smell filled his nose, so strong he could taste it.

As the \"masked bastard\" thought passed through his mind, Naruto gripped his head as it started throbbing, an image of a man in an orange mask with spiral-pattern that only showed his right eye, wearing a black cloak with red clouds stiched on it, and a black long-sleeve top under the cloak that also covered his neck and chin, a pair of black gloves, and a pair of dark-coloured pants along with a pair of almost boot-like sandal shoes and white stirrups. On the image's waist was a thick black belt with armor-like metal plates attached to it. He wore the same metal plates on his shoulders.He wore blue nail polish on his toes and he wore dark grey gloves and a ring on his left thumb. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen the image changed to someone else wearing a mask was white with a purple tint that covered the entire upper-half of his head with a design that resembled an eye, consisting of a ripple-pattern with three tomoe around the centre; two of these tomoe acted as the mask's eye-holes. His attire includeed a pair of black pants and gloves, with a white, presumed form-fitting shirt underneath. Over this, the second person wore a purple, high-collared, long sleeve mantle that split down the lower half and had a crest that resembled a paper fan on the back. Around his waist he wore a simple, light-purple obi and a belt. Strapped to his back was a purple gunbai with black trimmings and black tomoe, connected to a black chain that ran up his right sleeve.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNaruto fell to his kness against the sole of the inside of the boot. Who was that? Somehow he knew the two were actually the same person. Naruto sighed, amnesia sucked! He knew his own name now, and that was something at least...though crediting that he was able to remember his name now to the Avatar using her foot oder to shock it back wasn't something he was keen on considering. Speaking of which...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe interior of the boot he was in suddenly darkened and Naruto paled at it as a object slid into the boot, Jinora's bare foot. The toes move closer, wiggling as if anticipation of smishing him. All Naruto could do was stare, frozen to the spot. As the foot of the little girl who was anything but 'little' to him got closer to him, Naruto wished he was a firebender or something, even if Jinora felt him, she'd most likely assume he was just a pebble or something. Realizing he could potentally be crushed to death if he didn't do something, Naruto slid so thayt he was standing sideways as the foot reached him, trapping him between her big toe and her second one. He groaned, well, at least he was going to live a bit longer rather than having \"crushed by a little girl's foot\" on his gravestone.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJinora blinked as she looked at her right boot. She could swear that there was somthing inside of it. As far as her personality went,  she knew she was quietly reserved, intelligent, studious girl; much different from her younger, more rambunctious siblings (something she took pride in, actually). Out of Tenzin and Pema's children, she was the calmest and most mature. She enjoyed reading historical fiction, as well as her father's journals which chronicle his adventures with her grandfather, Avatar Aang. She was also beginning to find boys interesting, (something, she noted,which troubled her father greatly). So natrually she was curious as to what it was.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNaruto gasped as the toes stddenly clenched, squeezing him on both the front and back, before the toes started moving up and down along his body, clearly studying him, trying to determin what he was. Ne was tempted to bite the girl, but that wouldn't help him. Seemed that part of him lucked out with this Jinora. He just hoped that she didn't KILL him while trying to determin what he actually was.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'No doubt about it,' Jinora thought, 'there's DEFINATLY something in my boot.' Question was, what was it? Curious, she sat down and pulled her foot out of her right boot and tilted it and gave it a few shakes. She was surprised when something tumbled out of it. Then she sighed in annoyance, it was one of her sister's dolls from the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikki...\" she said in agrivation, picking the human-shaped toy up \"...how many times do I have to tell you not to leave your things in my room?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThis one had spiky blond hair and on it's face were three marks on each cheek that looked like whiskers. It's pants were a dark shade of orange, held securely in place by a black cloth tied around it's waist. The doll's upper body was covered by a common, short-sleeved Earth Kingdom tunic, with the only difference being that instead of the usual green, yellow or beige color, it was white. And to top the whole thing off, over it the toy wore a black and orange over-shirt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJinora blinked, seemed this one was new. And what was it made of it even felt real. She shrugged, not really her business, even if the thing WAS cute, she had to give it back to her chatterbox of a sister. She stood up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Thank you for letting me out of there.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHUH?! Jinora's eyes widened and head whipped to face the toy in her grip, which was now using it's arms to try helping it pull free of her fingers. Then it stopped and looked at her sheepishly \"If you could set my down, preferably NOT into your boot again, I'd appreciate it, little lady.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJinora slumped down, stunned. \"You can talk?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Of course I can, I'm not a toy if that's what you were thinking. My name is Naruto.\" the blond said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Not a...wait...then that means you're a shrunken person then, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNaruto nodded. \"And you're very smart.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe young airbender girl's jaw went slack and she gapped. WHAT?! She brought him to her face, looking him over. Clearly this was some kind of joke.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You know a bird might deside to make a roost if you don't close your mouth. You're name's \"Jinora\", right?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"H-How do you...?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n'Naruto', if she had heard right shrugged again \"The one who put im in there mentioned you by name.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"The one who put you in there?\" Jinora asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You wouldn't believe me if I told you, but can you please help me find a way to be turned back to normal?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurned back? That wouldn't do. Jinora suddenly smiled as her free came down to lightly pet the boy on the head, pushing his spiky locks down with her huge fingers,the texture of his hair was something she had never really felt before. It reminded her of a mixture between hair and fur. She looked at him and thought about this and smiled as she made her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm keeping you.\" Jinora said suddenly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNaruto jaw dropped and his heart skipped a few half dozen beats. \"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Relax, I'll take good care of you while you're mine, little pet. And you'll be safer with me than you would be with Ikki or Meelo. Now wher will I be able to keep you where I know you'll always be?\" Jinora said, talking to herself with the last part. Then her eyes fell on her boot from before and her eyes took on a strange gleem that frightened Naruto.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah...that could work...I already know how you feel under foot and you'd be safe there since you couldn't get out...\" the ten-year-old said to herself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Naruto followed her gaze hand his blood went cold. \"Not the boot! PLEASE NOT THE BOOT!\" he cried.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJinora didn't seem to be listening. She propped the boot up and dangled Naruto over the opening. \"Welcome to you're mobile home, I promise I'll be gentle with you.\" she cooed, batting her eyelashes as him and leaned in and planted a kiss on Naruto before she let go and he fell into her boot again. She then peeked in, the massive brown eye staring down at him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"How cute. But since I don't want you loney in there, I'll keep you company. Let me know when you're in the position you were before. I don't want to squish you.\" Jinora said and her head moved away andher foot entered again. re-entered to boot only enought to block the opening.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWell, at least she was considerate. Naruto wondered if he could at least talk his way out of being this girl's foot-pet. \"Is there anything I could do to convince you NOT to do this?\" he called.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIn responce, Jinora's foot slid in a little bit, causing Naruto to yelp and move back into the toe section, standing sideways like he had before.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hmmm...Is there anything you could do to convince me? Well, you ARE pretty cute. How about...becoming my boyfriend?\" Jinora said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNaruto almost fainted at the answer. WHAT THE?! HER BOYFRIEND?! SHE WAS SIX YEARS YOUNGER THAN HE WAS! But given his position he was sure she was serious.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well? What'll it be? my boot or my boyfriend?\" Jinora asked \"I'll give you a minute before I slide my foot to you and make you my foot-property. So which one?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA minute?! She expected him to choose in only one minute!? Oh man, if that was a joke, he wasn't laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tick tock, little one.\" Jinora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I agree, whose to say you'll let me out?\" Naruto muttered to himself.</span></div></div>",

He could feel how sweaty her toes were and grimaced at the thought of having to lick her feet in that state. He know that his captor was the one holding all the cards but at the same time he wasn\u2019t the type to give in so easily. Crossing his arm firmly, he shook his head defiantly. \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d He told her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra scoffed. The little guy was spunky. She\u2019d give him that. Her toes rewarded him with a good squeeze.   \u201cFine then,\u201d She said. \u201cHave it your way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched in Horror as the Avatar lifted her sole bringing it down on top of him in a quick but graceful motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhap!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***The North Pole***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEska sighed as she sorted through her mail. The day was proving itself to be more boring than usual. After her father\u2019s tenure as chief of the water tribe ended, the day to day tasks of ruling the Water tribe had fallen to her and her brother but it mostly involved sorting out political and civil disputes. There were only so many minor property disagreements a person could listen to in one day. When her brother agreed to cover the arbitration duties for the afternoon in exchange for her taking care of written communications for the day, she was quick to take him up on it. Now as she leafed through the hundreds of messages the northern water tribe chiefs had received, she was regretting that decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJunk, junk, junk, tribute, junk, summit invitation, junk\u2026 what\u2019s this?\u201d Eska paused as she noticed an Iron box with an letter attached. \u201cHmm this one\u2019s from the Avatar.\u201d  Opening the envelope, Eska read the note inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\">Dear Eska,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCame across a particularly stubborn prisoner that needed to be down a peg or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThought you might enjoy a new toy to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't seem to like feet very much. Tried to get him to lick after mine for me after my workout but he refused. Feel free to use that to your advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave Fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Cousin<br>\r\n-Korra</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm perhaps this day would be enjoyable after all,\u201d Eska thought. She carried the box into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned as light unexpectedly entered his eyes.  After Korra had knocked him out, he had woken up inside the box and had been stuck in it for a few hours.  Judging from the motion of his environment, he assumed the Avatar had kept her promise to ship him north. Of couse he tried using his Rasengan to bust out of there but it had proven ineffective. His powers seem to have reduced with his size and the walls around him must have been specially reinforced. He supposed that he was grateful that the box had holes allowing him to breath but he was unable to see anything outside of it. The ninja was actually really relieved when the box finally opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs light came pouring inside, Naruto could see a feminine hand reach out to him.  His first thought that Korra was back to abuse him further but as his eyes adjusted he realized that the hand was lighter in skin tone.  The hand lifted him out of the box and he soon found himself facing a new giantess.  The new girl resembled Korra  in a way. She was paler and a little younger but there was something about her that reminded Naruto of the Avatar.  She wore the same style of clothing (fur material intended to keep its wearer warm) but appeared to favor purple rather than blue. She also seemed like less of a tomboy and more reserved than the Avatar. Though she didn't wear black, Naruto sort of got a goth vibe from her something that her purple eye shadow seemed to accentuate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was sizing her up, the girl seemed to be examining him up as well turning him around tilting him forward and backwards like he was new toy she had received.  \u201cMy you are a cute one.\u201d  She told him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe such a tiny thing like you could get on my cousin\u2019s bad side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So this was Eska.</i> \u201cThat wasn't my fault. Your cousin was being totally unreasonable.\u201d The Ninja explained. \u201cMean too! \u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought he saw the faintest traces of amusement appear on her face. \u201cWell\u2026you may not be in better hands\" She said to him. \"People tell me that between me and my cousin... I tend to come off as the mean one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was more difficult to read than her cousin. On the surface, she looked cold but Naruto got the impression that she had a dry sense of humor.  The problem was he couldn't tell how whether she was joking or breaking the grim reality of his situation to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a matter of perspective.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain her answer was ambiguous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued. \u201cThe fact remains though\u2026 the Avatar has left you in my care\u201d Her thumb tickled his stomach. \u201cIt does raise the question\u2026 what do I do with you?\u201d</span></div></div>",

He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" Eska said, getting his attention again, \"...I believe we should start training you, from what that note said, you have obedience issues.\" as she spoke, Eska removed her thick boots, exposing her sock-covered feet.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAt the sight of them, Naruto whimpered, making Eska raise an eyebrow. Cute, tiny and helpless against her? Amusing. She set him down in front of her feet and he backed away from them as if they were a set of bombs that were about to go off. Eska didn't show it, but this pleased her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems she'd have better luck than her Southern Watertribe cousin had with the little one. Good<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm yourself. I wish to play with you.\" Eska said in her monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto gazed at the monolithic shadow cast by Eska's foot. Judging by the dirty lint balls and yellowish sweat stains covering the sock, it was safe to assume that Eska had worn these socks for a while without washing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thump*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, Naruto felt an immense amount of pressure on top of his body.  He felt the moist, sweaty fibers of Eska's sock. Naruto also noticed the cheesy smell that the sock was emitting as it crushed him. It was far too heavy to resist against. As much as he tried, the sock had completely conquered him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess didn't step on him with her full weight, but she applied enough pressure to keep Naruto firmly pressed against the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath her foot, the blond begin to struggle with all his might, trying his best to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEska moaned as she felt Naruto squirm under her sole. \u201cThat feels rather nice.\u201d She informed him, somehow still sounding bord. \u201cIn fact I want you to keep struggling just like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could respond, Eska began rubbing her humongous foot against him, using his tiny, struggling body as a foot massager for the next 30 minutes. By the time she had used him massaging every crevice of her socked left foot, Naruto was panting with exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEska\u2019s left foot lifted off of him, but Naruto didn't have the energy to run away as Eska brought her right foot towards him and placed it atop his body. She saw he was too tired to even struggle anymore. Eska solved that problem by pressing her foot harder against Naruto, just enough to remind him he still had a job to do, forcing him to quickly resume wriggling around. Eventually, twenty-five minutes later, Eska has used Naruto to massage every part of both her soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a good start.\u201d Eska said, pulling her foot off of Naruto and picking him up. \"You make a good toy. I will keep you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared at her. KEEP him?! No! Not if it meant more foot-torture! At least let him get back to his normal size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEska bent down and picked up one of her boots and held Naruto over the opening.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your new home.\" she said, her bland tone making it seem more like an order than anything. Peering down into the foul smelling cavern Naruto bit his lip nervously  \"Please don't tell me she's gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Eska released him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was sent plummeting downwards, Upon making contact with the insole of Eska's winter moccasin-like boots, he simple bounced on it like a jellotine-like surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsweat the insole had absorbed had made it near spongy and had cushioned Naruto's landing. \"Gross\" Naruto complained as he stood up and wiped some of the moistness from his body. Walls surrounded him on every side. The floor underneath him was soft and spongy and felt wet to the touch. The atmosphere of this place was incredibly hot and humid, making being in the area a truly unpleasant place for the ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Naruto saw Eska looking down at him within her boot. He face eclipsing everything, demanding his attention as she loomed over him like a goddess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest.\" she said, then her face pulled away. Then the footwear tilted and Naruto's eyes widened. A sock-covered foot that he'd gotten very familiar with entered the boot and drew near him. Naruto, filled with panic, ran until he was in the toe section of the shoe. and had to turn around to face the beast that pursued him as Eska's foot caught up with him and forced him onto his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelpless, as it poured over him. Trapping him beneath it. Smothering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEska's sock-enveloped foot rolled over Naruto like a heavy carpet. He pushed with both arms. Tried to squirm away. Too late. He tried to roll out from underneath. But the heavy, living carpet had Naruto pinned on his back. Pinned to the sole. It rolled over his waist. And then quickly, over his chest. Was it going to sweep over his head? Was Eska going to smother him with her foot? It was too late to push it away. Too late to do it any harm. Too late to stop it as it crept closer to his neck. So warm and heavy...It was no use. Too late. Too late to fight back. And now Naruto laid there, trapped. And felt Eska's foot slid up to his chin. Felt the blood throbbing through her foot even through her sock. Pulsing. Covering him. Naruto took a deep breath and held it as the heavy, warm carpet pressed itself against his chin. His arms and legs were pinned to the sloe of Eska's boot. He couldn't squirm away. Couldn't move. To his surprise, the socked foot stopped under his chin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNaruto let out a long whoosh of air.And waited. Had she really stopped? Yes. Eska's foot didn't crawl over his head. It rested heavily on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she expected him to be her insole...or was it to use her socked foot like a blanket? Probably both. Either way, it was warm, and he wasn't in a position to refuse her whims unless he wanted to get squashed into a crimson grease spot under her sole. He didn't want that.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Naruto let all his exhaustion take over and her closed his eyes...</span></div></div>",

To his relief, the first sight to greet him was not the socked toes of Eska on top of his body.  Rather, it was the sight of a distant ceiling, which was soon blocked by the giant face of the waterbender who had used him as an insole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally awake?\" she asked in her lackadaisical tone, \"I hope you're ready to get right back to work.  It was boring when you stopped moving.  I wondered if I had broken my little toy on the first day.  So to make it up to me, you better work hard to not disappoint me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little regard for Naruto's well being, Eska brought her bare foot down on her tiny captive, trapping his head between her big and second toes.  Giving it a painful squeeze, she lifted him to his feet by his neck, taking time to watch as he dangled by his head from her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced to grab at her toes so he could still breath, Naruto tried to free himself from their iron grip on his head.  It wasn't long before his face was turning purple and he began to feel lightheaded.  He was on the verge of passing out again when Eska released her grip on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time, be sure to get to your feet on your own, or I won't be as nice in helping you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gasped for air, only to take in big whiffs of foul smelling foot odor.  Looking up, he saw that Eska had placed her feet directly in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's see if you've learned anything so far.  I want you to lick my feet, like you didn't for Korra,\" the creepy water tribe girl commanded, wiggling her toes in anticipation.  The look in her eyes almost dared him to disobey her like he had with her cousin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Naruto didn't know why, but he just couldn't give in to Eska's demands. It was like a part of him he still couldn't remember just would not submit to the giant water tribe woman in front of him. \"NO!\" shouted Naruto to Eska. \"I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK, BUT I WON'T LICK YOUR FEET! I MAY NOT REMEMBER MUCH OF MY PAST, BUT I WON'T LOWER MYSELF TO LICKING SOMEONE'S FEET!\" Naruto shouted in defiance to Eska's demand. Eska responded back to Naruto's comment with a glare. After glaring at him for a minute, the glare changed into a smirk. \"I'll be honest, I was hoping you would still defy me.\" Eska said down to Naruto dryly. \"It wouldn't be much fun if I was able to break you in such a small amount of time. I promise you, though, that you will eventually obey me and whoever I say can use you. For now, however, I believe your insolence deserves some form of punishment. Consider this the first of what I expect to be many punishments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hearing those words, Naruto quickly  tried to escape from his captor. Running as fast as he can, Naruto ran about  two feet, to normal perspective, before Eska started to box him in for his punishment. Taking her boot, Eska threw the item in front of Naruto's path. Reacting quickly, Naruto decided to go left and escape that way.  Seeing where her future belonging was going, Eska took her other boot and threw it in Naruto's path once again. Figuring out what he would likely do next, Eska decided to stop him early. Taking her socks, she quickly threw one behind him and another to the right of him, thus boxing him in a smelly cage of foot stink. Naruto didn't know what to do. He couldn't remember anything that could likely help him, and the smell from the boot openings and socks were starting to mess with his head. Seeing her captive stuck, Eska decided to slowly walk over to where Naruto currently was and taunt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wish you wouldn't have tried to escape, little one. It would have been easier for you to just accept what would happen to you instead of make me irritated at your pitiful escape attempt.\" Eska said to Naruto. \"Oh well. More fun for me. First though, I'm going to show you how hopeless your attempt would be if you did get outside.\" Eska grabbed a second pair of boots to wear and started reaching down. Eska grabbed Naruto and started to walk outside to the cold. After going out, Eska finally opened her hand and showed Naruto what he would see if he escaped. \"Look around you.\" Eska said to him. \"This is what awaits you. That is, if you didn't die of hypothermia. Your small size makes you more susceptible to freezing to death out here quickly. You can already feel the effects, can't you? I can see your shaking badly and you've only been out here for less than a minute. I'd give you ten before you freeze to death.\" Deciding she crushed his escape attempts for a while, Eska came back inside to the room where she had Naruto trapped in a square of boots and socks and placed him back inside of said square. \"Now that you know what to expect should you escape, I believe it is time to start your punishment.\" Eska said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Taking off the second pair of boots, Eska points her bare naked foot down at Naruto toe first. Naruto was still too cold from being outside to do anything and could  only watch as Eska brought her sweaty and smelly toe down on him. Taking her big toe first, Eska placed it onto Naruto's face and placed a miniscule amount of pressure on him. Not enough to hurt him, but enough to let him know he couldn't get it off of him. She then started to rub his face with her toe, covering him in the sweat and dried skin stuck to it. \"You should be grateful I'm doing this.\" said Eska. \"This should hopefully warm you up enought to lick my foot.\" After two minutes of her rubbing Naruto's face, she slowly took her big toe off of him. Thinking this was a reprieve, Naruto was unprepared for the next toe that landed on his face. This process repeated itself for each one of Eska's ten toes. Deciding that Naruto was warmed up enough, Eska started the next part of his punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Grabbing Naruto with her first to fingers and thumb, Eska slowly brought him over to her right foot. She then shoved his body into the sole of her foot and slowly rubbed him all over it. From heel to the tips of her toes, Eska rubbed him into every part, covering him in the sweat and smell that her foot generated. She then brought him over to her other foot and repeated the process. By the time she was through, the smell had soaked into Naruto's very being and the sweat coated him like slime covers a slug. For some reason, when he thought of this, he had an image of a blond woman with an odd diamond shape on her forehead. Finally deciding that she had punished him enough, Eska decided to end it for the day. Taking both of her socks, she put Naruto between them both and rubbed them together vigorously, making Naruto smell like her foot even more. This torture would surely break a normal man, but this small part of him flared up again and stopped him from giving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes of rubbing Naruto between her socks, she decided that it was time to go to bed. Picking up Naruto, Eska made her way over to her bed. \"I assume you still have some fight left in you still.\" Eska said to Naruto. \"I will take care of it in the morning. For now, though, I am tired. Hopefully after tonight, you will be more willing.\" Taking Naruto over to her right boot, shestarted to lower him into it. \"Sorry, but this is the only way for you to survive the night in this cold. Don't worry, though, you will have company.\" Dropping the barely conscious into the boot, Eska maneuvered it so that Naruto would be stuck in the toe section. Grabbing her socks, she quickly stuffed them into the section where Naruto was. Feeling like Naruto would barely be able to move and would surely be able survive the night, Eska called it a night and slipped into bed. Naruto, however, was forced into the toe print of Eska's big toe because of the socks pushing down on him and stopping him from moving. He was warm, thankfully, and decided to go to sleep, not knowing what Eska had planned for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What will Eska do to Naruto tomorrow when they wake up?</span></div></div>",

The first example of this was insulting some spirits that had settled in Republic City and making them go on a rampage. Avatar Korra stopped them eventually but was blamed for the destruction they caused. Thus, when Naruto was found by the hot tempered heroine, she was in a very bad mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra beat the young ninja {who found himself powerless in this new world} in a quick fight and dragged him back to Air temple island to personally deal out his punishment.

That morning had been very foggy and Naruto had wandered too far and had gotten lost.

It was there that she noticed the young ninja dressed in unusual orange clothes. Curious as to who he was, she hid behind a tree and watched. Naruto didn't see the young girl who had spotted him hiding there. He began to practice his Rasengan on a nearby tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula watched as the ninja created a ball of what she could only guess was air with his bare hands and destroyed a tree with it. Orange clothes she thought and the ability to control air. He must be an airbender she decided. I'd better capture him she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came out of hiding and called out to the ninja. \"Well well well...looks like I caught an airbender.\" She said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto jumped at seeing the fire nation princess come out of nowhere.

Azula feet smelled worse than before which was something he thought was impossible. He also noticed her feet had become a lot sweatier as her footsweat soaked into his face. He desperately wanted her to pull her feet away but Azula just kept rubbing and rubbing. Naruto vaguely remembered his ideology of never giving up but the more he experienced the fire nation princess\u2019 feet, the more he felt like abandoning that principle and begging for mercy. Azula could also tell so was close to breaking him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto woke up to find himself chained to floor of a dungeon. He took a moment to process what had happened and realized that cruel woman must have moved him there while he was asleep. He tried to break free of the chains but found that no matter how hard he tried, he could not get loose. The chains seemed to be extra strength and to top it off, the demon fox seemed to be holding back on lending him his power. Naruto guessed he was enjoying the particular method the woman was using to torture him. Eventually Naruto gave up on struggling and waited in terror for Azula to follow up on how she said he would be tortured next. He wasn\u2019t kept waiting long. About five minutes later he heard voices outside his cell as the fire princess meet up with her henchwomen.<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n\u201cDid you two follow my instructions?\u201d Azula asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYes we did a double workout routine and a 2 hour jog just like you said Azula,\u201d Ty Lee told her. <br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026remember I don\u2019t want him physically harmed, just mentally broken.\u201d Azula said looking in Mai\u2019s direction.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Mai said annoyed. \u201cI heard you the first time.\u201d<br>\r\nMai sighed. Of the three of them, Azula was really the one who would most likely seek to physically torture her captive.<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you found another airbender\u201d Ty Lee said impressed. \u201cI thought there was only one left.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure he\u2019s an airbender right?\u201d Mai asked dryly. She knew Azula had a tendency to jump the gun.<br>\r\n\u201cI saw him use an air technique with my own eyes.\u201d Azula told them insistently \u201cBut the problem is he is refusing to confess and answer my questions\u2026that\u2019s why I need your help. Anyway we\u2019ve kept him waiting long enough!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nNaruto shuddered as he heard his cell door open.<br>\r\n\u201cAh you're awake\u2026good\u201d Azula told him. \u201cI actually wanted you to wake up to the smell of my feet in your face but at least that means we can get your torture started right away. These are the friends I told you so much about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto could easily tell which girl was which. Azula\u2019s description of them had been perfect. He knew right away that the cheerful girl in pink was Ty Lee and the girl with the sour expression on her face was Mai. Thinking about how accurate Azula\u2019s description of them had been, he shivered and prayed that Azula had exaggerated about how bad their feet would smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee smiled as she looked at the captive ninja. <br>\r\n\u201cThat airbender is pretty cute\u201d  She giggled. <br>\r\n\u201cFor the last time\u2026I\u2019m not an airbender!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Naruto whined.<br>\r\n\u201cSee what I\u2019m dealing with,\u201d Azula said annoyed. \u201cAt least now we have an excuse to torture him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDo we have to do this?\u201d Mai asked bored. For her torturing a captive seemed like a waste of time.<br>\r\n \u201cOf course!!\u201d Azula said exasperated. \u201cDo you know how bad it would be for the fire nation if there are other airbenders unaccounted for? However...here\u2019s some added incentive for you. Whichever one of us can get the airbender to spill his secrets, gets to play with him for the rest of the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls were intrigued by Azula\u2019s offer. They each liked the idea of having the \u201cairbender\u201d to their self for the night. Even Mai gave a rare smile at the thought of the games she could play if she was given some time alone with this prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are we agreed?\u201d Azula asked.<br>\r\nMai and Ty Lee nodded enthusiastically. <br>\r\n\u201cOk so we\u2019ll each take turns torturing him for an hour\u201d Azula said looking at her friends. \u201cSince he\u2019s already been introduced to my feet, why don\u2019t one of you two go first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho takes the first turn?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After 3 hours of weapons training and running, Mai couldn\u2019t wait to take off her boots and give her feet some much needed air. Naruto grimaced as Mai lifted her left foot just above his face allowing him a good view of the removal of her boot. Then he watched in horror as Mai slowly began to tug at her boot eventually popping them off. The smell hit everyone in the room like a stack of bricks. Azula and Ty Lee backed away as even the two of them weren\u2019t spared from the smell. Mai wrinkled her nose a bit and blushed slightly embarassed.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry!\u201d She apologized. \u201cI guess the result of my workout were a little better than I expected.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright\u201d Azula laughed actually glad her captive was really going to suffer smelling Mai\u2019s feet. \u201cI just hate to be in the \u201cAirbender\u2019s\u201d position right now.\u201d<br>\r\nTy  Lee just covered her nose and mouth with her hands.<br>\r\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll watch from outside the cell\u201d Azula announced. \u201cThat will give your feet the space they need to break our captive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire princess and Ty Lee left the cell pretty fast to watch the torture from a distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like it\u2019s just you, me, and my feet\u201d Mai said an emotionless tone to her voice. She removed her other boot and wiggled her toes in front of Naruto\u2019s face causing the ninja to yelp in terror. <br>\r\n\u201cThis torture stuff bores me but once I have you to myself, we might be able to have some real fun,\u201d Mai told him. \u201cThe thing is in order to play with you\u2026I\u2019m going to have to break you first!!\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While the weapon girl\u2019s feet were soft (probably from soaking in sweat all day) the smell was unbearable for Naruto and tears began streaming down his face in less than five minutes. <br>\r\nMai noticed but she didn\u2019t stop. She was extremely lonely and bored after her boyfriend Zuko abandoned her to join up with the avatar. It was true that she still had Azula and Ty Lee but they were the kind of friends she could only handle in small doses.  The yellow-haired boy looked like he might be entertaining company in Zuko\u2019s absence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mai thought of Zuko, she felt anger fill her. He didn\u2019t even bother to say goodbye in person. He just left her a note. She thought she meant something to him. You\u2019d think he tell her he was going to do something big like confront her father. Guess he didn\u2019t care for her as much as she cared about him. It bothered her how much she changed when she was with Zuko. She had begun to expose her feelings to him which was something she didn\u2019t do to just anyone and she had listened to him responding to his problems the way a caring girlfriend would. What upset her the most was that she still had feelings for Zuko\u2026eventhough he had chosen to leave her\u2026she still loved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to take out her anger on Naruto kicking and pressing her feet against his face and nose trying to rub whatever sweat and dirt remained on her feet into him. Naruto groaned and whimpered throughout the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Naruto the torture was definitely an awful experience. But what made it worse was that he was unable to read this girl as she tortured him. Mai kept her emotions guarded and Naruto had trouble telling if she felt happy, angry, sad, or indifferent doing this to him. He knew he shouldn\u2019t care about how his enemy felt but they was something about this girl\u2019s expressionless face that bothered him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ready to give up yet?\u201d Mai asked him pressing her feet hard against his face. \u201cIf you give up now\u2026I\u2019ll definitely stop\u201d <br>\r\nDefinitely not wanting to give the watching Azula the satisfaction of hearing him submit, Naruto refused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Mai continued his torture. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy do guys always have be so stubborn?\u201d She asked annoyed. \u201cAlways so hesitant to let a girl know their feelings even if all they wanted to do was help!\u201d<br>\r\n She pinched Naruto\u2019s mouth open and picked up her boot and poured the large amount of footsweat inside of it down the ninja\u2019s throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto choked on the salty taste of Mai\u2019s feet, he realized what it was that bothered him about Mai\u2019s expression. It was an expression he had seen frequently in Sasuke, Gaara and even sometimes in himself. It was the cold dead look of loneliness\u2026she had lost someone close to her and she was hurting inside from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn\u2019t get the chance to dwell on his discovery as Mai continued to torture him. She gave him a second helping of footsweat from her other boot and proceeded to use the smell of her feet and her boots to put him through hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time his hour with Mai was up, Naruto was constantly sobbing. Azula and Ty Lee came in and informed Mai her time was up.  They wondered whether Mai had done enough to break the ninja.<br>\r\n\u201cSo \u201cairbender\u201d are you ready to talk yet?\u201d Azula asked. \u201cOr does the torture continue with a fresh set of feet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn\u2019t know how much more torture he could take. Maybe he should just submit now and spend some time alone with Mai. At least he would be with a kindred spirit who shared his loneliness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wanted this to happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you were doing all that to me, Something was bothering me about your expression. I've seen it frequently and even felt it myself. It was the cold dead look of loneliness\u2026you've lost someone close to you and your hurting inside from it. I know its not my bussiness, but I'm not an idot. If you want to talk, I'll listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" Mai covered her ears, Why? How? How did he know what she felt? What bugged her most was that he was right on target with it, like his words were hitting every single sore spot in her body, With every beat of her heart she felt a small constricting pain throughout her chest. So that was why he tricked Azula, Naruto wanted to help her. Mai fought back furious tears. How dare he do this!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You DON'T know a thing about me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know being alone sucks more than I'd like to.\" Naruto said with unmistakable honesty and sadness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you...\" Mai's mask was starting to come off, she seemed sad and angry at him. She was more than ready to pull out one of her throwing blades and yet something stopped her as soon as she saw his face...those eyes. Those beautiful deep sea-blue eyes that seemed to see right through her, they made her feel like she was drownding in comfort and yet she saw a pain she knew too well. He didn't toy with people's hearts, that was forever beneath him. He was telling the truth. He truly DID know how she felt inside. Mai felt her heart crack, he wanted to help her so much that he was willing to druge up all his own pain and suffering, the pain that could have made him go mad, the pain that could have made him a monster. Just for her to have a shoulder to cry on. Mai felt a smile tug at her lips, glad he was willing to be there for her, and a small voice in her head told her Ty Lee had been right, this kid was cute.  He'd make a wonderfully entertaining plaything, she could feel it. The question now was do they share feelings or dose she clame him as her toy right away?      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As promised by Azula, Mai won the prisoner Naruto for the night to do with as she wished. She put on her still wet and spongy feeling boots as two Fire nation guards Azula  had ordered entered the cell. The guards the proceeded to knock Naruto out with a quick blow to the head, remove him from his one set of chains, force his arms behind his back, and then chain his wrists and ankles together with the another set of the same extra strength chains found in the dungeons, only this time they weren\u2019t latched to the building. They then carried Naruto to Mai\u2019s private quarters as she followed behind. Upon arriving, the two guards threw Naruto into the room on his back, allowed Lady Mai to enter, and stood guard outside the now shut door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai, starting to have ideas begin swirling in her mind, hurriedly sat herself down upon Naruto\u2019s chest/stomach. She quickly pulled out a kunai from her sleeve and aimed it preciously at Naruto\u2019s exposed throat just as he awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen blond boy\u201d Mai began softly \u201cFrom spending so much time around Azula, I\u2019ve become the type to never tolerate disobedience. I want everything in life the way it is when I throw my knives: quick, precise, and direct. Never boring.\u201d<br>\r\nAt this point Naruto became very worried from her somewhat hostile words, as if the sharp object pointed at his jugular wasn\u2019t already enough. A quick glance around the room told him he was quite alone, and Mai was quite in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai continued, \u201cI know you just want to help me, but right now\u2026this very moment\u2026I need to get something out of the way before you can begin to do that, if at all.\u201d<br>\r\nAt this, Naruto was confused, but he thought it simply best to allow her to go on with her explanation. Maybe he could find out some useful information for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you may have noticed, there was a somewhat hidden anger behind parts of my torturing you before. Not directed at you in particular, but maybe at all men in general, my seemingly uncaring former boyfriend Zuko especially for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto internally groaned. \u2018Oh great, a girl with weapons that isn\u2019t so keen on men right now. Her and Tenten would get along swell.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai had the perfect idea in mind\u2026a way to get at least some semblance of vengeance, if not against Zuko for leaving her alone, then at least against all males and their pigheaded ways of only caring for their own feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and I are going to play\u201d she said with the slightest of smiles, one that would uncharacteristically grow as she went on. \u201cAnd by play, I mean I start to feel confident about myself once again, my pain maybe heals, and you possibly make up for some of the other members of your gender\u2019s past mistakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow exactly do you plan on that!?\u201d Naruto cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to lick my feet clean\u201d Mai said nonchalantly as one could while kicking her boots off. The walk back from the dungeons encased in her boots had once again put her feet in a less than dainty state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s jaw dropped, and as the familiar aroma of Mai\u2019s putrid foot stench once again reached his nostrils, he practically screamed an ear piercing \u201cWHAT!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me\u201d Mai started with a her clear and steady voice, although one could say it began to crack towards the middle of her monologue. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re going to do. And during it all I get to feel like the princess Azula is\u2026the Fire Lady I should have been by Zuko\u2019s side. If nothing else, it\u2019ll just be relaxing to have my tired, smelly, dirty, sweaty feet massaged and cleansed by your male tongue\u2026therapeutic in a way when you think about it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d Naruto asked meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai twirled the kunai in her hand, and pressed it against Naruto\u2019s throat. Should she have pressed any harder, she would have surely drawn blood. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to find out.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Be extra careful that you get them nice and clean!!\u201d<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and began licking Mai\u2019s right foot up and down causing the young girl to giggle. Naruto couldn\u2019t say that he liked the taste of Mai\u2019s feet (Who would?), but for some reason the small smile that emerged on her lips as he licked, made him feel glad.  <br>\r\nHe guessed it was because he sympathized with Mai. That emotionless expression the weapon girl had given him had brought up the memories of his own lonely childhood. He shuddered as he remembered the cold and empty feeling inside of him and he was determined to stop Mai from feeling that. It didn\u2019t matter that she spent an hour cruelly torturing him or had a dagger to his throat a couple seconds ago; Naruto couldn\u2019t abandon someone who had that type of pain in her heart. Since Mai wasn\u2019t ready to share her feelings with him yet, Naruto decided he would remain by her side just so she wouldn\u2019t have to be alone. If licking her feet made Mai feel even the slightest bit happier, than Naruto was more than happy to endure the salty taste. He continued to lick her foot making sure to lick away whatever dirt he found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai smiled as Naruto worked away at her foot. The feel of his tongue against her sole was both mentally and physically soothing for her and she was grateful to him for doing it.<br>\r\nNaruto continued to lick for another 20 minutes. After he had finished licking every area of the top and sole of Mai\u2019s foot, Naruto began to lick her toes. Mai moaned as she felt Naruto\u2019s tongue gently graze her toes. It really felt amazing for her. As Naruto licked between Mai\u2019s toes, the weapon\u2019s girl felt warm tingles of enjoyment run down her spine. After Naruto had finished licking every area of Mai\u2019s right foot, Mai pressed her left foot against his face. Smiling, Naruto began to run his tongue up and down Mai\u2019s other foot licking her left foot clean. After another half an hour of licking, Naruto had thoroughly licked every area of the weapon girl\u2019s feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai inspected her feet to discover that Naruto had licked them spotless. She nodded approvingly. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty good at this!!\u201d She joked. \u201cMaybe I can convince Azula to let me keep you as a personal foot licker.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled. He felt glad that Mai was starting to warm up to him.<br>\r\n\u201cNo matter what the job is, I always do my best!\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai laughed. The licking had made her feel a lot better. Apparently, Naruto had made more than her feet feel good. Just having someone to stay with her and keep her company eased some of the pain and anger she was feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her \u201ccaptive\u201d trying to decide what to do next with him. She wanted to take him up on his offer to listen and talk with her but she didn\u2019t trust herself not to break down and cry while she poured her soul out to him. Maybe it was better to just to continue to play with him for now. Mai affectionately rubbed her feet against Naruto\u2019s head as she considered what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she decide?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was a rich only child who got anything I wanted. As long as I behaved...and sat still?and didn't speak unless spoken to. My mother said I had to keep out of trouble. We had my Dad's political career to think about. The only person who could get me to express myself before you came along was former boyfriend Zuko,  Azula's brother. Azula, Ty lee and I have been friends since...I can't remember how long. We went our seprate ways after we graduaited from the Royal Fire Accemey for Girls, Ty lee when off and joined the circuse, Azula stayed with her family, and I was sent off with my family after my dad was made a govoner. I found out from Azula that Zuko was banished by his dad for speaking out in a war meeting. I can't remember crying  so much, that made feeling much of anything even harder, it convinced me emotions were painful and something that life would be better off without. My dad was made the govener of the city of Omashu after the king there surendered, after that Azula and Ty Lee came back into my life with a mission to help capture the Avatar, I was board out of my mind at the city and I'm sure you know by now, Azula's not the type that takes 'no' for an answer. We chased the Avatar and his friends for a while, eventually running into Zuko again, his banishment was revoked after Azula told her dad some fib about how he got rid of the Avatar. For a while, I was acctualy happy. sure me and Zuko had a few minor squabbles, but that was easy to deal with. It didn't last, Zuko turned on his dad, then ran off to join the Avatar and his friends, he didn't even say good-bye in person, he just left me a note telling me about it. Sorry if all my problems stem from Zuko, but I cared about him and he tore my heart out. After all that, Azula found you and...well, you know the rest.\" <br>\n<br>\nNaruto nodded, going back into...that place...was never a good thing. That dark, cold, empty, lonely pit in the bowles of hell. He'd been there and he knew what it was like. he couldn't help it...he shuddered as he remembered the sheer loathing he had for that place. He was also feeling sheer disgust twords Mai's so-called parents, he knew he'd never be able to understand what having parents do something like that to you was like, but still...who chose political statuse over family?!?!?!? After she finished, Naruto looked Mai in the eye and told her everything about his life, how had had no parents to begin with, how his earliest memories were from members of the noble families in the village trying at assinate him when he was only a year old, the attack by the nine-tailed fox being why everyone hated him becouse of how all becouse he was born on the same day and how it had given them the idea that if they killed him, the fox demon would never have shown up at all.Obviously, the Third Hokage; also known as Sarutobi Sasuke, had passed a law forbidding anyone from talking about the accursed fox and his attack. Of course, this meant that Naruto had no idea why everyone gave him regular beatings, why everyone glared at him; why everyone hated his guts. It was no secret that Mitokado Homura and Utatane Koharu; heads of the village's council held a strong dislike for Naruto and did anything in their power to make his life a living hell or get an execution. In fact, they sometimes sent ANBU to assassinate him behind the Hokage?s back. Of course, they would always be caught and the Sandaime passed new orders to murder anyone who spills the secret or attacks Naruto. Needless to say; there were several ?mysterious? deaths regularly. Naruto was shunned by everyone, both peers and everyone else except for a few people, how thay saved him from that dark place. All of his life up to this point she learned it all, poor boy had wanted to vent all this for years, that was painfully obvious. <br>\n<br>\n\" Like I said, I know that being alone sucks more than I'd like, I've been in that place before, I know what its like, what it dose to people. I was lucky. Mai, here's what I know from having to go through all that: When you've spent your whole life surrounded by the darkness of the human heart, having people that you care about and care about you in turn is like being able to cluch a star in your bare hands. I'll remain by your side just so you don't need to be alone for as long as I have a say in the matter.\" Naruto finished.<br>\n<br>\nMai hugged him and held him close, and whispered in his ear something that made him smile.<br>\n<br>\n\"If that's what its like, I just found a star to hold onto.\"<br>\n<br>\n      </span></div></div>",

For some reason, she felt completely safe and secure, and she'd give anything to get a few more nights like this one. She sighed and snuggled deeper into the eerily soothing pillow. Perhaps it wasn't so bad to let herself relax every now and then. She hadn't realized exactly how good it felt to get a full night of imperturbable sleep, and no matter what it took, she'd get one of these pillows for herself. They were damn cozy. A sudden flash of light interrupted her from her ceaseless rest. She hadn't heard anything about a thunderstorm, and the lightning was quickly annoying her. Mai shut her eyes tighter to block out the sporadic sparks, digging her face deeper into the soft cotton of the pillowcase. She wasn't quite ready to wake up yet, and she'd do everything in her power to hang on to those last few minutes of precious sleep. The unmistakable sound of muffled giggling reached her ears, and she immediately snapped her eyes open and hopped up onto her knees. She blinked a few times to gain her bearings,  her vision eventually becoming clear enough to see both Ty Lee and Azula looking down at  her with devilish grins on their faces. The room was imperceptibly dark, signifying that it was early morning at best, and thin rays of light streamed in through the open window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!\" Mai spat, her luxurious sleep immediately forgotten. Their grins only widened, and both girls simultaneously pointed at something to her left. She glared at them for another few seconds before skeptically turning her head. To her amazement, Naruto was wantonly lying on the bed next to her, a miniscule amount of drool  seeping out of the open corner of his mouth. Her own mouth opened in horror as she realized that the pillow she'd been snuggling up against all night was her new friend. At least they were still wearing they're clothes, that would have been a nightmare otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula couldn't resist. \"Mai...I see you and the airbender were getting friendly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai's face tured red with furry. Ty Lee looked at Mai. Her aura wasn't dingy, pasty and gray anymore, something about this boy had changed her for the better. She'd have to ask Mai about it... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knife missed her ear by inches, good thing Mai was too mad to aim straght<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...assuming the girl in question didn't kill them first!</span></div></div>",

The poor cutie seemed nice too, why did Azula have to be so heartless? On top of Azula's cruelty being the ansolute counter-part to the circus girl's naturally kind nature, Ty Lee was curently feeling admiration for her captive standing his ground aginst Azula to preserve the trust his comrades had in him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, for the record, I don't want to do this. I'm just trying to stay on Azula's good side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has one?\" Naruto asked, Ty Lee felt that was a reasonable question, Azula never was one to show kindness unless it was to trick someone to get what she wanted from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure about that myself.\" Ty Lee said as she balanced on her fingers, moved her hear back so that it looked to her that the strange boy was strapped to the ceiling, and her lower body so that when she set her head back to speek with him, her feet were resting on it. Seeing how Ty Lee bent and contorted her body, Naruto couldn't help wincing, did this girl even have bones?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, It dosn't hurt though, I was a master gymnist by the time I was seven.\" Ty Lee told him seeing the look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azula forgot that part when she told me about you, for a second I thought she'd tortured you until you could bend that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised, I out-did her with cartwheeling one time, she dosen't like having someone be better than her at anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's a vain snob? If she hates being beaten so badly, why didn't she mar you years ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee felt herself blush, was that his way of secretly telling her she was attractive?

I'm not an airbender, I don't even know what that is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Azula said she saw you airbending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groned \"And what dose that prove? You can't see air, how can she prove it? All that she's got going for her is her own word.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee nodded, he did have a point. A crazy living flamethrower's word aginst fact? No way Azula had any evedince in her favor. Suddenly, the two heard the door knob turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry!\" Ty Lee said and plucked the nose pin off Naruto and the smell hit him like a out of control ferrate train.      </span></div></div>",

Lying down in front of Naruto and holding her head in her hands while kicking her legs, Ty Lee tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...Oh! How about the eastern Fire Nation! They have a few blonds out there...I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Fire Nation, eh?\u2019 Pieces started matching together in his head.

Damn, this was actually starting to get hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her finger and twirled it on his chest, leaning toward a slowly reddening and very embarrassed Naruto's ear with a devilish smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise not to tell Azula...as long as you promise to do something...special...for me, Kay?\u201d she practically breathed into his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...uh...you see...uh...I'm not allowed to tell you where I\u2019m from\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d she giggled a centimeter from his nose, giving him a look that sent jolts of energy up and down his spine like a bouncing ball. Ty Lee started to press herself against him and leaned into him as she ran a hand along his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm...sorry but\u2026 I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d This came as almost a whimper from Naruto. Too much more and he wouldn\u2019t be able to take it any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee looked back to make sure no one was watching and, when she knew it was clear, practically saddled up on Naruto\u2019s  chest and started to rake her hand through his hair like an expert. Damn what she could do with her hands! \u201cPleeease?\u201d she said in the cutest voice she could muster while batting her eye lashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 well, m-maybe I can say...village...h-hidden in\u2026\u201d Naruto finaly gave in as Ty Lee's hand went from his hair to his lips, in the say-no-more-way that tells people to be seilent after hearing something, Naruto got the message, Ty Lee had gotten what she wanted whith him just saying he was from a hidden village. Ty Lee's hand moved to his chest. A coy smile made its way to her lips as she said, \u201cNow that wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, Ty Lee pressed a little harder on Naruto\u2019s chest, forcing him to the ground with their faces mere centimeters apart. Naruto began to sweat as she started to close the gap, \u201cW-what are you do\u2026?\u201d he began but was cut off as she mashed her lips into his while pressing her tongue into his mouth in a strong and impassioned kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was in shock. He had never been kissed before, and especially not like this. There was no denying that he enjoyed it and he was almost sad when Ty Lee ended it. She looked down at him with a sultry smile and spoke. \u201cIf I remove your bindings will you promise to play nice?\u201d she purred, she liked this kid, she now knew Sokka was a bit of a lost cause with her, he was involved with that Suki girl, not that she cared anymore, this boy was a way better catch. Still in a daze from the intense kiss, Naruto numbly nodded his head, not really sure what he was acknowledging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon heard four consecutive clicks and the bindings were off. Now Naruto was having an internal debate as to weather he should try and flee or stay. However, Ty Lee straddled him again before he could choose so he was forced to decide that he would stay for now and make his escape later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuunnnnhh,\u201d he moaned as she began to stroke his whisker marks, Ty Lee smiled as Naruto's eyes started to close lazily, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that, do you? I guess it helps you relax then.\" Ty Lee cooed to the now half-asleep ninja. He looked so cute as he was drifting off to sleep. This was for the best anyways, if Azula came back and he was unconcouse, she'd be none the wiser, just assume that her foot-oder had knocked him out.  After a little more stroking, Naruto was fully out like a light. Ty Lee had just lifted him into a chair when Azula re-entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what did you find out? And WHY is he out of  the bindings?\" the princess snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said whoever got him to talk got to have him, Azula.\" Ty Lee pointed out, that caught Azula's intrest instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...did...you...find...out?!\"  Azula hissed  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said something about a hidden village...but he passed out from the smell before I found out were it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula's eyes went wide at the idea of a hidden village of airbenders, that would be a desaster for the Fire Nation! Azula felt her outrage buld until she sniffed the air. and she scrunched her nose in descust at the foul oder still in the air, no wounder the boy had passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take him then.\" Azula said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee  gathered Naruto up in her arms, she and Naruto had both won this, and now Azula would be chasing after non-existent airbenders, so that would help the Avatar out too. And she was got to take Naruto home with her. That brought one thought to her head as she looked fondly at Naruto's peacefull face: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swore she'd pummle her sisters if they tried to take him from her. </span></div></div>",

A dream definitely was an apt analogy because the entire experience had seemed like a nightmare. Well most of it anyway\u2026there was still that part at end\u2026the part where Ty Lee caressed his cheeks\u2026he really liked that. The fox ninja took in his surroundings. He wasn\u2019t in prison anymore. Instead he was in a comfortable bed in what looked to be a very nice room. He wondered if maybe everything had been a dream after all. Maybe he was still in the hidden leaf village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up as he heard giggling outside the room. He watched the door open and Ty Lee walked in chuckling. She had changed her clothing and was now wearing a blue dress. Naruto was excited. Despite the fact that she was one of the people who Azula wanted to interrogate and torture him, she had been so friendly and sweet that Naruto was happy to see her. Just as he was about to run up and hug her, Naruto stopped confused. Another Ty Lee (also wearing a blue dress) had followed her into the room. She was followed by 4 more all dressed exactly the same way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked in surprise. 6 Ty Lees? No Way! Maybe his vision was blurry. He did just wake up after all and he had taken in an unhealthy amount of foot odor. Naruto rubbed his eyes. It didn\u2019t help.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six Ty Lees circled him giggling.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re cute\u201d one of them said wrapping her arms around him. Another one playfully ruffled his hair.<br>\r\n\u201cWow his hair feels so soft.\u201d She noted. \u201cAlmost like fur.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?

Ty Lee's handling him.\" Azula said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not doing a very good job of it!\" one said.

To keep herself from the idea of Azula forcing her sister to tear the so-called airbender's body apart for information, one of the six studied a bottle of elixer that she spied in the capnet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch that, its a new invention: a shrinking potion. We plan on seeding clouds with it and when it rains, our enemies'll shrink and the Fire Nation can just walk into were they live and take over easy.\" Azula said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eldest of the six thought for a moment \"Has it been teasted yet?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula shook her head, dealing with the six of them was becoming an annoyence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is our sister suppost to be interogating that boy again?\" the eldest asked, Azula told the six identical sisters about the method she was using with the foot-treatment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eldest sister nodded \"Two last questions: Can the six of us have the boy and mind if we test the shrinking potion?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula's eyes widened as it hit her why the eldest was asking so many questions...and what she was asking if she and her identical sisters do, and she liked it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee's six blue-dress-wearing identical sisters wanted to shrink down the \"airbender\" and give him the foot-stink tourture!  That was twelve feet and all of them most likly stunk and if the boy she'd captured was shrunk, he'd be overwhelmed by the stink of having Ty Lee's sister give him the foot-related torture all at once. Azula fought down a evil laugh, the \"airbender\" would be screaming to tell the Fire Nation everything he knew!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I agree, you six have to give the foot-related torture to the airbender all at once. And you need to keep in mind that the shrinking potion is still experimental, it could wear off at any time.\" Azula said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed and understood, so do we have a deal?\" the eldest sister asked</span></div></div>",

Rather hot fire and lightning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her captive cruelly. \u201cWhat would be the result on my feet if I were to perform all one hundred moves? Do you think that it would improve the quality of your torture?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was horrified as he realized that amount of training would drive the psycho chick\u2019s foot odor to a new unbearable level. Her feet would be dripping with sweat by the time she was done. Naruto struggled with all his might against the ropes but the smell of Azula\u2019s feet had weakened him. He tried drawing on the demon fox\u2019s energy but it dissipated. Apparently since Naruto\u2019s life wasn\u2019t in danger, the demon fox was content to sit back and enjoy Naruto being tortured. Once he realized he would be unable to escape, Naruto began to shake in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula watched with a sick amount of pleasure at the \u201cAirbender\u2019s\u201d increasing terror. If there was one thing she was better at than firebending it was psychological torment. She pulled her boot off of Naruto\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to deprieve you of my scent for a while but these boots will help make my feet extra sweaty.\u201d  She told him bending down to put on her boots.<br>\r\nNaruto looked at her angrily.<br>\r\n\u201cAww don\u2019t be mad,\u201d she teased him. \u201cOnce I finished practicing I\u2019ll let you smell my feet for hours\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go!!\u201d Naruto screamed at her. <br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to spend time with me\u201d Azula said giving a mock pout. \u201cI\u2019m hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUntie me and I\u2019ll spend as much time with you as you want\u201d Naruto said \u201cBeating the crap out of you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSave all that energy for sniffing my feet later.\u201d She recommended. \u201cFor now just relax and enjoy the show.\u201d<br>\r\nAzula got up and began practicing her moves performing a rather graceful series of kicks.<br>\r\nNaruto shouted after her calling her every bad name he could think of but the princess ignored him lost deep in training.<br>\r\nEventually Naruto realized his shouting was useless and gave up exhausted. He had no choice but watch his tormentor practice her routines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula made a mental note that Naruto had stopped shouting but didn\u2019t say anything instead choosing to focus on her techniques. She smiled to herself as she continued her kicks. She knew forcing her captive to watch her make her feet as gross for him as possible was a horrible torture within itself. She imagined it was like forcing a condemned man to watch his executioner sharpen the ax. She grinned as she thought about how much agony he must be in watching her prepare her feet for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched as Azula\u2019s firebending kicking techniques got more and more elaborate. She performed spin kicks and flip kicks generating blue flames and even lightning from her feet. Even Naruto had to admit that her attacks looked amazing but the thought of what was happening inside her boots sent a cold chill down his spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally two hours later Azula stopped her attacks. She was panting from going all out. She smiled evilly and slowly began to walk towards her victim. Naruto shuddered as he knew what was coming next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was new. Azula kicked off her boots and still had her smirk on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm a pyro-goddess to you am I? Well, how about I give you a sample of the fruits of my training, little one.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Naruto felt her feet plant themselves so close to his face that it seemed to him that they were tring to mirge with him. The smell was even more awful that before. All those kicks did a better job than he was afraid of.  He couldn't think, couldn't breath, or even move. The stale smell of overworked feet continues to degrade his state, the stink of which makes his determination wither. Naruto continues to shudder from having Azula's foot odor corrupt his bodily system. Naruto's mouth is filled with the vinegar taste. And his eyes were teary from the overwhelming odor thanks to forcibly enduring the hellacious torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirsty?\" Azula asked, a mock-sweetness in her tone. She forced open his mouth and poured all the built-up sweat inside her boots down his throat, forcing him to drink every last drop. Naruto let out a muffled scream that made Azula laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...how cute, you can't stand not having my feet on your face.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula put her feet back were they were. Naruto was sure as this was hell that the demon fox was loving this. That became wickedly clear as the fimmiler feel of red chakra gathered at on place: His nose, making his sinse of smell god-only-knew how sharper. Naruto passed out, he couldn't stand it.   </span></div></div>",

His worst fears confirmed, Naruto looks up at Azula\u2019s smiling face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat cage is built to withstand attack from even the most powerful airbenders\u201d She tells him grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not an airbender.\u201d Naruto whines. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d Azula says. \u201cI\u2019m having too much fun torturing you to stop even if you did confess everything now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shuddered. The more he become familiar with Azula\u2019s tortures, the less he looked forward to seeing how she could top herself torturing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula bent down by Naruto\u2019s cage an amused smile on her face. <br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea how bored I was until you woke up. That was very inconsiderate of you passing out on me like that.\u201d She lectured him clicking her tongue. \u201cBut at least it gave me the time to think up new ways of making your life miserable. Do you want to hear what I came up with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I say no would it make a difference,\u201d Naruto said dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula briefly wondered if Naruto was related to the boomerang kid that traveled with the Avatar before ignoring his snide remark and continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know growing up I had all the material objects I ever wanted. But traveling around a lot, I never really got to have a pet\u201d Azula told him tugging on his leash.<br>\r\nNaruto could see where this was going. He already had a collar around his neck. No way he thought\u2026she wouldn\u2019t. Then again he realized...she was evil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI always wanted a puppy\u201d Azula continued to talk in a classic rant that all villains are inherently gifted with. \u201cSomething that would look up at me with devotion and loyally lick my feet no matter what I did to it. Unfortunately even when I was allowed to have one, the thing would always be afraid of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGee I wonder why Naruto thought. You\u2019re so charming in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean you light the thing\u2019s tail on fire and suddenly it doesn\u2019t want to be around you.\u201d She said acting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment gave Naruto a vivid description of what being Azula\u2019s pet would be like and he began to pull at his collar in a useless attempt to get it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cFortunately you came along.\u201d Azula informed him \u201cAfter you passed out from our little torture session, I decided you\u2019d make a great pet for my feet. I\u2019ll take care of you and you\u2019ll be devoted to me for it. We\u2019ll play games. I\u2019ll teach you tricks. Of course I\u2019m still gonna torture you but you\u2019ll learn to deal with it\u2026well eventually anyway. It will be perfect\u201d<br>\r\nShe grinned as she thought how humiliating this idea was for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn\u2019t want to be anybody\u2019s pet but the idea of belonging to this woman particularly frightened him. He doubted she was as compassionate an owner as Kakashi or Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be your pet\u201d he said adamantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so cute that you think you have a choice.\u201d Azula laughed. She was going to enjoy humiliating him.</span></div></div>",

She looked at Naruto grinning. \u201cAny suggestions?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNaruto decided not to play her game. He just clenched his teeth and glared at her. This was fine for Azula who was more than happy to offer suggestions of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see Appa, Momo, and Zuzu are taken\u201d Azula says wondering aloud \u201cWhat else can I name you?\u201d   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe marking on Naruto\u2019s face give her an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about I call you whiskers?

Naruto begins to cough and gag. Azula\u2019s feet smelled as awful as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill can\u2019t get used to the smell huh?\u201d Azula laughs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe makes him smell her boot for five minutes.

The idea of smelling Azula\u2019s boots the entire night is too terrifying a prospect for him and he reluctantly submits to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be good.\u201d He finally says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smiles with glee. She feels a rush of power in getting her new pet to accept his role. She decides to see whether he\u2019ll really behave himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me pet your head,\u201d She orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumilated Naruto bends his head down tears running down his face.<br>\r\nAzula gently rubs her hands through his hair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere there\u201d she says stroking him gently.

Seems you like my feet don't you my little pet.\" Azula said as her feet rested on her pet's face, she was delighted at the muffled screams that she heard.

What was this made of?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, change into this.\" Azula said pleasently, tossing him a red one-peice, spandex leotard with strips of cloth tied to it so it looked like it had streamers sewn on it, it looked like a red virsion Gai and Lee's outfit. Not wanting to upset his owner, he did as he was told, after making an understandable request: that he could change in a seprit room. Azula agreed, but had him leave on the leash and collar. Whiskers came back out, dressed in the outfit, what was that smell on it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhiskers fallowed his owner and saw she had a large hoop set up in the middle of the cortyard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azula! Hi!\" a cheerful voice called and a girl in pink with a poneytail bounced into the cortyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ty Lee.\" Azula said happly with a smile on her face. Ty Lee's good mood crashed into a brick wall and died, Azula? being happy? and she was SMILING? This was bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...um...whoes this?\" Ty Lee asked, nodding at the one who was attached to Azula via a collar and leash. She could guess who he was already: in trouble. Azula being pleasent and that silly-looking outfit along with the hoop in the cortyard had her guess that much. The poor boy looked scared, and she didn't blame him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ty Lee, meet my new pet, Whiskers.\" Azula said plesently, her cheer doubling and making Ty Lee's blood freeze, it was obvious Azula had re-named this poor kid, and were she had gotten the idea from, those marks on his cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...um...Whiskers...er...what are you doing here?\" Ty lee asked, she had a bad feeling, and two little voices were currently having an argument in her head, one marked \"DO THE RIGHT THING\" that wanted her to help Azula's pet  get away and the other was marked \"SANITY\" thay was saying she shouldn't risk Azula's wrath to help him. He looked over at Azula, saying everything he needed to without opening his mouth. Azula was who knew what was going on, not him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of having him do the ring of fire, that outfit was dipped in lamp oil along with the cloth streamers.\" The boy looked like he wanted to throw himself at Ty Lee and beg for help. Again, Ty Lee didn't blame him, memories of how Azula \"persuaded\" her to join her and Mai flashing through her head and the two voices in her head began screaming themselves horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula lit the ring and took off the leash, leaving just the coller, then ordered him to jump through. Ty Lee couldn't watch. She turned away. with only one thought in her mind: Poor kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, or \"Whiskers\" as he was now being made to go by, did as Azula told him and...</span></div></div>",

For a brief second he considered running away but realized the courtyard was blocked off and he had nowhere to go. He had experienced Azula\u2019s punishment before and he would do anything to avoid being punished by her again. In his mind, he was also beginning to accept Azula\u2019s role as his owner. She had beaten him, she had broken him and now he belonged to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he crawled towards the hoop, he realized that just obeying his owner and jumping through the hoop wasn\u2019t enough, he had to emerge from the hoop unscathed or he would have another personal punishment session with Azula\u2019s feet. The odds however were against him considering Azula had dipped his costume in lamp oil. Even the smallest spark would cause his outfit to burst into flames. At the last second the ninja turned foot pet got his most creative idea since using a clone to form the rasengan\u2026\u2026creating a chakra shield!!! Working quickly, he gathered his chakra as he leaped through the hoop. His chakra extended around his costume preventing the cruel sparks from reaching him. To Azula\u2019s dismay, Whiskers came through the hope unharmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee who had turned away during Whisker\u2019s dangerous jump had turned back expecting to see the horrific sight of the charred remains of Azula\u2019s pet . She was surprised to see him not only alive and well, but without a burn on him. She breathed a sigh of relief, then she clapped her hands impressed with Whisker\u2019s ability to survive the ring of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job Whiskers. You\u2019re so good at tricks\u201d Ty Lee said petting his head. She really wanted to say she was happy that he survived Azula\u2019s evil game, but that was as close as she dared go to showing her support for him.  <br>\r\nWhiskers smiled happily. He looked over at his owner hoping for her approval. Pets lived to please their owners. Looking at Azula\u2019s face, he saw her eyes narrow and shuddered. She didn\u2019t look happy he had emerged unhurt. Whiskers wondered if she was going to punish him anyway. However, Azula stern expression broke into a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere Whiskers, Here Here\u201d She called. Whiskers reluctantly ran to her. Azula cupped his chin and affectionately petted his head. \u201cGood job Whiskers\u2026your owner is so proud of you.\u201d<br>\r\nNaruto felt glad. Not only had he pleased his owner, he was sure he had avoided the dreaded punishment Azula had become so good at giving him. He began to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee of course knew Azula better than that. She spotted Azula\u2019s trademark grin appear and knew bad things were in store for Whiskers. She wanted to call out and warn him but fear of Azula\u2019s wrath prevented any cry from escaping her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough\u2026Ty Lee was right. As Azula stroked her pet\u2019s head, she winked at Ty Lee before creating a spark with one of her fingers and brushing one of the streamers on Whisker\u2019s outfit. Instantly the costume burst into flames. Naruto began to howl in pain as he tried desperately to extinguish the flames covering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula laughed hysterically as Whiskers rolled around on the ground in an attempt to put out the fire scorching his body. Ty Lee covered her mouth to prevent herself from screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops!\u201d Azula giggled. \u201cLooks like I spoke too soon, it appears I get to show Ty Lee how I punish you after all.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This underground bunker (used to hide the fire lord during an emergency) was the perfect place to do that. Permission from the royal family was needed to enter this chamber and with her father away having a conference with his troops and her brother god knows where pursuing the avatar, she would have the time alone with her pet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked affectionately at Whiskers still feeling a little guilty over setting him on fire.

There was the added fact that eventhough she had burned her pet, he had come out of the pond without a mark on him. Now she had to worry about karma as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her pet look up at her inquisitively, she decided to put her thoughts on hold. If karma was after her, she would deal with it later. In any case, for now she would give cruelty a break and just have some gentle fun with her pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whiskers I want to play a game of Dragon Cards with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded. Although he was still scared of his owner, the game sounded like fun. While he was not as skilled as Shikamaru, Naruto was a mischief maker at heart and liked playing games. Plus it sure beat having to go through the ring of fire again. Azula lead Whiskers to a table and they both took a seat at opposites sides. As Azula shuffled the deck, she spoke to her pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets make this game interesting\" She said. \"If you lose, I'll punish you in my usual way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shivered then looked up at her dying to say something. Azula chuckled realizing that her pet didn't dare speak unless she gave him permission to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's on your mind Whiskers?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shouldn't I get something if I win?\" Naruto asked. He cringed thinking Azula might punish him for daring to suggest that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead she smiled before asking \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were alot of things Naruto wanted at the moment considering he was currently a pet for a girl with a penchant for sick tortures...But as he thought about it, there was one thing he wanted from his owner maybe even more than his freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's call it a request to be named later.\" He finally said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula scratched her head. Her pet was definitely up to something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" She said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course if you're not confident in your skills, I'll understand if you just want to play it safe and stick with just punishing me if I lose\" Naruto said smiling. \"After all losing to a first time player would be a sore wound in itself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crafty ninja was beginning to learn enough about his owner to know she wouldn't refuse that kind of challenge. Azula tried to make an angry face but she couldn't help admiring her opponent's guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!! Lose!!!! Dream on!!!\" She said laughing. \"You got yourself a deal but when I win I'm going to enjoy punishing you\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth players shook hands before getting the game underway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula was born lucky but Naruto is the kid everyone wants to bet on.<br>\r\nHow does the \"Dragon Cards\" game turn out?</span></div></div>",

Naruto had his two water dragons attack Azula's fire dragons, Azula couldn't beleve it. She just sat there, her eyes wide and her mouth being the envy of a wide-mouthed bass. She lost...to her own pet! It was unbelevable! Azula never lost before and Whiskers, who had never even heard of \"Dragon Cards\" beat her so...easily! Just how good WAS this guy?!?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good game, a bit too short, but still...would it be wrong to say that your amzing at this!\" Azula laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got a lucky hand.\" her pet said bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula stood up and walked over to Whiskers and planted a kiss on his forehead. Naruto blushed bright as a bonfire, it was the first time a girl had kissed him. Azula giggled at the shocked look on his face, he was just too cute when he was embarrised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got me, I'm not going to deny that you won fair and squar. What's this request of your's, Whiskers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember how I was training when you found me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm glad I found you, so?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto whent into an explination about how his life in the Leaf village was as one of Kakashi\u2019s students and how he had to grow up with no one in his life, leaving out the nine-tailed fox compleatly of course, Azula started to cry at the thought of her pet being so lonely, But more than anything, she was mad as heck at this Kakashi guy. She felt justified in beleaving Kakashi\u2019s treatment of Naruto was wrong starting from the bell test. How on earth do you expect a boy who has been ostracized by his own village to just grasp the concept of teamwork like that? Naruto\u2019s never had anyone really looking out for him, especially not his classmates. While the exercise would be understandable for Sasuke (if he weren\u2019t such a stuck up prick) as he has been pampered by his village, it makes no sense for Kakashi to reasonably expect Naruto to rely on two people who have never been there for him, i,e. Sasuke and Sakura, to help him. Naruto, despite his outgoing personality, had to learn to be a loner to survive. What kind of idiot is Kakashi not to be able to see that anyway? Next is the training. Or lack thereof. Azula made a mental list what Kakashi taught Naruto: Climbing Trees...and that\u2019s it. Kakashi regarded Sasuke more highly than Naruto, that much is pitifully obvious; as he watched Neji fight Hinata, he privately thought that not even Sasuke could stand up to him, as if that bastard set the bar for Genin standards; also when he told Naruto that he couldn\u2019t train him, he blatantly said he had more important things to take care of. How Kakashi abandoned Naruto during the one month break of the Chunin exam was more than a little messed up. Granted that things worked out for the best (with Naruto finding a stronger teacher more willing to train him) Kakashi didn\u2019t know that would happen. What exactly was better chakra control going to do to help Naruto defeat a Hyuuga prodigy!? He probably planned on Naruto losing and training him in the next exam, the bastard. First and foremost, if you can\u2019t train more than one student at once, don\u2019t take a three man squad. Secondly, Kakashi knows the Kage Bunshin. Why couldn\u2019t he have at least made one to instruct Naruto. Thirdly, and this is the kicker, he had the gall to reprimand Jiraiya for teaching Naruto the Rasengan after he had taught Sasuke the Chidori! This clearly indicates that, while he knew the technique all along, Kakashi had no plans of teaching it to Naruto because he didn\u2019t think he could handle it appropriately. What did he think Sunshine boy was going to do with the Chidori; use it as a magnetic force to attract an ice cream truck for the Konohamaru corps to have a snack!? He actually believed that Sasuke would use it to protect his fellow shinobi of the Leaf. Didn\u2019t he spend a lot of alone time with Sasuke? You\u2019d think he was a little more observant of the fact that everything Sasuke did was toward killing Itachi...especially since the prick had said that! Also, she made sure not to forget the rather ironic fact that Naruto mastered the Rasengan in roughly one month, the same amount of time taken to train for the third round...a rather obvious smear on Kakashi\u2019s poor teaching. The idiot doesn\u2019t even realize how Jiraiya taught Naruto the Rasengan because Kakashi was too busy being a dad to a pompuse ass that was just like her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...your a fighter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep...and being in that kennel  made me feel I needed a good workout, no offince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken Whiskers. So, you want to put your training to good use?\" Azula couldn't beleve her luck! She could use her pet's skills and abbilities pretty well for use aginst the Fire Nation's enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do what I can for you, after all, you are my owner!\"  Whiskers pipped up happly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy.\" Azula said, she was going to use Naruto's skills, make no mistake of that, but he wouldn't be made into a living weapon or anything like that, after all, Azula loved her new pet too much for treatment like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the meantime...rematch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula laughed affectionately and ruffled Whisker's hair <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your on.\"            </span></div></div>",

Just then, a earthquake shook the ground and the sky turned a bloody crimson and a anonized moan was heard from the very planet itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!\" Whiskers shouted, the nine-tailed fox was quick to answer, his tone was lacking it's usual blood-lust and malace, all of it replaced by urgency.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...you have to stop this spirit! a spirit must wait for the Winter Solstice unless they want to forcibly exchange the status of the living and the dead and shatter the deviding line between life and death. I can use my power to keep you uneffected by the change, but you have to beat him in some sort of duel or everyone living will die, the dead will rise and the imbalance will shatter the fabric of the world!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of duel?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANY KIND!!!

He saw that the kid, who  didn't look older than he did, create a ball of rotating spiritual energy. Aang was hit with it, the ball of energy slammed into his gut. Aang felt the ball's power torch his insides, it was an attack, no denying that. It was the size of a fist and felt like a hurricane forcing its way inside his body. Azula was likewise impressed, even simi-awake from her ansestor's doings, she was able to analyze how the attack worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So that was what he was working on when I found him. That technique grinds into whatever it touches, causing massive internal damage rather than external. I'd hate to be hit by that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang flew out of the cave and Naruto/Whiskers heard a rumble above Azula. A rock was coming loose, Aang had earthbent a rock above her. Acting on his natrual impulse to protect the ones he cared for, Naruto knocked her out of the way and the rock hit him over the head. He was out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whiskers!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Azula said, forcing her body to obey her, she rushed over to her pet and saw he wasn't hurt bad, just knocked out. She breathed a sigh of releif, She just had to wake him up, and she knew just how.

It wasn't that long ago that she wouldn't have hesitated to use whatever means necessary to defeat the avatar, but now looking at blonde ninja, she couldn't help feeling worried about him facing such a powerful enemy.

He thought if he defeated the kid it might make his owner happy and he was more than willing to risk his own safety to do it. At the same time Azula still looked very weak and Naruto didn't want to leave her alone. Maybe he should give up the chase for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?  </span></div></div>",

Naruto heard a wizzing sound and nonchalantly caoght the boomerang that had been tossed at hin between two fingers and bent it in half, dropping it to the ground, and his expression STILL looked bord. Sokka, having a fit over his boomerang charged at Naruto with his club. Quick as lightning, Naruto had his wrist and was crushing it, Sokka screamed in pain as the beast-boy kicked him in the face and tossed his out-cold form aside, even in his half-deamon state, Naruto didn't have it in him to kill anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next.\" Naruto yawned, were any of these guys going to get him to at least change the expression on his face?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitara sent spikes of ice at him.

He didn't even bother to fight the already-immbolized Aang, he just tied him and his friends up, changed back to normal and got ready to take them all back to Azula.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Azula smiled as she considered what type of mental game to play with her pet. There was something that she was dying to try with him but she wasn\u2019t sure he would go for: a Mental Agni-Kai. This type of mental duel was something that only the most experienced firebenders challenged each other with because the stakes were very high. Not only would the participants of this duel be mentally tired out by the end of it, but they basically put their greatest secrets at risk by competing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mental Agni-Kai basically allowed the competitors to see into each other\u2019s souls. That was part of the reason Azula wanted to try this with Naruto. The Ninja fascinated her and she cared about him a great deal, but at the same time she didn\u2019t understand him at all. What type of person would save her life after she had cruelly tortured him? Why would he stay with a cruel owner like her when he clearly had the power within him to escape? How did he really feel about her? This game was a chance for her to get to know him personally and understand what makes him tick. Azula looked at Naruto wondering if he would be willing to compete. She supposed that if she really wanted too, she could order her pet to engage in this duel. If she could get him to sniff her feet or jump through fire on command, it would be easy for her to force him to play. The problem with that she was beginning to care too much about him to violate his personal thoughts and secrets without his consent. She would tell him the facts first and only go through with it if Naruto was willing to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhiskers, come here\u201d Azula said signaling her pet to take a seat next to her. Without any hesitation, Naruto sat next to Azula and snuggled against his owner\u2019s shoulder like an affectionate puppy dog. Azula smiled thinking about how the ninja made a cute pet. She hugged him tightly before continuing. \u201cThere is one mind game in particular that I would like to play with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat set up the board,\u201d Naruto said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula laughed. <br>\r\n\u201cNo it\u2019s not like that silly! Let me tell you about it first and then you decide whether you want to play or not.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to challenge you to a mental Agni Kai,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA mental what?\u201d Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgni Kai. But we could call it a mental duel if that\u2019s easier for you to remember.\u201d Azula said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a battle between two opponents\u2019 minds. The goal of the game is to penetrate your opponents\u2019 mental defenses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was intrigued.<br>\r\n\u201cHow does that work?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell using a special technique, firebenders can gain access into another person\u2019s mind,\u201d Azula said. \u201cIt only works if the person is willing to let them do it though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026isn\u2019t there a small problem with that?\u201d Naruto interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m not a firebender.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I know that,\u201d Azula chuckled. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto decided it was best not to bring up how she mistook him for an airbender when they first met. Instead he allowed Azula to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can use the technique to give you access to my mind as well\u201d She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh,\u201d Naruto said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula went on.  \u201cWhen our minds are linked, you\u2019ll be able to see any of my thoughts, memories, or secrets that you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally\u2026Cool!!!!\u201d Naruto said excited. He liked the idea of seeing Azula\u2019s intimate thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smiled. She loved the way Naruto could easily become really energetic.<br>\r\n\u201cEasy Whiskers! That\u2019s only if I allow you too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I did say this was a game right?\u201d Azula reminded him. \u201cI\u2019m obviously going to try to prevent you from doing that. You\u2019ll probably want to do the same as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026You\u2019d be able to see into my mind too?!!!!!!\u201d Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh course! That\u2019s the whole point!! Why is there something embarrassing you don\u2019t want me to see?\u201d  Azula asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s eyes shifted back and forth. He did have his share of embarrassing moments. Among them was his first kiss with Sasuke. Rather than answer Azula, Naruto decided to distract her by asking another question. \u201cHow do I prevent you from seeing into my mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula caught onto what Naruto was doing but she answered his question anyway.<br>\r\n\u201cWell while our minds are linked like that. I can basically show you anything I want and Vice versa. If I wanted to, I could make you think you were boiling in oil and you can do that to me as well.\u201d<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n \u201cOh so it\u2019s like genjitsu\u201d Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh that mental illusion jitsu you told me about,\u201d She said. \u201cYes\u2026I guess you can say that. Basically we\u2019ll try to use mental images to force each other to submit and drop our guard.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u201d Naruto said considering. The game sounded challenging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course if you do decide to drop your mental guard. I\u2019ll be able to see whatever secret or personal thought of yours that I want to. It will work the same way for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo if I dropped my guard, you would be able to see all my thoughts?\u201d Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell only one thought or secret at a time.\u201d Azula said. \u201cYou\u2019d be able to see my thoughts and secrets as well but only if you are able to beat me.\u201d <br>\r\nThe fire princess smiled giving Naruto a teasing look like that was never going to happen.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNaruto scratched his head. He liked a challenge and he wanted to please his owner, but at the same time there were some personal thoughts that he had that he didn\u2019t want Azula to see. Also knowing that Azula had a sadistic streak to her, Naruto wasn\u2019t crazy about letting Azula show him whatever mental images she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula saw Naruto thinking it over and gently squeezed his shoulder. <br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d She told him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to force you. If there are some secrets you don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing with me, we could always play something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled. Azula had softened a lot since she originally captured him. What does he decide to do? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t think you have to do it to please me.\u201d Azula told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I wanna find out what your greatest secret is,\u201d Naruto said giving a sneaky grin like he was about to pull off Kakashi\u2019s mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula laughed. Her pet was really good at making her seem at ease. <br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s only if you can beat me! And trust me that\u2019s not gonna happen!!\u201d<br>\r\nShe playfully ruffled the ninja\u2019s hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet it\u2019s that you like playing with dolls as a little girl.\u201d Naruto teased her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIck. Only setting them on fire,\u201d Azula said trying her best to scowl. She couldn\u2019t hold it for long and quickly broke out into a smile. Not wanting Naruto to get the last word in, she quickly added \u201cAnd just for that\u2026let\u2019s make this game have the same stakes as last time. That way I can torture you in addition to learning your secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat cause there\u2019s another request I\u2019ve been thinking of asking you to fulfill for me.\u201d Naruto told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother request?\u201d Azula asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! You\u2019ll find out when I win!!!\u201d Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula giggled and shook her head. <br>\r\n\u201cDream on!\u2026Alright let\u2019s get started. I still have to teach you how to play the game.\u201d<br>\r\nIn must cases Azula would take advantage of her opponent\u2019s inexperience but Naruto was a special case. She wanted to play fair with him. She would show him how to guard his mind and knowing Naruto\u2019s ability to pick up games really fast\u2026they would be evenly matched in this duel. She looked at her pet. \u201cAre you ready Whiskers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula got up and lit a fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto got a little concerned. \u201cAzula you\u2019re still pretty weak\u2026are you sure you should be firebending?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAzula nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m only using a little bit of power.\u201d <br>\r\nShe sat down on one side of the fire and motioned for Naruto to sit down on the other side. Naruto did as he was asked. Azula slowly begin to control the flame\u2019s movements making the fire look like it was dancing around. Azula looked back up at Naruto.<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026now I need you to stare into my eyes. Try and concentrate on reflection of the flame.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and did what the fire princess told him to. Azula\u2019s eyes were one of her most exotic features. They were a bright amber color and despite the coldness they usually projected, they had a beautiful depth to them that anyone who could withstand her fierce stare would get lost in. As Naruto watched the reflection of the fire dance across her eyes, he felt like his soul was being drawn into hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smiled. She was staring into Naruto\u2019s eyes as well and felt the same pull on her soul. <br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s working.\u201d She announced. \u201cJust make sure you don\u2019t break my gaze.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOk,\u201d Naruto mumbled. He wasn\u2019t sure he could look away even if he tried to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Azula said. \u201cNow why don\u2019t you try projecting an image into my head. Concentrate on something that you want me to see.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought for a second and focused on the first image that popped into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula was instantly able to see it and smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t you think about anything besides Ramen?\u201d She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto chuckled. \u201cCouldn\u2019t help it. I\u2019m pretty hungry. But this technique is pretty cool. I didn\u2019t think it would work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it works.\u201d Azula said clicking her tongue. \u201cOk let me try and project an image into your head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gave a nod. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula focused an image in her mind.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat image are you seeing?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA dragon?\u201d Naruto said unsure if that was what he was supposed to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d Azula said. \u201cIt seems to be working. Remember that when you are projecting images into my head. You are actually protecting your mind from me seeing what\u2019s inside it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it!\u201d Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be doing the same thing to you as well.\u201d Azula explained. \u201cIf at any time you can\u2019t take any more of my mental imagery\u2026just relax your concentration and think of the color white and I\u2019ll know to stop. That will be the equivalent of giving up. Ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk!\u201d Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s basically it. Are you ready to start?\u201d Azula asked.<br>\r\n\u201cReady!\u201d Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Azula started the duel and everything went black.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just want you to remember that any tortures you go through aren\u2019t real and that no matter how much pain you are feeling\u2026WHEN you give up, you\u2019ll be totally fine again\u201d Azula reminded him. \u201cBut that said, I\u2019m going to mentally torture you until you beg for mercy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped. \u201cWhat do you plan to do to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smiled \u201cI always wondered what cooked pet tasted like! I think I\u2019ll try barbecuing you first before breaking out some other special tortures I have planned just for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shivered. \u201cDid anyone ever tell you\u2019re sick!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula giggled and tossled her pet\u2019s hair. \u201cAll the time. Anyway, check this out!\u201d<br>\r\nThe fire princess snapped her fingers again and this time Naruto found himself chained to a barbecue grill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow you\u2019re pretty good at this\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course!! I\u2019m a champion when it comes to mental duels.\u201d Azula said proudly. \u201cAll the more reason that you should give up now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-Uh\u201d Naruto said. \u201cNot when I have the chance to find out your deepest secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026you\u2019d better hope whatever mental images you are showing me beats this\u201d Azula said lighting the grill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw! It\u2019s hot!\u201d Naruto said wincing in pain. Despite the fact that the flame underneath him was a figment of Azula\u2019s imagination, it definitely felt very real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said\u2026I play for keeps.\u201d Azula said \u201cRemember all you have to do to get out of here is think of the color white.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned. He was beginning to think that he may have accepted more than he could handle by agreeing to Azula's challenge. The fire princess' need to win had definitely brought out her sadistic streak. Still, if he could hold out a little bit more, he might be able to win this. After all he was projecting his own mental images toward Azula as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he give up?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto concentrated very hard. Despite the fact that he felt like he was on fire, he knew the flames weren\u2019t real. Fortunately, his Ninja training came in handy. Genjitsu was a popular attack technique among ninjas and he was used to protecting himself against it. While in most cases it was usually possible to break out of technique, Jiraiya had prepared him for the rare situation where he would have no choice but to endure the illusion technique to the end. Focusing his mind the way he did in his training, Naruto mentally endured the searing flames the same way he would endure a genjitsu attack.   <br>\n<br>\nAfter what seemed like an hour of being barbecued alive, Naruto heard Azula applaud. <br>\n\u201cVery impressive Whiskers,\u201d She said petting his head. \u201cNot everyone can withstand the feeling of being burnt alive for so long.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nNaruto groaned in acknowledgment. It was taking all his concentration not to give up. C\u2019mon, he thought, Azula is going through mental torture as well\u2026I just need to outlast her.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t really think that I would leave things there\u2026did you?\u201d Azula said smiling. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to kick things up a notch.\u201d<br>\nThe grill disappeared and Naruto found himself sitting in front of Azula looking at her boots. Grinning, the fire nation princess sat down and stretched her legs towards him. \u201cYou knew this was coming\u2026didn\u2019t you?\u201d She said.<br>\n<br>\nNaruto frowned. He couldn\u2019t say it was a surprise but he was definitely hoping that his owner had forgotten about his aversion towards her feet.<br>\n\u201cI suspected.\u201d He grumbled. \u201cI was just hoping it wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nAzula shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t press such an obvious advantage\u201d She said giggling. <br>\n<br>\n\u201cRats!\u201d Naruto said as Azula placed her booted feet in his lap.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take off my boots for me?\u201d Azula suggested with a sneaky smile on her face.<br>\n<br>\nRobotically, Naruto reached for Azula\u2019s boots. Not good, he thought. Apparently while he was inside Azula\u2019s mind, the fire princess could control his every action. He really hoped that Azula was on the verge of giving up because he doubted he could withstand this particular torture for very long. After a little bit of tugging, Azula\u2019s boots popped off and Naruto once again found himself closer than he ever wanted to be to Azula\u2019s sweaty bare feet.  The fire princess wiggled her toes and slowly brought them to her pet\u2019s face. Naruto coughed. Azula had managed to recreate her special form of torture in her mind perfectly right down to the smell.<br>\n<br>\nAzula chuckled as she saw Naruto\u2019s reaction. Now that she had revealed her secret weapon, Naruto didn\u2019t stand a chance.<br>\n\u201cYou should just give up now,\u201d She suggested as she began rubbing her feet against his face. <br>\n<br>\nNaruto shook his head. Despite the fact that he was already feeling pretty sick, he was determined to hold out for as long as he could.<br>\n<br>\nAzula smiled. The leaf ninja was really something. Even when the cards were heavily stacked against him\u2026he still was determined to fight it out.<br>\n\u201cOk,\u201d She said gently stroking his face with her toes. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll have to play with you a bit more!\u201d <br>\n<br>\nHow does the fire nation attempt to win the duel?</span></div></div>",

She'd gotten overconfidant and hadn't noticed the light, fingertip-like pressure against her mind.<br>\n<br>\nThat was when she saw Naruto rise from where the flames had been. Azula sighed in relief and then as he bunny-hopped out of the smoke from the flames, she noticed Whiskers was different.<br>\n<br>\nNaruto's skin had turned a pale bluish color, almost a blue-gray. Naruto's costume consisted of blood-red socks, black slippers, loose black trousers, a long-sleeved black tunic with red cuffs and a black, high-collared, sleeveless overtunic with red trim. A wide red sash/belt kept the overtunic in place.Naruto also wore a black Mandarin-styled hat topped with a red ball and trim. He now sported claws on both his hands and feet. His canines had also lengthened and turned into fangs, while his whisker-marks had grown wider, darker and more pronounced until they looked more like tattoos than birth-scars. His eyes had been the greatest change as his once soulful blue eyes had changed becoming blood red with an animalistic black slit for the pupil and black rings appeared around his eyes. And his lips had turned pitch black.<br>\n<br>\nAzula turned as pale as much as her uncle loved tea and Pai Sho. Of all things, Whiskers just HAD to turn himself into THAT to counter her advantage over him!<br>\n<br>\nA Jiang Shi!<br>\n<br>\nAzula was terrified of Jiang Shi! She'd heard the story of the hopping, chi-draining vampires when she was two years old and she'd had nightmares about the creatures until she was nine! A full SEVEN YEARS without being able to sleep or even shut her eyes for even a single second!<br>\n<br>\nWhat made them worse for benders was that Jiang Shi fed off chi and therefore could literally EAT whatever a bender tried to use on them!<br>\n<br>\nWhiskers bunny-hopped towards Azula once, tilted his head to the side and looked at her a moment as she stood there trembling before he said one word, giving her a good look at his fangs as he opened his mouth.<br>\n<br>\n\"Chi!\"<br>\n<br>\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"</span></div></div>",

That wouldn't do at all. The grill suddenly vanished under Naruto and he fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if you thought I was cute at this age my pet.\" kid-Azula said, frowning cutely at him with her hands on her hips as Naruto turned rightside-up. Naruto formed a blindfold out of thin air and tied it around his head so he couldn't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't deserve to see someone that cute.\" he said just as the younger version of his owner was trying to think of how big she wanted the mallet she planed on wacking him with for bilndfolding himself would be. She giggled at her pet and hugged him...with strangth equal to Sasuke's ego-problem. Clearly, Azula enjoyed having people underestamate her when she was this young so she could rub beating them at anything in they're faces. The face that she'd used the mental duel to give herself superstrangth when she had made herself younger was proof of that. Naruto gasped for air and squrmed in her grip, but even when his body was as thin as a peice of thread were kid-Azula was hugging him, he didn't break in half or anything like that like he was expecting to. She liked hugging him too much at this age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid-Azula then grabbed Naruto and squished him into a big mountain of what he guessed was play-dough, his mistress entertained herself by twisting and packing him into variouse shapes then when she was done, Naruto was turned back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like being this young when I'm playing this mental duel with you Whiskers, I'm staying this age until one of us wins this challenge and every time we have a mental duel from now on.\" kid-Azula told him as she stuck Naruto in a apple-sized bubble so that his body was forcibly took the round shape and his face pressed aginst the inside of the round object she'd stuffed in in as she rolled him around and juggled him around like a soccer player. Naruto felt ill when kid-Azula took him out and stuck her hand inside of his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to take away your fun, my little misstress, so play with me as much as you want for as long as you feel like.\" Naruto said, but it was acctualy the pint-sized pyromanic useing him like a hand-puppet that caused him to say that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKid-Azula blushed and looked at her pet fondly \"Awwwww...that's so sweet of you Whiskers! Ok, I'll play with you for as long as I want.\" then the little monster grinned, a flicker of how Azula was when her and Naruto had first met \"Too bad for you, the more I play with you, the more I want to play with you for even longer!!!!\" she cackled, it sounding out of place comming from a child.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried to think of the color white, but never got it, it seemed that kid-Azula had blocked out his ability to give up and let her know when she had won until she'd had her fill of being able to do anything she wanted to him in this game when she had her hand up his back, little kids never wanted it to end when they were having fun with something. Naruto found himself Azula would change back, he'd been right, shw really WAS worse when she'd been younger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nkid-Azula thought for a moment about what to do with Whiskers and nodded to herself as she decided on what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

Slowly the environment around her began to form. The darkness didn\u2019t completely disappear but there was enough light around her for the fire nation princess to make out where she was. Judging from the stone walls around her and the iron bars in front of her, she guessed that she was in some type of dungeon.  Well\u2026it looked like a dungeon anyway. She was right outside of a huge iron gate. Two torches on either side of the gate provided the only sources of light in the room. Looking at the gate gave Azula an uncomfortable feeling. It felt like she was staring into the gateway toward hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I got to hand it to you fox-boy,\u201d She said aloud. \u201cYou certainly know how to create a creepy atmosphere but don\u2019t expect to beat me with special effects\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response Azula heard a cruel laugh that caused her to shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto?\u201d She called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo red eyes glowed through the gate.<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\"> <b> \u201cAh, Fresh meat!!!\u201d</b></span>   An evil voice growled. <b><span class=\"cred\"> \u201cYou look awfully tasty little girl.\u201d</span> </b>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula\u2019s heart beat fast.

Which, judging from your reaction is becoming increasingly less likely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned. He didn\u2019t know how the demon fox had gotten loose but he definitely wasn\u2019t responsible for it. Since the Kyuubi was unpredictable and extremely violent, he wouldn\u2019t think about using it in a mental duel against a friend. Also the demon fox was the one thing about himself that he had intentionally kept a secret from Azula. When he had first met her and she was\u2026well a sadistic psycho\u2026there was no question about keeping such dangerous knowledge from her. However, even though she had softened quite a bit since then, Naruto still couldn\u2019t bring himself to tell her. A part of him wanted to share his secret with his new friend (maybe that was why he agreed to this mind game so willingly) but another part of him was horrified over the way she might react. His own village had pretty much ostracized him because of the demon within him, while his enemies wanted to rip that power from him. Azula was capable of reacting either of those two ways. He hoped that his friendship with his owner had changed her and that she wouldn\u2019t see him as a source of power\u2026but did he really know her that well? Even more terrifying was the thought that his new friend would hate him because of it. After all, the demon fox had almost eaten her. If she discovered his unique connection to the monster...she might not want anything to do with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto knew that now that the Ninetails was roaming free in his mind, he was going to have to tell Azula about it eventually. Still...he couldn\u2019t bring himself to tell her just yet. He decided to change the subject for now. <br>\r\n\u201cNope that wasn\u2019t me!! I had something else in mind for getting you to give up.\u201d He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula took the bait.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026what exactly?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled \u201cTickle torture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were going to tickle me into submission,\u201d Azula said raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I had to win somehow,\u201d Naruto said sheepishly \u201cI was all set to ambush you, tie you down and tickle you good when I heard you scream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Azula said. \u201cWell you got there just in time. One more second and that thing would have eaten me.\" The princess looked at the Ninja seriously. \"Naruto...Thanks for saving my life again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over, Azula kissed the ninja on the cheek. Naruto blushed and hugged her tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m around\u2026I\u2019ll always protect you.\u201d He promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite, the pain in her shoulder, Azula couldn\u2019t help smiling as she heard that. If anyone else had made that promise to her, she would have met that statement with sarcasm, disbelief and contempt. Yet somehow when Naruto said it, it made her feel warm inside. She gently wrapped her arms around Naruto returning his hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn evil laugh interrupted them.<br>\r\n\u201c<span class=\"cred\"><b>AWWWW I HATE TO BREAK UP THIS TOUCHING SCENE. BUT I STILL HAVEN\u2019T EATEN</b></span>\u201d A menacing voice growled.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two of them turned to see the demon fox glaring at them. Naruto quickly pushed Azula away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRun!\u201d Naruto said. \u201cI\u2019ll try and hold him off as long as I can\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you think I\u2019m leaving you alone with that thing...you\u2019re crazy!!!\u201d Azula said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto frowned gathering his chakra.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right behind you!\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Demon Fox snickered. \u201c<span class=\"cred\"><b>YOU\u2019RE ACTUALLY THINKING OF TAKING ME ON BRAT? I THOUGHT YOU OF ALL PEOPLE WOULD KNOW HOW USELESS THAT IS. YOU\u2019RE WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE!!!!</b></span>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grimaced. The fox was right. He was totally outmatched but he still had to try. He had just promised Azula that he would protect her and he wasn\u2019t about to go back on his word.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cTajuu kage bushin no jitsu!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula watched in amazement as hundreds of Naruto clones appeared. She had never seen that technique performed before and it was an impressive sight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly grabbed Azula\u2019s arm pulling her away as waves of clones charged towards the demon fox. \u201cC\u2019mon Azula, this technique probably won\u2019t even slow him down.\u201d<br>\r\nThe two of them began running. In the distance Naruto could hear the popping sounds his clones made upon disappearing. It sounded like they were being eliminated one hundred at a time. He pressed Azula to run faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***Ten minutes later***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula panted heavily as she rushed alongside Naruto. She moved pretty fast but she couldn\u2019t keep up with the Ninja\u2019s speed. They were in a forest now. Azula didn\u2019t recognize it at all but Naruto seemed to move around it like he know where he was. She guessed that this place was familiar to him. Maybe he was picturing it in his mind. She wondered what else he was subconsciously picturing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto stop a second.\u201d She said. \u201cI can\u2019t keep up with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stop!!!\u201d Naruto said frantically tugging Azula\u2019s arm. \u201cIf we do\u2026he\u2019ll get us!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto do you know this monster?\u201d Azula asked. She had never seen the Ninja so terrified before. Having met the demon, she couldn\u2019t say she blamed him but she sensed that something else was scaring him about the monster. Something that he was hiding from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paused before nodding slowly. <br>\r\n\u201cA little too well,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that thing?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy worst nightmare!\u201d He said slowly. \u201cC\u2019mon we have to hurry!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s definitely not telling me something, Azula thought. She wanted to press him on it but now wasn\u2019t the time. Instead she nodded and the two of them ran further into the woods.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sky darkened as Naruto and Azula ran through the woods. It was clear that a vicious battle was being fought behind them the likes of which neither of them had ever seen before. Both of them were focused on one thing\u2026getting as far away from there as possible and neither of them dared turn to witness what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when he felt the ground tremble underneath them like a massive earthquake had struck that Naruto couldn\u2019t resist looking behind him to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026?!\u201d He said, turning to see a 600 long X 600 tall Iron wall sizzling with energy cutting across the ground behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto Watch Out!!!!\u201d Azula (who hadn\u2019t bothered to turn around) screamed pointing in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Bam!!!</b>  Naruto looked back ahead just in time to notice the tree in front of him and slam into it face first. The speed and force with which he charged into it caused him to tumble backwards bumping into Azula (who had been running right behind him) and causing them both to hit the floor hard.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOw!!\u201d Naruto groaned sitting up. He was still a little dizzy from hitting the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand reached towards him and helped him up. Naruto looked up to see the man who had saved him from being devoured by the Ninetails a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded. Staring at the man in white, the energetic Ninja was unusually at a lose for words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man moved toward Azula and helped her up too. Azula gave him a nod of thanks.  Minato looked at the two of them. \u201cI suggest that we continue to get as far away from here as possible.\u201d He told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them argued with him and the three began running further into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Naruto asked finally finding his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato looked at them \u201cI used a jutsu known as Heaven\u2019s gate!\u201d he explained. \u201cIt creates a barrier that can even repel Bij\u016b.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto scratched his head. There was something about the man in white that seemed very familiar to him. Something pleasant. Almost like a dream or distant memory that he had trouble recalling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve met you before\u2026?\u201d Naruto said rubbing his forehead trying to remember. He asked it like a question but he knew it was true. Somehow he knew. Naruto wished he could remember. He wanted to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man simply nodded. \u201cYes a long time ago,\u201d he said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d Naruto asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief second the man looked at Naruto like he wanted to say something. There were a million things he wanted to say. A million things he wanted to tell him. He wanted Naruto to know the connection between them. A connection he valued more than anything. He wanted to let his son know that he was proud of him. That he was sorry for leaving him and most of all he wanted to tell Naruto how much he loved him. Unfortunately as so often seemed the case, time was not on his side. Sighing, he took his eyes off his son to focus on the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u2026no time to reminisce,\u201d The Man in white said. \u201cThat jutsu won\u2019t hold him for long so I\u2019m going to have to make this quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost in response to the 4th Hokage\u2019s statement, the sound of thunder was heard as the demon fox attacked the gate pounding it from the outside. The gate shook violently looking like it would give way at any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato frowned. \u201cListen carefully because I probably won\u2019t get the chance to explain this again. Engaging in a mental duel was a bad idea because unlike a normal person, you share your consciousness with another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto suddenly understood. \u201cYou mean the Kyuubi?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 4th Hokage nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyuubi?\u201d Azula said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grimaced. Now was definitely not the time to discuss his secret with her. \u201cThat thing,\u201d He said pointing at the gate. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have to fill you in on it later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula reluctantly nodded. She was curious but realized that there were bigger things at stake to be worried about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Minato went on. \u201cWhen Azula locked your minds in a mental duel, it allowed the Demon Fox\u2019s consciousness to surface and now\u2026it\u2019s fighting for control of your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato glanced at the two of them \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you that if it wins out it will be very bad do I?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThey both shook their head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 4th hokage managed a weak smile. \u201cGood!\u201d<br>\r\nThere was another thunderclap at the gate. This time it began to crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs informative as this is turning out,\u201d Azula said. \u201cI\u2019m less concerned with how that thing escaped and more concerned with how to stop it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop it in the conventional sense,\u201d Minato explained. \u201cWhat you need to do is try to end the duel. It should return things to normal\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula scowled. \u201cYeah well\u2026Newsflash blondie. I tried that already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fourth Hokage shook his head. \u201cSince you are locked in Naruto\u2019s subconscious, Naruto has to be the one to get you out of here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at the fox ninja. Nodding, Naruto tried thinking of the color white but nothing happened.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore pounding\u2026the crack was visibly bigger.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not working!!\u201d Azula said frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato sighed. \u201cIt looks like the demon fox is using its powers to suppress your thoughts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d  Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato considered. \u201cYou need to head to the center of your subconscious.\u201d He told Naruto.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThe center of my subconscious?\u201d Naruto repeated giving him a blank expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fourth Hokage smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s the location where your mind will be strongest.\u201d He explained. \u201cWith a little luck that should provide the extra mental boost that will allow you to escape from here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pounding and cracking got louder. The three continued to run through the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat so how do we get there?\u201d The boy asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt not quite that simple,\u201d Minato said. \u201cFirst you have to figure out where there is. The center of your subconscious would be a place that you have a deep emotional attachment towards; a place that you would call your home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto considered carefully. \u201cThe only place I can really say that about is Konoha village. I\u2019ve lived there all my life.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded. \u201cThen that is where you should be headed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how do I get there?\u201d Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 4th looked at him calmly. \u201cNaruto, this is your mind. Whether you realize it or not\u2026you know where everything is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating, Naruto looked towards the south east. \u201cI think it\u2019s that way.\u201d  he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"> BANG!!!!!!!!!!</font></b>  A hole appeared in the gate and from the distance the group could see a malevolent eye peering through at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 4th hokage nodded to Naruto and Azula. \u201cYou two go on ahead\u2026I\u2019ll try to hold him off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked worried. He didn\u2019t know why but he didn\u2019t want the man to leave him. \u201cYou can\u2019t take on the Kyuubi alone\u2026he\u2019s too strong!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato waved him off.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me\u2026I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto still looked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 4th Hokage lightly tipped Naruto\u2019s chin. \u201cBelieve it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about the warm look in the man\u2019s eyes made Naruto trust him and he consented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato looked at Azula. \u201cKeep on eye on him for me! He\u2019s a handful\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Naruto left, he turned to ask the man in white one more question. \u201cIf this is my mind\u2026How are you able to be here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato smiled. \u201cWhile the Demon Fox exists in your soul\u2026I guess you could say I exist in your heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled. Somehow that cryptic remark made him feel happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 4th leaned in to whisper to Naruto. \u201cWhen you get back to Konoha\u2026the real Konoha that is.

Eventhough the demon fox had intervened and prevented him from getting seriously hurt, he was still sore all over from the fire and unable to get away as Azula sat down and moved her feet towards him. <br>\r\nTy Lee was shocked as she realized what punishment Azula had in mind for Naruto. On the road she had shared a room with Azula and  knew the result of  Azula removing her boots. The smell that filled the room was unbearable.

Maybe she misjudged Azula. That heart inside the princess' body might do more than pump blood.<br>\r\n\"Besides it would be much more fun if you made my pet smell your feet as punishment,\" Azula told her with an evil grin.<br>\r\nTy Lee frowned. \"There's no way I'm going to do that\" She said finally directly standing up to Azula.<br>\r\n\"If you don't, I'll punish him anyway after I make YOU do the hoop of fire\" Azula said giving her a look that showed she wasn't playing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee gave Naruto an apologetic look. \"Sorry Whiskers\" She said sadly.<br>\r\nShe wanted to help him, she really did.

Ty Lee's head was buzzing about Naruto, she had to find out more about him. She got up in the middle of the night and looked over at the figure shifting underneath the sheets, blonde hair all that was visible. She tip-toed over to him and pulled the sheet away. The first thing she noticed were the marks on each cheek that greatly resembled whiskers, the ones that inspired Azula to re-name him. Maybe they were some kind of birthmark? She didn\u2019t know, all she did know was she had to touch them. Letting her curiosity get the best of her, she gently pressed her hand against his right cheek and ran her fingers over the grooves of each mark. She found them to actually be very soft and kind of nice to touch. She was taken aback for a moment when the boy in her hand subconsciously nuzzled his cheek against her hand, seeking more comfort from her fingers\u2019 gentle touch. A small smile graced her lips as she resumed gently rubbing his cheek. She then took notice of his somewhat long, shaggy blonde hair. It was pretty matted and messy, she wondered when the last time it had seen a brush was. Slowly running her left hand through it, the texture of his hair was something she had never really felt before. It reminded her of a mixture between hair and fur. It, like everything else about the boy was odd, but not unpleasantly so. Ty Lee couldn\u2019t help but smirk a little bit when she heard the boy started to make a low rumbling noise in his chest that sounded awfully a lot like a purr. A curious idea began to form in her mind that she just had to try out. Stopping her ministrations on his cheek and scalp, she was delighted for some unknown reason when she heard what sounded like a small pitiful whimper from him. Was her touch really having that much of an effect on him? Ty Lee amused herself with him for a few more hours, delighted at having him around. She whent to bed eventualy and when she woke up, Naruto was moaning. Worried, Ty Lee stepped forward and pulled the sheet away. The cloth dropped from nerveless fingers when she saw what was underneath. Naruto\u2019s human ears were gone, and in their place, two large, fuzzy fox ears stuck out from the top of his head. Looking down, Ty Lee saw he had also sprouted a red, furry tail, also fox-like. Ty Lee let out a delighted squeal that was probably heard by half of the Earth Kingdome. He was so CUTE! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foxboy yipped in answer, Ty Lee stayed with Naruto all day and found out that his intelligence had been reduced to almost the level of an animal\u2019s. Naruto rubbed up aginst Ty Lee's feet, purring happly that she was near by. Ty Lee knew Azula was bound to have her feeling back by now and that she'd do who-knows-what to Naruto if she found him like this. </span></div></div>",

The problem was that Ty Lee had no idea who to ask for help regarding this situation. This type of transformation was so beyond the bending abilities that Ty Lee was used to seeing and she didn't know of any places that dealed with that type of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto in that state of mind was unable to offer her any advice. Ty Lee had tried questioning him as she stroked his ears but all he could do was purr and whimper. Also Ty Lee suspected he was getting steadily worse. Before he seemed to be able to follow anything she was saying but now it seemed that he only understood short sentences. She had to do something and quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting Naruto on her lap and gently stroking his fur, Ty Lee began to think of people who would be able to help her or at least point her in the right direction. The first person she thought of was Azula's uncle General Iroh.  He was a seasoned veteren who was very wise. Unlike his niece, the man was a very kind-hearted person who would be happy to help those in need. He might know of some place that they could go to reverse what was happening to her friend. The problem was that General Iroh had recently escaped imprisonment in a fire nation prison and his whereabouts were currently unknown. Ty Lee was hesitant to began a lengthy search for him when time could be running out for Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother information source was the Avatar. Eventhough the current incarnation of the avatar, Aang, seemed extremely naive, he had the ability to tap into his past lives' knowledge. Somewhere in his lifetimes of experience there must be the answer to this problem. Unfortunately, like Iroh the Avatar was also in hiding from the fire nation. Not only that,  Ty Lee had spent the last year working for Azula trying to capture him. Chances were the Avatar would be extra careful avoiding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a third option that was rather risky. Another good source of advice was a group of elderly twins named Lo and Li. Ty Lee had met these twins in the past and their wisdom had been really helpful and resulted in her and her friends gaining insight into their own souls. Ty Lee thought there was a good chance they could put her and Naruto on the path towards finding a cure. The downside however, was that Azula frequently used the twins as advisors. Seeking their advice might lead them into contact with the cruel princess. Ty Lee hated to risk that type of danger but she at least knew where the twins were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee looked at Naruto's cute face. She rubbed his head. \"Don't worry Naruto, I'll definitely help you!\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to come to a decision about which information source to seek out soon otherwise it might be too late for her friend turned fox. <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

The two headed into the nearest town and Ty Lee got them some new clothes (She couldn't go around in a fire nation-made outfit and she had to get something to cover Naruto's ears and tail.)  After that, she asked about an old man and a bald monk. One of the people she spoke to told her that they had stopped by a day earlier. Ty Lee thanked her informant and whent off in the direction they had been going. Naruto was getting steadily worse like she feared, he had started crawling on all fours the way a fox would.

He tossed the weapon aside growled and charged at Sokka only to be knocked aside by a wave of water from Katara (who was becoming ever more impulsive these days). Naruto shook off the water attack and charged angrily towards Katara ready to rip her apart. Ty Lee ran to stop this fight from escalating but tripped as Toph trapped her ankles underneath the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninja was once more knocked aside by an air attack from Aang who rushed in front of his waterbending friend to protect her. The air attack didn\u2019t do more than stun Naruto and he quickly turned on the airbender knocking aside any earth, air and water attacks that that the avatar used to slow him down. Naruto (acting completely on impulse now) was getting angrier by the second and the angrier he got the more powerful he became. He didn\u2019t even feel the tidal wave Katara hit him from behind with and he shattered through an attempt by Toph to imprison him under earth. Sokka tried to attack the ninja on Appa but Naruto backhanded him sending the entire Air bison flying straight into a tree. As the brutal Ninja charged towards him, Aang tried to separate the two of them using a wall of air. Naruto pierced through the wall and began clawing his way towards the Avatar ready to rip Aang\u2019s heart out of his body. Aang just barely managed to protect himself by encasing himself in stone using earthbending. Naruto pounded viciously against Aang\u2019s earth made armor ignoring Toph and Katara\u2019s boulder and tidal wave sized-attacks like they were pebbles and rain. As his armor shattered around him, the Avatar felt a feeling of terror he had never felt against any enemy before. He closed his eyes as Naruto\u2019s claw-like fingers came toward his unprotected throat thinking he had finally met his match...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t blame Katara for not trusting him but it definitely didn\u2019t make things easy for him. \u201cTy Lee explained things to me while you guys had your hands full. It was her idea I use her as a hostage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you!!!\u201d Katara said. \u201cYou\u2019re probably working with her to trick us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait Katara!!\u201d Sokka called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her brother angrily but stopped when she realized he was badly hurt from the battle. She rushed to his side to heal him and the flying bison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Katara was tending to Appa and her brother,  Ty Lee convinced Toph and Aang to let Naruto go. Though they were initially reluctant, they finally consented based on the fact that Toph discerned that Ty Lee was telling the truth when she said she would prevent Naruto from harming them. Once Naruto was free, he cuddled his face against Ty Lee\u2019s legs happily.  Toph and Aang watched shocked. They found it hard to believe that just a few minutes ago that person had nearly killed all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a lot of explaining to do!\u201d Aang told her.<br>\r\nTy Lee nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nOnce Sokka was healed, he convinced Katara to at least hear Ty Lee out. Sitting down and stroking Naruto\u2019s ears, Ty Lee told them the entire story. The gang listened quietly for the most part but did make occasional comments or questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ty Lee described how Azula made Naruto do the hoop of fire. Sokka told Zuko his family was sick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me I know.\u201d Zuko said pointing to his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang applauded Ty Lee standing up to Azula and helping Naruto out and Ty Lee felt a little proud of herself as she continued her tale. Finally Ty Lee got to the part about Naruto\u2019s transformation and why she needed their help. When the girl had finished telling her story, the avatar looked at Toph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas she telling the truth?\u201d Aang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind girl nodded. \u201cEvery word.\u201d She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the Avatar group had an important decision to make. Knowing  Naruto\u2019s and Ty Lee\u2019s situation\u2026Should the Avatar tap into his past lives' knowledge and help those two out?</span></div></div>",

I wanted peace. With all those villages it was never going to happen. Akatsuki\u2019s goal was split into three stages. The first step was to collect money. After that, the second stage is to use that money as a capital. To create the Shinobi world\u2019s very first contracted organization of war.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell\u2026is that any different from the rest of the villages?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be completely different from villages in service of countries, actually. Here I\u2019ll explain it for you. For countries with powerful Shinobi villages, \u201cShinobi business\u201d represents a large percentage of that country\u2019s income. The Shinobi villages participate in internal and external conflicts, thus earning massive amounts of money and effectively supporting the country\u2019s economy. In other words, for the country to obtain a stable income a certain amount of war becomes necessary\u2026But in this day and age, while there do exist any number of small conflicts, the great wars of the past are no longer to be seen. Countries have scaled back the villages and many Shinobi have lost their place of being. Shinobi exist for battle, yet this peace is the \u201creward\u201d they receive for putting their lives on the line for their countries.  The \u201cfive great Shinobi countries\u201d still aren\u2019t that bad\u2026both the countries and their villages are large, with much trust still placed in them contracts still pour in from other countries, and their existence is secure\u2026still the same cant be said for smaller countries. Maintaining a Shinobi village, even in times of peace, requires massive finding equal to approaching that in time of war. But if you try to scale back the village you become unable to respond to unexpected conflicts. And that\u2019s where our organization, Akatsuki, comes in! Paying no allegiance to any country, we will provide our clients with exactly the amount of Shinobi needed exactly when they need them. Amassing an appropriate amount of power, we will create a contracted organization that fulfills the warring needs of small countries and villages everywhere!  At first we would\u2019ve taken on all wars for trifling amounts of money, thus dominating the market of war, an, furthermore, in relation to the size of that market we will use the Bijuu to cause more conflict. Eventually we would\u2019ve control all war, establishing a monopoly! And with that the system of Shinobi villages in larger countries will collapse people will be forced to rely on Akatsuki and thus we will arrive at the realization of our true ambition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this he put his hand in front of him. \u201cThe third stage of our objectives. World domination.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glared at him. How could they acquire peace like this. \u201cWorld domination\u2026 so you just wanted to take over everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. But once we would\u2019ve ruled we can then start rebuilding, start everything from scratch and thus everything would be peaceful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about us Jinchuuriki. We were nothing but slaves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are wrong. We didn\u2019t just capture you to help us in the war, but the fact that demons like yourself will never make the nations go at peace as people will fear that the demon would be released and as such destroy the land. People will always fear your kind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S A LIE!\" Ty Lee shouted \"People fear what the don't understand, if a person is good, how dose them useing whatever they have in order to protect what's important and show the world that everything's not just good and bad so that everyone can understand one another be something to be afraid of?! You say you want peace, yet you enlist people who kill the innocent for you plans? How are you a good person if your goals make the innocet suffer? Your no saviour, just another deluted madman!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPein glared at her, this girl dared to call him a madman?!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will never understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's were your wrong.\" Zuko said  \"It was that same idea that became the cause of a 100-year old war here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPein's eyes flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Die then.\"        </span></div></div>",

Sokka was still to injured from the fight with Naruto to move<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPein rushed forward and slammed his knee into Naruto's stomach so hard, he was sure he heard his ribs crack. Ty Lee, angered by the attack on her friend, went at Pein with a Kyusho-jitsu barrage, Pen backed away from the assult and grabbed Ty Lee by the throat and slammed her into the ground. Aang sent a blade-shaped blast of air at him, Pein dodged and leped into the air as Aang tried earthbending the ground he was standing on to try and give himself an opening, Pein twisted his body in mid-air as the avatar sent daggers of ice at him and as Pein landed, a fireball struck him only to see that the Akatsuki member had used substituion and Aang found a punch being twisted into his back.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonan wasn't doing nearly as well as her comrad, Toph was easy to deal with so long as she used her origami wings to stay off the ground, what bugged her was the flames and water Zuko and Kitara were sending her way. If papper got wet, it beacme flimsy as it sagged and clung to itself and lost its stiffness, the flames were a bigger problem, if that connected, her skills were going to be turned to ash as the papper burnt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Konan dodged the flames, she felt one of the wings she made with her origami-jutsu skills get heavy. She turned to see what it was, Kitara had drinched her right wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Konan cried as she hit the ground with a thrump.  Zuko aimed a burst of flames at her, Konan squizzed her eyes shut as she expected this to be the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yahiko...I'll be seeing you again soon...\" she muttered under her breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Konan felt someone roughly push her aside and a cry of pain as the fireball struck them, Konan tensed, that wasn't Pein's voice...she opened her eyes to see none other than Naruto trying to put the flames out. Everything froze, save Ty Lee elbowing Kitara in the ribs and the girl sending a wave to extinguish the flames, everyone was staring at Naruto as he got up panting, thanked Kitara for putting the flames out, no one was moving, Pein was about to stomp on Aang's throat, Toph was aiming a bolder at Pein, Ty Lee was smiling at her friend-turning-fox, Sokka looked like a fish out of water, Aang's eyes were almost the size of Appa's head, Kitara and Zuko had been so stunned that they had fallen to they're knees and were pointing at Naruto with stunned looks on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I don't like seeing people die, especaily if I can do something to prevent it.\" Naruto shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonan got up and thanked him, in all honesty, she always did feel odd around Naruto, but she had finally learned why, what he did and what he'd said about not likeing seeing people die had made that clear to her at last: the fox-hoste was the same as her and Pein's old friend Yahiko. how he hated sadness and pain, wearing a mask over how he felt when something was bothering him, how strongly he valued life, how all he needed to know in order to help people was that they needed it and it was within his power to give it to them...the only thing that was diffrent about them was that Yahiko beleived in \"an eye for an eye\" and Naruto didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you forgive us for troubling you?\" Konan asked. Her and Pein were about to go on their way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stopped them, he had to know something. \"Wait! Why were you two here at all?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPein and Konan sighed       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danzo. We fallowed him and when we came across you, your current state made it hard not to assume the nine-tailed fox was taking control of you.\"  Konan said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Toph asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto moaned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danzo is more militant than most in the Leaf Village, favoring aggression and war over passiveness and peace. In the past, he competed with Sarutobi for the position of Third Hokage. He created the (now disbanded) ANBU training department known as Root  and acted as its head. Danzo believes that Konoha must go through a fundamental ideological shift in order to survive, he's stated that the First Hokage's influence has meant that subsequent Hokages have proven to be indecisive and weak as they adopt his philosophies of how he saw the people of Konoha as a part of his own family, and that they were worth dying for and refused to draw a line between the rulers and protecters of the people. He'll be easy to spot becouse he lost an arm at some point. Are you telling me HE'S why I'm transforming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPein nodded <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Naruto's fox-tail split, so that he nine tails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho no...THAT'S what that wacko has planned? He plans on turning me into a mimiture virsion of the nine-tailed fthen have me sent back to the village I'm from and publicly kill me so he's given control of the village?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nPein and Konan winced, that was just cruel, it was also just the kind of thing Danzo would try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll keep the Akatsuki from troubbling you, as for finding him, you'll have to do that on your own, the transformation should wear off nartually if you stop the one who cast it on you, but that has to be done BEFORE the transformation is compleated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Pein and Konan disappered.          </span></div></div>",

He was dizzy and nauseous and could barely think straight. As he struggled to get his bearings, he realized he was no longer in the forest. He looked around trying to get a sense of his environment. He was in what looked like a dark tunnel. Walls surrounded him on every side. The floor underneath him was soft and spongy and felt wet to the touch. The atmosphere of this place was incredibly hot and humid. The temperature was hotter than the desert outside the sand village while at the same time damper than the village of hidden mists, making being in the area a truly unpleasant place for the ninja.While the heat of this location alone made this place unbearable for Naruto,  there was something even worse inside the environment. Something that made the young Shinobi wonder whether he had been sent to hell. The air inside this cave smelled exactly like Azula\u2019s feet. At first Naruto thought that the smell was just some of Azula\u2019s foot scent that had remained inside his nostrils after her torture but then to his horror he realized that the smell was a hundred times worse. It was as if smell was a part of the environment and nothing Naruto tried could get the smell out of his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot dampness coupled with the smell in the air took its toll on Naruto both mentally and physically and he desperately began to seek a way out of the cave. First he tried using chakra techniques but the smell made it impossible to think straight. Without being able to establish the proper concentration, Naruto realized he would have to seek a way out of cave naturally. He gagged and coughed as he moved through his surroundings hoping to find an exit. Suddenly he saw something that gave him hope. Light was shining through the top of the cave. Quickly he moved towards it hoping to find a way out. As he got closer to the light source, Naruto felt happy thinking he would finally get to experience fresh air again. However upon gazing on the source of the light, Naruto saw a sight that not only crushed his hopes, it filled his heart with terror. Azula\u2019s pretty face was smiling down at him (a scary sight in itself) only now it was gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smiled at Naruto\u2019s reaction to seeing her again. It was exactly the reaction she hoped for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi little guy,\u201d She laughed. \u201cEnjoying your new home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d Naruto asked horrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seemed to love my boots so much,\u201d Azula grinned. \u201cI thought you might want to experience being inside one of them. Unfortunately I had to shrink you down so you would fit. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat explained a lot Naruto thought. He wondered why he hadn\u2019t been able to figure it out from the smell and surroundings. Eventually he chalked it up to Azula\u2019s foot odor hindering his ability to think. Anyway...he had no intention of staying like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn me back!!!!\u201d Naruto demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHee Hee you\u2019re so cute when you\u2019re angry.\u201d Azula giggled. \u201cBut maybe you should be less concerned with what size you are and more concerned about what I\u2019m obvious going to do to you next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color dropped from Naruto\u2019s face as he realized what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula grinned as she saw the terrified look on her prisoner\u2019s face. As bad as it was for him now, It was about to get a whole lot worse.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stomped her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Naruto that sudden movement was quite an experience. He felt a brief wave of nausea as the boot moved rapidly downward and a sudden amount of pain as Aula\u2019s heel banged against him hard. The pressure had suddenly increased as Azula\u2019s foot was now pressing hard against him marking him as her property and he was pressed into the solf, squishy skin of her foot until he was stuck to it, her sweat making her flesh feel like he was in a pot of quick-drying concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAula crossed her legs, she stared at the higher of the two articals of footwear, the one that had her prisoner inside it, natrually.  The princess  thought of how to enjoy a tiny prisoner as her personal living insole. Suddenly she smiled cruelly as she lowered her foot and started to walk away. Naruto suddenly felt her foot lift him up only to crash down a second later. That happened again and again. Azula was obviously walking somewhere. Next he felt the toes his head was between start to shake as Aula rubbed her toes aginst his head and Naruto felt like he was in hell. Then it got worse. Azula used a heel-toe motion to shift the pressure from one end of Naruto's body to the other. After that, she did a forward and backward rubbing with her foot. smushing Naruto's face into her insole and rubbing tirelessly, Naruto found himself glad for the  soft, spongy, wet floor as the feel would have been like sandpaper otherwise. As his capter was doing all this, she was keeping her feet the tempiture of a sona by focing firebendingon her soles. Azula started to sweat again and the heat from her sole made her footsweat boil around Naruto and made the already damp air of her boot feel like he was breathing in glue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't take this. But he couldn't get out. The only way to get free was if Azula took him out to amuse herself by having him as a foot-toy!     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt sick just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his reaction Azula giggled. Next she proceeded to describe Mai and Ty Lee\u2019s rigorous work out routines for her captive. She told him all about how Ty Lee spent hours on her feet practicing acrobatic moves every day and she described how Mai ran around practicing throwing her knives from different distances. After that she described her friends\u2019 footwear for Naruto and talked about how hot, sweaty and smelly their feet would become after wearing their shoes all day. By the time the fire princess had finished her description, Naruto was shivering and whimpering like a frightened puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would!!!!\" Azula chackled and Naruto scorched her foot with the Raisangan.

Ty Lee and I have already had some fun with you, so let's let Mai have her turn with you. Hurry up, you don't want to make us wait, do you?\" Azula said with a smile. Naruto slowly started to walk to the one called Mai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before he was even ten feet away from her feet, to his perspective, the smell was horrible. It was worse than anything he had ever smelt before. Then the heat came. It felt like he was wearing a blanket on a summer day. As he got closer, he started to make out more and more details, such as the tiny droplets of sweat, which were the size of basketballs to him, as well as the subtle movements of her feet. He also saw the black polish she had on her toes, shining in the light. He realised that these feet, while hot and sweaty, weren't the worst feet he has ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come on little foot toy, don't just stand there. Start worshipping already.\" Azula said. \"Yes,\"said Mai.\"My feet are waiting for their turn, so hurry up.\" Naruto quickly snapped out of the sudden trance he was in and started to massage her feet. \"Wow,\" he thought. \"This is actually very soft.\" Soon after he started Mai said down to him, \"Come on little air bender, you can do better than that. I can't even feel you down there. If I don't feel a change down there, I might have to help you, and you won't like how I will do it. Oh, and don't forget to go between the toes.They need some love too.\" Naruto quickly understood and worked even harder. Eventually, he finished the heel and sole. All he had to do now was the toes and he would be done with this foot. Using chakra, he climbed Mai's foot and got between her first and big toe. As soon as he touched the skin between them, the oes scrunched together and trapped him in their grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oops, sorry. Guess I forgot to warn you that the skin between my toes are extremely ticklish. Oh well, you know now at least. Now hurry, you still have another foot to get to after this.\" Mai said to Naruto. \"Man, I feel sorry for the little guy.\" said Ty Lee. \"It must be so stinky and sweaty down there. Especially considering how we just got done training before this.\" \"Don't worry Ty Lee. Just remember, he is an enemy of the fire nation. It is his duty to service and worship us.\" said Azula. \"Besides, soon he'll learn to love serving and enjoying our feet.\" \"Well,\" said Ty Lee unsure, \"if you say so Azula. I guess he'll be happy, eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, Naruto was massaging between Mai's toes. First he had to move most of the toe jam out of the way to get to the skin, as well as make sure it stayed out of his way.Next he had to make sure to be careful not to tickle her, or else he will probably be made into toe jam by accident. All of this, while dealing with the heat and sweat pouring off of them. Needless to say, by the time he was done, he was soaked in sweat, most of it not even his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nicely done, little one. You did pretty well for your first time. No time for a break, though, you still have my other foot to do, as well as Azula's and Ty Lee's.\" said Mai. When he heard that, the life drained from his face. \"Oh god, I just finished one and I'm kinda tired. There's no way I'll be able to do five more.\" he thought. \" Come on, little one, your wasting time. You still have much to do.\"said Mai. Resigned to his fate, Naruto made his way over to Mai's other foot and started the whole process over again. From heel to toe, Naruto massaged her foot and felt even worse than when he finished the first time. \"Very good, but you're not done yet.\"said Mai. \"My feet are so sweaty now, don't you think? I also bet you're really thirsty and hungry after all that work. Since you worked so hard on my feet, I'll let you drink my sweat and eat my toe jam as a reward. I promise you'll love it. The best part is, we both get something out of it. I get a clean foot, and you get a meal fit for someone of your size. Enjoy.\" Mai said with a cruel smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As soon as Naruto heard those words, he nearly threw up. Sweat and toe jam for a meal? No way! Sadly, he didn't have much choice, because as soon as she was done talking, she grabbed him and dropped him head first into the stuff between her toes. Naruto struggled to get out of it, but his efforts were misidentified to the others. \"Wow, you were right Azula. He really is loving his new life.\" said Ty Lee. \"See Ty Lee, he loves it. Look at him trying to get as much in as possible. I told you he would and he is. But he does look like he needs help. Mai, can you help him get more food?\" asked Azula. \"Gladly.\" Mai said. Taking her index finger, she slowly pushed Narutos head into his 'meal'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n To Naruto, it was different. As he was struggling to get out of the toe jam, he suddenly felt something hard push into his head. \"What the heck is pushing me!?\" he thought. \"I hope you enjoy the help I'm giving you , little toy. I saw how you wanted more, but couldn't, so I decided to give you a little push. Don't worry about thanking me. Your struggles to get more of it is thanks enough. Even better, is you still have seven more places to eat from. You are one lucky bug.\" Naruto tried to get out of doing this, but her finger was to strong. Slowly he made himself eat chunks out of her toe jam, while sipping sweat to get it down, each taste worse than the last. Finally, the torture ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Excellent work. Sadly, my time with you is almost up. Don't worry, though. I'm sure she'll treat you just as good as I did. And I'm sure I'll see you around even more.\" said Mai. \"Enjoy your turn...\"</span></div></div>",

Also, you'll have to put more into massaging and worshipping my feet. They are a bit tougher than Mai's feet, but I'm sure you'll enjoy them.\" Naruto was already tired from having to massage Mai's feet, but hearing about Ty Lee's made him feel even worse. \"How am I supposed to do that? I'm already tired from Mai. Now I have to use more? Thank god for Uzumaki stamina. Hopefully it won't be as bad as Mai's feet. She did say that they didn't smell as bad, after all.\" Naruto thought to himself. \"Yes Ms. Ty Lee. I'll start right away.\" he said out loud to her. \"Great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As with Mai, Naruto started to slowly walk over to Ty Lee's left foot to start.He soon found out she was right. Her feet didn't stink as bad as Mai's. Sure, there was still some stale air, but under that air was the smell of vanilla. \"Huh. Guess she must use some sort of lotion on her feet or something.\" he thought. He also saw that there were some calluses on here feet. Not many. Just one or two. Next he saw was a layer of sweat all over her foot. \"Dang. She wasn't joking when she said a lot more sweat than Mai. It may be harder to climb, but I'll manage. Thank god for chakra control techniques. Finally, he noticed that she had on white toe nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay little fox, you can start now.\" said Ty Lee. \"Hey, why did you call him a fox?\" asked Mai. \"What, you didn't see? He has these cute little whisker marks on his cheeks. They kinda make him look like a fox, so little fox.\" \"Huh. Wonder how I missed them.\" said Mai. \"You probably got distracted by his massage. No harm done. By the way, how is your massage Ty Lee?\" asked Azula. \"It feels wonderful. He really is good at this, to be honest. Maybe just a little more push and it would be perfect. Hey, can we keep him Azula? We could each train him all sorts of tricks and other stuff. He could be the perfect pet!\" said Ty Lee. \"Hmm. That is actually a really good idea Ty Lee. It would be wonderful to have a good massage after chasing after the Avatar.\" said Mai, giving her own opinion. \"I don't know. First we'll have to break him in and interrogate him for any information he has that could be useful. Afterwards, I don't see why we can't. But first things first. We have to break him so he willingly tells us what we need and listens to us.\" said Azula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto was half way through the sole of the foot when he heard their conversation above him. \"What!? No way will I be some sort of pet to them, even if their feet are kinda nice. NO! Snap out of it Uzumaki. You don't even know what they will do if they find out about the village. I gotta focus. First thing I gotta do is get out of here and away from these people. Next I gotta get back to the village and warn Tsunade about these people. Hopefully she'll be able to turn me back to normal.\" thought Naruto. While he was having his inner monologue, he didn't notice that he was slowly stopping at massaging Ty Lee's feet. But the others noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh?\" \"What's wrong Ty Lee?\" \"Little foxy is slowing down for some reason. Do you think he is getting tired for massaging our feet?\" asked Ty Lee. \"I don't know. Maybe.\" \"I know. Ty Lee, why don't you give foxy a little help down there. You know, shoulder the burden.\" told Azula to Ty Lee. \"Good idea Azula. He was looking a little bit tired. Maybe this will give him the rest and energy for your feet. Don't worry foxy, I understand you're tired and I'll help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, Naruto felt something grab him.\" Huh? What's happening?\" \"Here foxy. I'll help you out. Hopefully you can build up your stamina after this.\" \"Wait, wha-!\" Before he could finish, he was slammed into Ty Lee's sole. Then she started rubbing him all over her foot. \"See foxy. We can be nice to you. You can trust us. Now for the toes.\" She moved him up to her toes and pushed him up against her big toe. To Naruto, it was like he was jammed up against it and was being cuddled by it face first. After a minute of this, she took him away and put him between her toes and started using him like floss. This process repeated itself until he was done with the first foot. \"Now for the other foot.\" Hearing that, Naruto couldn't help but groan out from doing this. To Ty Lee, however, it was like he was groaning out a thank you. \"Don't mention it foxy. I understand you're tired, so it's the least I can do.\" Ty Lee said to him. \"Who knows. We may be doing this for the rest of our lives. Doesn't that sound nice?\" To Naruto, this idea sounded like a nightmare. \"Then again, she is being nice to me, and they are helping me. NO! I have to get back to the village. I am not someone's pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon Naruto was done with both her feet. Needless to say, he was soaked from her foot sweat by the time they finished. \"Oh~ you're so wet foxy. I'm sorry about that. Maybe next time it won't be so bad. Still, at least you enjoyed it. Next time, you may not even need my help for this. Too bad my turns up now. We could have had a lot more fun. You could have watched my acrobatic tricks. Oh well, maybe next time. Now, be good to Azula, she is a princess,a and you don't want to make her angry. Then again, maybe shell give you the rest of the day off. It's up to her , I guess. What do you say, Azula?\" Ty Lee asked Azula. \"Hmm, let me think. One one hand, he's very tired, but on the other, he could have useful information. I guess I'll...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Deciding to take her turn, Azula grabbed Naruto and put him near her feet. While Ty Lee's feet were more sweaty than anything, Azula's were the opposite. Due to always practicing her fire bending, the heat from the flames would always make her feet sweat, but the sweat would quickly evaporate, leaving behind the strong smell of old cheese and vinegar. This cycle continued for years, ultimately leading to Azula having some of the worst smelling feet in the entire fire nation. This fact was quickly discovered by Naruto, because as soon he was dropped around twenty feet, to his perspective, he was having to force himself not to throw up everything he had eaten that day. \"Oh god,\" thought Naruto, \"what the hell did this crazy lady even do to get her feet this bad!?\" Quickly, he tried to cover his nose, but the damage was done. The smell was already inside his nose, and didn't seem to want to leave. He fell to his knees and tried to get the smell away, but his efforts were all in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While this was happening, Azula was watching this play out, smirking and enjoying his pain. \"If this won't get any information out of him, nothing will.\" Azula thought to herself. \"It's a shame that I could never get my feet smell more pleasant, but it looks like this can come in handy for interrogating prisoners. Oh, he must be in horrible torture from them. Even at my size, they are pretty bad. To him, this must be unbearable.\" Seeing he wasn't going to start anytime soon, she decided to grant him some small mercy. \"Okay little airbender, I'm going to be a little bit nice to you. I will give you five minutes to get used to the smell. If you don't start to massage my feet within those five minutes, I will assume you will need some help, and I know you won't wish for my help.\" She said down to him. Starting to count in her head, she came to her five minute mark and saw he was nowhere near able to massage her feet. \"Oh dear. Looks like the five minutes are up and you still haven't done anything at all. Don't worry, one of your kind future owners will help you. Just don't make a habit out of this, though.\" Lifting up her foot, she quickly brought it down one the prone ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto was barely aware of what was going on around him. The scent of Azula's feet were that powerful to him at his current size. It was as if he were in some kind of foggy state of mind that had him question everything he would do. \"Why do I have to through this? How did I end up in this predicament? How will I get back to Konoha?\" These question where some of the few that were going through his head right now. They soon started to go to things like, \"What can I do to quit this torture? How can I survive being the pet to these three women? Why do they want me to suffer?\" The thoughts eventually became corrupted from there original design to instead be, \"How can I please these three women? Why not be a pet to them? How can I please these kind people?\" These last thoughts were the ones he had when Azula brought her foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The first part of her foot she started with was her heel. Lightly placing it on him, she slowly and carefully rolled his body under her heel, like he was some kind of toy. \"This feeling is just what my feet needed.\" thought the princess. \"Even if he was telling the truth about not being an air bender, I still won't let him go. If this does break him, Ty Lee, Mai, and myself could easily mold him to be the perfect consort to us. All he would do is worship and please us like the goddesses he would think we were, even if he was regular sized. Not to mention Ty Lee was right about those whisker marks. They are kind of cute.\" She was suddenly brought out of her musings when she felt a wet sensation from her heel. Looking down, she quickly noticed it was from their pet. What shocked her was that he was willingly licking her foot with a smile on his face. \"Oh my god... I think we actually broke him.\" Looking up to he friends, she saw the shocked look on Mai's face and the happy look on Ty Lee's. \"Hey Azula, does this mean we get to keep him?\" asked Mai. \"Well Mai, it looks like we may. It appears he finally accepted his place.\" replied Azula. \"Yay!\" squealed Ty Lee. \"That means we get to keep him forever and ever!\" \"Mistress Azula, why did you stop?\" asked Naruto for the first time. \"I might be done with your beautiful heel, but the rest of your gorgeous foot need my attention.\" Shocked about what they just heard, the quickly asked to repeat what he said. Repeating it word for word, it quickly brought them back to reality. \"Of course.\" replied Azula, still a little shocked. She started to roll his body under the rest of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After the heel was the arch and ball of the foot. Carefully and with an eye for detail, Naruto licked all over those areas, as well as eating any dried skin Azula had on her foot without being asked. Deciding to save the toes for last, she quickly repeated the process with her other foot, during which, Naruto never lost his smile at pleasing his owners. Finally, she started on her toes. Deciding to do something different, she brought the soles of her feet together and kept them that way. Grabbing Naruto, she quickly put him between both sets of crimson colored toes. Then, she started  to clench the two sets of toes together, making sure Naruto's face got between each toe and ate what was between them. Finally done with the message, Azula and the others wondered what to do with him now. \"Well since today is almost over, I say we get back on track and look for the avatar and his little group. Who knew that stopping here on the way to earth kingdom would end with us finding a little pet. Now the question is, who does he sleep with? It isn't like he can sleep with each of us.\" stated Azula. \"Ooh, I have an idea. How about we all get in the same bed and let him cuddle with our feet all at once. That way, we each get equal time until we work out a schedule and he gets to be next to each his owners.\" stated Ty Lee with a smile on her face. \"Well, the idea is better than nothing, I guess.\" said Mai.\"Not to mention he just fell asleep.\" Looking down, they quickly saw that he was indeed asleep. Deciding to end the day, they each got themselves prepared and went to bed. Naruto, however, was tied to the feet of Ty Lee, since she seemed to care for him a bit more than the others. During this time, Naruto was having an internal struggle. In his mind, the idea of staying with his owners was fighting for control over the desire to leave. Which would win would soon be decided when he woke up. The next morning, the winner of the fight was made clear when...</span></div></div>",

She looked like her father, Oroichimaru, but has brown hair that went down to the middle of her back. On her head was a blue headband with a metal plate attached to it that had the symbol of a spiral arrow engraved into it and a plane all black shinobi uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh..Who are you and what do you want?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Yuki.\" the girl said \"And I've got something you need to do for me.

As it turned out, she was going to send him looking for a boy she liked, Yuki described him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was about 12-13 years old, on his head was short, blond, spiky hair and a blue headband with a metal plate attached to it that had the Hidden Leaf Village symbol of a spiral arrow engraved into it, like hers. As for his face he had blue eyes and odd whisker-like marks on his face, He wore orange pants and an orange shirt that has blue near the shoulders and was white at the neck On the back of the shirt was a red spiral symbol. He had some bandages on his thigh and a carrying case for kunai knives. He also wore a small pouch on his belt for basic ninja supplies.He was loud, energetic, caring, a hard worker, and was good looking, and he loved ramen way to much. When it came to pure battle instincts or improvising on the battle field, he was nothing short of a genius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd find him myself, but things keep geting in the way everytime. My dad was a psyico and I don't feel safe in my own home village on account that its full of hate-fulled asses who don't want to see the deffrence between one thing and another as long as they have somethign to hate a person for, an example is the guy I want you to find: A demon attacked the village the day he was born so those idiots think HE'S the demon and try to kill him when he never did anything wrong but simply exist in the first place, and that's were you come in. Bring him here and I'll let your meat-breathed friend go. I would release him now, but I need to be sure you do your job finding him and bringing him here.\" Yuki said to Aang<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but Sokka stays unharmed, or no deal.\" Aang said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to kill him,but I'm not  going to wait more than three days.\" Yuki said, \"So do you really think standing here is a good idea?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang raced off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuki turned to Sokka, \"Now...how to torment you to get that bald kid to hurry?

As his vision cleared, he saw he was strapped down to a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but he wasn't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall yet famine figure stood looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was beautiful, her eyelids were heavily coated with eye black shadow. Her face was a heart-shaped to boot. She had silky blue hair that clung close to her neck and face. Her clothing consist a long, dark cloak that reached to her shins bearing red clouds and a red interior with a chin-high collar. In addition to her appearance, on her bottom lip was a small lip piercing and on her Right middle finger was a ring with a kanji symbol \"white\" or \"Byakko\" - (White Tiger) And to complete her appearance, was a paper flower accessory in her silky blue mass of what she calls \"hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at him with calm, almost emotionless inky black eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...you seem to have a massive chakra signature, one surpassed only by the nine-tailed fox's vessel...and yet, your not a  Jinchuuriki.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Aang didn't know WHAT this woman was talking about. Chakra signature? Jinchuuriki? Who was she? And were was he anyways? Aang struggled against the bonds but they held fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother...those were bolted to the table and have chakra flowing through them.\" the woman said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you and what do you want? And were am I?\" Aang said, fearing that this woman has ties with the fire nation in some way. The woman gave him an odd look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were found at the Final Valley after the duel between the curse-marked brat and the boy who is the living prison of a demonic god.\" she said plainly, speaking slowly as if Aang were a bit dim. \"You must have seen them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang frowned in thought and tried to recall what she was talking about.  Then it hit him like one of Azula's lightning bolts: she meant those two!. The boy with hand-shaped wings coming from his back and the boy in orange with the red energy that was in a fox's outline!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang remembered now, he had gone into the Avatar state just as the two attacks the two of them were using, a blade of black lightning and a ball of compressed, concentrated, rotating spiritual energy,  collided and the energy of the two attacks meeting and the power of Aang's Avatar state started resonating, and Aang was transported to this world!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman snickered when she saw the look on his face when he recalled that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do remember.\" she said, she looked at him. It was clear that he came from another world, another dimension. And that power he had...she knew that harnessing it would greatly speed up the Akatsuki's goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me boy...what manner of power is it that you possess?\" the woman asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang looked at her, so that was what she had him prisoner for! She wanted to use the Avatar state the same way as General Fong and make him into a living weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not telling you!\" Aang shouted at her, the woman sighed \"Suit yourself, we could have settled this diplomatically by telling me and then being released, but you chose not to use reason. Now I have no choice but to torture you for information.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang paled, not knowing what this woman would do to him, he wished that she was just going to ask him questions then let him go before he shouted that he refused to go along with her before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's see, what do I use to get you to tell me what I want to know?\" the woman said to herself out loud, making the young avatar gulp.  Then much to his confusion, she flicked her wrist and pulled out a...piece of paper? Much to his horror the paper slowly morphed into a kuni, it seemed harmless, but she had made it change by applying spiritual energy to it, thereby making it sharper than a diamond-edged buzz saw!!!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. This won\u2019t do. I need you alive so my jutsu are out of the question if they're used to form origami weapons.\" the woman said to herself, Aang relaxed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just have to use some other means to get you to tell me what I want from you.\" she said.</span></div></div>",

Since the attack on the kazekage by the akatsuki, Gaara wanted at least either her or Kankuro to be part of the patrols. Today was her day ... it was already dark ... too dark for Temari to see the space in front of her was deformed. She crossed a kind of wormhole and she didn't notice it until trees were surrounding her ... she was not near Suna anymore, and since it was dark she couldn't see where the wormhole was ... but she didn't started to panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* If there's an entry, there's an exit as well *. And besides, she still thought she was in her world. She thought it was a kind of genjutsu or maybe a teleportation technique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere else, Sokka was guarding the camp where he, her sister Katara, Aang, Toph and Zuko were. Sokka was really nervous, especially when he imagined an army of firebenders attacking him, or worse ... Azula and her gang! even if he was quick, he still had more than meters to do before he could reach the camp and warn others. After a moment he heard a noise in bushes. Due to the pressure he immediately used his boomerang to attack the source of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari was on her guard. All that could be a trap ... and it seems it paid, she saw a weird \"shuriken\", she used her giant fan to produce a very powerful wind. It deflected it easily ... in fact it even came back to where it came. Which made things easier for Temari who knew exactly where her opponent was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch please ... I can deflect hundread of weapons if I want!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wind ... are you an air ...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka couldn't finish his sentence: Temari was already behind of him and knocked him with the edge of her hand. It seems that opponent was not strong at all and even didn't really look like a ninja ... and it was too real to be a genjutsu. Temari started to wonder where she was ... and what to do with him!</span></div></div>",

That brief moment she touched his bare feet was enough for temari to feel they were really sweaty, just as if he and his group were running away constantly or something. She then tried his arms behind his back to the tree just behind him, and then she simply waited for his victim to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka's vision was blured, the last thing he remember was that girl who wanted to infiltrate the camp. He tried to attack her with his boomerang, but it was deflected by a powerful wind. When his vision became more distinct, he saw that girl again, Sokka started to panic.

What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want some information.

We'll see about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari started to bite her finger to make it bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after she applied it on the ground a kind of one eyed weasel appeared out of nowhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my summon, Kamatari! And I think I know a good way to use it! ... Kamatari! Lick his feet! Torture him, make him laugh to death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature was not very enthusiastic to hear that order, but it had no choice and it obeyed. he started to get closer to Sokka's feet and licked them with his tiny tongue. The result was immediate: Sokka laughed hysterically from it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No hohohohoho please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horrible isn't it? But you can make it stop! It's up to you to tell me what I want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuhuhuhuhuse! I won't betray my frihihihiend! Ha ha ha ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then ... lick even more Kamatari!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nkamatari was surprisingly could at torturing Sokka's feet with his tongue, and it was very sneaky! He tried to lick even in between toes! but truly, Sokka's weakness were his soles! it made him laugh like a little boy! But despite the constant torture and laughter, Sokka continued to resist ... for the moment.</span></div></div>",
