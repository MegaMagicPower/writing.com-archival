There had never been a more perfect haven for vampires than this museum.  Old, and Victorian in style, it had at one time been a mansion.  Home to some rich family who collected artifacts and antiques.  They'd turned their home into a museum.  And Santiago had turned them into corpses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the Blood Saints had their own room, with plenty to spare.  A ballroom sat at the front of the building, with a chandelier that was older than the house hanging from the ceiling.  There was a kitchen, a pool room, though it was drained of water and they used it instead as a mini-torture chamber when the time called for it, and servants quarters.  The perfect vampire haven.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago had claimed the master suite as his own.  A bed sat at the far corner, having long ago stopped needing the use of a coffin.  Pillows and cushions lined the room and he'd set up a bar on the left side.  It was his haven.  Few were allowed inside without his permission.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega was the only one who came and went as she pleased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had thought this was virgin blood,\" Vega said in a low voice as she poured blood from a flask into a wine glass.  \"But the bitch was lying to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago smirked as Vega took the glass in her hand and sauntered over to where he lay in the middle of the room, surrounded by pillows and cushions.  He'd taken his shirt off and now only wore black pants.  Vega sat herself in front of him, holding the cup out to him.  He took it and swashed it around in his mouth the way one would do with wine.  Satisfied, he took a drink and then set it aside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward, he lay his head in Vega's lap.  Her fishnet stockings dug into the side of his face.  She ran her hands down his head and over his body.  \"You're tense, love,\" she observed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be in rule over this city,\" he growled, deep in his throat.  Vega continued to run her hands over him, every now and again digging her nails into him, the way he liked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The immortals of this city fear you,\" Vega told him, bending down and kissing his neck.  Her red hair fell over his face and he brushed it away, letting her kiss and bite him.  Though he barely seemed to notice.  His mind was elsewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear is not enough,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega stopped for a second, looking down at his face. \"It has always worked before,\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago rolled onto his back and looked up at the ceiling, feeling Vega's hands continue to pet him, playing with the belt around his waist.  \"Fear only rules when the fearful have no one else to turn to.\"  With sudden fury, he slammed his fist into the floor and sat up, making Vega back up, her eyes flashing in lust at his fury.  \"And it is useless when there is one who stands against it and rallies others to do so as well.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega, who was now seated in back of him, wrapped her arms around his shoulders, kissing and biting at his neck, her hands running over his bare chest, leaving red scratches in their wake.  \"Are we talking about Aubrey?\" she asked between kisses as her hands made their way down his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago growled and grabbed her wrists with one hand, turning around to face her, he held onto them tightly, squeezing with more force than what was necessary.  Vega didn't seem phased, instead she was smiling, anticipating his anger and enjoying the way it made his body glow.  \"He is a thorn in my side,\" Santiago spat through grit teeth, anger coursing through him at just the thought of the other vampire.  Aubrey was still a fledgling compared to Santiago.  Yet he had caused more problems than any vampire Santiago had ever come across. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Santiago, Aubrey used a different approach to get people to do his bidding.  He used friendship, diplomacy, and a vow of a safe haven to find allies.  It drove Santiago mad.  For every vampire he scared into complacency, Aubrey gave two more a place to feel safe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mighty big one,\" Vega answered and pushed her body towards his, though his grip on her wrists prevented her from getting too close.  \"What will you do about it?\" she whispered into his ear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remove it.\" </span></div></div>",

There was a kitchen, a pool room, though it was drained of water and they used it instead as a mini-torture chamber when the time called for it, and servants quarters. The perfect vampire haven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddock had claimed a room on the upper level.  A small one, with a window that he painted black to keep out the sun.  Aside from his coffin, which he used more out of habit than necessity, there was only a small altar and a wall of weapons in his room.  The altar was covered in candles, pendants, and crosses.  Crosses had no effect on vampires, something to which Maddock was forever thankful for.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddock was a vampire who believed in God.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only believed, but worshipped.  He spent his free time praying to God to forgive him for his sins.  Greed and Lust mostly, but sometimes Maddock knew not what to ask forgiveness from other than what he'd become.  In his mind, a vampire was a living sin.  And if he was a constant sin, then he would pray as much as he could in hopes that if he still had a soul, God would accept it when he finally died.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just because he was a God believing vampire, it didn't mean that he refrained from killing or doing whatever Santiago asked of him.  Santiago, the leader of the Blood Saints, paid Maddock to be his second in command.  And the pay was high enough that Maddock didn't question his orders.  He didn't question, he didn't flinch and he didn't hesitate.  If Santiago said to kill someone, Maddock would kill them and he'd get pleasure out of doing so. If someone else were to offer him a better deal, more money to be their second in command, Maddock wouldn't have a problem turning on Santiago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn between doing Santiago's will, Maddock stuck to himself.  Occasionally he'd hunt to fulfill his blood lust or find a good fuck when he felt like it, but for the most part, he was a loner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Maddock sat in his room, waiting for Santiago to call him.  The porcelain mask over his face glinted in the faint candlelight of the altar.  Only his blue eyes could be seen through the small slits in the mask.  He got up and chose a knife from the wall of weapons before sitting back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwirling the knife in his fingers, he began his prayer.  \"Heavenly father...\"  and as he said the words, he carved crosses into his skin and watched as they healed seconds after he finished carving them. </span></div></div>",

It was a bit more dangerous than the suburbs or the outskirts of the city because the inner city never seemed to sleep.  There was always someone out and about and it was hard to keep feeding a private thing, especially if the food fought back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Nox liked it.  He used the steam from the sewers as cover.  He could stand in the same spot for hours, waiting for the perfect victim to come along instead of choosing out of necessity.  He could go for what he was hungry for.  Tonight, Nox was hungry for something seasoned.  A woman, preferably, who had a few years under her belt.  Something classy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago didn't care whether Nox killed his victims or not.  Most Blood Saints did.  They drank, they raped, and they killed.  But Nox liked to leave them alive if he could.  And he didn't rape.  That wasn't his style.  He could get a girl if he really wanted one, he wasn't about to just start fucking every girl who walked his way.  No, Nox would lure them in with his vampiric powers.  He'd catch their eye and they'd come to him.  He'd feed, taking as much as he could without leaving any permanent damage, then he'd let them go.  He'd watch as they shook themselves out of the trance and walked, usually a little drunkenly from blood loss, home wondering where they got the bruise on their neck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the way Nox did business.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so of watching people walk by his hiding spot, he finally caught sight of someone who would suit him good.  A woman in her thirties, hair pulled tightly back in a bun, clad in a dress suit with a portfolio tucked under one arm.  A business woman.  She would be perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his vampire speed to run to an alleyway a little ahead of her, he stood near the edge, waiting for her to come closer as he made his vampire presence known to her.  It was what lured victims to vampires in the first place.  A sort of tingle on the back of their necks that make them look around.  The feeling of being watched.  It was the vampire presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike he anticipated, she slowed down, frowning as she looked around her, sensing him but not really knowing it.  Finally, she turned her head his way and as soon as her eyes met his, he knew he had her.  She stopped wallking completely.  He grinned, keeping her eye contact.  Then he backed down the alley, beckoning her to come and she did.  She followed slowly, expressionless.  He moved behind a dumpster and she came to him, standing in front of him, never breaking eye contact.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox flashed his fangs as he took her portfolio and set it on the ground.  Afterall, she was a business woman, he respected that, he didn't want to mess with her work.  Then he held onto one of her shoulders and with the other hand, tilted her head to the side, exposing her slender neck.  He could see the blood pumping through her veins.  What a delicacy. </span></div></div>",

He looked up just in time to see Mingmei descending along a fire escape. \u201cMin!\u201d he hissed \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe graceful shifter dropped the last few feet to the ground and silently padded over to Nox. \u201cSantiago let me out to stretch my legs, said my pacing was getting on his nerves.\u201d She stood right behind his current meal and gave her the once over. \u201cShe looks yummy.\u201d She licked her own ruby lips. \u201cCan I watch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox shrugs. \u201cKnock yourself out.\u201d He bites the business woman\u2019s neck, and she moans as he begins to dine on her blood. She\u2019s better than he expected, her blood an excellent vintage that is pure, unmarred by drugs, or excess fat. A sweet tasting treat, better than most that he\u2019s found in this city. Truly he\u2019d made a good choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s just finished with her when he notes that the air has become distinctly tinged with arousal. He stepped back from his prey and saw that Min hadn\u2019t just been watching. Her hands had slipped under the business dress the woman was wearing and were currently roaming as they willed under her cloths. \u201cOoh she\u2019s got a firm ass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox just stared at her for a minute before finally finding his tongue. \u201cWhat the heck are you doing?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMin just smiled \u201cExpanding my horizons, besides I\u2019m planning to share.\u201d So saying she pressed herself against the woman\u2019s back, pushing her into Nox. \u201cCome on, you\u2019ve already fed off her, what\u2019s wrong with taking just a little more.\u201d She smiled at him coyly \u201cAnd you get me in the deal as well, how can you possibly resist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox had been around Mingmei long enough to know about her appetites, but she\u2019d never tried anything like this with him. \u201cNO!\u201d his voice is soft but forceful as he yanked the business woman out of Min\u2019s grasp. \u201cShe\u2019s satisfied my hunger; she gets to walk home unmolested.\u201d He reached down and grabbed the woman\u2019s portfolio and stuck it back in her hands. Then, after making sure she didn\u2019t look too disheveled, he sent her back to join the throng of humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMin pouted as she watched her go. \u201cWhat about my needs?\u201d She turned and looked at Nox who was already walking away. She hurried to catch up to and match pace with him. \u201cSantiago hasn\u2019t visited me in forever, and Sasha can\u2019t seem to get it through his head that I\u2019m eager, interested, and available.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox turns to say something when a distant wolf\u2019s howl pierced the evening. The two of them stopped to listen, extending all their senses to determine just what they were hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWerewolf.\u201d Nox finally says, \u201cand it\u2019s close too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMin looks at him skeptically. \u201cCan\u2019t be, what werewolf would be dumb enough to set foot on Santiago\u2019s turf.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox taps his foot as he thinks, finally he shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t know who, but Santiago is gonna want to know about this violation.\u201d He turns to Min \u201cHead back and tell him that I\u2019ve gone to check this out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMingmei shakes her head. \u201cNope, you\u2019re not exactly a great fighter and I for one don\u2019t want to deal with Santiago if his main money maker is killed by a werewolf, I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the streets, pedestrians pulled jackets or loved ones closer, suddenly feeling a chill in the night air. Nox and Min continued, the baying of the wolf only seeming to spur them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alone.\u201d Mingmei said after awhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox didn\u2019t look at her as he answered. \u201cMakes sense, I haven\u2019t heard the answering howls of a pack yet.\u201d The two had arrived at a small park that currently seemed devoid of life. Nox pulled a small pistol from his jacket and checked to make sure it was loaded and that the safety was off. \u201cHopefully that means it\u2019s a rogue, and thus alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMin glanced at his weapon and smirked. \u201cYou think that little pea shooter is going to take out a were-creature?\u201d she scoffed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox ejected a bullet from the barrel and held it in front of her face. \u201cSilver, in the right places, will put any were creature down.\u201d He then re-loaded the round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMingmei snuggled up to his side briefly \u201cOh I like a man who knows how to handle his gun!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox shook his head and looked down at her impish grin. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever stop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head \u201cNope.\u201d But sobered soon after and stepped away from him. \u201cSo he\u2019s in the park, how do we flush him out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox looked Mingmei up and done, and smiles. \u201cLive bait.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox is hidden in the bushes. Silently he followed Min as she stumbled her way through the park. Off color and off key singing accompany her bumbling motions as she pretended to be drunk. Nox is forced to admit that her act is very convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoo! I\u2019m blasted!\u201d she said to no one in particular, before flopping down onto a park bench. The bench was facing away from Nox so he couldn\u2019t see Min\u2019s face, but he was able to spot the humanoid form that approached her from the other end of the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey mister!\u201d she waved at him, as if the task was just a little more difficult than usual. \u201cCan you give me directions to Main Street? I\u2019m kind of lost\u201d The man strode over to her, hands buried in the pockets of his jacket, and soon stood in front of her. \u201cMister?\u201d she said again waving her hands in his face. Nox was unable to tell much about the guy except that he was wearing clothing that was far too heavy for such a warm night<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash of movement his hands sailed free of their confines. One grabbed Mins wrist and the other grabbed her neck. Deciding that he\u2019s waited long enough, Nox left his cover; gun already raised, and pulled the trigger. The first shot took her assailant in the shoulder, dropping him to the ground. Mins was up in a flash and kicked the man in the balls for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNox jogged over to her side and crouched,  pointing the gun too the man\u2019s head before rolling him over for a better look and sees that the man is<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The perfect vampire haven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega had taken on the wine cellar in the basement to be her room.  Though it was smaller than most, it suited her needs.  It was dark and enclosed, so even if she no longer needed a coffin to rest, it was like she was in one anyway.  A crypt more likely.  She kept bottles and flasks of blood on the empty wine shelves.  Only the most ancient of vampires could drink dead man's blood.  Vega had an aquired taste for it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bed sat to the right of the cellar.  It was a small one, meant for only one person, unless of course one person was on top of another.  And to top it off, a cage sat in the back of the room.  Vega was known to play with her food.  She often brought home pets, who didn't last long.  The cage was currently empty, but Vega planned on filling it soon.  With who, she didn't know.  But she was sure she'd find someone fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega always had to find new ways to entertain herself.  It was hard in this day and age.  Vega found that only three things entertained her these days.  Sex, danger, and causing trouble.  It was usually a combination of the three that pleased her most.  For years, she'd been pleased with just ordinary sex.  Santiago was her mate and she had to admit he was good at what he did.  But she could only handle the same thing for so long.  So she did whatever she could to anger him, to make him violent.  When he was caught in his fury, he was always the best lay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even that was getting old.  She was growing bored and she could tell that Santiago was too.  Either bored or he took her for granted.  Thinking she would always let him have his way, whenever he wanted it.  It disappointed her to think that she was nothing more to him than just good sex.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, it was what made Vega happy.  And she was in the mood.  She doubted Santiago would be, but she could try.  And if he wasn't, she could always go find someone to make her pet for the next few weeks.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vega poised herself outside the door of the master suite bedroom, which Santiago usually occupied during the daylight and early evening hours. However, she could not have put into words what had influenced her to pause at this point. Perhaps she was enjoying the anticipation of something good to come; enjoying the struggle of straining against the excitement as it mounted within her. She drew her long, elaborately gothic fingernails down the dark wood grains of the door, scratching quietly like a cat appealing to enter and smiling all the while as if she found devilish humour in the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt hearing no bid to enter, Vega gently grasped the doorknob with a gaunt hand, and then twisted the brass with firm command, promptly causing it to protest with a resonating screech as it turned and bade her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick layer of pillows, spread abundantly over the worn floorboards, lay cold and uninhabited. The bed to the far corner of the room, neatly made and creaseless, was essentially bare too. Vega vehemently slammed the door closed behind her and sauntered in. She glared around at her surroundings, enraged Santiago had left without bringing her along for the ride. She flung herself upon a cushiony landing, letting her arms sprawl and body sink deep into a slumbered place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was disappointed, and it shadowed her pallid features in a dangerous and frightful way. Gazing up at the ceiling, she hungered for his rough touch and she drowned in his lingering scent which was ever present in this room, smelling of Santiago\u2019s sweet blood lust and his ever restless thirst for vengeance. Frowning, Vega ran her hands softly over the velvet cushions, reminiscing myriad occasions of passion and lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly once again, her frown broke into a shimmering smile. This clingy, almost desperate attitude: she was amused by it for it was so unlike her. She wondered vaguely as to where Santiago might have gone to, but growing increasingly restless she realised she could care less about his incessant scheming and how it was undoubtedly associated in some way with tonight\u2019s rendezvous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, tonight was hers. How long had it been since she had exercised her wicked talents on the poor innocents of this city? \u2013 and for reasons other than necessity? A girl after all must make regular occasions to pamper herself in order to maintain good health, strength and general overall happiness. Yes, tonight was the perfect occasion for some late night sport and foolery. The shadowed streets of the city would not be safe tonight. Vega would ensure it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as she had suspected, Santiago was not in the mood and all the taunting she had carefully laid out to get his blood boiling did not seem to phase him this time.  Vega had noticed him paying special attention to one of the New Dawn Clan lately.  She would have torn Delilah apart the first time Santiago looked her way, but she was smart enough to know better.  Santiago would have torn her apart.  Normally, she was a fierce fighter and was afraid of nothing, but Santiago.  Besides, her better half was developing a plan in his devious little brain which would bring New Dawn to its knees and make him their leader.  A bigger gang meant bigger funds and more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega decided Santiago was a lost cause for her cravings, so she told him she would be gone for a couple of nights and went out into the night to find a new pet.  Stalking came easy for Vega, she loved to play with her food.  It was so much fun to bring their fear up to the point of death.  Adrenaline tasted almost as good as blood itself.  She decided tonight was not a night for low class dining down by the docks, she wanted the taste of wealthy blood.  Wealthy Californian Wine Country blood would taste just right, and maybe she could score a few bucks on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe willed her body into the air.  Flight was not easy for a vampire, it took a lot of strength of mind and stamina of body.  Vega had developed and mastered both over her 200 plus years.  In no time she was in the Napa Valley.  She knew dressed in her Gothic black style she would draw attention, so she used another power she had honed, her dark magic power of imaging.  All she had to do was chant a small spell and think who she wanted to look like; she was that person to others, not the scary visage she preferred.  She thought of Delilah dressed in skinny jeans, a pink sweater, and pink Keds.  Although the thought just about made her sick, she knew fitting in was crucial to her hunting; no one looked more down home chic than Delilah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega came out of the alley she had landed in, and blended in with the humans on the street.  She had to choose her quarry carefully.  The timid and shy were usually the funnest, because they would get the most agitated the fastest.  They were so much fun to play with, but she wanted to find a business man.  A vineyard owner this time.  Maybe she would take on a whole family, and let her new pet watch their family die one by one.  Then she could take him home with her and make him her sex slave for a week or two, or maybe just a night or two.  She hadn't made up her mind yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was walking past a quaint diner, she noticed a man looking at her through the glass window.  He looked at her like she was the cherry on top of a hot fudged sunday.  Normally, she would have let him see her true self for just a second, long enough to scare him stupid, but there was something about this man that intrigued her.  She was not quite sure what it was.  She was not even sure if he was a vineyard owner, but she instantly knew she had found her prey.  The one thing which fascinated her the most, was she could not read him.  Usually within a matter of seconds, she knew everything there was to know about a person.  Reading minds was the easiest of a vampire's bag of tricks.  She could not read his mind, and it both fascinated and infuriated her.  Oh, she would enjoy torturing this one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the diner, she sat down at the table of the man she had seen through the window.  He did not say a word at first.  Most men would have tripped all over themselves if a pretty little, tight blond twenty-something girl sat down with them.  Maybe even would have asked what the hell she thought she was doing sitting at his table, but not this guy.  She knew he was not a vamp and she knew he was totally human, she could hear the blood running through his veins.  She wondered if maybe he were a werewolf, but then she thought, <i>No, not a werewolf.  Don't stink like wet dog.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hand out and said, \"Hi, I am Carl.  What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took his hand and shook it and returned cattily, \"I am Delilah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to meet you, Delilah.  What made you come in and sit down at my table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.  I found your smile interesting, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like something to eat or drink?\" he asked her, brandishing that charming smile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you,\" she told him, trying harder to read him without success.  He reminded her a lot of Santiago with his dark good looks, which should have been a warning, but she was too intrigued with him to catch the signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want then?\" he asked her point blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I am new here.  Can you tell me where I can find a room?\" she asked coquettishly, throwing the hint she was available to go home with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is the Napa Valley Inn, which is nice and reasonably priced.  Are you here alone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I just had to get away from my mundane life.  So, I took off and this is where I landed,\"  Vega slyly told him, of course, he did not know how true her statement was, which made it even more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How nice you have graced our small community with your anything-but-mundane presence.\" His smile got bigger.  \"You could always stay in my guest room at my farm if you don't have the funds to get a room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwww...there it was, the invite she had been waiting for.  This was turning out to be so much fun.  She liked this coquettish banter.  Usually, she hunted in secret and her victims never knew she existed until she went in for the capture or kill.  She was looking for different and she had found it.  Lucky her, unlucky him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't your wife and kids be just a little put out if you show up home with me unannounced?\" she asked, twirling a lose strand of hair between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wife, long gone moons ago.  One daughter, living in New York, hasn't bothered to write or call in a very long time.  She won't call until she needs something, probably money, but then again, she has made it pretty big as a model.  Maybe she won't call for anything.\"  The look on his face darkened a little when he talked of his daughter's defection.  He let his guard down for just a second.  She instantly got a vision of his daughter.  She looked a lot like the image of Delilah she was wearing now, young and blond cutsie type.  The block was back up almost as fast as it had went down.  Vega couldn't read him anymore than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry she has made you feel so bad.\"  She put her hand on his, sensing that maybe Daddy had a thing for his daughter, and that is why he had become interested in her, she said, \"I wouldn't hurt you like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaken a little aback by her forwardness, he snatched his hand away like he had been caught being nasty with her or something.  She stood up and acted like she had gone to far and was apologetic, \"I am so sorry.  I didn't mean to offend you.  I like you, your nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes softened as he fell for her false sincerity, \"Oh you didn't offend me.  I just was being overly sentimental about my daughter.  It was my fault.\"  He whispered in her ear so no one else would hear, \"Would you like to stay at my place or would you like a ride to the inn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispered back with soft vampishness, \"I will stay with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega walked out into the chilly night air, not really feeling the cold.  She went to the only cherry red pickup in the lot, unlocked the passenger side door, climbed in and started the engine with the keys as he had instructed her to do, before he went up to the counter to pay for his meal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just didn't know what to think of this guy.  There were warning bells going off with her vampire senses, but she also thought herself invincible so she didn't heed them.  She knew she could handle any situation, having been put in quite a few situations of close call over her vast years.  She knew no fear of anything or anyone, but Santiago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe climbed into the truck and they pulled out into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was something about smelling fish and river water that really fine tuned his senses so he could concentrate on every muscle, every movement, every breath, every swish and sway of his swords as they sliced through the air at invisible foes.  He practiced as often as he could, finding it both refreshing and stimulating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin was always looking for action.  Whenever there was a fight, he was always there to help out Santiago.  He didn't know why he was so loyal to the vampire, Santiago had no honor whatsoever, but Jin found that he was attracted to Santiago's power.  Such an ancient force, cruel and heartless, but a vampire who stood the test of time and still lives to tell his tale.  Jin admired that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging his swords, he danced them above his head, making light foot work before he brought them slicing down, their light metal blades shining in the moonlight.  Jin looked up at the moon.  In a couple days, it would be a full moon.  The wolves would be restless.  Jin hoped one would come his way.  Of all the creatures of the night, Jin hated werewolves most of all.  Shaggy mutts that didn't deserve the romantic title given to them.  Jin would kill them all if he could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise to his right brought Jin's eyes back down to earth.  He paused for only a second, listening for a noise to tell him where his stalker was.  A short intake of breath gave him away and Jin spun, swords flying.  It was a flurry of motion and had Jin really wanted to kill the person, they wouldn't have known what hit them.  But Jin brought his blades to a stop just centimeters away from the person's neck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn't seem phased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still playing with blades, I see,\" the man said, bringing a hand up and pushing Jin's sword away.  Jin let him move it a bit before he lowered both to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Jin asked, bitterly as he turned around and went back to his swordplay, moving and spinning, showing off some, but listening to the man.  He still didn't fully trust him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grinned and sat down on a pile of crates to Jin's right, watching the vampire move so gracefully.  \"I have a proposition.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't do business with hunters,\" Jin said coldly.  For that's what this man was.  A hunter.  A slayer.  A mortal who took on immortals.  Jin hated his kind.  He'd seen too many good vampires brought down by hunters like him.  And one day, Jin suspected that one would bring him down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll want to hear this,\" the man said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin growled and sheathed his swords on his back before turning towards him.  \"Caleb, you test my patience.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems your master and I have a common enemy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJin frowned.  \"I'm listening.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to help me kill them.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mingmei laughed when Sasha startled as she brushed some of his blonde hair out of his eyes.  She'd come into his room seeking company.  He quarters were lonely these days.  It had been so long since Santiago had sent her out after anyone.  She was growing bored.  The abandoned museum that the Blood Saints called home was big and practically empty.  She hated it, but she went where Santiago went.  She was his property afterall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Ming,\" Sasha breathed out, his voice a little shaky, still somewhat startled to find her in his room.  She'd woken up him from his rest.  \"You scared the crap out of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling softly, she sat on the edge of his bed and leaned over him, stroking the side of his face.  Sasha looked confused at the gesture.  God, it had been so long since she'd been with anyone.  She'd grown up having men force themselves on her nearly every night.  It had become such a habit of hers that when Santiago bought her and the nightly visits had stopped, she'd felt just how addicted to it she'd become.  It felt as though she wasn't doing her duty.  As if there was a job she wasn't completeing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to,\" she whispered, leaning down and kissing his forehead softly.  He frowned a bit deeper from the contact before he brought his hands up and placed them on her shoulders, pushing her away from him.  She gave him a grin.  \"Sasha,\" she said to him plainly.  \"I want to fuck you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sasha squawked.  He laughed incredulously and pushed her back further as he sat up.  \"Ming, I'm flattered and all, but no way,\" he said with a vehement shake of his head.  \"You're like a praying mantis.  You'd bite off my head and then fuck my body just because you need a lay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMingmei frowned at that.  \"That's not nice to say,\" she whined, pouting a little as she ran her fingers over Sasha's chest and shoulders.  He looked uncomfortable and grabbed her wrists, pushing her away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true,\" he argued, swinging his legs off his bed and pulling on a pair of jeans as he stood up.  Mingmei watched him move.  He didn't have the grace of the other, older vampires yet.  He still moved like a human.  But his body was practically perfect.  Every inch of him was clear skin and his muscles were defined, solid, toned.  She'd been attracted to him from day one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if it is,\" Mingmei said, standing up too and following him as he walked over to his closet and pulled out a hoodie.  She smiled at his wardrobe.  He was still so human, even after 150 years.  \"I wouldn't kill you,\" she said evenly.  \"Maybe maim you, but I won't kill...\" she purred as she pushed up against him, shoving him into the wall, where he let out a laugh that sounded half nervous, half real.  \"Come on, just one quick fuck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he said and pushed her away again.  \"You're my clan member, I don't want to make this awkward.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMingmei groaned as he slipped past her and walked back over to his bed, tidying it up.  \"Sasha, you're a vampire, start fucking acting like one.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha froze and stopped what he was doing.  He turned his head to look at her, hurt written all over his face.  \"What's that supposed to mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means you're still so human I can pracitcally hear your heart beating,\" she told him and watched as anger, sadness and humor flickered across his face all at once.  She didn't give him time to argue.  \"Clan members are meant to fuck,\" she said.  \"Santiago and Vega do it all the time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha wrinkled up his nose.  \"Don't remind me.\"  He turned and headed to the other end of the room, pulling open a chest where he had his weapons stashed.  He pulled out a handgun and stuffed it into the back of his jeans.  \"They're mates, they're supposed to do that.  You're not my mate, you just want my body.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMingmei didn't fail to hear the pride in that last statement.  She grinned.  \"We don't have to be mates to have sex.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we do,\" Sasha said, closing his weapons chest and turning to square off against her again.  \"It would be too awkward.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMingmei sauntered over to him, watching his shoulders tense and he gulped when she got near to him.  She ran a finger along his breast bone, biting her lower lip.  \"It doesn't have to be,\" she whispered.  \"Vega and Caspar fuck all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha's eyes widened at that.  \"Are you serious?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMingmei pressed her body into his, her mouth near his neck, he held his hands in front of him, holding her off but not really pushing her away.  She smiled, she was getting somewhere.  \"You've been with this clan for how many years and you've never noticed?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" he started, but she cut him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me open your eyes,\" she said and started kissing his neck. </span></div></div>",

For a minute Sasha saw stars.  Pain exploded in the side of his head from where he was still reeling from the slap.  After only a moment, his head started to clear.  He could feel his brother's hands on his arms, holding him up and in place.  Thank God for Vanya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sasha brought his head back around, he found that Santiago was pacing back and forth, looking much like a caged tiger, which was making Mingmei look both distressed and interested at the same time.  The other Blood Saints were watching him, waiting for him to say something.  Vanya tightened his grip a little before letting go and coming to Sasha's side, looking him in the face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" Vanya whispered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasha nodded and brought a hand up to his head.  He felt the gash on the side of his face that was already healing, almost closed.  Santiago could sure pack a whallop.  And this time Sasha hadn't even done anything to deserve it.  Santiago had just been attacking the messenger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier, Sasha and Vanya had been spying on Aubrey's club under Santiago's orders.  Santiago and Aubrey had been going head to head for a while now and there were rumors floating around that Aubrey was gathering his allies close to him, ready to attack Santiago and finish this feud once and for all.  Santiago had been furious at the rumors and for a week now had been stressed out and ill tempered.  He'd sent the twins to spy on the night club to see who was coming in and out.  They'd dreaded to tell him that they'd not only seen Braeden, the leader of the Lupine werewolf pack, but also Ivy and Sloan, the Alpha females of the She-Wolves.  Sasha distantly wondered if there had possibly been a way to tell Santiago without getting the punching bag treatment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else did you see?\" Santiago spat suddenly and Sasha and Vanya turned their heads to face him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanya spoke up this time, since Sasha was still gathering himself from the blow.  \"A few other Lupines and She-Wolves.  There were a couple wolves from other packs and at least one were-snake.  But they could just be going there for fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago glared and growled.  Sasha frowned when Vanya took a step in front of him.  Sasha loved his brother, but sometimes he got too protective.  \"It doesn't matter if they go there for fun or not.  Either way, they're showing their support for that whelp, Aubrey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to take him out,\" Nox said from where he sat perched on a small stone wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him, and the leaders of the packs who follow him,\" Maddock added quietly from where he leaned against the wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bloodbath,\" Vega laughed, licking her lips.  \"My favorite.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need a plan.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vanya sat nervously in his chair, watching as Santiago swirled a finger lazily in his chalice, the blood there staining his finger red.  But Santiago wasn't paying the blood any attention, his eyes were on Vanya and he didn't look happy.  It was never a good thing when Santiago wasn't happy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanya and his twin brother Sasha had followed Santiago for 150 years.  It was a long time, maybe not to Santiago, but to Vanya it was.  He hardly remembered his mortal life.  All he really knew was Santiago and the ways of the Blood Saints.  But it wasn't like the twins had ever been given a choice.  They'd watched Santiago murder their father and then the ancient vampire had turned on them, biting both of them and giving them the immortal life.  They had to follow him, or be left out in the cold.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to do something for me, Vanya,\" Santiago said, his voice slipping into that familiar ancient accent Vanya had grown accustom to.  It was the accent of a dialect of a language that was dead to the modern world.  No mortal would recognize it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanya shifted uneasily in his chair.  \"What can I do?\" he asked nervously.  It wasn't often Santiago came to him.  For important tasks, Santiago usually left them to Maddock or Jin or even Nox.  He rarely gave the twins an important job to do. They were young, with much room for error. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to take care of a pest problem I have,\" Santiago said, finally withdrawing his finger from the blood.  He licked it clean, all the while watching Vanya, who frowned, not understanding.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pest problem?\" Vanya asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Santiago nodded and leaned back in his chair, hooking one leg over the arm and swinging it, looking lazily and bored.  \"That fool Braeden has aligned himself with Aubrey's clan.  That whelp is gathering forces.  I need to show Braeden and the other wolves that they've chosen the wrong side.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanya's eyes widened.  \"You want me to go after Braeden?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago snickered but looked annoyed.  \"Do you really think you're that powerful?  To take on an Alpha male?\"  Vanya shook his head.  \"At least you know your strengths,\" Santiago observed, growing serious again.  \"No, you need a more formidable opponent.  Someone whose death will affect Braeden's entire pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have someone in mind?\" Vanya coaxed, not really liking where this was going.  He could kill someone, he'd done it before, but normally it was out of defense or during a battle.  It wasn't outright murder.  But how could he deny Santiago anything?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A She-Wolf,\" Santiago said plainly and Vanya grit his teeth.  \"Your choice of which one, but I will warn you, the older ones are quite deadly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to kill a She-Wolf?\" Vanya asked quietly.  \"But they're not even aligned with Aubrey's clan.  They're neutral.  They-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are Braeden's greatest weakness aside from the members of his own pack,\" Santiago cut in.  \"Kill one and Braeden will understand the message.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanya shook his head.  \"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why I brought you in and gave you a place in this clan?\" Santiago asked, sitting straight in his chair again and leaning forward.  Vanya stiffened.  Santiago only looked like that when he was making a threat.  Vanya knew when to keep his mouth shut.  \"Because when I killed your father and turned to kill you, you stepped in front of your brother.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To protect him,\" Vanya whispered, remembering the horrible nightmare of that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago nodded.  \"Yes, you protect your brother with a ferocity worthy of a vampire.  You have potential.  Another hundred years and it may be you I am fighting for power with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand,\" Vanya said, though he thought maybe he was starting to see where Santiago was going with this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSantiago stood up, showing that this discussion was almost over.  \"Vanya, you are a worthy vampire, your brother is not.  Sasha is expendable.  I would really hate for anything to happen to him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanya kept the growl from escaping his throat as Santiago left the room.  He leaned back in his chair.  Great.  Kill a She-Wolf or sentence his brother to death.  What choice did he really have?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Caspar watched as Vega walked into Santiago's room.  She closed the door behind her and a few minuts later, he could hear the moans and sounds of sex.  He closed his eyes for a second, imagining what it would be like to get between those gorgeously pale legs of Vega's.  To feel her body against his, to run his fingers over her skin, to hear her moan under his touch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaspar opened his eyes at the thought.  The one thing he'd ever truly wanted and the only one he could never have.  Not without sentencing himself to death.  No one pissed off Santiago, no one.  And Caspar knew that someone sleeping with Santiago's mate was a good enough reason for Santiago to be pissed off as any.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, Caspar made his way down the stairs that opened into the ballroom.  The Blood Saints had made their haven in an abandoned museum, that had at one time been a lavish mansion, before Santiago killed its owners.  Caspar didn't hold it against him, it was a nice house.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping as he was about to enter the kitchen, Caspar put a hand on the doorway, a small smile touching his lips.  It lasted only a second before it turned into a scowl.  For such a big house there sure wasn't enough privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not nice to spy,\" Caspar called out, not turning around or looking anywhere but the spot in front of him.  He heard a cold chuckle ring out behind him, echoing around in the ballroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says the spy,\" the voice called.  Caspar growled and turned finally, quickly spotting the vampire who'd been watching him.  Maddock sat on the railing on one of the balconies that overlooked the ballroom.  He leaned lazily against the wall, swinging a leg while the other was scrunched up near his chest.  Maddock's porcelain mask that he never took off glinted a bit in the dim lighting.  He was twirling a knife, leaving marks in the wood on the railing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaspar had never really gotten along with the other vampire.  But he'd never done anything about it.  Maddock was from Ancient Egypt, older than most vampires and possibly even older than Santiago.  He had skill they hadn't even begun to see.  Caspar enjoyed a good fight, but he'd never fight Maddock, not unless he knew the other vampire didn't have the ability to just kill him by blinking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Caspar asked in a low voice, annoyed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Maddock answered, still twirling the knife.  \"Just observing vampire nature.  Wondering what it's like to love something you can't have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaspar smiled, though there was malice behind the gesture.  \"Are you going to tattle?\" he asked in a mocking voice, but the question was still real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Maddock asked, putting a hand to his chest.  \"I never tattle.\"  He jumped off the railing and onto the balcony, walking back behind the red drapes that blocked off the room behind.  Caspar clenched his fists, but Maddock called to him, \"Unless the price is high enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you,\" Caspar whispered under his breath, not caring if Maddock heard it or not.  He'd said it to the vampire's face before but the other didn't seem to care.  In fact, he'd laughed at having it said to him and Caspar wouldn't be surprised if Maddock enjoyed being sworn at or called names.  He was just that type of vampire.  Loved to get under people's skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaspar felt fury rise up in him at the situation.  Of Maddock's taunts, of Vega's untouchableness, or Santiago's impending wrath.  He needed to release some of this anger.  </span></div></div>",

Sloan was thankful for that.  Although she loved what she did, there were some nights she just needed to take off and have fun with her girls.  Tonight, Sloan, Lavender, Bliss and Wren had decided to head to <i>Eclypse</i>, the nightclub owned by the vampire Aubrey.  It was quickly becoming their favorite hangout, not to mention a safe haven for wolves and vampires and other dark creatures.  No one messed with each other inside <i>Eclypse</i>.  If they did, there'd be a brawl that would claim more lives than it was worth.  So Aubrey and the others in the New Dawn clan did everything they could to keep it peaceful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was a vampire to make nice with, it would be Aubrey.  He took care of the people who followed him.  Sloan, along with her co-Alpha Ivy, had decided they would offer their support to Aubrey should he need it, but they would never officially align with him.  The She-Wolves were neutral unless called upon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will Lanny be there?\" Wren asked from where she walked ahead of them, her voice quiet, her gait smooth.  Sloan and Bliss chuckled as Lavender's face blushed slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Lavender admitted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBliss put an arm around Lavender's shoulders, giving her a squeeze.  \"You gonna have fun with your boy toy tonight?\" she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender pushed her away.  \"I don't know,\" she said, then to get the conversation off of her, she nodded her head towards Sloan.  \"What about you, Sloan?  Mitch is working tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloan paused for a moment and raised her eyebrows at the others, who were watching her with curiosity.  \"Mitch?\" she asked, a smile spreading across her face.  \"Why would I care if Mitch was working?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Sloan, the guy wants you,\" Bliss said.  \"Badly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloan shrugged.  \"Then he knows how to get me,\" she said simply.  \"Tonight I'm hanging with my girls.\" The others chuckled and Sloan laughed with them, though her thoughts went to Mitch, one of the Lupine wolves.  Sloan often did business at the club.  After Lavender had been attacked a few years back by a vampire John, the She-Wolves had wanted to find a way to protect their girls as much as possible.  It had actually been Aubrey's suggestion that they use the club, so if anything should happen, there would always be someone there to help.  Sloan had taken up the offer.  And since then, she did most of her business in the club.  She usually sat at the bar, where Mitch worked, and waited for her trick to show.  She didn't miss the way Mitch watched her or eyed her John's, sizing them up when she walked off with them.  She'd just never thought about it.  She was used to people being attracted to her.  And Mitch was a friend.  That's all.  Just a good friend who liked to look out for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, Wren?\" Lavender was saying as Sloan came back to the present.  \"You've got someone tonight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWren shook her head.  \"No,\" she answered.  \"There weren't any suitable proposals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too picky,\" Sloan said.  \"Some of those guys may have been nice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWren shrugged her slender shoulders.  \"Maybe, but they're not for me.  I'll send them your way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls chuckled as they entered the club. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bliss stood up on a ladder, restocking one of the top shelves in her book store.  It was a good thing she didn't have to do this often, her store really didn't get that much business, but she had a few loyal customers who came in to do all their shopping.  Most of them were teenage goths, looking for spell books or poetry or whatever kids were into these days.  Bliss suspected that part of the reason some of them came back was because they enjoyed the atmosphere of her store.  That dark, gothic, mysterious feel of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth was, Bliss knew most of those books were full of crap.  Some skeeze wanting to make money off of a teenage fetish for all things magic.  She could sell books that said just about anything and her teenage customers would think it was the real deal.  The truth was, it took a lot more than fancy words and blood oaths to get black magic to work.  Give a kid a Quija board and all of a sudden they think they're mediums.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBliss would never give those kids the real books, the ones that gave away secrets no one should know.  Books of the covens, of the packs, of the clans in the world.  Books written by vampires, by werewolves, by witches and hunters and anything else who dealt in the black arts on a daily basis.  Those were the books Bliss kept strictly for herself and for her pack and maybe a few stray true witches here and there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell above the door rang, startling Bliss into almost losing her balance on the ladder.  She let out a yelp and grabbed hold of the top rung to steady it.  She caught her breath and called out, \"We're closed,\" trying to peek around the bookshelves to see who had just come in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rats.\"  Bliss chuckled.  She knew that voice.  Delilah.  \"And here I was, my heart set on a cheesy romance novel.\"  Bliss grinned and watched the blonde vampire walk into the aisle she was working in.  \"Morning, toots.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah.  One of the most cheerful, happy-go-lucky vampires Bliss had ever encountered.  She loved the girl like a sister.  She was the closest friend outside of the pack that Bliss had.  Cute as a button, soft as a teddy bear, and yet she could kick anyone's ass if they messed with one of her friends.  It was a good thing she was on Bliss's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it's a cheesy romance you want,\" Bliss chuckled and climbed down the ladder.  \"Take your pick of gentlemen.  Would you like Fabio or Fabrizio?\"  Delilah laughed and began fingering the books on the shelf next to her, reading some of the titles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither,\" she said.  \"I need a man with intelligence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to find one of those these days,\" Bliss answered and set the box of books she'd been reshelving down.  She stretched her arms up above her head and yawned.  \"You going out tonight?\" she asked, walking towards the counter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah followed her, her footsteps soft, barely noticeable.  Bliss went behind the counter while Delilah jumped up on it and swung her legs, looking all the picture of a bored teenage girl instead of the vampiric killing maching Bliss knew she was.  She supposed that's what she liked about her friend so much.  Her innocent exterior.  Most vampires she knew, and some werewolves, were all about image.  That cool, <i>I'm better and older and wiser than you</i> type image.  But with Delilah, she really didn't care.  She just wanted to have fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about it,\" Delilah answered, chewing on a fingernail.  \"I'm getting hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do a little hunting?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah sighed and pouted.  She turned and gave her friend a pathetic look.  \"I wish there was something worth hunting in this city.  But everyone's just so fatty.  And everyone likes sushi.  You know how sick it makes their blood taste?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBliss laughed and rang out the cash machine for the night, locking it in the lock box beneath the counter.  \"Well I'm sure if you go to <i>Eclypse</i> tonight there will be some young hot stud to feed on,\" Bliss said, referring to the nightclub owned by Delilah's clan leader, Aubrey.  \"Give him a few Long Islands and you're set.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish we had better hunting ground,\" Delilah sighed.  \"I really wish I could go to the East Side.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And get torn apart by Santiago and his nutcases?\" Bliss squawked, locking the front door.  \"I love you too much, sweetie, to let you do that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah suddenly looked mischevious.  She hopped down from the counter, eyes flashing, a smile spreading across her face.  \"Then come with me,\" she said.  \"Bait and trap, it's been so long since you've done with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Bliss shook her head and pocketed her keys, heading for the backdoor.  Delilah was hot on her heals.  \"I am not messing with Santiago.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Delilah begged.  \"We won't stay long.  Just one meal and then we can leave.  He won't even know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBliss sighed and turned to look at her friend.  Delilah pulled out her best puppy dog eyes.   Great.  Now what was she supposed to do?</span></div></div>",

When all three wicks were lit, she blew out the match and laid it into a small Sake cup.  She glanced around the room, taking in the mood.  It was almost perfect.  Candles were lit on just about every hard surface.  The coffee table sat in the middle of the room, a leopard fur lay on the floor in front of a fireplace, which was sporting a nice fire.  There were couches and pillows and a bar.  Elvina had made this her room.  She even had a locked chest with supplies in the corner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was in the back part of <i>Eclypse</i>, the vampire, Aubrey's, club.  The She-Wolves had made a deal with Aubrey.  He'd come to them, in the beginning, asking them if they wouldn't like to use his facilities for their business.  It was right after Lavender, the She-Wolves' youngest member, had been attacked while on a job.  Ivy and Sloan, the Alpha females, had agreed that it would be safer and wiser to use a familiar place.  In return, they provided Aubrey's most esteemed guests with services and also helped out the New Dawn clan if ever there was an encounter with a hunter or a Blood Saint.  Aubrey didn't charge them, but the girls came to the club often enough and bought drinks and pleased customers, bringing them back each night, that it was worth while to have them there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvina was one of the top earners.  Aside from Sloan, who seemed to have an unnatural ability to attract men, Elvina brought in the most customers and was the most sought out She-Wolf.  She wasn't as picky about her clients as the others were.  If they paid well enough, they were good enough for her.  Money was money and that's about the only reason she was in this business.  Yeah, there were nights when the sex was real good, but that was just an added bonus.  Most nights, it was strictly business.  Just a girl, working for her money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight was one of those nights.  She really didn't feel like being here, but she was and she had a client coming.  She wasn't sure who to expect.  Ivy had set up the appointment and Elvina had forgotten to see who it was before she came here.  A part of her hoped it wasn't anyone important, so she could just lay back and let him go.  But another part of her yearned for someone who would peak her interest.  Someone who would make the night worthwhile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, there were other ways to make nights worthwhile.  She checked the time.  She still had a few minutes before her John showed.  That gave her time to make things a bit more interesting.  She crossed the room to the bar.  She poured two drinks, one for herself and one for her client.  Martinis, the way she liked them.  She downed hers in one gulp, shaking her head at the burn before pouring herself another.  Then, she reached into a hidden compartment on the bar and pulled out a small packet.  Cocaine hardly had any effect on a werewolf.  So Elvina mixed hers with silver dust.  Not too much.  The stuff would kill her if she ingested too much.  But just enough to make it worthwhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpreading out a line on the bar top, she rolled up a bill and quickly snorted it.  The burn was short lived.  Almost immediately, her body started to relax.  She blinked heavily, before smiling to herself, feeling the drugs take an effect in her system.  That was more like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvina unbuttoned her pants and slipped them off, left in her black lacey underwear.  She left her shirt on, a small black top that left her stomach exposed.  Lace sleeves went down to cling to her fingers.  It was her favorite get up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her hair back and flung it over her shoulder as she laid down on the couch, positioning herself in wait for the John.  The room was a euphoric hue now.  And when the knock on the door came, Elvina was a bit more accepting of the night that awaited her. </span></div></div>",

With his free hand he pointed to his head he was to weak to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is... oh my god\" said Ivy as she came rushing into the room followed closely by solan,aburey and fin. Elvina passed the note around with the same reaction. The boys eyes where wide with fear.\"Where is the rest\" aburey said as he reached down and riped the sleave revealing a tattoo of the hunters \"hunter\" he added with venom in his voice. \"He cant speak he's to weak buut he poinded to his head earlier\" chimed in Elvina ' well we have to save him call an ambulance. \"It's to late his heart is slowing down\" said aburey.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ivy sat in a corner booth of the <i>Eclypse</i>, the club owned by Aubrey, who was the leader of the New Dawn vampire clan.  It was a pretty popular hangout for all supernatural beings.  Even as she sat there, she saw a lot of familiar faces making in the crowd.  Some vampires, some wolves, even a few of the more rare beings.  Ivy spotted a few of her girls out on the dance floor.  Sloan, her co-Alpha, was dancing with someone Ivy had never seen before.  Tatum and Wren seemed to be just dancing for the sake of dancing, and Lavender was there with Lanny, her boyfriend.  Ivy smiled to herself.  She was happy for Lavender.  It took a brave person to recover from what the girl had gone through, being attacked by a John.  But she had.  And Lanny was a great guy.  Cute too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy was too busy watching her girls on the dance floor that she didn't notice as someone slipped into the booth with her.  It was a few seconds before she reached for her drink and found that it wasn't where she placed it.  Almost immediately, her senses kicked into overdrive and she spun in her chair, wondering what imbecile had that gall to toy with her.  But her anger instantly dissapated as she found it was Aubrey who now sat next to her, a quaint smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Ivy,\" he said smoothly, his voice like silk.  Aubrey had that type of power over anyone.  He was smooth and soft and sly.  Even Ivy, who found the objects of her desires to be more feminine, had to admit that Aubrey was the type of vampire that could send a chill up anyone's spine.  In a good way of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aubrey,\" Ivy breathed, instantly relaxing.  She had nothing to fear from this vampire, who had given girls so much.  He'd allowed them the use of his club as a home base for their services.  \"I hate it when you sneak up on me,\" she said, though there was a playful glint in her eyes that always seemed to be there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey chuckled softly and moved her drink back over, gliding it across the table without sloshing the liquid inside.  That was a vampiric talent.  \"Forgive me, angel,\" he said.  That was another thing about Aubrey.  He called all the girls he knew, \"angel.\"  Ivy knew it annoyed some of them, but she found it endearing.  If he called you that nickname, it meant he thought highly of you and respected you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty busy tonight I see,\" Ivy remarked, nodding her head toward the crowd.  Aubrey looked over and scanned everyone, though a rather unapproving quirk had graced his lips.  Ivy frowned.  \"Something wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were hunters here today.\"  Ivy froze at the words.  It was the last thing she'd expected.  Hunters?  Here at the club?  She was immediately outraged that she hadn't been told about it.  Hunters coming to a vampire hangout was never a good thing.  Why wasn't there a blood bath in here?  Why didn't Aubrey seem too perterbed?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here?\" Ivy squawked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey nodded, pulling a flask out of his back pocket.  It was a silver color, not real of course, with a rose engraved into it.  Aubrey loved roses.  He unscrewed the top and took a swig before closing it up and slipping it back into his pocket.  Ivy never asked what he kept in there.  Alcohol had no effect on vampires and Ivy didn't think that Aubrey would just drink whiskey for the aesthetic reasons.  She had always just assumed it was blood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he nodded.  \"During the day.  While I slept.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Ivy asked, wondering what the hell was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAubrey sighed and leaned back.  \"They spoke with Ulric.\"  The vampire was referring to a werewolf friend that he had.  Ulric was in the Lupine pack and a good friend of not only Aubrey but the She-Wolves as well.  \"Said this was a warning.  They respect vampires who don't kill their food, so they respect an establishment that promotes that sort of being.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the warning?\" Ivy asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems a young couple and their infant son were killed two nights ago on the East side,\" Aubrey said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy sucked in a breath.  \"East side?  Santiago.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem,\" Aubrey said, but then ran a hand over his face, looking more human than Ivy had ever seen him.  \"But they were killed by a werewolf.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy shook her head.  \"No one in my pack would do that.  Nor in the Lupine pack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Aubrey said.  \"But if it happens again, they're not going to risk letting us live anymore.  They're going to kill everyone.  Werewolves and vampires.  We need to find who did it and make sure it doesn't happen again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy leaned back, mirroring Aubrey's dejected look.  \"How do we do that?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lavender pulled her shirt on, straightening it watching herself in the mirror.  She turned around, examining her whole body.  Her tube top was leopard print and she wore red pants that were tiger print.  It was an odd combination, but it was her style.  What was more important, this was Lanny's favorite outfit of hers.  He said it made her look primal.  Primal and \"hot as fuck.\"  She smiled to herself as she could practically hear his voice inside her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanny was by far the best thing that had ever happened to her.  Her whole life, she'd been lost and confused and when she was bitten by a werewolf, things only got worse.  She'd joined the She-Wolves and had found a home with them.  For a while, she'd thought things were going to be okay.  Though she didn't particularly like prostitution, she did it, to help out her pack.  But when that vampire had attacked her, she'd been just as lost as ever.  The nightmare of that night still came back to haunt her.  The only difference now was that she had Lanny.  The first guy that made her feel like she was worth something.  They'd been together for nearly a year now.  In two days would be their one year anniversary.  It was the longest Lavender had ever stayed with a guy without fucking him.  That had to mean something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were planning on celebrating tonight.  Maybe they'd go out to the <i>Eclypse</i>, the nightclub owned by Aubrey.  Or maybe they'd find something else to do.  Whatever it was, Lavender was happy to be spending the time with Lanny.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clock, she realized that he'd be there any second.  Lavender gave herself one more look in the mirror before she jumped up and ran to her kitchen.  Lavender lived in a small, one bedroom apartment.  She shared it with Manhattan, but the other girl was never home.  So it felt like she had the place to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was straightening up the kitchen, for what reason she had no idea because Lanny was a bigger pig than she was, her cell phone rang.  She fumbled with the phone and finally answered it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lavender, sweetheart,\" came Sloan's voice over the phone.  Sloan was one of the Alpha's of her pack.  She was also a dear friend and almost a mother figure to Lavender.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sloan,\" she said, hopping up onto her counter and swinging her legs, kicking the drawers with the heel of her boots.  \"What's up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, dear,\" she said, then got right down to business.  \"Look, I can't talk long, I've got a client waiting for me.  But I just wanted to call and let you know to be careful tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  Is something wrong?\" Lavender asked, fear instantly spiking in her chest.  She hated when she got so nervous.  But ever since the attack, she'd been jumpy and scared of just about everything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloan said something to someone in the room before answering Lavender's question.  \"No, nothing's wrong.  There's just been a lot of hunter activity lately.  I'm looking out for my girls.  You'll have Lanny with you tonight, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he should be here any minute,\" Lavender said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Sloan answered.  \"Well have fun tonight.  If you need me, just call.  I'll have my phone on.  This client likes it when I'm distracted.\" Sloan gave a funny laugh to which Lavender chuckled.  Sloan always got the weird clients.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night, sweetheart,\" Sloan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night, Sloan,\" Lavender answered and then hung up.  Just as she did, the doorbell rang.  </span></div></div>",

A plaid mini-skirt, a gray button up shirt that showed off her well endowed cleavage, and the black choker she always wore when out on the job.  She was hoping to make a little extra cash tonight.  Business had been slow lately and rent was due on the apartment she shared with Lavender.  It wasn't like she couldn't just ask Ivy or Sloan for a loan, but she liked to be a self-sufficient person.  She liked doing things for herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNights in the city were always Manhattan's favorite time of day.  Not only because she had more of a chance of finding a vampire to fuck, which was her absolute favorite, they all fucked like gods, but also because she just liked the look of the streets in the dark.  The orange glow of streetlights, the mystic look of the steam traveling up through the sewer drains.  The lack of people traveling down the street.  She loved it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the other girls never understood why Manhattan worked the streets when Ivy could score her some big time players if she really wanted them.  Hell, Manhattan could barely explain it.  Perhaps she just had a fetish for danger.  She was an adrenaline junkie.  Fucking a stranger, not knowing if he really was just there for the sex or for something else, it was thrilling to her.  Exciting.  Plus, no one fun got pass Ivy's screening.  Manhattan couldn't stand some of the prissy rich boys that Ivy scheduled for her.  She wanted the real guys.  The guys who had no other way to get laid than to pay for it.  The guys who just wanted to fuck and fuck hard and fuck long.  Those were her favorites.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a dangerous life, but Manhattan loved it.  Sure, to some it was degrading, but to her, she was experiencing new things every night.  She was seeing another side of the city besides just the ones she saw under the shelther of Ivy and Sloan's protection.  She liked this gritty life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car pulled up beside her, startling her out of her thoughts.  But she instantly recovered and gave a seductive grin at the window.  It was tinted and she couldn't really see inside.  She bent over, making sure to expose her cleavage a bit more.  To her delight, the window rolled down.  There was a man sitting inside.  She didn't recognize him.  He had black hair and a goatee.  He looked fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do for you?\" Manhattan asked, coming closer to the car, trying to look as pleasant and irresistable as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiled at her and scooted closer to the window.  \"How much will a thousand dollars buy me?\" he asked, his voice smooth and low.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManhattan's eyes widened at that.  She was unable to keep the shock off her face.  That was a hefty price.  She'd struck gold.  \"Honey, that will buy you an entire evening of anything you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" he asked, eyes mischevious.  Manhattan felt a warning bell ring in her head at the tone of his voice.  But this guy seemed too good to pass up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything,\" she assured him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached over and opened the door.  She looked inside and saw he was alone aside from his driver.  There was champagne and glasses in the car.  It looked like he had a fun night planned.  But still, that tone he'd used.  She was starting to question what he had in mind. </span></div></div>",

She was walking home from another exciting evening at <i>Eclypse.</i>  Nothing big had happened, but the club was always fun.  It had looked like Elvina had a good client.  Some big hot shot vampire from the looks of it.  Lucky girl.  And Ivy had been as fiesty as ever.  She'd left a decent sized hicky on Tatum's neck.  She smiled at the thought of the Alpha female.

She didn't know what could tear them apart.  \"Want me to go check on her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you?\" Ivy asked.  \"I would do it, but I need to be around when Elvina's client leaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, babe,\" Tatum said.  \"I'll head over to her apartment right now.  Manhattan's probably home by now, but I think she's gonna need someone a little more compassionate than that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvy laughed again.  \"Right.  Thanks, love!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time,\" Tatum said.  \"Hey what are you doing tomorrow?  Wanna catch breakfast?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet,\" Ivy said.  \"I'll pick you up at seven.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good god, girl, I don't get up that early.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, seven thirty,\" Ivy said.  \"I can't wait that long to see you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're flattering.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed, said their goodbyes and then hung up.  Tatum pocketed her phone again, still smiling.  But that smile soon faded as she caught a whif of the air.  She'd been so preoccupied on the phone that she hadn't noticed the change in the air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was following her. </span></div></div>",

He was a business man, some big shot executive in a computer software company or something.  They hadn't discussed his work yet, so Wren didn't know.  He wasn't married and didn't have any kids.  Both were something Wren liked in her clients.  And he was completely and utterly human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was usually Ivy who screened the clients of the girls.  Wren trusted Ivy's judgement on people.  That's why she'd yes to meeting this guy.  Ivy had okay-ed him, put his name on the safe list, and let him have his pick.  Wren knew he'd been with Sloan and Elvina both.  She'd asked the other girls about him and they had both said he paid well but fucked better.  Not the most elegant of descriptions, but Wren knew what they meant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when he'd asked Ivy if he could pay for Wren's services, Wren had decided to give the man a chance and invite him out to dinner.  It was the way she screened her clients.  She didn't sleep with just anyone.  Wren liked gentlemen.  She liked men who knew how to treat a woman right.  She didn't want to be just a tool or a quick lay.  She wanted to be an endeavour for the men she provided her services to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, this guy, whose name was Jack Lacey, was looking promising.  She'd let him choose the spot to eat dinner, the first test of a man's worth.  Jack had chosen a Sushi place.  It wasn't as lavish as some of the places her prospective clients took her to, but it was nice.  She liked it.  Not to mention, the wolf inside her loved to eat raw meat and any excuse she could find to do so in front of a client, she would take it.  Most of her clients didn't know she was a werewolf.  Hell, most of them didn't know werewolves, or any other creature of the night for that matter, even existed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like it?\" Jack asked and Wren smiled again at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good,\" she said.  It was time for test number two.  \"But I can't get a hang of these chopsticks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack laughed, picked his napkin up and wiped his mouth before leaning across the table.  \"Let me show you,\" he said.  With both hands, he placed the chopsticks into Wren's slender fingers, molding her hand into the right position gently.  She watched his face as he did so.  He was so concentrated, so willing to help.  He passed test number two.  Wren had known how to use chopsticks, she just wanted to see how he handled it. \"There, now pinch these fingers together,\" he said looking up at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\" Wren asked, purposely pinching to hard and the California Roll slid out of her grasp.  She smiled and let out a laugh.  \"I don't think I'll ever get this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack chuckled and took the chopsticks from her hand.  \"Here, like this,\" he said, picking up the food with the chopsticks and holding it up for her to eat, holding his hand underneath it to keep it from dripping on her black Kimono-like shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWren smiled at him wontingly and took the food from his chopsticks, chewing it and swallowing.  He watched her the whole time.  \"I think I'll stick forks,\" she said, looking down in a feign of shyness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get it,\" Jack said, smiling at her again.  \"You just need to practice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a good man, she decided.  But she was a bit distressed over the fact that she was beginning to like him.  She liked to keep these things very business-like.  She didn't like letting her emotions get involved.  It could get dangerous.  But the way he was looking at her, the kindness in his eyes, maybe she was willing to give him a shot?</span></div></div>",

In Central Park, only litter stirred. If anything, the beasts wouldn't be noticed in the still darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the crooked trees were thin shafts of light cast from the mystical full moon above the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twig snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" muttered Ulric, chuckling out of amusement. \"Some bait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple strolled on a path; one tall male in a beige jacket and a blond woman speaking indistinctly on her cellphone, now holding up an umbrella. Little did they knew that something lurked near them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlric stared, not daring to say a word, for he saw a pale, scrawny woman dressed in gothic attire creeping from behind. Her dyed-red hair whipped around as she glanced into the darkness with immortal eyes, searching for any sign of a trap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recognized her as Vega of the Blood Saints and cringed once she looked in his direction. Strangely she did not see him. He knew that once a vampire from the Blood Saint sees a werewolf, there would be utter chaos. Especially with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVega continued stalking her prey. He exhaled sharply and tensed. He glanced over his shoulder to meet his best friend's gaze. Mitch smiled, baring wolfish fangs, his skin bristling into pitch-black fur.

A lot of stray vampires lurked here and there, hoping to feed.  Mitch had to keep his eye on them.  He, along with Ulric, helped the New Dawn Clan and Aubrey keep the vampires who frequented the club in line.  It was a house rule that no vampire was to take the life of their victim.  They were to feed and let go.  Let the person go home and wake up in the morning thinking they had one hell of a hang over.  In all the time that Mitch had been helping out Aubrey, only one vampire had ever broken that rule.  And it turned out it was a Blood Saint.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a bartender in this club had its perks.  He got in free, got free drinks, got paid well, got tipped well, got the respect of the vampires and werewolves and everything else the frequented the club, but most of all, Mitch got the respect of the She-Wolves who used the club to do their business.  And there was one She-Wolf in particular that made Mitch love his job.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSloan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the most beautiful, funny, smart, and sweet girls Mitch had ever come across.  She was an Alpha of the She-Wolves and she was also the main attraction in the club whenever she came around.  People paid good money to aquire her services.  It bothered Mitch sometimes.  Some of the guys she attracted weren't the best.  He kept a close eye on who she walked off with every night.  If anything happened to her, there'd be hell to pay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitch!\" he turned when he heard his name.  Quinn had come up to the bar, grinning like an idiot.  Mitch snorted.  Quinn was the youngest vampire in Aubrey's clan.  He was young, naive, and sometimes cocky.  But he was a good kid.  Loyal and honest.  Which Mitch supposed he got from Fin, one of the vampires who sired him.  He sure as hell didn't get it from Lesmana, the other who sired him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kid,\" Mitch said, walking over so he was standing in front of him.  \"What's your poison?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O Positive?\" Quinn tried, chuckling already at his own joke.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch snorted.  \"Fresh out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Quinn pretended to be upset.  \"How about Captain on the rocks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it,\" Mitch said, pulling out his bottle of Captain Morgan.  He poured Quinn a generous helping, something he did for all of his friends.  He set it down in front of him and said, \"Good hunting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, man,\" Quinn said, raised his glass and toasted Mitch before sipping it and walking off.  Mitch chuckled a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the bottle away, he scanned the crowd again.  His eyes settled on a group of girls who had just entered.  His heart skipped as he saw they were She-Wolves.  Wren, Lavender, and Sloan to be exact.  And Sloan was looking as lovely as ever.  She wore a white sundress that rode up high on her thighs.  Her blonde hair fell down around her shoulders and she just seemed to glow with beauty.  She was gorgeous.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mitch would never pay to sleep with her.  He would never degrade her like that.  And because he had morals, she was off limits to him.  Unless he could convince her to try a relationship, which was something she adamantly protested against ever doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group made their way down onto the club floor.  Mitch watched them as they went, already dancing even before they got to the dance floor.  Sloan moved like an angel. </span></div></div>",

It was early in the morning.  The vampires had retired to their respective resting spots and most of his clan and others were just getting to bed.  But not Braeden.  He loved early morning.  He usually went home early in the night and got to sleep so he could wake up and enjoy the quiet, peaceful hours before the world awoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were slow during these few quiet hours.  The noise dimmed, trouble seemed to fade, and Braeden could let himself relax.  As Alpha male of his pack, he dealt with a wide array of troubles on a daily basis.  This was always his time to get away from that all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his eyes closed, Braeden listened to the birds outside his window.  It was something he seldom had a chance to hear anymore.  Living in the inner city, there wasn't much wildlife except for pigeons and Blood Saints.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraeden's quiet morning of peacefulness was suddenly broken as someone started knocking harshly on his front door.  Braeden opened his eyes.  The sun was up, so it wasn't a vampire.  Probably one of his pack.  He was almost tempted to let them keep knocking for a while.  But the tone of their knock was a bit off, something was wrong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, Braeden stood and walked out of his bedroom.  He owned his own house on the outskirts of the city.  He didn't spend much time here, opting to stay in the Lupine haven in the city most of the time.  But sometimes, he just needed to get away from it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the front door, he pulled it open and found Ulric standing outside, panting, looking almost frantic.  Braeden sobered instantly.  When Ulric got worked up, it was for a good reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Braeden,\" Ulric breathed, trying to catch his breath.  Braeden guessed that the wolf had run here.  He didn't see a car anywhere.  \"We have a problem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" </span></div></div>",

But once he'd gotten there and had heard that Manhattan was waiting for a client, he couldn't pass up the opportunity.  Manhattan was his favorite.  They were friends and both of them knew that the sex was merely business.  That's why he liked her so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me again,\" Donovan confirmed.  \"Were you expecting anyone else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's three times this week, Donnie,\" Manhattan said, though he could see the playfulness on her face.

It was a good room for a frisky romp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just going to sit there and let me do all the work?\" Manhattan asked as she closed the door and locked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want to do,\" he answered, grinning. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lewis stood outside of <i>Eclypse</i>, the club owned by Aubrey, his clan leader.  It was a brisk night and he was doning his denim jacket.  He didn't care what Lanny might say, denim studded jackets weren't just a style of the 80's.  Even if they were, Lewis was bringing them back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe club was already hopping.  Mitch was working tonight as a bartender there and a few of the other Lupines were inside, living up the night.  He'd come to see Ulric, really.  But the other wolf hadn't shown up yet and Lewis hadn't wanted to go inside.  He wasn't a huge fan of the club when it was busy and bustling.  He liked Aubrey well enough, but the club just wasn't for him.  It was better when there was a lesser crowd and Lewis didn't feel like he was hiding a secret from so many people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis was still getting used to being a werewolf.  There were impulses and nuances he was still trying to get used to.  Whenever he was around a mortal, a regular human being, it seemed to him that he stood out like a sore thumb.  Like everyone in the world would be able to tell that there just wasn't something right with this one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, he didn't know how the others did it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lupine pack was more a family to Lewis than any he'd ever had.  They taught him things about being a werewolf, about dealing with the urges.  But it took time.  Even the most veteran wolves still sometimes fell prey to their own urges.  Primal urges.  Guttural urges.  Mainly, the urge for blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a werewolf wasn't like being a vampire where you had to drink blood to survive, thank god.  Lewis didn't think he could handle that.  But wolves still got the hunger to taste blood, to feel flesh in their mouth, to shred skin with their teeth, to tear meat with their claws.  Every once in a while, the animal showed up.  And it was those urges that Lewis had the most trouble controling.  The animal urges, the ones he wasn't used to as a human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLately, it had been getting worse.  It always got worse around the full moon, but for some reason, this lunar cycle was the worse so far.  It was still three days until the full moon but already Lewis was feeling the pull.  Most werewolves lose themselves during their first few full moons.  That's why Lewis stuck with the pack.  They could help control him when his animal instincts took over.  They wouldn't let him hurt any body.  Lewis had never fully given in, he'd never fully lost control of himself.  But he felt like this time was different.  This time he actually might lose himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlric was going to be his babysitter until the full moon was over.  But he was late and Lewis was getting antsy.  Besides, it wasn't really fair to make Ulric watch him for four days straight.  It wasn't fair for Ulric.  The other wolf had a lot of things to deal with, he didn't need to be babysitting pups.  And Lewis had overheard a few patrons of the club talking about something that may help.  Something that soothed the urges, that mellowed the body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPixie dust.  That's what they'd called it.  Lewis doubted it was actual pixie dust, though it was entirely a true possibility.  No, it was a drug.  A drug for an immortal.  Lewis knew where to get some, he'd heard who sold it and where to find him.  The only question was, would he rather wait for Ulric, or try out this drug?</span></div></div>",

Dark eyes took a moment to glance over her shoulder at the still naked vampire sitting on the edge of the bed, a sheet pulled carelessly over his waist. Silver hair was tangled and hanging carelessly in his face, and she took a moment to push it behind his ear. \u201cNothing,\u201d he said, shaking his head and lying to her like she couldn\u2019t recognize it after six hundred years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you Aubrey. You know I hate it when you try to lie to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head and smiled back at her. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, rolling her dark eyes at him and planting a kiss on his lips. \u201cYou can be so difficult sometimes,\u201d she told him with a smile, before standing up and reaching for her shirt. They were lovers, of a sort, but they were not in love. She had no illusions about their relationship, and once she had understood what it was, she had been fine with it. She wished that it could be love, but after six hundred years, she was not the romantic girl she\u2019d once been. She had thought she\u2019d been in love with Santiago as well, and now he was fucking that vampiress whore of his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t really her concern anymore, but she did have her pride, and it stung, at the moment. Still. She did not need Santiago, just as she did not need Aubrey, but out of the two she knew which one she would rather be with. A hand ran through his silver hair again, drawing his distracted eyes. \u201cI know something is bothering you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked, eyes falling to her form. A hand reached out to rest on her hip, fingers digging in a little more tightly than intended. \u201cOnly that this lovely creature in front of me is about to leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed, turning away to pull a white shirt on. \u201cYou should be used to it by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, sighing slightly. \u201cWill you be at the club tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, running fingers through her hair to try and untangle it. It wasn\u2019t working out very well, but she imagined that by the time she got out of the room and onto the street it would fix itself. Still, she felt the need to do something with her fingers, because she didn\u2019t want Aubrey to know how much it did bother her that he wouldn\u2019t confide what it was that was on his mind. She imagined it was probably the Blood Saints moving in on his territory again. They\u2019d been getting bolder lately, particularly Vega. A snarl wanted to rise in her throat at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like such a human thing, she thought wryly. To be kicked to the curb by the younger woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said after a moment, adjusting her appearance with quick and expert fingers. \u201cI have business of my own to take care, and I\u2019m afraid dear that you\u2019re just not invited.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mock pouted at her, reaching out a hand and pulling her back to the bedside, fingers sliding under skintight clothing and running against her skin. She ignored the faint chill that his touch sent up her spine, smiling down at him and letting her hands run through his hair again. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you mind,\u201d she smirked. \u201cYou\u2019ve never interfered with my business before, and I know you\u2019re not interested now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pout deepened. \u201cYou offend me, madam. To imply that I do not care\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs a perfectly reasonable statement.\u201d Her smiled took the sting out of it, and leaned down to kiss him again, this time longer and deeper. \u201cDo not pretend that we are other than what we are, love,\u201d she ran her fingers along his cheek, studying him carefully. It was his eyes that really got her, those eyes that were so much younger than hers, and yet still full of so much life. It made her remember what it was to be human, and that was a dangerous thing for any vampire. \u201cI have accepted that I am not the one for you, do not make that harder by teasing me so often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frown creased his perfect features. \u201cMarcella, I meant no offense. Are you alright, this is not like you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, resting her forehead on top of his for a moment. \u201cOld wounds ache tonight,\u201d she whispered, kissing his skin one last time. She forced a smile, before turning away. \u201cI might see you later,\u201d she said with a wave of her fingers. \u201cBut don't wait up for me.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He's an ancient vampire.  None really know how old he is except Santiago himself.  He's vicious and cruel.  He's fighting for control of the vampires in New York.  He despises werewolves and would like to see them either enslaved or killed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Maddock-</b> Second in command of the Blood Saints.  He's from Ancient Egypt.  He keeps his face hidden, saying the world can never know what he looks like.  Whether he is beautiful or hideously scarred beneath his mask is unknown.  He's not as cold hearted as Santiago, but he'll do anything for money or blood lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Nox-</b> A modern vampire.  He was turned in the late 1800's and has adapted well with the times.  He's loves technology and is a wonder with computers.  Santiago asked him to join the Blood Saints so he could scam money and help fund them.  He's not as cruel as the others, but he's loyal to Santiago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vega-</b> She's only about 300 years old, but she's mastered her vampiric powers.  She performs dark magic and can conjour images and shadows.  She has a taste for torture and loves to watch people suffer.  She's scary to look upon.  She's also Santiago's mate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jin-</b> A vampire from Japan whose about 450 years old.  He's highly trained and mastered in the martial arts.  He's like a bodyguard to Santiago when Maddock isn't around, but Santiago hardly needs one, so Jin spends most of his time training or challenging other vampires to a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mingmei-</b> The only Blood Saint who isn't a vampire, Mingmei is a were-tiger, one of the few of her breed.  She was born in China and grew up a sex slave.  Santiago bought her and she's his property.  She's a seductress and highly deadly to Santiago's enemies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sasha-</b> One of the youngest Blood Saints.  Only a mere 150 years old.  He is a twin to Vanya.  The two grew up in Russia together and were sons to a man Santiago killed.  He turned both Sasha and Vanya into vampires.  They've followed him since.  They're pranksters and hooligans.  But very dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vanya-</b> Sasha's twin.  Like his brother, he is 150 years old.  He is the more mature of the two and the ferocity for which he watches out for his brother is what attracted Santiago to the two.  Sasha doesn't know that Santiago values Vanya over him and Vanya wants to keep it that way, for his brother's sake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Caspar-</b> A vampire from London, he's about 200 years old.  He's heartless, cruel, and merciless.  He kills without warrant.  It's said that he was the infamous Jack the Ripper that stalked the streets of London in 1888. He has never accepted or denied the accusations.  He's also in love with Vega. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><span class=\"cred\">She-Wolves</span></b><br>\r\n<i>The She-Wolves is an exclusively female pack.<br>\r\nMost of them are prostitues, but it's not a membership requirement.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/trans.gif\" title=\"She-Wolves  [#1133004]\nFor my interactive.\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" id=\"protectWMLImg2\"><img onmouseover=\"protectMe(this, 'protectWMLImg2');\" title=\"She-Wolves  [#1133004]\nFor my interactive.\" alt=\"For my interactive.\" src=\"https://www.writing.com/main/images/action/display/ver/1153187565/item_id/1133004.gif\" width=\"400\" border=\"0\" height=\"293\"></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sloan-</b> One of the two Alpha females in the pack.  She's an optimistic, chipper girl and she's also the top source of profit for the She-Wolves.  People will pay top dollar to bed her and she doesn't just sleep with any John.  She's a high class companion.  In wolf form, she's has tannish brown fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bliss-</b> She owns her own bookstore and is a very practical girl.  She dabbles in black magic, but would never use it to hurt anyone.  She's not a fighter.  She doesn't openly seek prostitution, but if a John asks Sloan specifically for her, she'll usually go along with it.  In wolf form, she has dark brown fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Elvina-</b> Originally from France, she is another of the top profit earners for the She-Wolves.  She's probably the most dangerous of the pack.  She knows how to fight and to kill.  She also has an addiction to drugs.  She can be a bit cold and cruel, but she loves her pack members.  In wolf form, she has black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ivy-</b> The other of the Alpha females of the pack.  She's practical and down to earth.  She doesn't sell her body for money, but she helps set up deals, to make sure her girls are safe.  She's skilled with weapons and has almost perfect aim with a handgun.  She's in love with Tatum.  In wolf form, she has light brown fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lavender-</b> The youngest of the group.  She's into the punk look and dresses wildly.  She dies her hair a pinkish-purple color.  She started off as a prostitue, but after a vampire John tried to kill her, Ivy pulled her out of it.  Now she has a boyfriend, Lanny, whose part of the Lupine pack.  In wolf form, she has brown fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Manhattan-</b> The only African American woman in the She-Wolves.  She takes part in the prostitution.  She screens most of her clients through Ivy, but she also does some street work.  She's tough and knows how to handle herself.  Her brother, Edgar, is in the Lupine pack.  In wolf form, she has black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tatum-</b> She's loud and funny and sportsy.  She lightens up a room when she's in it.  She doesn't have much of a bloodlust, but she will defend her pack to the death.  Like Bliss, she only takes part in the prostitution when someone specifically asks for her.  In wolf form, she has light brown fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Wren-</b> The most soft spoken of the pack.  She's elegant and graceful.  She has the ability to be one of the top profit earners for the pack, but she's picky about her Johns.  No one holds it against her.  She's beautiful and calm, but moves like she's dancing when she fights with knives.  In wolf form, she has whitish gray fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><span class=\"cred\">The Lupine Pack</span></b><br>\r\n<i>Contrary to the She-Wolves, it is an exclusively male pack.<br>\r\nThey're fighters and are aligned with the New Dawn vampire clan.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/trans.gif\" title=\"Lupine Pack  [#1133006]\nFor my interactive.\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" id=\"protectWMLImg3\"><img onmouseover=\"protectMe(this, 'protectWMLImg3');\" title=\"Lupine Pack  [#1133006]\nFor my interactive.\" alt=\"For my interactive.\" src=\"https://www.writing.com/main/images/action/display/ver/1153187642/item_id/1133006.gif\" width=\"400\" border=\"0\" height=\"290\"></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ulric-</b> He's third in line for Alpha.  He's also very close friends with Aubrey, the leader of the New Dawn clan.  His best friend is Mitch.  He's funny, happy go lucky and smart.  He can fight well enough, but he's small in size and that sometimes gives him a disadvantage.  In wolf form, he's has blondish brown fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mitch-</b> Second in line for Alpha, he's a strong fighter.  He's a bartender at Aubrey's nightclub.  He's quick and dangerous and may come off a little cold, but he's actually a kind, caring person.  He's got a thing for Sloan, of the She-Wolves. He's good with knives and guns.  In wolf form, he has black fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Braeden-</b> The Alpha male for the Lupine pack.  He's the leader.  He's extremely smart and very dangerous.  Though some might say he's a little too careful and he doesn't attack until someone attacks him.  But his goal is to keep people alive, so no one can blame him.  In wolf form, he has dark brown fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Donovan-</b> An African American man, he's a bit of a player and a show off.  He likes to be in the spotlight and he's one of the most frequent clients of the She-Wolves.  He talks a big game and fortunately for him, he can fight as well as he says he can.  In wolf form, he has dark brown fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lewis-</b> One of the youngest werewolves in the area, he's only 16. He grew up in an abusive house and when he ran away, he was bit by a werewolf and left to die.  Braeden took him in.  The others watch out for him.  He's a bit cocky, but he knows he still has a lot to learn.  In wolf form, he has light brown fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Huan-</b> Having grown up in Mexico City, Huan came to the states to escape a hunter.  He met Braeden through Edgar, who befriended him when he first came.  Edgar and Huan are best friends now.  He's a good fighter and is pretty loyal to his friends, though he has a bit of a bloodlust.  In wolf form, he has black fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Edgar-</b> He is Manhattan's brother and Huan's best friend.  He looks out for his sister a lot, even though she's older than him.  He's a bit of a smart alec, but he's also a genius.  He's highly intelligent and can use his quick wit and knowledge in a fight when strength just won't cut it.  In wolf form, he has black fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lanny-</b> He's a practical joker.  He loves pulling pranks and is a bit of a pyro.  He always has a plentiful supply of firecrackers on hand.  He gets into trouble a lot and though he can fight fairly well, he always seems to take the brunt of an attack.  He's Lavender's boyfriend.  In wolf form, he has a tannish fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><span class=\"cred\">New Dawn Clan</span></b><br>\r\n<i>They are a pretty diplomatic clan in that they don't kill for food.<br>\r\nThey're seen as powerful and because of that are often under attack.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/trans.gif\" title=\"New Dawn Clan  [#1133007]\nFor my interactive.\" height=\"0\" width=\"0\" id=\"protectWMLImg4\"><img onmouseover=\"protectMe(this, 'protectWMLImg4');\" title=\"New Dawn Clan  [#1133007]\nFor my interactive.\" alt=\"For my interactive.\" src=\"https://www.writing.com/main/images/action/display/ver/1153187709/item_id/1133007.gif\" width=\"400\" border=\"0\" height=\"292\"></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Aubrey-</b> The leader of the New Dawn clan.  He's quiet and poetic.  About 350 years old, he's travelled all over the world looking for the vampire who turned him and left him to die, but he hasn't found him.  He's trying to find something or someone who will make his immortal life worthwhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lesmana-</b> She's from Ancient Egypt.  She's a bit of a villain compared to the others.  She gets in trouble with Aubrey a lot for taking too much from her victims.  She liks to taunt her prey and she sometimes uses her vampiric powers to take advantage of people.  She's Fin's mate and she thinks of Quinn as her son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Fin-</b>  Nearly 500 years old. The second in comman of the New Dawn clan.  He's almost silent, only speaking when it's absolutely necessary.  He's tough and cold but is very loyal to his friends.  He's vowed to stick with Aubrey through anything.  He's Lesmana's mate and thinks of Quinn as his son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Duncan-</b> One of the younger vampires, he's only about 50 years old.  He was bitten when he was 25, by Aubrey, who did it to save his life after another vampire left him for dead.  He's loyal to Aubrey to a fault.  He's short tempered and loves to toy with his prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Quinn-</b> The youngest vampire in the clan, he's been a vampire for only 10 years.  He was bitten when he was 20.  He's still learning the ways and he still has trouble dealing with what he's become.  He's shy and quiet and not a very good fighter.  He thinks of Fin and Lesmana as his parents, since they sired him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Delilah-</b> She's been a vampire for nearly 200 years.  She grew up in Holland but came here during World War II.  She met Marcella, who took a liking to her and brought her into the clan.  She's sweet and childish.  But she can fight and she's been known to beat vampires twice her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Gideon-</b> He was turned into a vampire during the American Civil War.  He was a slave during that time.  Santiago came to the plantation where he was and slaughtered everyone there, but for some reason left Gideon to turn into a vampire.  Gideon has sought to kill him ever since. He's bitter, but doesn't let it control him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Marcella-</b> She's nearly 600 years old.  She's beautiful and smart.  She's also dangerous and has a very defined mastery of her vampiric powers.  She was Santiago's mate but he threw her out when he got tired of her.  Now, she has an on again off again relationship with Aubrey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Notes:</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to do what you want with this.
