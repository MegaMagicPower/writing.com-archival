            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle was sitting on the couch, browsing through random TV channels, wondering what the hell he was going to do. College was out, he had to live with his parents and younger sister for the summer, and he only had a handful of friends he could spend time with... He didn't have a summer job... he had nothing to occupy his time. So... he channel surfed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad was on a business trip, his sister was hanging out at the mall with her friends, and his mom was at the lab doing who knows what with her science stuff. He was home alone and bored as fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came across a news station, and before he could switch to something else, the story caught his eye. Some sort of fast acting virus had broken out in the area and seemed to be quickly spreading. What really caught his attention was that his mom's company's name had been mentioned as being involved. He strained to hear the details... until they literally jumped on screen in the form of a E-cup sporting anthropomorphic lioness grabbing the on-scene reporter into a passionate kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his eyes, the reporter went from struggling to extremely accepting. Her breasts suddenly swelled up under her tight top, burst it open as fur began to spread over her body. Her curves increased as her face stretched into a muzzle and her ears began longer. She developed two extra pairs of breasts as the last of her clothes ripped off, leaving her as a naked, horny looking anthro border collie. The literal bitch broke the kiss to begin and show off for the camera with a lustful whine. Suddenly, she lunged forward, presumably to get at the camera guy, ending the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was stunned. He'd never seen anything like it. One kiss, and that woman was changed. It... it was hot, yet scary as hell! And this apparently came from his mom's work?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard the door open. His head spun to see a tall, strong, and extremely busty cow woman in the door, staring at him longingly. Her breasts were so huge they made the ones he'd seen on the news look flat. And... something about her was familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's mommy's little boy doing~? Mooo~... Don't worry sweetie, momma came home just for yooouu~... Momma's gonna make you feel sooo gooood~!\" He froze. This cow... used to be his mother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the opportunity to pin him to the couch under her massive breasts. She shoved a nipple into his mouth, leaking fresh warm milk into it. \"Sorry to get rough, sweetheart, but momma's gotta get milked~!! OoooH~!! Mooo~!!!!\" She undid his pants and began to rub her moist pussy gains his hardened cock. It wasn't big, but it would do to ease her itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his former mother bounced on his cock and force fed him milk, he realized something: he wasn't changing. He was still the same guy. Did it not work on guys? Or... maybe there was something else... His thoughts were brought to a stop as he began to climax with a loud, muffled moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his mom got off of him, satisfied for the moment. She snuggled his head into her cavernous cleavage lovingly, kissed his forehead, then whispered in his ear. \"Momma's gonna need her big boy to help her more often~... Momma's sooo glad that project at work backfired~... Moo~ it's soooo much more fun this way~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of you was just as excited. But another part was terrified of what was to come...</span></div></div>",

She was a buxom anthro tabby cat, with breasts the size of your head and a second pair beneath. She gazes onto the two of them as she licks her lips and sways her hips. \"I'm back from the mall~...\" He realizes that that the cat girl is his sister... and judging from her pussy, she's seen a good deal of action already...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat doesn't stop her from lunging onto the couch alongside Kyle and their still horny mother. She immediately plunges onto his cock as momma cow presses her dripping snatch onto his mouth, forcing him to eat her out. As his sister and mother used him, they passionately make out, all taboos about being related erased from their altered minds. Kyle is helpless but to let the anthros fuck him and use him for their pleasure. Still, he had to admit he liked it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, all three came together. The two animal women pulled back to make out together, ignoring Kyle for now.</span></div></div>",

Down the street you see a mini-orgy happening right there out in the open, most of those involved all already anthros, but one of the members is a girl being turned into an anthro snake. You get so hard again, like you did watching that newscaster get turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, some louder moaning from an unexpected place gets your attention. You go next door to your neighbor Keiko's house to find their front door wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Is anyone...?\" The sound of moaning and slapping flesh upstairs answers that question. Heading up, you walk past Keiko's parents' room, which has her parents, now both anthro Great Danes, going at it, and to Keiko's room. There you saw the girl known as your's college's biggest wallflower now standing in the middle of her room, a mighty futa centauress with F-cup breasts, dressed for some reason in what looked like a girls' Japanese high school uniform top and skirt, taking an anthro futa pig from behind while pounding a dog girl below her, all while working on her advanced thesis at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keiko?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!!\" she responds, sweat rolling down her brow as she writes, \"It's strange. I was a virgin before this whole 'virus' thing hit. In fact, I never, I almost never had a lurid thought. Now I can't seem to go a millisecond without wanting something in me, or to be IN someone, and trust me, the latter, I'm definitely still getting used...\" she starts making a lot of silly faces, before finishing, in more ways than one, \"...but I think I like it!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look below her to the dog girl she just filled with her cream to see they looked familiar. Unlike most of the anthros, she was more like a kemonomimi, her only anthro traits being her ears, tail, claws, and six breasts, but otherwise still looked human. She did however looked kind of like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's my brother Yoshiro. He can't get enough of my dick. Not that I don't want him to...\" She cracks a smile. \"However, pig lady back there I don't know. She just wandered in a couple of hours ago and started pounding my vagina, not that I mind. Honestly, I think it's helping me concentrate on my thesis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peer over at her work, and most what you see seems above your head. Of course, you don't take quantum physics, so that's a given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to join in?\" a horse-cum covered Yoshiro chirped in a bubbly soprano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M... Maybe later.\" you utter, deciding it was time to take your leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, you see many infected walk the street, often having sex in public or trying to grab the uninfected in order to convert them. Meanwhile, the remaining humans you have seen were mostly in windows or in helicopters or biohazard gear, but a handful walk up along with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has anyone else noticed the furries have shown lower priority in us than in say, other people, or their own kind?\" one man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was going to become one of those anthros myself when my sister became one of the hermaphrodite ones earlier today, but nothing happened, and then she lost all interest. Something's up. Maybe a cure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four of you near the convenience store, you find a military hazmat perimeter there blocking the way, holding off the tide of anthros trying to continue the spread of the virus. Meanwhile, another man, whom seems to be a fellow immune person like you and the other three people you just met a minute or two ago, is resisting being dragged away from an eight-breasted futa anthro rabbit girl by the military.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiots!! That's my wife!! Let me go!! Can't you tell she isn't like the rest of them!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard!!\" the futa anthro rabbit girl cries in fear. \"I'm so scared!! Please don't leave me!! Why are you doing this? I just want to stay with my husband!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soldier shoves her back. \"Back!! You're infected!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janet!!\" Richard shouts. \"How dare you!!\" He struggles in the hazmat guards' grips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this...</span></div></div>",

The five guards that were posted there to keep the disease at bay were gone the second the fence went down. Nothing could be seen of them other than the scraps of their yellow hazmat suits flying in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The loud sounds had captured the attention of the entire quarantine zone. A scientist also in a hazmat suit turned around to see an anthro wolf leap onto her and rip the hood clean off. Despite never having taunted the anthros, the yellow suit made her guilty by association and the anthro bit into her neck. The scientist made an expression of pure shock and pain before she moaned and began to inflate, rapidly gaining weight and growing. Her face morphed into a muzzle and became fuzzy, black, and white. An anthro panda was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Janet seized the opportunity of confusion to kick the soldier who was restraining her in the jaw, knocking him out instantly. Before Janet ran to her husband, she spat on the soldier to add insult to injury. To further that insult, the saliva infected the soldier on the ground, transforming him into a busty anthro hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Janet made a beeline to Richard and leaped into his waiting arms. Richard had performed some assault of his own and embraced his anthro wife with a loving kiss. \"Let's not waste any time, Janet,\" said a relieved Richard. The two ran off hand in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It was a matter of 2 minutes and 34 seconds before the entire quarantine zone was infected and transformed save for one. The only one who wasn't transformed was the colonel in charge of the quarantine. He was held up by the panda and the wolf while the anthros surrounded him. At a second glance, he was covered in bite wounds, proof he was immune as he was still human. A tall and fluffy futa sheep approached him, clearly the leader as the others made way. She gave him a deep and passionate kiss and lowered him to the ground, resting him on the concrete and mounting herself on the colonel's erect member. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The sheep bounced up and down, having the time of her life as she satiated her sexual appetite. The poor man couldn't hold it in anymore as he released his seed into the sheep. Her visage turned into one of bliss as she released her seed onto the anthros around her. Along with the sperm came a shower of milk as she sprayed everywhere. The sheep's followers happily licked up the milk and cum from themselves and then moved onto each other. An orgy erupted in the middle of the former quarantine zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Kyle could only look on with a massive hard-on as the orgy persued. It was a sight to behold as the herd continued to mate. Kyle didn't notice as...</span></div></div>",

Unlike most of the anthros he had seen on the news so far, his mother had lacked a muzzle, only had fur on her ears, tail, and Holstein spots, had hooven toes, an udder, and two breasts sitting under her original breasts, which were now far larger than her head now, and each breast was sporting four teats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was sufficiently hard, she stopped her ministrations and slipped back on him. \"Moooooo~ You're such a good boy, Kyle... Making your momma feel so good...\" She begins pounding up and down on his stick, her tail thrashing about as her udder sloshes on his belly. Kyle is riveted as he is feeling his second build-up of the day, nay, his life, and it's coming at the hands of his mom, who is now lost in a low lolling moo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

We're not sure that vaccine mom tried to make before she gave in to virus even works!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hooooonies, why don't you please stop fighting my beautiful mistake and join me... Well, actually, I see Sammy already is. Tee hee!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie backs away slowly as a platinum blonde feline tail snakes out from under Sam's skirt, as a different force begins lifting it from the front. Sam wholly ignores her ears transmutation from humanoid to feline as they ride up into her hair to lift her skirt and peer at her new 15-inch barbed feline futa penis sticking out just over her vagina, right above her clitoris. She then drops her skirt hem as she is compelled to inhale, her inward breath making her breasts swell and swell. B, C, D, E, F, the mammaries destroying her bra and tearing up Sam's t-shirt, before finally ending their growth at the top of the musical charts in the G-cup range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom walks over to Sam, asking her, \"How about I make the remainder of your change pleasant for both of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N... N... No, mom...\" Sam finally stammers, even though her stiff erection and pre on the tip argue otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom then stops, puzzled by what has just happened. \"Wait... No?\" She then noticed Sam's changes had stopped. She had only become partially anthro, like her. She then recalls what Sadie said earlier about the \"vaccine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. You two also used that same pesky neutralizing agent I tried to use before I realized how great this is. That's why you stopped changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, this is madness!!\" Sadie exclaims. \"You've let the world be infected with this... weird Anthro Virus, turning people into mindless sex beasts against their wills, all because you refused to speak up about the dangers of the genome to your superiors and was tainted by the promise of the fame the new discoveries in advanced genomics would give you. 'It'd cure world hunger,' you kept saying was the excuse for ignoring the dangers. Now look!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moooooo~ Yessss..... The worrlllddddd...\" She begins to slide herself on the still addled Sam's newborn cock... \"...will be such a better place now... I will end war, sweety. I will end war... with pussy!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam blankly smirked, \"Mommy...... made a funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SAM!!\" Sadie shouted, shocked seeing her sister not resisting her mom... er, riding her cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shout was sufficient to snap Sam back to the waking world and finally to her normal self. \"Wha?!\" Sam was so shocked by her being inside her mother her dick prematurely went off as she tried to get her off her, sending some of her seed in her mom, and some splattering onto the kitchen floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle, finally recovering from his bliss, sits up and asks, \"Wait. Just what all is going on here? I'd kinda like to know why my mom took my virginity, will do me just as easily as some stranger, and, um, all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, with an uneasy truce established between the mother and the sisters, they try to share some insight on what they knew on the virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, mommy was working with team that was trying to make all those farm animals make more food, and whatnot...\" your mom began, clearly drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie takes over, \"However, the company was cutting corners, using untested compounds, chemicals, genomes, and processes to speed up production. Mom found out, but got persuaded to look the other way. I didn't, and got canned. However, just before all of <b>THIS</b> happened, your mom finally saw the light, for a moment, and tried to write a retrovirus, a neutralizing agent to the clusterfuck they had made. Unfortunately, corporate greed is corporate, they infected her, made her Patient Zero of the Anthro Virus, thought they could contain her, study her, then erase her. However, they didn't realize how easily she could spread the virus. Overwhelmed the whole facility, then into the town, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that's how we got to now.\" Kyle's mom says, reaching for your dick to blow him. Sadie sprays her with a water bottle. \"Bad mom!! Mothers don't fellate their children!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle then asks, \"Wait, then how does Sam factor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't. I'm almost as confused as you are, Kyle!!\" Sam exclaims. \"Sadie just asked me to help her set up her lab when she was fired, and then right when the virus broke out had me injected with that vaccine stuff... <b>NOT LIKE IT HELPED MUCH, SADIE!!</b>\" Sam shouts, pointing to her semi-stiff feline prick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>WELL, AT LEAST YOU AREN'T COVERED IN FUR WITH SIX BREASTS AND AND A MUZZLE TRYING TO SCREW ALL OF CREATION!! THAT'S SOMETHING!!</b>\" Sadie countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I KINDA WANT TO BONE MOM!!</b>\" Sam shouts, before covering her mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a goooooooood girl... You do that.\" Mom replies with a smirk, trying to stroke her daughter's genitals, but getting a quick slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not right!!\" Sam cries, leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time since she got home, Kyle's mother didn't have a look of lust on her face. However, it didn't last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadie asked herself, \"More importantly, what makes our younger brother immune to the virus, and can we use it to fight it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

So everyone affected turned into women, except for some who happened to develop cocks as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant that he himself was immune to whatever was happening here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he feels something soft yet heavy leaning on his head. He jerked away, only to be grabbed by strong hands and thrust into the cleavage of the amazonian looking panther that had snuck up on him with a sly grin. \"Well now, aren't you a tasty looking bit of prey~? I'm going to have some fun with you~!\"</span></div></div>",

Between her thick, muscle-packed thighs was a long and girthy cock bobbing with her heartbeat. Kyle had never been so happy to see one of these horny hermaphrodites as he was right now, because the Great Dane grabbed his would-be captor, bent her over, and speared into her wet folds. The panthress growled at first, but after a few thrusts from the Great Dane, her snarling subsided into cute little squeaks of pleasure as her lust overcame her. Her eyes zoned out completely, freaking Kyle out so badly that he stood there and just watched her breasts swing back and forth below her in time to her mate's thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Great Dane hilted in the panther and noisily came.

The lioness ran after Kyle, her massive assets defying logic as she catched up to him. With a swift tackle she snatched him up and forced him to began fucking her. With no choice he thrusted his already hard member into her nether area.\"Yes! I want more! More!\" She moaned as he thrusted as hard as he could. She panted as she then gave the teen the titjob of his life and forced him to drink out of her massive tits. Climaxing there on the spot she licked her lips and he passed out from the sheer force used. As she pick him up she had several choices on her mind.
