You were always a sort of loner in high-school, sure you had a couple of friends for a while but they either moved away or fell in with the wrong crowd just to be socially accepted more. You weren't like that, you didn't care if you fitted in with everyone else, you cared about being you and if they didn't like it then it was their problem.<br>\r\nSo you always used your spare time to study your favorite thing in the world, Magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grades in other subjects were fine, except for math (you had some trouble in the past trying to understand it), but you always excelled in magic. But you never thought that you would actually be accepted to a school like this, it was a dream come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on the bus on the way to the Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" you hear a voice from the seat behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you new here too?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" you respond \"First year, I'm pretty excited\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. My name is Terra. It's nice to meet you\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra had long light-brown hair and blue eyes. She looks to be about 17-18 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too, my name is (*Name*)\" you respond<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems pretty nice\" you think to yourself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear people talking in awe and excitement, you turn to see the you were now pulling up to Arcane Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are!\" says Terra<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing!\" you say <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was, you couldn't wait to actually see the inside, rumor has it the there is an enchantment on the whole building that actually makes it bigger on the inside as well as a protective barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Terra get off of the bus together since you were sitting next to eachother and head inside. The inside looked even more spectacular and it does look far larger on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello students!\" says an older voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Corvenus, I am the Archmage here at the Academy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorvenus was an older gentleman, probably in his 50's or early 60's.<br>\r\nHe had a short trimmed grey beard and grey hair, he wore a black suit and was wearing a green scarf... not sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my school. You are all here because of your passion for the arcane arts. Let me tell you that there is no cause more noble than to understand and use magic for the betterment of the world. If you take your studies and tasks seriously, you will find power. Use this great power in vain however, and you will bring nothing but suffering and regret. Please heed these words carefully for they are the same words that my Archmage taught me when I myself had enrolled.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tone of excitement and awe suddenly had turned to that of seriousness and some were even intimidated by how Archmage Corvenus had spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a smile appeared on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, without further ado, I leave you to your Keepers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeepers were the mages responsible for keeping order in the school, if anything were to go wrong they were responsible for resolving the problem. They are also the official referees for things such as combative magic duels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Corvenus walked away, presumably to his office, you see a pair of Keepers walk up to the crowd of new students. One of them begins to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would all new students please seperate into two groups! One side Male, the other Female. After which we will lead you to your respective dormatories.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich group are you in?</span></div></div>",

Your dorms are on the east wing of the academy. Do not disturb the girl's dorms on the west side of the academy or you will face punishment.\" says the Keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's harsh, man.\" says one of the students<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are the rules.\" replies the Keeper<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes of walking, you finally reach your dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody, please line up for selection!\" you hear an older Keeper call out.<br>\r\n\"Time to find out who your roommate is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis keeper looked different from the others. So far, the only ones that you have seen looked very serious, this guy appeared to be smiling and excited to see the new students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few moments, all of the male students had lined up in front of the older Keeper.<br>\r\nHe then started to pull keys with numbers, almost at random, out of his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a key, the number on the key designates which room is yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne at a time, students were given a key to the dorm rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich key did you get?</span></div></div>",

It was true, it looks like he treats his hair far more than that of the average guy. You also notice the 12 different hair products sitting in one of the boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's nothing wrong with taking care of your hair!\" he says swiping some strands to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but... maybe you're taking it a bit far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't disagree more, *Name*\" he says, brushing his hair while sitting down on his claimed bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, anyway is there supposed to be someone else showing up?

Terra goes into awe as she saw the beautifully laid garden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, the flowers here are beautiful!\" she says, leaning down to better see and smell the flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe your nickname should've been Flora instead,\" you joke, earning you a slight shove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most people don't know that story,  [your name],\" she relies. \"Either you got lucky or it was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter a paused moment you ask \"Was what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, there was silence. The smell of flowers in the air and a quick breeze made the moment almost into something from a storybook. Terra only smiled as she strolled around the garden with you. You soon decide to break the silence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tariah, uh--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" you heard, interrupting your sentence. Who was it?</span></div></div>",

You do work quickly.\" He continues, earning questioning looks from Terra at both you and Samuel. \"Is she the same girl from the bus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. My name is Terra.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so it is the cute girl from the bus then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute, huh?\" she asks with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said that she was cute\" you stammer, nervously <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you don't think I'm cute then?\" she says with false sadness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said that either!\" you retort<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right. Eric was the one that said you were cute. After watching you on the bus.\" Samuel responds, blatently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your friend was watching us?\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know until after.\" You say, defensively. Hoping to god that this embarrasment would end, that everything would go back to that nice moment in the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" she says, almost shrugging it off, thankfully. \"What I want to know is...\" oh no<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm cute, [Your Name]?\" she asks with puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, it was obvious on how she was going to tease you. She probably thought that this was fun, seeing you stammer, waiting for you to say something just to turn it into another insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really shouldn't keep a lady waiting, [Your Name].\" Samuel says, joining in on her game<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at him, as he just holds a faint smile and cold eyes behind his glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what did he mean by 'You work fast'?\" she adds to the fray \"Are you courting other girls here too?\" She said that a bit liuder than before, attracting a few glances and glares from nearby students also walking the grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I was courting anyone!?\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you were just teasing me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was torture. You would do anything to get out of this. You were seriouly considering faking a stomach bug and escaping to the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Terra bursts out into laughter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should see your face, [Your Name]\" says Terra with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm seriously regretting this walk.\" you say under your breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that, [Your Name]\" says Eric, who walks up to the three of you. \"She's having a grand time of just teasing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems the two of you have something in common\" you retort, face no longer red of embarrasement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cold, [Your Name]\" he says before directing his attention to Terra \"By the way, my name's Eric. And you must be the lovely Terra.\" he says with a bow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you were the one that was staring at me on the bus.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric immediately stands ups straight, mouth agape at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told her!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. it was Samuel.\" you say back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then puts Samuel into a very familiar looking headlock at incredible speed.<br>\r\nYou just watch for a moment as they go at it, Eric trying to hold Sam down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So these are your room-mates then?\" Terra asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For better or worse.\" you say with a sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes pass as they continue. Apparently the keepers nearby didn't think of it as too much of an issue, which was fine since it wasn't what anyone could really call a fight. Eventually, Samuel seems to get a hold of Eric's lordly hair enough to mess it up, at which point Eric immediately retreats. It's not a surprise that he can just reach into his pocket and find a comb to deal with this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel get's off the ground, dusting off his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice moves\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned from the best\" he says, watching Eric desperately try to fix his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guys...\" says Terra</span></div></div>",

They both walk away,  chasing one another, leaving you two alone again.

It must have been at least 7 or 8 stories high and maybe just as wide. Heck, people were lying down on the edge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The other thing was that something, make that some things, we're circling around, interacting with each other and even students. One took notice of you and flew towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It looked like a fairy spirit, and spoke in a really high voice, \"Hello, there. I'm Milly, a resident of the Aura Fountain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Aura Fountain?\" Teriah asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why, yes! This vast fountain is a reservoir of aura, the essences of spirit and emotion.

Teriah springs up, \"Wait, I think I have one!\" She reaches into her bag and looks for it. Two seconds later, out comes a coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hence the name, it is a gold coin, maybe the size of a half dollar coin, but definitely at least 5 times the weight.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome students! to the Academy of Thaumatology and Arcane Practices for Witches and Warlocks, or Arcane Academy for short. Every school at a high-school level or above teaches some level of magic, but what makes Arcane Academy different is how it produces some of the most powerful Warlocks and Witches in the world! Of course the school still teaches things such as math, history, chemistry and P.E. which are all required for a decent level of magic as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a couple of rules before we start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;please use your best grammar, I have a low tolerance for 1337 (ex. lol, jk, omg, etc.)<br>\r\nbut minor spelling/grammatical errors are usually fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;as per the usual for my stories, Romance is allowed and actually is encouraged, just remember that this is not an erotica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Try not to make chapters too short and please keep it interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Keep the story going! No adding any chapters that will end the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;No adding any non-original characters, such as Naruto or Sailor Moon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story takes place on earth and history still works out relatively the same way, such as JFK's assassination still happened but this time there really was a magic bullet!<br>\r\nUnlike my previous story, this one allows for the lead to be Male OR Female rather than just having a Male lead. Also, monsters exist and are hunted professionally by mages. <br>\r\nJobs can be taken between classes. Anything from Janitorial duties to Monster hunting jobs.<br>\r\nMagical power is drawn from both the mage, and the environment. Water based spells are more powerful around watery areas, such as lakes or rivers; While Earth magic is more powerful in the mountainous areas of the world. However, A strong enough mage could still create a powerful fire based spell even while underwater. But that requires near-mastery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe schools of magic include, but are not limited to, Pyromancy (Heat magic), Aquamancy (Water control/purification magic), Auramancy (Magic specifically drawn from a mage), Photomancy (Light magic), and so on. There's no such thing as Cryomancy. In fact, Pyromancers have control over things such as ice because in science cold does not exist, it is merely the lack of heat. Since Pyromancers can control the temperature around them, they can also do things such as create ice around them. The same rule applies to photomancers, while darkness does not exist but instead is a lack of light and they can control the amount of light in the area and in turn retract light to create darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYay Science!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, because of the required understanding for most magics to work, there are very few spells and incantations that surpass scientific knowledge. Originally, during the middle ages when magic was becoming more and more frequent, mages were the scholars and would record the different effects of different magics. As scientific abilities advanced over time there was a greater understanding of how magic tied in to everything. Pretty soon after that, science was used to understand the world around us with calculated results, rather than magic which, without proper understanding, would be chaotic and dangerous. Scientific studies would be used to understand the world and then the new formed knowledge would be translated into terms that could be understood and used by mages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short, if we can't understand it with scientific point of view and understanding, it is extremely difficult to replicate it with magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UPDATE* Weapons such as swords, staves, guns, etc. will be commonplace at Arcane Academy, as a good mage always has a backup plan. Monsters may not be effected by certain types of magic, but a bullet or a hard edge will almost always hurt, and some weapons may even be enchanted for added affect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to ask questions! If you don't understand something about the world or are curious about the different possibilties, send me an E-mail to my on-site inbox. I'll answer anything to the best of my abilities. In fact, if you have a question and I wouldn't know how to answer, or if it's a question to something that I haven't thought up yet, I will make an addition to the world to make it make as much sense as possible. Ask away!</td>",
