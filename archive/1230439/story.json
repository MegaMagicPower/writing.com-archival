            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robin remembers all the stuff that Kid Flash dropped off last week.  There'd been some kind of giant fight in Keystone City that had damaged the Flash museum.  Kid Flash said that Flash stored weapons that he'd confiscated from super villains in a special storage area at the Flash museum but that a fight with some villains had compromised its integrity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Kid Flash was instructed by Flash to bring a half dozen super weapons to Titans Tower for temporary safe storage.  The xinothium energy ray from the villain Heat Wave was pretty easy to figure out.  So was Captain Cold's cold ray.  Duh.  Obvious molecule interaction minimizer circuitry.  A couple of the others were pretty standard villain stuff, thought Robin.  Kid Flash thought the Flashes fought tougher villains than him and Batman.  <br>\r\nNo way!<br>\r\nBut the last weapon in the bundle, a bazooka sized gun with all sorts of little controls and settings knobs puzzled him.  He stared at it from multiple angles while Kid Flash secured other ray guns in the impregnable Titans Tower storage vault.<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's this one?\" asked the boy wonder lifting it up and aiming it at his slender pal.<br>\r\nKid Flash sped to his side, a red and yellow blur and pushed the muzzel end of the device downward in a fraction of a second.<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Watch that!  I'm seeing Jinx again tonight.  I want my speedster buns just the way they are.  Perfect.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"It's the fat ray, boy blunder.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Don't call me that.  The what?!\"<br>\r\n\"The fat ray.  Gorilla Grodd used this once to make Flash weigh a thousand pounds. \"<br>\r\nRobin smirked.  The idea was pretty funny.  One of the sleek Flashes blimped out to weigh a thousand pounds.  <br>\r\n\"How's it work?\" Robin had asked.<br>\r\nKid Flash had sighed and then refused to tell him.  This irked Robin.  He was the responsible one.  Who was Kid Flash to not trust him?!  He said something about Flash having only not destroyed it to see if any technologies useful for good and not evil could be extracted from it.   <br>\r\nRobin remembered what Kid Flash had said as he opened up the heavy door to the Titans Tower storage area.  He pulled the supposed fat ray from its storage bin and examined it.  There sure were a lot of dials.  Maybe I should contact Kid Flash before trying to use this . . . </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robin sighed and flipped open his communicator.  It was the only responsible thing to do.  \"Kid Flash!  Come in.  Kid Flash!  This is Robin!  Please answer!\"<br>\r\nNot a second later, Kid Flash's handsome face, framed by his bright red hair was showing on the screen.  He was out of uniform.  It looked, from the background like he was in some kind of restaurant.  He glanced quickly to each side then spoke in a near whisper.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\nRobin was momentarily perplexed.  \"Um, I, uh, I need your help here at the Tower.  I-\"<br>\r\nHe was about to explain the situation when he heard a voice from off screen.<br>\r\n\"What is that?  You told me you were going to leave it at home!  You promised me!\"  Then it seemed like he must have put it down because Kid Flash's face moved off screen and the view Robin had was stuck on the ceiling of that same restaurant.  Offscreen, Robin could hear Kid Flash trying to calm Jinx down.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, baby.  It's force of habit.  I didn't even mean to take it.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right.  You're addicted to the whole deal.  You'll never change and make allowances for being with me!\"<br>\r\nFrom that point their voices moved further away and it was a full minute later before a very irritated Kid Flash returned to the screen Robin saw.<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot Robin!  My girlfriend just walked out on dinner and judging from how angry she is the lovin' dessert I was hoping for is out of the question.  Now, what is it?\"<br>\r\nLuckily, Kid Flash couldn't see the nervous look in his eyes behind his mask.  Robin repeated his request that Kid Flash speed to the Tower without further explanation.  30 seconds later, the teen speedster zipped into the room and stood beside Robin in his skin tight red and yellow uniform.  He still looked irritated.<br>\r\nHis look didn't improve much when Robin outlined his plan.<br>\r\n\"You . . want to use the fat ray to make yourself a little pudgy to appeal to Starfire?\"<br>\r\nRobin nodded.<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\"<br>\r\nRobin nodded again and Kid Flash shook his head.  \"Are you crazy?  This is the way to be,\" said Kid Flash patting the 8 visible squares of stomach muscles under his uniform and then the equally toned abs of his friend.  \"You're in great shape dude.  Why would you ruin it?\"<br>\r\n\"If Starfire wants-wants . . pudgy, I'll be pudgy.  It'll just be temporary but it'll show her how serious I am.  You understand that, don't you?  Don't you make sacrifices to please Jinx?\"<br>\r\nKid Flash sighed.  \"If you only knew.\"<br>\r\n\"So, how 'bout it?\" asked Robin picking up the bazooka sized fat ray gun.  \"Fatten me up just a bit.\"<br>\r\nKid Flash nodded.  \"I don't get it.  But, okay.  There's only one problem.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Flash never finished explaining to me how this one works.\"<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure we can figure out the other parts.\"<br>\r\nA disappointed Robin rolled his eyes and the two slender teens started fiddling with the dials and switches on it, both adjusting at the same time and not sufficiently noting what the other was doing.  <br>\r\nAll of a sudden the thing hummed to life and a couple dials started to glow.  Robin turned a nob that he thought was sort of a safety, thinking that he was setting the safety and preventing an accidental use of it.  <br>\r\n\"No, don't touch that one!\" barked the speedster but it was too late as a green light came out the muzzle end of the gun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A greenish light started shooting out the muzzle end of the bazook sized ray gun.  Robin had the thing pointed away from himself but the green ray shot out at a wide angle and when Kid Flash tried to reach a certain knob to turn it off he only succeeded in pointing the gun at the lower half of Robin's body.<br>\r\n\" . . oh . . \"<br>\r\nEven thought the ray had only hit him from the thighs down, Robin's whole body now tingled in a way he'd never felt before.  He wasn't sure what to do.  He stopped resisting Kid Flash's efforts to pull it from him.  But this only turned the ray on the lower half of Kid Flash's body just as his efforts to flip the safety back on resulted in him turning a knob next to it from its setting of A to the alternate setting of P.  Finally he reached the right knob and turned the thing off.  It clattered to the hard Tower floor just as his whole body was engulfed in a tingly feeling that was totally new to him.<br>\r\n\". . oh . . \"<br>\r\nAs he tried to figure out what was happening to himself, he saw Robin's belly expanding and the buttons popping off his red uniform top.  Frantically, Robin reached for and undid his utility belt.  It scuffed across the floor as the sound of spandex ripping filled the room.  Robin's green leggings were shredding as was the seat of his pants and even the jock he wore underneath.  But he never saw his pal's equipment.  His gut was expanding as though a fire hose was pumping water into it and it immediately hung down to his much wider thighs.  At the same time, Robin's face turned puffy, his chest started looking saggy and even his arms and fingers seemed saggy and puffed out to their physical limit.<br>\r\nRobin groaned.  He could see his reflection in the stainless steel door to the storage room.  He'd obviously gained a lot more than the maximum 100 pounds he'd intended.  <br>\r\nKid Flash, still feeling that bizarre tingle, looked on in horror.  He loved his sleek, speedster physique and totally identified with it.  Fat was  . . . He shuddered at the sight of his pal.  Easily 600 pounds.<br>\r\nBut no sooner had he filled with revulsion than he felt an incredible sensation behind him and reached back with both red gloved hands.  He was just in time to feel his round speedster butt expand outward as though the same fire hose that had filled Robin with blubber was now turned on him.  In just a few seconds, his buns ballooned backward and outward till they were the size of a pair of oversized beach balls.  His thighs were becoming similarly gargantuan.  His upper body filled with fat, his face becoming puffy and his chest sagging with an advanced case of gynecomastia.  His belly expanded too, but it was clear that his shape was different than Robin's.   And, thankfully, his Kid Flash suit was tremendously stretchy and enlarged to still fit him.  But he now understood what the switch that had two settings, A and P was for.  Robin had been fattened in the apple shape with his tremendous new weight centered around his midsection.  He'd been fattened in a pear shape, his hips becoming even much more enormous than Robin's, his buns blimping out till they extended two feet back of him, his center of gravity lowered as gravity's pull on him was multiplied many times over.<br>\r\nThe two formerly fat free teen hereoes looked at each other in silence for a few seconds as they tried to regain their balance in their new lardass bodies.<br>\r\n\"Nice going Blimp Wonder.\"<br>\r\n\"And you're blameless, Kid Fat?\"<br>\r\nKid Flash advanced and pushed his huge gut against his friend's even larger one.<br>\r\n\"You had to turn it on!\"<br>\r\n\"And you just had to point it at me!  Look at me!  I make that loser villain Control Freak look like an anorexic.  At least my butt's as big as yours, though!\"<br>\r\nKid Flash rolled his eyes.  \"At least my gut's not as big as yours, mud slide.\"<br>\r\n\"God of Thunder Thighs!\"<br>\r\nThe two angry teen heroes looked at each other a moment then broke into smiles.  Neither could stay mad at his best friend.  <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" said Robin.  \"Let's just fix this quick before the others see us.  How did Flash get out of this one?\"<br>\r\nKid Flash sighed.  \"He said he went into a sauna and sweated the weight off.\"<br>\r\n\"What?!  That'll take days . . . at least!\"<br>\r\nKid Flash nodded reluctantly.  <br>\r\n\"Well, there's a freight scale just around the corner from here.  Let's see how bad we are.\"<br>\r\nKid Flash waddled at high speed around the corner and stepped across the stainless steel square and stared at the digital display.<br>\r\n677 <br>\r\n\"I weigh six hundred seventy seven pounds!\" he shouted in disbelief despite the sight and feel of his enormously heavy body in his red and yellow suit.  \"I'm only five eleven!\"<br>\r\n\"Your ass might be five eleven across, now,\" said Robin with a slap to one elephantine buttock.  Kid Flash stepped aside and Robin waddled atop the scale.  The red, digital number display moved too fast to see any one number before settling at . . <br>\r\n637<br>\r\n\"I weigh six hundred thirty seven pounds!\" Robin muttered squeezing at his spherical body with his arms as if needing to confirm the number.  \"God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teen heroes, incredibly toned just five minutes ago stood there trying to deal with the enormity of their enormity.  They were only snapped out of it by the -ding!- of the elevator opening and Starfire stepping out, her jaw dropping at the sight of them.</span></div></div>",

He made himself and tripple decker sandwich composed of Wham, Tofurkey, Vegetarian Beef, cheese, tomatoes, and mayonaise. It towered high above his head. He wabbled carefully over to the couch and wolfed it down as a, well...wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I so call winner,' Beast Boy shouted followed by a loud belch.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just another City Hall ceremony.  Thanks for saving Jump City, Titans.  Been there done that.  Raven disliked these ceremonies at this point.  It seemed like the mayor used them as political rallies for himself.  She could barely stand to look at him.  We'd have saved the City just as certainly if the other candidates were in your office, you jerk!<br>\r\nOh well, she told herself while waiting with the others for his speech to end, at least they got some first hand evidence of the mood of the general public.  Raven was particularly interested in the reactions to the Titans of the girls in the audience.  Sure, there was some ogling of Robin and Beast boy.  That sort of thing was even worse with Kid Flash.  She wanted to condemn it but she couldn't deny that the speedster was awfully cute.  Gods, those buns.  But more than their reactions to the male Titans she was interested in their reaction to her and Starfire.  <br>\r\nShe'd become increasingly upset at how girls seemed to see them.  At first, the disturbing undertones weren't so obvious that she couldn't tell herself things were otherwise.  But, at the last such ceremony she'd overheard two anorexic looking blond girls berating two chubby girls for identifying with her and Starfire.  <br>\r\n\"Like, why don't you fatties root for a villain or something?  All the hero girls are thin or haven't you noticed?\"<br>\r\n\"Like, duh.  Fat equals bad,\" said the other blond girl.<br>\r\nRaven had turned around and seen that the two girls being verbally attacked weren't even especially fat.  She'd gone home from the ceremony to her room at the Tower and looked at her slender, beauty's body in the mirror and didn't feel at all good about it.  She'd never wanted to be the club used by some girls to hit other girls over the head.  <br>\r\nNow, at this ceremony, she overheard two average shape girls in the front row of the audience talking about how they could never be like Raven and talking in dispiriting terms about their own bodies.  Raven looked at them.  They were maybe 10 pounds overweight, tops.  <br>\r\nAnger welled up in her, anger that only increased when the mayor asked her to say a few words with an introduction of \"And now a few words from the beautiful . . Raven!\"<br>\r\nShe marched to the microphone as the crowd applauded.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mr. Mayor.  We're all happy to help in any way we can.  As for my appearance, well, a spell was cast on me to change my appearance.  I've almost broken it.  The next time you see me I'll be my real self, looking pretty much the same but much much heavier.  Thank you everyone!\"<br>\r\nThe other Titans were perplexed but she quickly told them that she'd just been saying that.  She was her natural shape right now at 5'6\" and 115 pounds.  But she told them that she'd made a decision.  She couldn't stand to have her appearance used as a weapon against some girls.  She was going to go fat.<br>\r\nHer teammates were stunned.  Robin asked if she would just cast a spell.  <br>\r\nThat wouldn't work, she explained.  She could cast a cloaking spell that would give her the appearance of much greater mass whenever she was maintaining the power of that spell.  But she didn't want to divide her concentration for fighting.  It would be better to actually be much heavier.  <br>\r\nBeast Boy ran one gloved finger up her side from her hip.  \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\nShe nodded.  \"Didn't Kid Flash drop off for safe keeping some sort of ray gun that can make a person's body gain significant weight almost immediately?\"<br>\r\nRobin nodded.  \"The fat ray gun.  He said somebody blimped Flash up to a thousand pounds.  It's in our safe storage area.\"<br>\r\nRaven sighed.  \"Okay, let's get Kid Flash here to help use it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Raven just asked Kid Flash to speed to Titans Tower as soon as possible.  She figured it'd be easier to explain in person.  10 seconds later the slender speedster was there in his skin tight red and yellow uniform.  Like her four original teammates, the teen speedster had a little trouble at first wrapping his mind around what she wanted to do.  Down in the Titans Tower storage room he was half trying to talk her out of it as he retrieved the bazooka sized ray gun while the others waited outside for safety.<br>\r\n\"So . . you want me to shoot you with the fat ray and . . make you weigh three or four hundred pounds.  Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Three.  Four.  Five.  Whatever.  I just want it to be perfectly clear that I'm a hefty girl and a hero.\"<br>\r\n\"Um, wouldn't less weight than that do the trick?\"<br>\r\nShe looked at the worried expression on his face and chuckled.  \"You're really uncomfortable with the very idea of fat, aren't you?\"<br>\r\nHe couldn't face her.  \"Well . . . yeah.  I mean, I'm sorry, but look at me,\" he said holding his arms out.  \"Almost six feet tall and a 26 inch waist.  S.T.A.R. Labs said I'm 0.4% fat by weight.  And that's with eating like 6 meals a day!\"  <br>\r\nHe turned to face her.  \"But I understand what you're doing and honestly, it's pretty cool.  Jinx said something to me about all the role models for girls being bimbo bodied beauties.  She-\"<br>\r\n\"Is that what I am now?\" smirked Raven.<br>\r\nHe looked away.  \"Um, no comment.\"<br>\r\nShe chuckled.  \"Alright.  Let's do this.  Hit me with your best shot, skinny boy.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he said from two feet away in the stainless steel lined room.  \"This is gonna take a sec.  Lot of controls to set here,\" he added as he turned several knobs and flicked more switches.  At last he was ready and nodded to her.  <br>\r\n\"This isn't very precise.  Flash thought he got hit with this ray for about 5 seconds when he zoomed up to a thousand pounds.  So, we'll just try a couple seconds.\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, he flipped another switch and the device hummed to life.  He pulled a trigger and a bright green ray emerged from the muzzle of the ray gun.  Raven felt warm and tingly all over her body and then Kid Flash let go of the trigger.  But the changes to her body caused by the ray were just starting when he stopped firing.<br>\r\nShe felt her belly become convex and then almost ooze into rolls of fat down her sides.  Her thighs first touched then overlapped by several inches, the flesh dimpling in the cottage cheese-like texture of advanced cellulite.  Her taut butt ballooned outward and her twin perky round breasts expanded in just seconds to nearly the size of cow udders.  Atop it all, her face puffed out and her neck fattened till she had four or five extra chins below her actual one.<br>\r\nLuckily, her outfit was stretchy enough to expand to her new dimensions, though her long cape now looked more like Robin's short one, as it barely covered past her hugely expanded waist.  <br>\r\n\"You okay?\" asked a worried Kid Flash.<br>\r\nRaven steadied herself against the wall, trying to adjust to her new feeling of mass.  She nodded.<br>\r\n\"Allright then, let's quantify this,\" he said leading her around the corner to a freight scale.  Raven found she had to waddle a certain way.  Her thighs overlapped too much to walk the way she used to.  But she didn't feel that bad about herself.  In fact . . .<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\nShe felt good enough to give a healthy swat to skinny ass Kid Flash's buns.<br>\r\nShe laughed.  \"I always wanted to do that.\"<br>\r\nHe looked at her nervously.  \"Is this affecting you hormonally and psychologically?\" he asked as she stepped onto the freight scale.<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" she shrugged.  \"Truth is, it doesn't feel bad and I almost feel as though it frees me.  I can forget my inhibitions.  I-\"<br>\r\nShe stopped because the blurring red digital display was finally settling on a number.<br>\r\n467<br>\r\nRaven laughed.  \"I weigh 467 pounds?  Wow.\"<br>\r\nKid Flash nodded, unsure what to say.  She now weighed 300 pounds more than him.  He turned around to shut off the machine and, again, she goosed him.<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Stop that!\"<br>\r\n\"What're you gonna do about it, stick figure?\" she chuckled.<br>\r\nHe rolled his eyes.  \"I'm a speedster,\" he protested against the denigration of his physique.  <br>\r\n\"You're a bunster,\" she laughed swatting his butt one more time before he zipped out of her reach, a red and yellow blur now at the door to the storage room.<br>\r\n\"At least you're in good spirits,\" he said.  \"I was worried you'd be depressed.\"<br>\r\n\"Nope.  I'm jolly,\" she said and laughed.  \"Okay, time for the new me to face the world,\" she said and nodded to the flame haired speedster.  He opened the door and she waddled out to face Robin, Beast Boy, Cyborg and Starfire.  Their eyes bugged out and their jaws dropped.  Their 120 pound teammate stood before them now weighing 467 pounds.  No one said anything.  The silence was finally broken by Robin's squeal.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n\"I always wanted to do that, too,\" she chuckled about her swat of their leader's butt.<br>\r\n\"She, um, she says it feels like she's lost some inhibitions,\" said Kid Flash rubbing his own butt.<br>\r\n\"You are . . most  . . large, friend Raven.\"<br>\r\nFour hundred sixty seven pounds, she told them.<br>\r\n\"Is . . is this what you really want, Raven?\" asked Beast Boy.<br>\r\nShe nodded emphatically.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Raven asked Robin to think up an excuse for them to appear in public and Robin did.  The Mayor of Jump City was always looking for excuses to be seen in public with the incredibly popular and telegenic young heroes who guarded the City.  <br>\r\nRaven watched from off screen as Robin, standing in front of the 6 foot wide screen in the communications center.  He was very clever.  Didn't you want to give us some sort of junior role models award Mr. Mayor?  We've got a little down time now so maybe we could have the ceremony tomorrow morning?  <br>\r\nOf course, Robin was making the whole thing up but the Mayor immediately claimed that he had been about to do just that.  He said tomorrow at 10 at City Hall would be perfect.  <br>\r\nAt 10 am the next morning, the Teen Titans arrived to the cheers of a couple thousand fans at the front steps of City Hall.  They lined up behind the Mayor at the podium.  He grinned at them but then his jaw dropped at the sight of a nearly 500 pound Raven eating a jelly doughnut while she stood there.  He rushed over to Robin.  <br>\r\n\"Is she okay?  She's-she's . . huge!\"<br>\r\n\"That's the real her,\" said Robin never turning from his stare out toward the crowd.<br>\r\n\"But . . she was always so . . um, cute looking?\"<br>\r\n\"She says that was a spell cast on her by an evil mage.\"<br>\r\nThe Mayor sighed in frustration.  They were all a bit freakish, except for Robin and the Kid Flash boy and he wore the tightest outfit not in a ballet.  But this was too much.  Raven wasn't cute or interesting now like the green boy or the girl who looked like she'd overdone the sprayed on tan.  Oh, what the hell were their names?!  She was just plain . . . fat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor spoke for a minute about what great role models the Titans were for Jump City's youth.  Then he turned over the podium to Robin.  Only, to his exasperation, Robin immediately turned it over to Raven.  She waddled up to the micro, still eating her jelly doughnut.<br>\r\n\"Hi, everybody.  You may be wondering why I look like this.  Well, this is the real me.  That weird skinny version of me was the result of a spell cast on me.  I was never comfortable in that skinny body.  It always felt like the real me was trying to burst out.  It wasn't even mentally comfortable.  It included a element of amnesia so that I would forget what I really look like.  And this is the real me,\" she said squeezing the sides of her massive, spherical body.<br>\r\n\"But don't worry.  I still have all my powers and I'll be just as good as superhero even though I'm no longer a skinny butt like him or him,\" she said gesturing to Kid Flash and Beast Boy to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took some questions and immediately divulged that she now weighed 487 pounds.  She posed for pictures, letting photographers shoot her from the front, with her massive cow udder breasts and from the rear with her pachyderm-like butt.  Then she flew off with the others, carried by a spell of black energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe press was merciless.  For the next few days, every paper, tv station showed pictures captioned with things like \"Ate the Raven, Ever More\" and \"Super Fat Super Hero\".<br>\r\nSeparately, all of her teammates offered support to her, worried that the scathing criticism would hurt her.  But she was immensely strong about it.  And true to her word, she was just as good a super hero as before.  <br>\r\nRunning speed and gymnastics had never been the strength she brought to the team anyway.  She conjured up power from other dimensions using spells.  And, if anything, she was more powerful now.  It had nothing to do with her newly corpulent body but with the peace of mind it gave her that she was helping girls who couldn't live up to unrealistic standards of slenderness.  Though it was hard to cross her legs the right way any more.  She had to get help from Beast Boy once.  Her thighs were so thick now.  Her mediation improved as well.  <br>\r\nDoctor Light thought he'd greatly improved his powers, some kind of photon ray supposedly.  The Titans rushed out to stop him.  He zapped Kid Flash and Beast Boy and was aiming for Starfire flying above.  But, Azareth, Metrion, Zinthos!  She projected enough black energy to wipe him out easily.  She crushed cinder block like nothing a few days later.  <br>\r\nIt was true.  The others could tell.  She was even more powerful now than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then a funny thing started in the press.  Editors, writers and photographers who didn't look anything like models in Vogue or GQ but who'd always been embarrassed about it started to feel a little less defensive.  An item or two in the Jump City Times actually made fun of what skinny asses Robin, Beast Boy and Kid Flash were.  Another piece worried that Starfire was anorexic.  And then there started to appear puff pieces, not many and not frequently, but they were definitely there, in newspapers and magazines, on Fox news and CNN.  They started doing positive pieces about Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe momentum swung so far around that the Teen Titans boys had all spent a time or two in front of a mirror not luxuriating in pride at their slenderness but wondering if they weren't too skinny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dinnner one night, they all told Raven how proud they were of the change she'd made in people's attitudes and what's more . . .</span></div></div>",

It was a busy day for the Teen Titans, plus it was the debut of the new and heavy Raven. For the most part, it when well for Raven. With the added fat, she became the new muscle for the team along side with Cyborg. Even though, the added fat was a bit difficult to move for Raven. However, she would hover most of the time. Also, due to her larger size, she became an easier target to hit for the villains. Eventually, she got use to it, as well as the rest of the team. The team praise Raven's larger from, which add to her strength. She even stop Gizmo by just sitting on him, the Teen Titans never ever seen Gizmo calling them snot so much before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Raven was on top of Teen Tower with the fat ray gun, waiting for Kid Flash.

He showed Raven how that you must type in a weight that you want and then use a dial to set the intensity of the ray that will hit the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that is about it\" said Kid Flash as he gave back the fat ray gun to Raven. \"Thank you so much\" said Raven as she gave Kid Flash a slap on his butt.\"Hey, not again\" shouted Kid Flash. \"You know you should get use to it, because I sure do\" shout Raven!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah, never seen you like this, even you skin looks lighter\" said Kid Flash as he was rubbing his butt. \"Yes, I know, this new suit I got feels a lot better on me too, even the cape is back to size\" said Raven. \"Ok, than I got to get going back to Jinx because we are trying to convince Mammoth to join the good side\" said Kid Flash. \"Oh you, I like to watch you shake those buns of yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, only Jinx is allowed to slap my butt!\" Kid Flash left the tower and head towards the city. Raven stood there and started to think about what Kid Flash just said. Raven was thinking if sexy Kid Flash has a girlfriend, then who else would be perfect for her. Someone she must like her she thought, but who. \"hmm, well I will see into that, but I have to try this ray gun out on Starfire.\"<br>\r\n                </span></div></div>",

Second, she also met Starfire in the kitchen and they both had a bit of a snack. Finally, she woke up Beast Boy and they had a little chat. It was good to get somethings off of her chest that way she can sleep better tonight. However, she would still like someone like her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walk towards her room door. Her fat was jiggling harder than ever before. She felt every movement of her fat on her body and love it! The door opened up and she saw the inside of her room, but she knew it was going to be hard for her to enter. So, she tried to get through the frame of the door. She tried all her might, but the door frame won in the end. It is at that moment when she realized that she can use her magic against the door frame. She can use her magic to widen the door frame so she can enter. With her magic, she was able to summon a pair of black hands to be place at the sides of the door frame. With some force, the door frame became wider for Raven's ever growing shape. She was now able to fit through her door and into her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven closed the door behind her and sat on her bed. Raven was quite the tired women and was really enjoying the sit down. Her suit is very tight and since no one is in her room and no one usually enter her room. She decided to take off her suit. She first took the cape off because it was too small for her now. She than started to take off her skin tight suit. While she was taking off her suit, rolls of fat were ozzing out her suit and her breasts were being squished together. Do to her fat, her skin was whiter than ever. The love handels were pushing her against her suit, that rips in her suit were becaming bigger. To the point were a rip went through her suit. At this point, all Raven can do is smile at the fat that was on her body. She stood up so she can let the suit fall off. As it fell off of her body, a cold rush of air came right at her and felt it all over her now naked body. She was butt naked now and she love every minuite of it. She felt through her rolls of heavy and squishy lard. She gave her big ass a slap, so she can watch it move around. She would dig her hands into her fat ass to see how fat and deep her ass has become! She move On from her butt to her arms which were coated in Lardy goodness. Her arm fat was hanging quite well and gave it a jab to watch it move a bit. At that moment, Raven remembered her thick thighs. She looked down to see fat coated tree truck sized thunder thighs. It was amazing to see them in all of their fatty glory! She grabbed them and shook them hard, causing multiple ripples of fat to jiggle. Her hands moved once more, but now the hands were hovering over a sea of fatty lard. It was her belly, of course. She grabbed it, jabbed it, and shook it until she became tired from it. She let out a blush, signaling that she was having great pleasure in her fat play. She than place both her hands on her boobs, she slowly move them around a bit. She just loved her fatter boobs! The way they jiggle up and down was a real turn on for her! Finally, she place a hand on her face, feeling out how cubby her face has become. She pitch her cubby cheeks and her Multiple chins. Feeling out the fat that has accumulate below her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was good and the world was alright. Raven was in total bliss and she did not wanted to end! However, she would have like to share her bliss as well. That was for another time and she went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She got up and looked at herself in the mirror, she was still naked. Luckily, she had the door locked and she was all alone in her room last night as well as this mourning. Raven remember her playful night yesterday and the joys that came with it. She love the way her fat was hanging from her midsection. The way her breast were resting on her extended stomach was such a pleasure for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven looked down next to her and saw her once small suit. She wonder if she can save it for a future use, but her new body is no use for it. Plus, the suit has multiple rips and tears that it is beyond repair. She used her magic to pick up the suit into a drawer. She also realized that she has gotten lazier since her gain. She could have pick the suit off the floor with her hands but her new found fat got in the way. She though to herself that she still needs to get really used to her fat. Now that her old suit is out of the way, she needs to find a suit that can fit her. She opened up more drawers in search of a replacement for her. When she found it, a suit that was the same size as her old suit. She worked her magic on the suit so it can fit her body better. The suit and the cape was being stretched by the flowing black hand in all the right places. Evenly, the suit looked the right size for her and the cape has become long enough for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven started to put on her suit, which felt a lot easier to do than ever before. The suit was up to her belly and felt better on her body. The suit still felt snug on her body, but it still felt nice. The way the suit was still hugged her butt cheeks behind her was a great feeling. She looked at the mirror so she can look behind her. She saw her nice plush butt being hugged by her suit. It was fun to see her body like this, hugging her body. The suit has become a second skin for her, but she wonders if she puts on more weight that the suit will become tight. She will have to control her self in that. She continue to admire her body when she saw something that she did not see before. She looked upon her thighs, which were thick with fat and they were rubbing each other. Behind her thighs, she had some Cottage cheese going on there. It cause some worry within her. She loves her fat thighs, but she did not like her uneven back thighs. Maybe she can smooth those areas out with a spell or with some cream. She also thought if she can lose some weight, she can smooth them out. However that is for another time, but hope that people will not notice it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for some breakfast and Raven slowly walk toward the door. She went through the door, which was much to her size. The way she was slowly walking was good for her so she can get use to it and to get some exercise to maintain a superhero life. She can float her way to the kitchen but she chose not to. She was hungry and wanted to see her friends so they can see her new suit.            </span></div></div>",

In came Raven very slowly, and greeted Starfire. \"Good mourning, Starfire\" said Raven as she sat at the table and getting some food to munch on. \"Hello, large Raven, how are you this day?\" question Starfire. \"oh I feel quite great today, plus this new suit just adds to my body\" said Raven as she chewed on a piece of bread. \"that is great, me and Robin are going to go to the mall of the shopping for a little while, hope you keep yourself company\" said Starfire as she started to walk out of the room. Raven looked up to see Starfire, she was quite focus on her food. \"Do not worry about me Starfire, I need to practice on my movement and to get ready for any crime fighting that we might do\" said Raven. Starfire left towards Jump City while Raven was enjoying her delicious breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Raven finish off her Breakfast, she went off to do practice her walking. She decide to practice in the kitchen/living room area because it was big enough for her to walk around. It was a lot harder to walk because now everything she does is heavier for her. The fat would swing from side to side every step she would take. Walking around the room was great for her body to get the experience she will need. Every movement she would take it would send ripples of fat across her body. She stop in the middle of room to admire her body once more. Up until now she was having trouble with her body. However, she has now nailed the rhythm of her new body fat. It please her and she now can walk normal, such it was hard at time, but she can overlook that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has also dawn on her that she has not seen Beast Boy or Cyborg this mourning, maybe they are working on something she wonder. she decided to go and check them out.         </span></div></div>",

Once there, she began to open up selves and take out supplies that she needed to make. She knew what she was making and she didn't want Beast Boy to find out. A delicious soup that had all the things that Beast Boy enjoyed since he was a vegan. She came back to Beast Boy with his meal and sat back down on her seat. Beast Boy look in awe at his meal due to the fact that he was hungrier than ever. He took a spoon near him and dug deep into the soup. Beast Boy did not notice that Raven was actually sitting next to him during his time eating his soup. Raven was thinking on what to say next until it hit her, \" you know, I think you are too skinny.\" After Beast Boy finished his soup and set it aside, he had Raven's full attention. \"yes I think you are too skinny for your own good, I mean just look at your self\" said Raven as she reached out to Beast Boy to lifted his shirt. This confuses Beast Boy due to the fact that he has been skinny through out his life and hearing what Raven had to say was odd to him. Raven felt Beast Boy flat stomach, which cause a little concern from Beast Boy. It dawn on him that he has always keep his body in tip top shape, but as what Raven just said he was a bit too skinny. He was the thinnest member in the team were as Raven was now the fattest member on the team. \"well know that you told me that, I might need to work out more,\" Beast Boy put his shirt down once Raven finished her \"examine\", \"I should put on some more weight, muscle wise.\" \"Well you might say that\" grinned Raven.

Once she took out the knife, she took the slice of cake and shoved it into Beast Boy's mouth. While Beast Boy had his mouth full of cake, in some what of a state of shock, he looked at Raven with a look of concern. Raven put a hand to Beast Boy's cheek, \"oh just eat it will you. Upon saying those words, Beast Boy's green skin turn red. Beast Boy chewed on his slice of delicious cake, which was a big piece of cake, and shallows the whole thing. \"That was very delicious, I thing I will enjoy the rest the of the cake later...\" Beast Boy was again interrupted by Raven shoving another piece of cake into his mouth. \"there, you going to have keep up with me when I am feeding you\" said Raven as she was cutting up the rest of the cake. This process of Raven feeding Beast Boy when on for quite sometime until there was no more cake. Beast Boy was in a state of a food coma. Raven lifted up Beast Boy's shirt to find his once slim green belly has rounded out a bit. \"oh you wouldn't be so tiny when I am through with you\" said Raven as she pick up the plate that had the cake. She walk to the kitchen, happily knowing that she is fattening Beast Boy right under his nose. Speaking of Beast Boy, he looked behind him to see what Raven was up too. He was surprise to see that Raven was using her magic to make more food, a black cloud would magically teleport food into the room. Raven put the plate away and pick up a large pie that was teleported in. Beast Boy tried to stand up but a force pull him back down. It was Raven's hand that pulled him back down.\"oh come on Raven, that is a lot of food for even one man too eat\" yawned Beast Boy. Since Raven stuffed him with so much cake, he was becoming sleepy from it. This pleased Raven as she sat next to him again. \"well, I make all that food for you to eat,\" Raven took a slice from the pie, \"you don't want all the food to go to waste?\" Beast Boy had his sight on the food that the dark cloud was creating, he didn't want Raven to feel bad for making all the food. He knew that he is going to pass out for eating all that food. In the end, he was doing it for Raven, who has Never been this happy in her life. He open his mouth so that Raven could place the delicious slice of pie. He chewed the wonderfully tasting pie and shallowed it down. It was pure bliss for Raven to seen the tiny green boy expand before her. She took the whole pie now and shove it to Beast Boy's face. Even though most of the pie was all over his face, Beast Boy just licked some of the pieces off. This act of feeding Beast Boy with a plethora of foods when<br>\r\nOn for quite a while. From different kinds of cakes to a multitude of pies. Beast Boy was being feed to the brim. After sometime, Beast Boy has passed out from Raven's feeding. The little green boy was no longer little. Raven stood over Beast Boy in a state of bliss. She looked over the new belly of Beast Boy. His stomach has started to grow out of his shirt. Raven lifted up Beast Boy's shirt to uncover the dome like belly. Gone was Beast Boy's tiny belly, replace was big round mid section. Raven place her hand on his belly, she felt the smooth surface of the belly. She also felt that his belly was tight as well. Raven notice that she over fed Beast Boy, so she started to put things away. At that moment, the tv screen turn on and Robin was on the screen. \"Hello Raven, is everything alright Over there?\", question Robin. Looking up at the screen, Raven step forward. \"yes, all is fine here at the tower\" said Raven. Robin responded, \"that is good to hear, Starfire and I just encounter cyborg, so we will be heading your way.\" Raven nodded to what Robin just said. The screen went black as Raven went back to Beast Boy. She told Beast Boy to wake up from his slumber. Beast Boy responded with a little moan. Raven stood there thinking on what to do next. She got a hold of Beast Boy and stood him up. Even though Beast Boy was dull, he was still able to walk a bit. They both moved towards Beast Boy's room, Raven smiling the whole way. \"once I am done with you, you will end up like me, big and fat\" she said to the limp Beast Boy. She gave Beast Boy's belly a pat once they reached his room. Raven departed Beast Boy by giving a little push towards Beast Boy into his room. He walk a bit like a zombie into his room. Until he fell on to his bed. Raven make sure everything was alright with Beast Boy as the door closed between them. \u00a0</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was noon when The sun rose high over Jump City. The Teen Titans have already started their day. Expect for one of the them, Beast Boy. He was in a deep coma from last day feast. Some of the Titans were wondering why hasn't Beast Boy woken up. Raven knew what was up, which is why she told the rest of the Titans. She told them that he wasn't feeling too well which is why he slept sooner than usual. Starfire was worried \u00a0about Beast Boy, but Raven told her that she did not need to. Both Robin and Cyborg agree not to bother Beast Boy while he rested. As for Raven and StarFire, they send sometime training, more so for Raven( due to her new weight).\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around this time that Beast Boy woke up from his daze. He opened his eyes completely to see the light coming into his room. The first thing that came to his mind was that he slept in late. He shifted his weight to see his clock; it read 12:05 PM. He gave out a moan, due to the fact that he remember what made him sleep late. It was Raven's crazy feeding yesterday. He remembered Raven stuffing him with cakes and pies. He rubbed his stomach to remind him of the stuffing. To which he realize something odd. He felt his stomach again to find that it felt very soft. It confuse him, to which he stood up to find that standing was a bit difficult to do. He look down to see what was going with himself. He found that he was no longer skinny, he now had a belly sticking out of his shirt. Beast Boy stood dumbfounded at the sight of his chubby new from. He tried to pull down his shirt but could not due to the new fat. Beast Boy poke his fatty belly, \"Raven really overfed me.\" Saying that, he took off his shirt to see how much fat was on him. He saw that fat has started to from on his chest, which now gave him breasts. He pitch them and shook them to see that they bounce with every movement. After that, he poked his chubby belly, which was quite soft. At that moment, Beast Boy wanted to talk to Raven. He decided that he wanted to tell her of the events yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy put on his shirt( tried to, due to his belly poking out.) Once he manage to do so, he step out of his room. At that moment, he was thinking were could Raven be. Could she be in her room or in the living room? Beast boy decide to check in Raven in her room. He also did not want the others to see him just yet.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy arrived at Raven's room, wishing that she was in there. The door slid open and he took a look inside. Raven was inside with StarFire chatting about something that Beast Boy was not able to hear. Upon seeing Starfire, he closed the door. He did not want to see starfire's reaction to his new body just yet. Beast Boy was very nervous of Starfire might tell the others. However, he can stay outside forever just wondering about that. So, he reopened the door and walked inside.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven sat on her bed facing Starfire, who sat on a chair across from her. They were both talking about how since they can fly without the help of the other. That they should team up more often when fighting the villains of Jump City. Due to Raven's larger frame and expertise in magic, she can give the muscle to the team up. As for Starfire, with her slender and fast body, she can give the speed to the team up.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were chatting away about their team up, in comes Beast Boy. Raven is the first to notice him as he walked into the room. She smiles and blushes \u00a0to the new Beast Boy. She knows what Beast Boy was going to say to her and she knows what to say back. All the food that she feed him has make him chubbier. She marvels at how just plump he has become. She still knows that he is not as fat as her, but he will be soon. She even has to admit that if it wasn't for Kid Flash, she would date Beast Boy. Raven signaled Beast Boy to come forward. Starfire finally stop her discussion with Raven to see what was going on. She saw Beast Boy and stood up to greet him. However, she stop dead on her tracks and put a hand on her mouth. She blush underneath her hand as she took a good look at Beast Boy. She removed her hand and said \"oh my, large friend Raven, you are no longer the only Jumbo size member on the team.\" Raven stood up and said \" no Starfire, you got it all wrong, I am the jumbo sized one, he is only large sized.\" Both the girls laughed while Beast Boy stood in front of them nervously. Putting a hand behind his head, Beast Boy said \"well you can say that I am no longer small sized.\" Starfire moved closer to Beast Boy and put a hand on his shoulder. Looking him over, she question \"is this the reason why you went to sleep early yesterday?\" Before Beast Boy could answer, Raven spoke first. \"yes it is Starfire, you see Beast Boy here was feeling sick\" shout Raven. \"so as any good team member, I want to cure him and so I fed him.\" Starfire look at Beast Boy again and poke his stomach, \"I think you over did it, however he does look healthy now!\" Beast Boy felt a sence of relief upon hearing what Raven and Starfire were talking about. He felt so much better that they did not take his gain the wrong way. \" it has been nice talking with you Raven, but it is about time for me to go\" said Starfire. Raven crossed her chucky arms, \"where do you have to go?\" Starfire headed to the door, \" I want to see Robin beat Cyborg in a game of basket and ball.\" Raven nodded as Starfire step out of the room.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since her gain, Raven's room became a lot more bright. Her room was become less dark and dim, however she still had her magic books and her dark arts supplies. \"you do know that I was not sick\" said Beast Boy. \"of course you are not, but you looked nervous towards her, so I'd help\" said Raven still crossing her arms. \"that is nice of you to do that but their is a reason why I am here\" spoke Beast Boy. Raven unfolding her flabby arms on place \u00a0 Them on her thick hips,\"oh what would that be?\" Beast Boy was dumbfounded from what he just heard. \"oh of course I know what you are here for,\" \u00a0Raven moving herself closer to Beast Boy,\"you are here because I made you fat.\" \"yes that is correct\" said Beast Boy tugging down his shirt. \"you still need to get used to your new gut of your,\" reaching out and giving his gut a slap,\"and I can make your clothes fit again.\" Beast Boy had a naive expression on his face,\"what do you mean \"get use to\", I was planning on losing it once I got the...\" Before Beast Boy can finish his sentence, his belly gave out a rumble. It make him blush while it make Raven grin. At that moment, she took Beast Boy by his hand and push him out the room. She came out as well with him, \" looks like you can use a meal.\" \"hey look just because my belly said I am hungry does not mean...\" Unfortunately for Beast Boy, he was once again interrupted by Raven. She place her fatty arms around his body and pushed him towards the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

They can have the whole room to themselves, just like yesterday. Walking down the steps, Beast Boy and Raven came to a stop. Raven put \u00a0an arm around Beast Boy's shoulder, \"so what do you feel like having, fatboy?\" As Beast Boy's belly growled, he suggest that if there is anything left in the fridge.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven took her gaze off from Beast Boy and to the fridge. She was thinking of the most wonderful foods that can fatten Beast Boy up. All the ways she can add fat to his expanding body. Raven returned her gaze to Beast Boy, admiring his cubby cheeks. \"why don't you take a seat and I will get some food for you,\" Raven spoke to Beast Boy. She waddled to the kitchen meanwhile Beast Boy took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven uses her magic to remove different kinds of foods from the fridge. From cold pizzas to cherry jello was taken out. She place them down next to her and started to separated them to categories. Any meat based foods was moved to it's own group. All foods that is a pastry was moved into to it section. The more healthy foods were place aside if she need them. She ponder wither she is going to feed Beast Boy with sweets or with meats. She just smiled as she knew how to feed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy looked onward to the kitchen, as Raven prepare his feast. He saw that Raven was place the foods in group. He wonder as to why she is doing it but it did not bother him. He was more concern that Raven would remember his vegenism. He hope that it will not happen like last time. That Raven will not get WAY to into it. Beast Boy now saw that Raven has placed on a tray a good assortment of healthy foods. This pleased him as he took his mind off of his worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven, with the tray of foods, waddled over to the awaiting Beast Boy. She placed the tray of healthy foods in front him. A growling sound was heard from Beast Boy's belly, signaling his hunger. Raven smiled as she knew what she must do soon. Beast Boy digged into the feast that was made by Raven. While he was munching on his food, Raven went back to her preparations. Once he was done, she will commence in her next phase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food on the tray was starting to disappear bit by bit. Most of it went into Beast Boy's mouth. Others were reduce to nothing but crumbs on the tray. The chair that Beast Boy sat on was creaking ever so slightly. His entire body before this meal was In a chubby state. Now it is some what of a plump state. Beast Boy took the last bite out of his food as he move the tray aside. The tray was in a messy state than it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven, after finishing her \"plans\", came over to Beast Boy. As he was resting against the creaky chair. She spoke, \"well looks like you just finish your meal there.\" Raven placed her hands on his softening shoulders, rubbing them gently. \"oh that was a good meal\" sighed Beast Boy. Raven purred slightly, \" why don't you rest a pit on the couch.\" Beast Boy nodded as he stood up and waddled over to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven told Beast Boy that she will be right back. She decided to see what the rest of the titans are up to. Raven walked down the hallway to the elevator. The elevator took her to the basketball court. Once she arrive there, she saw Robin dunking more shoots than Cyborg as Starfire cheered him on. \"oh hello there friend\" said Starfire as she stop her cheer. \"is Beast Boy any better now?\" questioned Starfire. Just as Raven was about to speak towards Starfire, an alarm broke out. Robin and Cybrog look up from their game that they were playing. \"look there trouble in Jump City, we have to go now!\" yelled Robin. Both the male Titans took off leaving Starfire behind with Raven. \"I was going to say that Beast Boy needs time to rest a little longer, he should be up and about by tomorrow\" said Raven to Starfire. Starfire nodded \"then I must, go and help Robin and Cybrog out.\" \"please take good care of him\" said Starfire as she took off as well. Raven in the middle of the court, thinking about her plans. \"oh I well take good care of Beast Boy alright.\"\u00a0</span></div></div>",

She waddled over to sit with him. As she sat next to him, she saw that his shirt has tighten. It is starting to reviled even more Belly on him, which caused Raven to grin. Even his pants were tighten up since his feast and there are parts were it was starting to tear a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy turned to see Raven grinning at him. \" what is on your mind there?\" upon hearing this, Raven blush a bit. It took a moment to think of what to say to Beast Boy. It felt Like forever for Raven to think of something to say. \"you have really grown, Beast Boy.\" spoke Raven. \" At this rate, you will be as fat as me.\" \"Which is nothing wrong with that, I am just saying.\" Raven place her hand on Beast Boy's plump green belly. Her hand sank into the soft flesh that was a part of Beast Boy.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy gave Raven a strange look. \"As I said before I plan on to lose all of this.\" \"I have never been fat in my life, being this big is just odd to me.\" He place his hand on his stomach and rubbed it . He could feel just how soft he has become. The way the fat jiggle under the pressure of his hand. On the other side of his belly, Raven still had her hand on it. Seeing this, Raven pushed her hand even farther into Beast Boy's fatty belly. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy blush a bit, \"you seem to really like playing with my fat.\" Raven looked back at him, \"I know!\" Hearing this, Raven started to used both her hands to really push into Beast Boy's flesh. \"your belly is so soft,big, and doughy\" said Raven. She was \u00a0causing waves of fat clashing against each other from Beast Boy. The way his fat was plush as a Teddy bear. It reminded Raven of her own obese body. \" I really want you fatter\" said Raven out loud.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven just realize the mistake she just made. \"excuse me, come again\" asked Beast Boy. Raven let go of Beast Boy's stomach and bit her lip for a moment. She stood up from the coach and stood in front of Beast Boy. \"what I'd said is that I what you happier!\" Beast Boy pause for a moment. \"what do you mean by that\" question Beast Boy. Raven started to feel through her fat, \"I mean look at me , I am really happy being fat.\" \"you are getting bigger, don't you like at least?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy lifted his shirt to expose his fat. Showing his plump green belly with his man breasts on top of it. \"not really, it feels odd to me, to be honest with \u00a0you.\" \"I do feel much warmer, which does feel neat.\" \"I do not see it as you though.\" Raven felt as if she is failing to convince Beast Boy. \"look at me, I am quite Lardy.\" Raven place her hands on her love handles. She pitch them, feeling the soft doughy fat form around her fingers. Still using her fingers, she lifted her fat and let it drop. Her whole body jiggled violently to the force of her love \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Handles. \u00a0\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy tried to refit himself with his shirt, but failed. His shirt is still exposing his fat. Raven stop with her fondling and waddle beside Beast Boy. \"I am happy for you\" said Beast Boy. \"what I really want to know is that have you been fattening me up on purpose?\" there was a pause after Beast Boy spoke. \"um, Raven did you hear me?\" there was an even longer pause. \" Raven can you hear\", Beast Boy was interrupted by a slice of pie being shoved into his mouth. Slowing chewing his food, he saw Raven hovering over him. With a pie in one hand and a knife in the other. Before Beast Boy could shallow the pie slice, Raven shoved yet again pie slice into his mouth.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis process continue once Beast Boy finish the pie. Luckily Raven had more to give him. There where a plethora of pies behide \u00a0her. Using her magic, they hovered over her. She cut each one of them and send them at Beast Boy. Still using her magic, the pie slices separated from each other. At a pace, they entered Beast Boy's mouth. He could not hold back from eating these slices. In his mind, he knew that he should not. In his stomach, he wanted more.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parade of pie slices continue to enter Beast Boy's mouth. Raven's magic led her to do others things without even focusing on the feeding. She bend over to Beast Boy's belly. She shoved her whole chubby face on to Beast Boy's fatty belly. \"my goodness, you are so plush\" said Raven. \"soon you will be my size or even bigger!\" \"all I need to do \u00a0is keep this up, I think I have enough food for you.\" \"Speaking of which, I think you are going to need more.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Raven left Beast Boy, she gave his belly a little kiss. She got up and headed to the kitchen. She saw behind her that Beast Boy was still being fed by the magical pies. It should only be a matter of time when the feeding will stop. Luckily she plan ahead of time. She had \u00a0prepare an army of pasties for Beast Boy to consume. Getting ready for her moment of attack, Raven was making sure that each \u00a0<br>\r\nPasties was delicious to eat. She took a cream filled donut and eat it. She tasted the lovely flavor of cream and chocolate at the same time. She licked off some cream from her lips. \" yes this is quite good,\" she patted her expand belly,\" I wonder if Beast Boy is ready.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven heard a moan behind her, she saw that Beast Boy has finished his pies. \"Oh just in the nick of time\" said Raven. She used her magic to hover donuts towards Beast Boy. She saw that Beast Boy's \u00a0shirt has stretched a bit that it started to tear. \"ah that is quite the development for you, Beast Boy!\" Beast Boy could only focus on his expanding belly.\u00a0<br>\r\nThe many donuts floating around start to enter Beast Boy's maw. Chewing at a steady pace, Beast Boy's shirt continued to stretched. \u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven observed the fatten up Beast Boy. She can see that there was a huge tear across his chest. Wonderfully exposing Beast Boy's breasts for Raven. \u00a0 \"I wonder if your shirt will be able to hold on\" spoke Raven. She came near Beast Boy to examine him. She notice how his fat has make his shirt tight on him. She place a hand to his pants to see how it was holding up. Oddly enough, his pants was holding up quite nicely compared to his shirt. \"hmm, I could cast a spell on to your clothes but where is the fun in that!\" She gazed back to the kitchen to summon more food for Beast Boy. She sat next to him as the parade of food continued it march.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been a couple of hours once the feast was over. Raven's army of pasties has become nothing but crumbs. Most of these crumbs were all over Beast Boy's body. The crumbs rested on Beast Boy's bare skin. His shirt has fail to contain his fat. It's remains was all over the ground. Over at the kitchen, there were stacks of plates in the sink. From the way it seems, it was the aftermath of a great battle. Only the smell of once living pasties remain in tact.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven rested her head on one of Beast Boy's breasts. She was content to have seen Beast Boy's growth. She also was rubbing Beast Boy's massive stomach. At this point, Beast Boy has become a bit fatter than Raven. Compare to Raven, Beast Boy's breasts were much bigger than Raven's! His Hugh green belly was overflowing with fat. He had developed bigger love handles, which causes Raven to shake them. Sometimes, she feels her fatty body to see how similar or different their bodies were. Most of the time, they were the same. Like in Beast Boy's neck fat and chubby cheeks. Other times, they were different. As in Beast Boy's belly fat, which still felt a bit bloated. At the end of the day, it made Raven very happy.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun has disappeared and in it's place was the moon. \"well, it is time to sleep, don't you agree\" spoke Raven. Beast Boy was half asleep at this point. \"oh my big fat boy really does need to go to sleep!\" She stood up from the couch, which has left a big indent from her butt. She tried to left up Beast Boy, but there was no way that would happen. \" you have gotten so heavy for me, do not worry, I know a way.\" \"you will get used to the heaviness just like I did.\" \" I could even teach you as well!\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her magic, she lifted Beast Boy from the couch. Still under Raven's control, Beast Boy waddle towards his room. Raven follow just behind him as well. They both arrived to Beast Boy's room. The door frame was still bend from Raven's growth. Due to Beast Boy's new fatten body, this was a good thing. Before Beast Boy entered his room, Raven got behind him. Raven tried to hug Beast Boy, but failed . She blushed due to she was now smaller than him. She than instead lift Beast Boy's stomach and let it drop. His fat jiggle and wiggle from Raven playing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy entered his room and flopped onto his bed. The impact was so great that his bed broke under the added weight. \"'oh my, I will fix that later\" said Raven as she closed the door between them.\u00a0<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Raven smiled and hugged him tightly. \"But, you'll have to get just as big as I am, we'll be the same weight. Will you agree to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven nodded, swiftly summoning more food to her table and eating like a starved pig. Once she was done, her stomach was bloated, nearly ripping through her outfit. \"I just...URRRAAAP...just cast a spell on all this food I ate. It'll make me gain twice as much weight in less time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast Boy grinned at that. \"So today is a fatten Raven day, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven nodded, eyes gleaming as she poked his jiggly middle. \"But tomorrow is a fatten Beast Boy day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can live with that. Will that spell work on any food you eat from now on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For today,\" Raven replied.

Beast Boy was eager to gain and snuck a few pieces on the side, but a majority of the food ended up in Raven's now gargantuan stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuurp.  Beast... Boy... I think I'm... I think I'm done for the day... Urp.\"  Raven managed to say, her hands attempting to rub as much of her absolutely engorged stomach.  She belched again, groaning from the massive amount of food in her stomach.  Her body had torn through a majority of her suit, and she was barely decent.  Her gut had absolutely surged outwards, weighing her down, a literal sphere of tight white flesh.  Every other noise out of her was a belch, and she was almost ready to burst.  Her magic had caused a majority of the fat in her body to focus on her stomach, but her ass and breasts had fattened up significantly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Raven, there's still a lot of food here.\"  Beast Boy said, looking at the remaining feast.  Despite eating pounds upon pounds of food, there was still a significant portion of the meal remaining.  \"Are you sure you can't eat anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... URRRRP.  Beast Boy, does... it look like I can eat anymore?\"  She moaned, her hands falling uselessly to her sides as she gave up on alleviating the pressure in her stomach.</span></div></div>",

Due to the fact that it was summer, Raven and Starfire were tanning themselves up. It has been a while since any of their villains has cause any kind of trouble. Slade has been in hiding, doing who knows what. Mad Mod had since than moved back to Great Britain. For the most part, it was mostly quite in Jump City.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn there swimwear, the two girls were relaxing under the sun. Starfire in a nice purple bikini was lying face downward. The sun hitting her body giving her a light tan. Meanwhile Raven, \u00a0under a giant umbrella, was lying down face forward. She had a bikini similar to starfire expect that it was blue. When Raven was thinner, it fit her perfectly. Now that she outgrow her bikini, she used her magic to abject it to her weight. It now hugs her body nicely. In some places it feels tight were in others it feels nice. What she really like from it was that it show off all her body fat to the world! She feel really sexy while wearing it. It also had quite the reaction from Starfire.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven came to accompany Starfire and tan for a while. Before they began to tan themselves, they made sure to put on sunscreen. Starfire was the first to do so. Due to her size, it was quite simple to apply the sunscreen. All that she asked from Raven was to put some on her back. Now Raven on the other hand, was much more sentive to the sun. so you put more sunscreen than Starfire. She made sure that every part of her body was covered. However, this proved to be difficult for her. She was able To apply the cream all over her front body. When it came to her entire back side, she need some assassinate. Luckily Starfire was more than happy to help her larger friend. For Raven, she really enjoyed how Starfire was rubbing the cream all over her back side. She did a really good job getting into every fold of Raven's body. Her fat was being molded by the fingers of Starfire like the way a baker to dough.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teens have been out for over an hour. Both of them were chatting of Several things to past adventures to there daily lives. It was at this moment were Raven wanted to get something off her chest. \"You know that Beast Boy is doing well at the moment\" said Raven relax under the umbrella. Hearing this, Starfire turned her head towards Raven. \"That is lovely to hear that Beast Boy is all better now!\" \"However I did more than just cure him. You saw that he was a bit fat yesterday. \u00a0Well, he has gotten much fatter than that. I wonder if he is up and about right now?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire upon hearing this sat up and fully face Raven. \"oh my, his illness has make him larger. I hope he is okay. He really did not want to be that way.\" Starfire reached out and grab a roll of fat from Raven. \"Has he gotten bigger than you?\" Raven responded, \"oh he really is, he is so fat and Lardy. I absolutely love how he has gotten.\" Raven grab her rolls of fat as she said that.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven knew what this was building up to.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
