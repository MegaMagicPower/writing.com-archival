You had an awful feeling that the human child that was briefly in your care was in terrible danger. \"No\", you said. \"I told them I wouldn't follow them.\" You continued reading, but the feeling of worry and guilt eventually became too much. \"Perhaps... I'll just check in on them\", you said to yourself as you set the book away and headed off. You walked down the stairs and headed over to the door and walked out of the ruins for the first time in what felt like an eternity. You were extremely unfamiliar with your new surroundings, but you focused on finding the child, wherever they may be. Just as you had reached a waterfall, your entire body was quickly covered in long, thick vines. You gasped as you struggled in vain against your binds, but it proved to be futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy, Boss Lady\", said a familiar voice. Your eyes widened and your brow furrowed in anger as the cruel flower from earlier popped out of the ground. You thought you had disposed of him earlier when you caught him bullying that poor child, but it seemed that he had stuck around. \"You really got me good back there, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! What have you done to the child?!\", you yelled as you attempted to free yourself with fire magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I haven't done anything to them... yet\", the sadistic plant laughed. \"Don't get me wrong, I got loads of plans for the little brat. Buuut... I just know that you're gonna get in my way. I'm right, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave that poor child alone!\", you cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lucky for you, I have to test out my new trick before I use it on them\", Flowey said. \"And you're just the guinea pig to help me out!\" With that, Flowey sent a powerful surge of energy through his vines and into you. You screamed out as the energy covered you, your body absorbing it and causing you to feel an extremely odd pain. Once he was finished, he unwrapped his vines and allowed you to fall limply to the ground. He looked over at you and grinned at his handiwork. \"Hahaha! It worked!\", Flowey laughed. \"Now to go use it on that little goody-goody. Maybe I'll come back to check on you later\", he said as he popped back into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around ten minutes, you woke up and shook your head. \"*groan* What happened?\", you said as you held your hand to your head. After looking at your hand and at your surroundings, you gasp in horror. \"Th-that awful flower...\", you stammer in horror. \"What has he done to me?\"</span></div></div>",

Your arm, and the rest of your body, were wobbling as if they were made of dough or jelly. On top of that, you noticed the most delicious smell of butterscotch-cinnamon emanating from your hand. It was reasonable to assume that this was Flowey's doing as well, as it had been several hours since you had baked your pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm made of pie filling?!\", you screamed. This was a horrifying fate, one that you wish on anyone. You were little more than a walking snack now, and it likely wouldn't take much for you to be splattered into paste or smeared across a surface, that's not even taking into account what the temperatures of Snowdin and Hotland could do to you. \"I should stay here and see if I can somehow reverse this... Perhaps the human can take care of themselves until I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped yourself mid-sentence and grimaced, disgusted by the words coming out of your own mouth. \"What am I saying? I can't allow that awful plant do anything like this to an innocent child.\" Mustering up all of your courage, you decided to do whatever it took to find the human and keep this from happening to them, regardless of the risk to your own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving lived much longer than most other monsters, you knew every short cut there was to be found, and all of them had secret pathways leading out of the ruins. They were made with the intention of monsters avoiding areas that are inhospitable for them, but they're mostly used by spiders now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that the human had to get through Snowdin first, but that was a while ago. They would likely be around the Waterfall or Hotland by now. Unless Flowey had gotten to them, that is. If he had done something similar to the human, they could be frozen solid and defenseless!<br>\r\nOr perhaps you should wait further down and see if they arrive. There was no telling where Flowey would strike, maybe allowing the human to believe they were at the end of their journey before they struck. In that case, it would be wise to get to that area before Flowey to both ensure the human's safety, and try to restore yourself. Of course, you weren't thrilled at the idea of meeting your ex-husband. You still haven't forgiven him for what he did all those years ago. But that was something you would have to mentally prepare for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have much time to waste. Something could be happening to the human right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking only of the safety of the human, you ran as quickly as you could through the passage leading to...</span></div></div>",

If I was fast she could catch up with them, though I had to move quickly. Unfortunately for me my jelly-like body wobbled vigorously every time I tried to run. The intense cold made things even worse as little by little I slowed down, though I was too focused on finding the child to really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pressed on, trudging through the forest and eventually ending up in a vast field of snow. The lights of the snowy town appeared in the distance as I kept going. It wasn't clear at first that my gelatinous body was slowly freezing in the frigid cold, my feet already frozen solid as I hurried desperately toward Snowdin. Once my legs were frozen I took notice, having to waddle as if my legs were made of stone. Next my arms froze, stuck at my sides as my pace slowed to a crawl. I hopped as quickly as I could, trying hard not to fall over. My head froze as well, leaving me unable to even look around, a terrified expression stuck on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually I froze completely, unable to so much as wiggle as I stood there. I looked more like a statue than a person now, not even able to move my eyes to see if anyone was around to help. Luckily for me there actually was someone around to help! Far off in the distance there was a purple bunny girl collecting snow, probably to make popsicles for her shop. I don't know how long I stood there helplessly, though the strong scent of cinnamon and butterscotch drew the rabbit over eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh thank goodness</i>, I thought to myself, <i>I'm going to be brought into town!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny looked me up and down, giving me a few curious pokes. After that she pulled off my clothes and blushed as she found the 'sculpture' to be completely anatomically correct. I would have been blushing intensely if she still could, though it was far too cold for a semi-liquid creature like me to do such a thing. No blush appeared even once the bunny started rubbing curiously at my vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, what kinda pervert would make this thing so lifelike?\" The bunny girl asked herself out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Because I am alive! S-Stop touching me there!!</i> I silently responded internally, though there was no way to communicate while I was stuck like that. I was relieved when the bunny shrugged and finally stopped poking my sex, though that relief was short-lived once she dug an ice pick out of her bag. The bunny was getting ready to carve me up and bake me into cinnamon rolls!</span></div></div>",

As it was being stuffed into the small sacks he brought with her, you noticed you could still feel that part inside of the bag, as if it wasn't torn off at all. You didn't have much time to think of it though, as the ice pick swung at you again. This time, taking you entire ear off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you pieced together that, in this form, simply being torn up wouldn't be enough to kill you, but that'd just mean, when the baking time came, you'd be alive to experience it!

But that swiftly changed when she picked it up and stuffed it in there, your vision of the outside world suddenly replaced with the inside view of the bag, surrounded by your frozen, broken off parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only whimper in your head as you felt the sleigh moving. Now that you were broken up, it was even <i>less</i> likely someone would come to save you, and you were about to be transformed into a very nice, baked good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have much time to wonder what it'd be like though, because, before you know it, the bag you were in was dumped out, you falling out only to find yourself...</span></div></div>",

Her warm hands mooshed your face but you couldn't find it in yourself to be angry or scared with the joyful look she was giving your small form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this she began whisking ingredients together and then pressing you flat onto a pan, the cinnamon and butter she washed over you was delightful but then you were pushed into an oven! the heat slowly enveloped you and while it wasn't burning just yet you could feel your body expanding as though it were a pastry as she had thought you were. From the oven you watched the bunny baker wiggle around the room until she came back over for you. You felt fuller than before as if all parts of your body had grown inside the oven and the icy coldness of the room wafted onto you after so long in the heat. Steam still rising you cold see what you had been made into. Several trays of cinnimon rolls were laid out on the cooling rack and you could feel all of them! you watched as the adorable rabbit girl lifted one of the gooy buns that because of it's sensitivity you realized was one of your breasts.

After a couple minutes she just put the pick away and instead opted to shove me onto her sled and start hauling me back home. Her strength was very impressive, though even with a sled she still had a hard time getting me all the way back. Still, I was very happy not to be left helpless and far away from civilization. In fact I was so relieved that I hadn't even thought of my new predicament until I saw the townsfolk staring at me: I was still totally naked! My clothes were left somewhere out in the frozen field, leaving me completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could practically feel everyone watching me, staring at my every inch of exposed fur. My vision shook around as I helplessly stared upward, every part of me still stuck as if frozen in time. Every person she walked past gawked at me, each of them having their own reaction to the unusual and erotic sight. Some reacted with joy at the sight, laughing at me and giving me a grope. Others recoiled in horror at the shopkeeper parading around with what was ostensibly a piece of pornography. One woman, a mother, was so disgusted that she immediately scurried off with her children as the kids peeked around their mother at me, energetically chatting back and forth while their mom tried to keep them from looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment I couldn't help but feel that being smashed apart and stuffed in a bag might not have been so bad if it spared me the humiliation of being carried around as a perverted art piece. The worst part was when she propped me up in front of her shop. She wasn't even going to bring me inside!? At that point I really wanted to scream, to flail around, to do <i>anything</i> to spare me the embarrassment of being a nude ice sculpture. Unfortunately for me it just wasn't meant to be. A small crowd of 6 or 7 monsters gathered around while the bunny wiped sweat from her brow and stood next to me triumphantly.</span></div></div>",

Plus I don't think some of the folks around here would appreciate an 8 foot tall statue of a naked lady.\" The bunny girl responded, though she did look a little guilty that she was going to melt down such a lifelike piece of art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't feel guilty enough not to drag me inside and place me next to the fire though. \"Hey, hold it there for a sec.\" She said, scurrying off into the back room and returning with a metal tub big enough for me to stand in. I couldn't help but feel a little offended as the group panted and grunted while trying to lift me high enough to set in the tub. I'm not <i>that</i> big! ... Ok, well, I am pretty big. Still, they eventually managed to set me down in the tub, my body already starting to drip into it. Being so close to the roaring fireplace was uncomfortable but at least I couldn't be burned in my current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can finally thaw out and go back to searching for the child!</i> I thought to myself as the monsters filed out and the shopkeeper went back into her back room. The fire was so hot that I actually started to melt, but I didn't think it was going to be a problem until my head suddenly fell off and plopped into the tub. That was somewhat concerning. It was even more concerning when more of me crumbled and splashed down into the pool quickly forming in the tub, my body falling apart before my eyes and melting in the hot liquid that was now me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say it was a bizarre feeling would be an understatement. I was breaking apart and melting right then and there, my body quickly turning into nothing but a pale white sludge with no features at all. Within minutes there was nothing solid left of me, just a pool of cinnamon-butterscotch scented liquid nestled in a hot steel tub. I should have been terrified but it was actually quite relaxing; all the tension in my body was gone, literally! I tried my hardest to reform but it was no good, I was too hot to make myself solid at all. All I could do was sit there in the tub and patiently wait for more misfortunes to befall me.</span></div></div>",

The feeling of my body bubbling and boiling but feeling no pain was extremely strange, not to mention the fact that I was now totally liquid. The shopkeeper eventually came back with a pair of oven mitts and grabbed ahold of my tub before dragging me away to the back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't see much since I was still stuck, but I caught a brief glimpse of a single glass jug. Surely she couldn't store all of me in such a tiny space?. The thought of being bottled up would have made me sick to my stomach if I still had one. She didn't go about storing me right away though. Instead she sat around a while and waited for me to cool a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body was still pretty hot, too hot for me to reform, but I'd cooled enough that she could now stick her fingers into me and test my taste. I couldn't quite see her but I could tell she was definitely tasting me because I could feel her licking me off her fingers! The feeling was actually kind of nice, though I was a little unnerved after she swallowed that little bit of me and digested it almost instantly. If she kept eating me I might just disappear forever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately I must have been delicious because she couldn't restrain herself. She scooped out another handful of me and drank me down. Then another, and another, and another. The bunny was greedily snarfing down my tasty liquefied form bit by bit! I could feel myself shrinking as more of myself was split away and got processed by her stomach. By the time she reigned in her hunger she'd gotten a round and jiggly belly that poked out from under her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then there was far less of me. So little of me in fact that all she had to do was tip over the tub and dump me into a funnel, neatly storing me in a single two-gallon jug. There was only two gallons of me left! Barely anything! The shopkeeper's big purple belly sloshed loudly as she carried my jug back out into the shop and placed me on the counter, scribbling a price tag on a piece of tape and sticking it on. Hopefully I'd be bought soon; I don't want to end up as a bunny's dinner!</span></div></div>",

I still couldn't believe that most of my body had been eaten! If somebody didn't buy me, I could join the rest of my body gurgling away in the purple bunny's stomach! I tried with all my might to move around and get someone's attention every time a monster entered the shop, but none of them were interested in the jug of white liquid with the eyes. I couldn't believe that I was hoping to be purchased, but hearing the gurgles of the plump purple bunny's belly and seeing though the glass of the jug as she licked her lips put enough fear into me to want as far away from here as possible. As each minute passed, I began to lose hope, until it was time for the shopkeeper to close up for the day, and my fate was sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was sort of hoping no one would buy you\", the shopkeeper said as she ripped the price tag off and grabbed my container. I mentally wept as I was carried over to a table along with a glass and the purple bunny sat down. I could now see that her belly didn't look as full, but still kept much of it's roundness. I could almost feel the jiggling as she took a seat and popped the cork off of my container.<br>\r\n\"Now let's finish the rest of this tasty cider\", she said to herself as she poured out some of my liquid body into the glass. It admittedly felt a little nice running down her tongue and down her throat. Perhaps it was my mind trying to keep from being afraid of what was going to happen to me. I felt a familiar tingling sensation as the part of my body was dissolved inside her stomach, which grew as she downed the glass. Once she had finished, she licked her lips.<br>\r\n\"Mmmm-mmm. Delicious! Think I'll have another-\" The shopkeeper tilted my jug, going to pour another glass, but stopped herself. \"Eh, to hell with it.\" The purple bunny pushed the glass aside and put her lips to the jug, quickly and greedily chugging my liquid form! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best to let out a scream, but that did no good as i poured down the bunny girl's throat. A loud *GLUG* *GLUG* *GLUG* could be heard as she slurped up the delicious \"cider\". As I drained into the shopkeeper's stomach, I mentally cursed the awful flower for my plight. I should have toasted that despicable weed when it first threatened the child. Then maybe this wouldn't be happening. Soon, the jug had been emptied and I had completely drained into my new fleshy enclosure.<br>\r\nShe let out a rather loud belch and patted her belly, causing me to slosh around inside. \"Excuse me\", she said as she licked her lips. \"I kind of regret not keeping some of that cider for later\", the shopkeeper said, \"But that was just too sweet to just leave lying around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bunny woman's gut, I mentally cry out as the digestive juices begin to break down my body. \"This can't be the end\", I thought. \"I won't allow myself to perish! Not like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, I was not going to die on this day... although there are things more humiliating than death inside a stomach. </span></div></div>",

At least Toriel didn't feel any sort of pain, she was just kind of, absorbed straight into the bunny woman's gut, making the already notable weight gain stick out even more. Toriel felt more solid in this form, even if she was trapped on the purple bunny's abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to move around, all she accomplished was to make the remaining chunks of her that were digested earlier to accumulate around her. There wasn't much else to do however... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite having drunk all 2 gallons of the \"cider\", the bunny didn't feel full at all \"Still not full? I thought it would be enough. Might as well have some dinner and be done with it for the night.\" The bunny went to the back, getting some of the raw dough for tomorrow and began baking it. About an hour later, it was ready, and despite being just fat, Toriel almost swore she could smell the flaky butter that covered the buns. Giving it about 5 minutes to cool, the bunny final picked one up and began to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the first bite of bread entered the bunny's stomach, Toriel felt a tug, pulling her attention towards the chewed bread. It was slowly digesting, unlike her essence, which turned into fat almost immediately. This piled up over time in a pool of digestive acid, slowly but surely filling up the stomach. At the halfway point, it occurred to Toriel that perhaps she should attempt something. And that something she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mushy stewing pile almost immediately broke down into fat, joining her in the bunny's belly. She felt, bigger somehow. Perhaps the digested hot buns were now part of her body. Or maybe just because she was actually able to do something. Nevertheless, her actions were noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the cider make me hungrier than usual? Usually I'm beyond stuffed at this point\" The bunny pats her gut, feeling all of Toriel, yet not realizing a thing. \"I was planning to save these for later, but oh well. I am still hungry after all\" She grabbed the remaining hot buns, stuffing them into her mouth without a care for how many she swallowed. Keeping up with her pace was Toriel, immediately forcing the buns to digest into fat. It was a close race, but eventually, the bunny ate the entire tray, about 60 in total. And yet, she still felt hungry. Looking at her to waistline only aggravated her more, seeing as her previously manageable bump of a belly had completely transformed into a massive accumulation of useless fatty fur, which unbeknownst to her was actually Toriel \"Why did this happen!\" Frustrated, she gave up on having dinner and went to bed, leaving the sentient accumulation of fat previously known as Toriel to contemplate her current situation. </span></div></div>",

Thankfully, she managed to escape through her behind without any accidental digestion occurring, slowly escaping the bunny's anus as a lardy mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe piled up at the foot of the bed, leaving any partially digested parts on the bed as well as anything that wasn't a part of her. Once all of her mass was accumulated, and it was a rather large amount, she began shifting towards the door, hoping to reach the bathroom and possibly reassemble herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took what felt like hours, although it was really just a half hour, but she remade herself, albeit with some... Additions to her figure. From instantly digesting the hot buns the bunny made, she had gained more mass. It was useful to replace any missing pieces from her, but alas, it was an overly excessive amount. Her previously apple shaped figure had swollen to an orange, and a huge one at that. Her belly was sagging onto her thunder thighs, not that she minded, seeing as it hid her vagina from public view, but how could she find her child like this? Her condition was at least better than being pie filling, as that was notably easier to melt and freeze. And in this form, she could actually afford to lose a chunk of herself, unlike her last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, she licked the inside of her mouth. She still had the lingering aftertaste of cinnamon and butterscotch, but it was mostly replaced with sweet fat, as if she were made of sugared butter, except much more solid. Still, she couldn't expect her body to hold up well in near a heat source. Escaping the house was easy, after she greased open the door. Now, where should she go next... </span></div></div>",

You were sure that malicious flower was after them again! Little did you know how far from the truth that was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued running, eyes straight ahead. However, you heard a noise overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook out below, idiot!\u201d that familiar, weed-y voice said. However, faster than you could respond to it, you felt two smooth, ball-like things slip around the side of your head. And, just like that, you were thrust into darkness, unable to see anything, and the feeling of your whole head being squished up. You had no idea what just happened, and began patting around your head, trying to make sure you weren\u2019t just imagining the squeezing around your head\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny onlooker, meanwhile, would\u2019ve seen the pear-shaped flower punk falling butt first upon you, right before his buttcheeks slipped right around your head, partially cramming your head up his rump. Unfortunately for the flower, he seemed a might small for you, so instead of squashing all of you (because he landed juuuuust right around your head), or sucking you up into his rear chamber, your body scrunched downwards a little, before expanding upwards like an accordion. Flowey, meanwhile seemed a bit pained, not expecting the feeling of your relatively large head partway up his rump. Meanwhile, you curiously patted around your head, only feeling his plant tush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot\u2026 exactly what I was going for\u2026\u201d Flowey admitted. However, he wouldn\u2019t let this be the end of him. He planted his leaf-like feet on your shoulders, and jumped forwards, intent on popping off of your shoulders. However, you were crammed up just far enough for him to instead yank your stretchy body downwards. Your neck was stretched thin as your head remained between his cheeks. Flowey looked back, realizing you were kind of stuck. As painful as he initially felt, he couldn\u2019t help but let out a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then squatted, making sure to angle his backside such that it was pointed towards the rest of your body. He giggled to himself at the downright juvenile attack he was about to pull on you. Then, with a grunt, you felt the walls around your head clench tighter, squeezing your squishy head even more so. But that wouldn\u2019t be for long, for, with a thunderous noise, your whole head was launched outwards, alongside a cloud of pollen, as your elastic neck snapped your head towards the rest of your body as if a rubber band was stretched and then released. The force of the gastrointestinal push left you dizzy as your head was launched backwards a little, until it was snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a malicious laughter brought you back to your senses. You were finally able to look down and see who was likely the cause for your confusion squeeze. It had the head of that flower creep from before, but it also bore a set of arms, legs, and a pear-shaped body, along with a prominent posterior for one of his size. Your brow furrowed with anger as the laughing creep stood before you, who\u2019d began tauntingly wagging his butt in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBet ya think you\u2019re real special cause you survived a trip up there, don\u2019t ya?\u201d he asked. You were confused at first, but as Flowey put a little more oomph into his taunting butt-shake, you began to put 2 and 2 together. You blushed, both embarrassed and horrified at what that monster was implying. \u201cWell, let\u2019s say I don\u2019t let stuff like size stop me! Yeah, all I have to do is get a better angle on you, sit on you a couple times until you\u2019re nice and flat, then, when you\u2019re too small to fight back, then I\u2019ll play with you, until I finish you off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt anger rise from within your chest, wanting so badly to stop this punk right here, right now before he could mess up that human! But, Flowey seemed intent on keeping that butt waving in front of you, wanting to make sure you remember just where you\u2019d end up by the end of this.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nothing seemed to change about you physically. You had all of your limbs, you appeared to be just as big as before, you couldn't see any changes. Your thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a growl from your stomach. At that moment, you realized you were hungry. You doubted this hunger was the flower's doing. Suddenly, you heard something come in from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, a Froggit had found its way into your home, and was traveling through it. Eventually, it found its way downstairs, and out the back, and stumbled onto you, struggling to get your bearings. It croaked to try and get your attention. You turned around, and were thankful to hear no difference to your movement. You didn't see anything, until you looked downwards. You were typically much taller than the residents of the ruins, but you don't remember seeing this resident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of you was, of all things, a snail! This snail was larger than normal, but a snail was a snail. That was what your stomach said as it growled at you again while you looked down at the snail. You planted a hand on your stomach, noting how empty it felt. You turned your attention towards the snail, and decided you needed to tend to this hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came at just the right time,\" you said as you reached down towards the snail. The Froggit, who looked a lot more snail-like to you, seemed confused at your statement. It tilted its head as your hand reached down to it. Your fingers wrapped around its midsection, and gently lifted it up level to your head. \"Down the hatch!\" you cooed. You opened your mouth wide and closed your eyes to enjoy the meal. Then, the Froggit began to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the snail flail about in your grip, though its attempts at escape were halted by your grip. You heard it cry and squeal with fear as you brought it close. You plopped it into your maw, you tongue already working to taste the snail. The Froggit tried to crawl out of your mouth, but your jaws were shut too tight for it to move anywhere. It was crying as you tasted it. After enough tasting, you lifted your head, and swallowed. The snail traveled down your throat, creating a noticeable bulge that disappeared behind your chest and into your stomach. You patted your gut and sighed with content. The Froggit, meanwhile, frantically beat against the inside of your stomach, crying for freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum!\" you remarked before licking your lips. As you sucked the taste off of each of your finger tips, any fear about what Flowey did to you disappeared. Flowey intended to make you hallucinate to see danger as safe, and vice versa, but he didn't account for the magic present in your body. The resulting magic altered Flowey's spell, and now you see various monsters as snails, not that you realized that yet. After you finished tasting the remnants of that snail, you decided you needed to continue to find that human. Flowey said he was after them, and you wouldn't dare let that creep displace a single hair on their head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, all you have to do is find out where that human was.</span></div></div>",

You are a young child of indeterminate gender who has wandered up into Mt. Ebott and fallen into the chasm inside for reason known only to yourself. Your determination has allowed you to have a certain amount of control over the flow of time. You've SAVED and gone through the underground more times than you can count. However, you often felt the influence of a malevolent force controlling your actions every now and then, making you do things you can't bear to think about. This time will be different, you think to yourself. Nothing is going to control you now. This time, you will save the underworld for good. At least, that's what you hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised to find that Flowey, a being that had quickly become the bane of your existence, was nowhere to be found from where you first fell down again. By now, you had gotten a good way into your journey, and it was odd that he hadn't shown up yet. You didn't even catch a sight of him sneaking behind you as he often did. This wasn't normal, but you had figured that, since he also had knowledge of RESETS and SAVES, that it might be because he knows you won't fall for his tricks. You knew that you'd inevitably run into him after getting to the barrier, so you weren't too worried. Nothing he did surprised you anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving just saved Undyne from heat death, you had decided to head back and try to befriend her. As you walked through the seaweed, a thick vine suddenly wrapped itself around your entire body, holding you firmly in place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned as you heard that familiar high-pitched voice. You didn't think he would turn up this soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heya buddy\", Flowey greeted. \"Looks like you're a little stuck there\", he said, feigning concern as you struggled against your binds. \"Betcha didn't expect to see me here, huh?\" He continued. \"Now, we've been doing this for a while now, and by now you probably think you've got everything figured out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to scream out, hoping maybe your arm-less monster friend was still nearby, but no sound came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know what? I'm pretty sick of going through the motions. Picking on you when you fall down, killing Asgore, becoming a god and all that\", Flowey continued. \"So, I decided to change things up a little\", he said, tightening his grip on you. \"Instead of messing with you at the entrance and watching your every move, I've been using my time to work on something special for ya.\" With that, he stuck his tongue out and winked as a surge of energy flowed through the vine and into your body, giving you an incredibly painful experience. More vines wrapped around you, seeming to drain your energy and replacing it with... something else. Your mind nearly went blank when your binds were finally unwrapped. Once they returned to the ground, you fell limp to the ground as the world was spinning around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlowey laughed as you struggled to return to your feet. \"You really are an idiot!\", he laughed maniacally as two leaves sprouted from the sides of him. \"I bet you don't even know what I just did, but I'll give you a moment to guess\", Flowey said before pausing. \"Nope? Nothin'? Well I'll just tell you. I just drained away some of your DETERMINATION. Not all of it, but just enough to give me control of the timeline again\", he said, laughing. \"And a little extra to give me this...\" With that, the two leaves on the sides of Flowey pushed down on the ground and he popped out of the ground, revealing that he had gained a pear-shaped body, as well as a set of arms and legs, along with a rather... generously sized behind. (though he was still about half your size)<br>\r\n[pic for reference: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://e621.net/post/show/1252260\" target=\"_blank\">https://e621.net/post/show/1252260</a> ]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty jealous, huh?\", he said, walking up to you with a confident stride. \"But don't worry, I gave something to you in return. In addition to draining your DETERMINATION, I went ahead and changed your body's makeup for ya. That ought to make things way more fun. In fact, I think I'm gonna have some fun with you right now...\" Flowey licked his lips as he walked closer to you, clearly having ill intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to wait to see what the sadistic flower had in mind. Not even thinking about what happened to your body, you got up and ran as fast as you could, trying to get as far away from your attacker as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, come on, buddy. You're not being a very good friend, ya know\", he said as he slowly walked to your direction. He wasn't in a hurry to catch you. He had control over the timeline again, after all. You were basically already his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually grew tired of running and found a group of echo flowers to hide in. Now having a chance to catch your breath, you examined your self to see what he meant about altering your body's makeup. To your horror, you found that...</span></div></div>",

Flowey had apparently been standing on the ledge above you, as you're forced to watch the rapidly descent of the flower's bulbous green behind. You manage to scuttle out of the way as he slams his plump rear on the ground, squashing an echo flower in the process. \"Haha, just think, that could be you\", Flowey laughs as he stands up and gives his rear another slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble over your own feet a few times as you run away, attempting to seek shelter from Flowey. As you attempt to get away, you run into a wall as you round the corner. You thought you would have splattered, but you managed to squeeze into a crack in the wall. How fortunate! You decide that this is the best place to hide until the coast is clear and wriggle deeper into the crevice. It's quiet for a while, but you soon hear the light footsteps of your enemy approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, where is that squishie?\", you hear Flowey ask himself. \"There's no way they could've gotten far. Maybe a monster splattered 'em? Shoot. Really would've liked to have a seat cushion or snack.\"<br>\r\nSoon, though, he hears your whimpers close by, causing a smirk to form on his face. He's found his toy. He knows you're nearby, but Flowey doesn't know exactly where. Somehow, he's going to have to lure you out. \"Hmm... let's see what else this body can do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you cower in your cramped shelter, you hear an odd distortion close by. Soon after the distortion stops, you hear much heavier footsteps, though whatever is making them doesn't sound to be too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm back!\", you hear a soft voice cry out. \"I'm me again! H-how is this possible? Mom? Dad? Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice doesn't sound familiar to you, though you swear you've heard that same softness in Toriel's voice. Whatever it is, it clearly isn't Flowey. You decide to squeeze out of your shelter and take a look. It takes you a while to return to your three dimensional shape, but once you do, you see a figure looking up at you.</span></div></div>",

Your screams are muffled in his massive ass, but he knows you're screaming. \"Mm~ it's your own fault for being so comfy,\" he says as he grinds harder into you. He gives a couple you a couple more butt bounces before he gets back up. \"Now, let's see what my freshly pounded Frisk pancake tastes like,\" he says, rubbing his leafy hands together in anticipation. He turns around to look at his handiwork, only to see his plaything vanished. \"What the-? Where-?\" he's cut off by a wriggling and screaming into his behind. He looks over at his butt, seeing you still stuck to it. He keels over, laughing at your predicament. \"Y'know, I would've finished you off in my stomach, but you look too pathetic to kill.\" He plops his butt back down on the ground, putting in one more series of grinding. \"But you do make for a good cushion. You don't mind if I keep you back there, do you?\" You can practically taste the mockery in his voice. You try to scream out as loud as you can, but your pleas disappear into his rump. \"I'm not hearing a no.\" You can only let out a defeated sob as Flowey walks off to who knows where, for you to live out your role as a flower's chair.

The impact of the fall into the ground had knocked you silly for a few moments an when you finally came to your senses, you were greeted with the sight of Flowey's massive butt about to descend upon you. The two plump orbs that were his ass cheeks looked like a pair of squishy green meteors to you and you could do nothing to stop the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sadistic flower's wide behind fell onto you with a *SQUELCH* as his right butt cheek squashed your tiny chewed up body flat! Flowey laughed as he lifted his rear up off of you, only to slam it back down over and over again. Each time he landed, it felt like you were being slapped in the face by a whale. After around half a minute, Flowey stood up. \"I think that's enough. Don't wanna turn my pancake into paste\", he laughed as he looked back behind him. He had expected to see a crater with his toy's face at the center, but found you were stuck onto his butt cheek like a sticker. \"Clingy little guy, aren't ya?\", he laughed as he slapped his butt and causing you to wobble along with his jiggly green flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than peel you off, Flowey walked off for a short while with you still stuck, jiggling and moving perfectly along with his flesh with each step before coming to a stop. \"Good thing that gullible skeleton left out this plate and cutlery out. Now I can eat my little pancake properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sobbed into the squishy green butt cheek before Flowey peeled you off and slapped you onto the plate.

Your twin giggled even harder at your reaction and began licking at your face. \"Surprised, partner.\" Your twin squished you harder against their body and smiled even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to pull away but with your weak body it was simply too impossible. \"Who are you and stop licking my face?! \"  You cried disgusted some stranger was licking your face even if they look almost exactly like you. \"Wow you really did forget about me this time. Mmm, cinnamon.  I'll allow you to remember me now. Now think carefully where you saw this cute face other than your own.\" They stretched your face apart hard and slapped it back together, throwing you back onto the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared up at them and tried to think carefully about how you would have a twin. You close your eyes and tried to think of the numerous resets and endings you earn which caused you to meet your twin. You could remember all now grabbing the knife in mom's kitchen that voice of identical stranger coaching you on to kill with no remorse until Sans. No, no, no this is bad, this is horrible it's it's..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yep, it's me Chara. Your best, true, and only friend.\" They climbed uptop your chest surprisingly not squishing you weak body flat.\"Now I know what you're wondering. What are they doing here? They can't get a physical body like Asriel. Welp that's your fault Frisk and do you know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked away tears as you felt pain beginning to surge throughout your body. Your body was beginning to squish down but the pain you hadn't felt before was coming down on you realistically. Chara sighed and the pain in your body disappeared being replaced by the usual feeling of being squished down. \"You used my own move against me. Remember the sit and wait deal until the victim has to agree to your terms. It's amazing with what could be amounted to thousands of years my happy endings being ruined by you pulling my own move against me.\" Suddenly they stood up and slam their ass down hard on you. They stood up and did it again and again until they could hardly breath resting on top your squished body.\"You gave the perfect idea to take the souls of the humans and a couple of monsters our selves for our own fun. Why even get the possibility to get our brother back and separate that stupid flower from him. Oh just imagine the fun we could have had teaching little Asriel to enjoy killing and stop being such a baby but no you had to have a heart huh. When you took the souls I could have my own body but you refused to make me one and share the souls until I promised I wouldn't kill without your permission. Naturally I agreed, for a chance to have fun with ultimate power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop.\" You whimpered under as their butt raised off you. Chara looked down at your squished body and laughed at the ass print imprinted on your body. They snatched you into their hands and began rolling you into a ball showing off their 'nightmare' face you remember they used to remind you of your deals together. With little fanfare you was popped into their mouth and they continue their speech ignoring your begging and pleading simply chewing you like bubble gum. \"But I notice something during one of the resets was that whenever you wanted to hurt someone or began to wonder back to killing, or even a slight lost of determination that my promise couldn't be held down on me. With that I learned how to torment people while not killing or hurting them with our powers, and how to make someone else do the job I want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Chara's slimy tongue poke a small hole into your body and felt yourslef being blown into a bubble and until you was out their mouth and being sucked back in again. You could only wiggle slightly from the uncomfortable feeling Chara saliva was giving you. You were being wiggled back and forth on his tongue until you were finally spat out onto the ground. \"You see I need you to lose your determination completely ir else give me permission to kill for eternity. Trust me I've changed over the runs but I simply enjoy tormenting and killing others too much. So how about giving me permission with actually 'meaning' it buddy. Or should I restart your eternal torment again.\" Suddenly a flash of images run through your head of being tormented by everyone in the Underground and up above  both intentionally and unintentionally till you either died through the various circustances Chara put you through other than the current one you face now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was still reforming but it was healed enough for your lips to reappear despite rest of your body uncurling from it's ball shape. \"No I won't do it! You might as keep at it, I'll get out of this eventually!\" If what they were saying is true then you're literally the only thing that protecting the world from destruction. You was already dumb enough to give this sociopath the power to change the world with an drop of an hat if they wanted. You giving them back their abiltiy to kill would have made your actions nonsense, if you had to suffer then fine this is your redemption for ruining so many happy endings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChara looked down at you and chuckled in amusement before tossing you into their mouth and walking off. \"Like I said before and say again. Since when were you in charge.\" Their eyes turned into huge black holes and their insane laughter filled the air. \"So many possibilities on how to torment you this time. Should I take over your place and shake things up a little and annoy that fat ass flower, or should I stay here and torment you until mom comes and finds me or til I get bored..\" Decisions, Decisions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe she would know something about how to fix your... situation. You quickly ran from your hiding place and headed toward Hotland, running as fast as you can from your flowery antagonist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that kid's pretty quick\", Flowey said to himself as he smirked. \"But I'm quicker.\" With that, he dug his root-like feet into the ground and slipped back into the ground... or, he would have. Right as he got his new legs back into the earth, his big bubble butt got stuck, preventing him from getting any further. \"I, uh, guess I didn't think this through very well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Flowey behind, you ran as fast as your little legs could carry you through the lighted tunnel to Hotland, the area of the underground where Alphys resided. One thing that you could count on, was that Undyne wouldn't catch you. The fish girl hated Hotland, and ventured in that section only when necessary. Almost as soon as you set foot in the area, you remembered why. The heat was intense, as it's name suggested. The entire place glowed from the fiery magma below. One wrong step, and you'd be toast. Not that you were dumb enough to actually step into a lava pit. As you ran across the bridge, you quickly discovered one of the effects of your new condition. You first thought you were perspiring from the heat of the area, but you would soon notice that the \"sweat\" you were wiping off your face was the same tan color as your skin. You weren't sweating. You were melting! Your new body makeup was causing you to melt from the intense heat of Hotland!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to turn into a puddle, you quickly ran across the bridge to Alphys lab, passing by the water cooler on the way over. You briefly contemplated cooling off over there, but you preferred a permanent solution to your problem. You ran over to the door of the laboratory and opened the door, dripping a bit of your newly malleable body on the ground. You wondered if losing bits of your body had any negative side effects. Tired from your journey, you hobbled over to a chair in front of the monitor, (which, for some reason, was no longer fixated on your position) and flopped down. As you sat in the air condition laboratory, your body became much less soft. Your body was no longer running over itself and dripping on the floor, now able to keep itself together. Suddenly, you heard the the sound of a door opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh geez. Those guys are getting pretty tough to control\", you heard a familiar voice say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Alphys, having apparently gotten finished dealing with something you had yet to discover. You wanted to run up to her and ask her to help you out, but your body didn't seem to be cooperating. It seemed that, while your body was cooling off, you had become stuck to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, I'm beat. I think I'll check up on the human.\" With that, she spun the chair around and flipped up her lab coat. You blushed heavily as you were given a full view of Alphys' plump scaly booty! It seemed that she hadn't noticed you sitting down there, and she was about to join you if you didn't do something soon. You don't have much time before the chubby yellow butt cheeks decsend and squash you into oblivion, so you have to act quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

This chair feels a lot more comfortable than the last time I sat in it!\" Alphys exclaimed as she grounded her rear to get more acquainted with her new cushion, pressing down on your malleable form and causing you to become even flatter on the chairs surface.

The difference, Catty clearly didn't know what she was doing. Whereas Bratty had a clear beginning and end and everything in between, Catty was constantly second guessing herself, squeezing one part of you out of one loop of you and into another loop, undoing loops only to redo them, she kept trying to do anything she could to match, maybe even outdo, Bratty's putty human creation. \"Tada,\" Eventually she reveals you, reduced to knots upon knots of stretched out flesh. Your face was pressed against your own backside, you felt your legs touching your back opposite your belly button while your arms were knotted under the backside of your knees. \"A... knotty human,\" Catty says, half smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBratty just takes you out of Catty's hands, unknotting you for what felt like an hour, until you were back to your original form. This lasted for all of two seconds until every part of you, except for an arm is wrapped up in a glamburger shape. She proceeds to wrap your arm around your body several times. She turns, brandishing you. \"Yoyo human!\" She wraps your hand around her index finger before flicking you downward, only for you to splat against the ground, leaving an uncomfortable few seconds of awkward air. Eventually, Bratty starts  to chuckle. Her chuckling leads to a roar of laughter as she starts to keels over, while you're still reforming. Catty starts matching her laughing magnitude only after she starts laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to hand you over, Bratty offers you up to Catty, who barely manages to grab you as she laughs. \"N-*snrk*-no-*snrk* I-I-I-it's a...\" Catty barely squeaks out her sentence between fits of laughter, only managing to stop while she kneads your body.</span></div></div>",

Catty swiftly yanked you up her legs and you realized that Bratty was right: you weren't big enough to fit. You felt it before you even got up to her knees. You wanted to cry out in discomfort as you were pulled up her thick jiggly thighs and stretched out, but your mouth was squished shut. The purple columns squish as your malleable form compresses their soft flesh. If you hadn't been turned into her panties, you could find yourself enjoying this. Soon you were pulled up to her sizable purple booty and your stretchy-ness seemed to have reached it's limit.<br>\r\n\"Nnnngh! Come on, human! I know you can fit!\", Catty whined as she struggled to pulled you over the violet mounds of flesh.<br>\r\nYou whimpered as your body felt like it was already stretched to your limit, but Catty sucked in her gut and managed to pull you up.<br>\r\n\"*phew* I did it!\", Catty said, giggling as she patted her rump.

Lemme try them on, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Bratty, I just got them to fit\", Catty whined. \"It'll take me forever to put them back on!\" The purple cat girl put her hand on her hips as she thought. \"Well, it's only fair to share the panty human, but they feel really comfy and it'll take a while to put them back on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only sit there stretched over her rump as the two girls discussed your fate.</span></div></div>",

Thank you! Thank you! Catty! Don't, worry we can trade the panties .. every other week!\" the girl exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only despair as the cat and gator shared a bout of uproarious laughter, Catty may have been hefty, but her soft rear and warm fur made it at least semi-tolerable. Bratty however was an alligator, and while her relatively leaner frame (you were still highly concerned your current size as underwear compared to the girl's rather generous curves) meant the journey onto her bottom was going to be far shorter than onto Catty's, you still were seriously worried that her scales was going to make it just as uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou were torn from your fearful musings, as Catty placed her hands on your sides and attempted to remove you from her violet rump, the cat had as much trouble taking you off as she had putting on and the experience was just as strange and off-putting as  when the purple cat first tried you on. \"just a little...more and.. Ahah!\" The teenaged monster successfully pulled you down past her knees, she proceeded to change back into her old panties and her overalls before bringing you up to her face. Catty was a bit sad she wasn't going to get the chance to wear something so comfy, but was fine knowing she would eventually be able to reunite you with her violet backside. \"don't worry human, ~you'll be back where you belong soon enough~\" the cat whispered as she patted her purple rump with a look of cheeky satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cattyyyyy!\" Bratty whined. \"alright! alright! here you go, some super cute, super comfy human panties\"  the feline said with a smile as she dropped you into the gator's anxiously waiting claws, \"yes! i'm going to look sooo cute!\" the lizard screamed with an enormous smile ,you were sure that if you didn't know the reason she was so happy, you would actually find the alligator genuinely cute. The reptilian monster momentarily  looked away from her new, human underwear to her best friend staring intently. \"Umm..Catty?\" the girl began to blush,\"do you mind going behind that garbage pile over there?\". Catty was mildly annoyed by this request, considering she had changed twice in front of her friend with no issue, but understood Bratty could somewhat shy. \"fine, whatever\" the cat  spoke as she rolled her eyes, before her smirk returned \"~just don't tear a hole in them with your plump rump before i get them baaack~\" the gator's blush intensified \"Catty!\" she squealed to her retreating friend's back, before being left all alone with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alligator shook off her embarrassment and focused on her new underwear with a look that made you very nervous, \"finally!\" The gator spoke with a grin. Bratty gently placed you down on a small rock before standing up, turning around and beginning to shimmy out of her pink short shorts, humming a tune from one of Mettaton's shows. You had no choice but to stare as the alligator slowly prepared to put you on  , Bratty was far skin than her feline friend but ,much to your dismay, possessed  generous curves, and while her rear was far smaller than Catty's, at your tiny size, it made little difference. Your dread only grew as the gator gal finally removed her shorty-shorts, now naked from the waist down,   Bratty pulled her previous panties from the shorts, predictably they were covered in images of Mettaton  singing  his songs , the alligator flung them into a junk pile \"won't be needing those anymore!\" the gator beamed before grasping you with her claw . you were terrified   as the gator swung you to her feet and and began happily pulling you up her long scaly legs. You almost wished you were back on Catty's violet booty as you were constantly nipped and scratched by Bratty's course scales and stretched out against her  slender legs. You noticed a momentary  halt as Bratty struggled to stretch you out enough to move past her thighs, \"rghhhh! come on!  I know you can fit!\" You wished you could  yell from the shear discomfort as you were slowly pulled bit by bit up the reptile's taut, rubenesque thighs. Finally you were millimeters away from you intended destination, \"Thanks a bunch Human!\" Bratty smiled over her shoulder. And with one last tug, the gator finished her task and you were pulled  onto her scaly green bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBratty wasted no time checking her rear in the river's reflection . You were not as stretched out as you were on Catty's ass, but your squishy form remained taught on the alligator's plump rump, Bratty was delighted with her new human undies, not only did they made her butt look cuter than it ever had before, but they're were the comfiest thing she had ever worn! \"Oh My God! I think i just found my most favourite clothing ever!\" The girl squealed to herself. You, on the other hand, were far from enjoying yourself. The discomfort caused by the gator's scales increased tenfold now that you were on her rump, you could feel every breath, every slight shift, every stretch of muscles as they caused her scales to dig into your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, well ,well you do look pretty good..\" Catty had stepped out from behind her junk pile to admire her reptilian friend's newly human-clad butt,she had to admit; Bratty looked <i>fine</i>. \"Cattyyy!\" The alligator cried out as she covered you with her tail. \"i told you not to look!\" The feline smirked \"well! i waited until you were covered didn't I !?\" you wanted to groan as you listened to your captors burst out laughing, and sighed with defeat as you saw  Bratty's arms swing her pink short-shorts to her feet and pull them rapidly towards you, shrouding your vision in darkness and  separating  you off from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled to make out Bratty and Catty's words from behind the former's short-shorts, they're words were muffled and you had trouble focusing on them as Bratty's walking further increased your discomfort, but you eventually made out that the pair were planning to grab a glamburger (you were <i>not</i> looking forward to being sat  on). You thought about your current situation; yes an alligator was using you as an (uncomfortably tight) pair of panties but hey, at least you were safe from Flowey...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mentally sighed as you weighed your options, Bratty's skinniness compared to Catty meant could potentially retain some free movement, you could try and make yourself as  uncomfortable as you could to convine Bratty to abandon you...or risk angring the monster using you as underwear. You did not want to find out what she would do to you if you made her angry. Your only other option was just to stay quiet for the two weeks Bratty had you, and see if you couldn't escape in any interval where she took you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of deliberation, you came to a decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She only managed to stop when Bratty placed both of her hands on Catty's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, so like this means 1 of 2 things. 1...You might be getting bigger...\" Bratty started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's true, then like, that means more room for us when we get down on the dance floor...\"Catty said. They both stared at each other in complete silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, totally!\" They both said in unison, followed by their laughter. With your body squished even more firmly against her cheeks, her booty jiggling was even more nauseating. You've gotten to the point where you thing you may be better off with Flowey...but then again, Flowey has a little...\"thing\" for you, and you have a small fear as to what he may actually do to you. Well...in comparison to Catty here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, like, seriously...this could mean that, or...like...your butt is tired from all of the walking, and stuff. So, like, maybe you should sit down, and stuff?\" Bratty suggested, pointing directly to the ground on their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like, that could be it too!\" Catty said. You mentally gulped as you heard that...you knew you weren't going to have such a pleasant time. \"Wait, are you sure your going to be fine by, like, yourself in there?\" Catty was mentioning the MTT-Burger Brand Emporium, where their friend, the one known as Burgerpants works at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry girl! I got this! You just, like, sit here, and I'll be back and stuff, alright?\" Bratty said, as she started to walk to the entrance doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll, like, be here and stuff!\" Catty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bratty disappeared behind the doors of the emporium, Bratty playfully wiggled her booty, before sitting straight down on the ground. The way she sat down wasn't easy...she sat down with quite a large thump when she landed on her thick booty...and wouldn't you know it, it hurt you a bit upon landing on the ground. That part didn't matter...but what really mattered was the fact that Catty was bearing her full weight down onto you, and she didn't even notice you at all! She even grinded her rear against the ground to get more comfortable. You felt yourself becoming more squished with each passing second, and you couldn't even more or even attempt to break yourself free from her enormous ass, because you were trapped directly between the ground and her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I think, like, Bratty was right!\" Bratty said, shifting herself onto the ground, which caused you to become even more trapped. All of this movement and shifting and being squished was causing you to lose hope in escaping, and forever having to suffer being a jiggly mark and a jiggly girl's behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Catty...\" You heard a familiar voice...you recall that this voice belong to Burgerpants himself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you guys, I could get in a lot of trouble if I keep bringing you food like this...especially considering that you guys don't pay me.\" Burgerpants said...his tone was hinting that he was not happy with what he was doing...but yet, couldn't even help himself. Catty got up and was hopping like crazy, causing her butt to jiggle, along with you. With your newly pressed form against her curves, words cannot describe how hard it was to not throw up at that point in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's, like, not true, we always pay you with our own secret treasure stuff...and stuff!\" Bratty said. She sounds more happy about the burger hiding in his pants, than she is about paying Burgerpants with \"secret treasure stuff\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like, in fact...\" Catty pulled something out of her pocket, and tossed it to Burgerpants. Bugrerpants just looked at it with a strange sense of curiosity...mainly because he didn't know what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Burgerpants asked. Catty and Bratty just shrugged in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know, but it's probably pretty rare!\" They said in unison. With a heavy shy, Burgerpants took out some of the burgers from his pants, and shared it with  Bratty and Catty. Catty seemed to have gotten the most out of everyone, because...well...she was a big girl...emphasis on big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thank you very much, Burgerpants!\" Catty and Bratty said with glee, as they both petted Burgerpant's head. Burgerpants just sighed in response, as they all started munching down on Glamburgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought just glimmered in your head. Last time you tried to free yourself, Catty made a bit of a commotion about it, so maybe if you just attempted to pry yourself off now, considering there are more people now... someone may take a look at Catty's large rump and see you! Considering the fact that you're so far squished into Catty's ass that you can physically feel her underwear... Yes! This has to work...the thought of this working was starting to give you very high hopes, to the point where you frantically tried to escape Catty's ass...which you failed in doing, but didn't exactly ruin your plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatty's eyes were twitching at what she was feeling, and yet again she was feeling discomfort, to the point where she dropped her uneaten glamburgers, and started to frantically scratch at her plump booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, not cool man, not cool!\" Catty, out of discomfort, started to shake her booty in hopes that it would get that strange feeling off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? Are the Glamburgers rotten or something?!\" Burgerpants said, as he looked ready to spit out what he just ate. Catty tried to turn around and look at her booty, but she couldn't see you because of how large she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If feels like something's moving in my underwear, or something! Like somebody do something!\" Catty called out, hoping in place to show her discomfort. Bratty and Bugerpants just looked at each other with a bit of nervousness...and then decided to...</span></div></div>",

You were certain he was posing for Shyren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh... hey...\" you heard Shyren say from above. You were sure you could feel her shake with nervousness. She scooted away from the sea-horse, but Aaron approached her again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a lady like you doing way out here on your own?\" he said.

He hit with such force, you felt your body compress between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, please, I-I'd just look weird! Please, just leave me!\" You felt Shyren shaking. There was a notable pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, call me wen you change your mind,\" Aaron said. He began to walk away, and you noticed something frightening. Your body began to stretch. When Aaron bumped against Shyren, you got stuck to him as well. You were stretched like a wad of gum between the two sea people. After stretching a little bit, Shyren began to be pulled back towards Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-?\" she said. She began to move the other direction, this time pulling Aaron the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Aaron said. He moved the other way, pulling Shyren with. Shyren began moving, and the two pulled against the gooey force tethering them together. They each grunted and strained as they pulled against each other.

Soon, you felt your hands feel sticky, then stuck together, then slowly disappearing into your arm. You also noticed the same happening with your feet. Then, as your arms grew into them selves, you also felt as your eyes started bulging out and moving toward the top of you head before they became full fledged stalks. You noticed how scaly your body was now and how much your stomach seemed to be coated with the slime that bonded your arms and legs together. Soon, they all grew into you, until you fell right over on your stomach, you're arms and legs now completely gone. Then, to finish off the transformation, you felt as a large shell suddenly grew right on your back. It was rather heavy too, given your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you saw the door open. \"My child\" Toriel called out, looking for you, only to notice you when she looked down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello little snail.\", she said happily, picking you up. You were a little happy to see Toriel, despite your state, until she followed her greeting with, \"You look so cute. You're going to go great in my pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost passed out when you heard that. You then remember what Toriel said when you entered her home, about holding back on snail pie. Well, now you were going to be that pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel as she closes the door and made her way upstairs, before setting you down gently in a large pail in her room full of other snails, just wriggling away beneath you, seemingly unaware of their fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then nearly get whiplash as Toriel lifted up the pail, her stomach audible from where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began walking towards her kitchen, ready to serve you up in a nice, warm pie. You began trying to make your way up the side of the pail. Unfortunately, not only were your already incredibly slow, being a snail, but the wriggling of your brothers beneath you really slowed you down. Now, you could only hope you could transform back before you were eaten.</span></div></div>",

You turn around and see a bunch of other spiders. To your horror, they leap onto you. They skitter across your body, wrapping you up in their web all the while. Despite your struggles, they manage to wrap everything from your shoulders to your knees in web, causing you to flop over, unable to move your arms an inch. The spiders then each attach another strand to the webbing wrapped around you. They then crawl away, dragging you kicking and screaming in defiance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're dragged through Hotland, and you swear that scent you're emanating smells a lot more hotdog-y than when you first started smelling that way. The spiders finally drag you up to a familiar cave with cobwebs spread about the entry like curtains. The spiders drag you through the entry, covering you up in more and more cobwebs as they pull you across the floor. Eventually, they separate themselves from you, leaving you wrapped up and on the floor in the middle of a dark, spider infested cave. You hear something sniffing in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahuhuhu~ What have my darlings brought me?\" you hear a familiar voice. You look to the source, horrified, as you see a pair- no, two pairs- no, five eyes pierce the darkness of the cave. Light suddenly shines down, revealing a spider like monster, boasting six arms, two legs, her five eyes, and a cutesy red outfit. The spiders brought before Muffet, the spider girl running a bake sale to move out all of her spider friends in the ruins. If only she didn't price her pastries so much. ...The fact that spiders have been handling them may factor into it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffet sniffs the air again, her eye fluttering at your succulent scent. \"Oh my~ I don't remember the last time my darling brought me something this delicious~ And how lovely of them, already wrapping you up in a sider donut for me.\" You shake even more at this. But your struggles are for not. Muffet hoists you bridal style, walking over to the desk of her bake sale. She places you at center on the table. You watch her write on the sign, and then take out an hourglass before putting it on the table next to you. You crane your neck to look at the sign, reading what she just wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>New special: Hotdog in a spider blanket! Sells for 9999G!

Frisk's gender isn't established in the game. As such, their gender will remain a mystery unless it's required for the chapter (same goes for Chara).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) You don't have to necessarily go through the locations in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Be sure to use proper grammar and spelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Make chapters more than one sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Limit the choices. After things get to two paths, it's decision time. Don't add infinite choices, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">NO PLAGIARISM.
