            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nancy had goosebumps as she snuck through the house. Every shadow startled her, every little creak alerted her. She was constantly on the lookout for her brother, expecting him to pounce at any moment. At the same time, she had to keep quiet and out-of-sight, trying to get the drop on him as well. In the game of nom tag, each player is not only the hunter, but also the hunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only so much time to enjoy each summer vacation, and no one wants to waste any of it doing boring chores. So how do they decide who does what, then? With a game of nom tag, of course! Whoever gets best 3 out of 5 wins, and the loser had to do all the winner's chores for an entire week! They've been doing this competition every week all summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy was feeling absolutely determined to win, partially because her brother, Jeremy has been winning every week all summer, and partially because Jeremy's stomach was always really stinky and gross from all the junk food he ate. Unfortunately, he was a couple years her senior and was already significantly better than her at this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, their house was more than big enough to accommodate their games. There were all kinds of places one could hide if one was clever... but hiding was too risky! Nancy wanted to be aggressive... take him by surprise! She tiptoed quickly around the house, checking every nook and cranny with incredible thoroughness, straining to find any sign of Jeremy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her blood ran cold and her entire body froze up when she suddenly felt someone grab her shoulder from behind! The hand spun her around, only for Nancy to find herself staring right into her brother's open mouth. She shuddered as his foul breath blew out against her face. \u201cN-no!\u201d She yelled, startled, but it was already too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a single movement, Jeremy wrapped his mouth around her entire head! She immediately started wriggling in his grip as her nice, well-groomed haircut was immediately ruined by his sticky, nasty saliva, which totally soaked every inch of her head. Her protests were completely muffled by his mouth as he lifted her up off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he started sliding her further down his throat, even big gulp he took sending her a few inches deeper. She tried to grab onto something and prevent her descent, but soon enough, her arms were pinned against her sides. Her head made a big bulge in his neck as his throat squeezed tightly around her, pulling her deeper and deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNancy was super annoyed by this! Getting swallowed up by other girls was one thing, but boy's stomachs were always so icky and stinky, especially her brother's. Her clothes were completely soaked in gross, sticky saliva, and her hair was completely ruined. Despite being mostly restrained, she kept kicking her feet just out of spite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Jeremy was down to her legs, and he slipped her shoes off before letting her feet slip into his mouth. With that, he closed his lips, taking one last big swallow and sending his sister the rest of the way down to his tummy. He chuckled as he felt her curl up inside his tight gut. \u201cSorry, Nancy!\u201d He laughed. \u201cLooks like you've been nommed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Jeremy just enjoyed the triumphant feeling of being absolutely stuffed. Eventually, he was able to vaguely hear the muffled protests she was shouting. \u201cWhat's that? I can't hear you!\u201d He said, pressing a hand to his ear. He can't actually hear her, so he was simply amused by her shouting. \u201cWell, whatever you're trying to say, you can tell me when I let you out. Which should be in, I don't know... thirty minutes or so!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mischievious cackle, he sat down in one of his game consoles and started playing, all while enjoying the feeling of Nancy squirming around inside his gut. This was super gross to her! He had no compunctions about constantly burping, and seemed to torment her by eating junk food and drinking soda, which only made his stomach even more icky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed a remarkable improvement in his gaming ability whenever she was in there, but eventually, it was time to let her out. \u201cAlright, Nancy. Time's up!\u201d He said, sighing as he put down the controller and shakily stood up to his feet. It was a good thing, too; it was actually quite exhausting to carry her huge weight around, and he had trouble keeping his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked up to the bathroom to cough her up. Spitting her out was a hundred times faster than swallowing her, and before she knew it she was lying in the bathtub. She had little crumbs of cheetos and junk food in her hair, and she was soaked to the bone in gross saliva. She was blinded by the light of the outside world for a moment, but eventually, she was able to look up at her brother angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn't fair! How do you always know where I am?\u201d She pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just have that brotherly intuition, I guess!\u201d He teased, patting her on the head before walking out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nancy took a bath and changed into a new outfit, she considered how she was going to beat her brother at his own game. She doesn't want to spend another week doing his boring chores! By the time round 2 of their nom tag match began, she already had a plan in mind...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Welcome to my home, James,\" Belinda said, as you walked into her home and followed her.<br>\r\nBelinda was a fat redhead with huge boobs, belly, and ass as her long, straight hair reached the top of her exposed crack. Wearing jeans that couldn't make it past the equator of her fat ass, it matched well with her with green blouse and vert green eyes. She was a (literally) massive gaming nerd that knew about everything about games and was quite obsessed with them.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for inviting me for game night,\" you replied as you saw the rest of your friends waiting in the living around a box.<br>\r\nOn the four seater couch was Cassandra, or Cass for short, and she was wearing some jeans with a black rave shirt under a leather coat. With probably the widest hips and biggest ass out of all of them, she was a pear shaped beauty, despite her B-cup. Cass was a black haired tomboy through and through, as people have mistaken her as a guy several times and they couldn't help it, as she acts like it. Especially with the farting.<br>\r\nOn the other hand, her brother, Sam, was the opposite in multiple ways. While Cass was loud, he was quiet and reserved with an appearance of a girl. If it wasn't the for the massive lower half he sported, explosive flatulence, and the same glossy, wavy, black hair, nobody would be able to tell if they were siblings. Currently, he was wearing his school uniform that consisted of black stockings, blue skirt with a white shirt under a blue tie and matching blazer.<br>\r\nFinally, there was Tracy, your crush, sitting on the floor and looking bored as usual. The goth had her shoulder length hair bleached as she wore everything black, from the collar she got from you on her birthday, to the tube top across her double Gs and finally her short shorts. She was your childhood crush and you couldn't help but stare at her in awe. However, you could feel jealousy from the others, though it would vanish immediately if turned towards the source and wondered about your friends' feelings towards you. You once asked them about it, but they hesitatingly dismissed it as friendship. Back to the present, Belinda activated the box and shoved it towards you.<br>\r\n\"Pick a card to start the game,\" she said as always when they used the box and like clockwork, you tapped it on its top several times before it spat out a card.<br>\r\nPicking it up, you waved it around until the words came into view and you were confused by it.<br>\r\n\"Nom Tag?\" You said, everyone's eyes widening in excitement and even the quieter members chattered excitedly.<br>\r\n\"So that's the game? Been awhile we did that game. However, seeing you didn't play this game before, James, we'll remove digestion from the game,\" Belinda said, taking away the box and card before replacing them with pills that everyone took.<br>\r\n\"As everyone remembers, it's the same as hiding seek and tag, with the rules being simple to remember: 1) to obtain points, one must consume another,\" Belinda explained before Sam popped in.<br>\r\n\"Does it matter how we do it?\"<br>\r\n\"I won't micromanage for this game this time around,\" Belinda answered, earning a happy rumble from Sam's behind as Cass chuckled at her girlish brother's fart before ripping her own.<br>\r\n\"2) You can't eat them if they see you coming, so that means you'll have to surprise them. 3) We'll have a full minute head start and then ten minutes before the round ends. Other than the boundaries being my home, all else is fair game,\" Belinda finished and pulled out a timer.<br>\r\nYou were still confused by the game and wanted more explanation for it, but the timer was activated, forcing everyone else to flee. Left alone, you leave and look around for a hiding spot before the minute is up. Just as you found the perfect spot, the timer announced that the minute was over and you quickly hid. For the next two minutes, you wait until your legs cramp up and you got out of your hiding spot. That's when you were found by...</span></div></div>",
