Tails called him over earlier today to help test something out. \"Hey, lil buddy! Are you home?\" he said aloud.He then heard a muffled voice from inside \"Coming!\" Tails then opened the front door to let Sonic in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then stepped inside of his workshop. It looked a bit messy as some blueprints of the Tornado were lying on the floor and on the work station desks along with measurement tools and other mechanical bits and pieces. \"So what is it you want to show me?\" \"It's in the lab. Come on!\" Tails said as he lead him to a small elevator near the left hand corner of the workshop, just next to the hangar door to the plane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter riding it downwards, they stepped out into the lab. The lab was a bit clean than the workshop above their heads, but still some things were unorganized. Their were a few rows of long counter tables filled with test tubes, beakers, research papers, and other stuff scientists use in the center of the lab. On the left wall adjacent to them, there were cabinets filled more or less with the same stuff on the tables, but some also had petri dishes containing bacteria colonies. There were also weird small gadgets and gizmos too. The wall across from them had huge bulky machinery and computers for calculations. On the north and south walls, there were strange machines too that seemed to have been built recently. One being a giant capsule like machine with a control panel and the other a giant ray gun, which looked like it had been built recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then took a seat near one of the experiment tables. \"So?\" Tails didn't respond but then showed him....</span></div></div>",

In truth Tails was having many thoughts of forming a harem due to a recent invention of his slightly altering his personality when he accidentally left it on when he fell asleep in his lab one night, ironic that an invention he planned to use to help people with psychological issues has changed him into one of the world's greatest threats. \"Now Sonic you will start to experience some changes, bear in mind they will be temporary.\" Sonic just nodded as he was still looking away unaware of how big these changes would be...</span></div></div>",

He was dreaming as if he were Rouge. Sonic went through Rouge's day in his dream, trying to steal the master emerald, and annoying Knuckles about his crush on her. It all happened in a matter of seconds. The next thing he knew, he was wide-awake. Thinking about how attractive she was. An alien feeling came over him as he felt his waist pinch in, giving him a waist that most women would die for. Sonic noticed this and touched his belly. Noticing how strangely thin he just became. Sonic's legs became thicker has they filled with a mixture of muscle and fat that used to be in his waist. He looked down at his shapely legs. \"What the...\" Sonic thought as he felt his new womanish thighs. While he was doing so, he butt puffed out and grew as did his chest. Giving him a rather sexy hourglass figure. Sonic looked down and said aloud \"I'm turning into a girl?!\" As if on que, his manhood sucked up into him. The feeling was almost orgasmic as his balls became eggs, his dick became a clit, and a man became a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fur on Sonic's head turned white as all the fur below his head fell off and his skin became smooth and hairless. Sonic's breasts expanded to a large C-cup as bat wings grew out of his back and his ears became big bat ears. His eyelashes grew out to cartoonish proportions to give him the exaggerated female look that all of his female friends have. Sonic's face reshaped itself to look like a girl's. But not just any girl, Rouge the Bat's. To finish of the change, pink lipstick appeared on Sonic's new pouty lips and blue eye-shadow applied itself to Sonic;s eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was a naked 'Rouge the Bat' laying where Sonic used to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and rushed into his bathroom and gasped wide-eyed when he saw his reflection in the mirror. It was Rouge. \"But how did... TAILS!\" Sonic thought as he ran into his closet and put on a trench-coat before running outside and to Tails's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes anything happen along the way?</span></div></div>",

I got the DNA from Rouge thinking that it would keep you male, but of course I hadn;t counted on it turning you into Rouge, herself.\" Tails explained as he finished writing and set the note-pad in a drawer. \"Can you change me back?\" Sonic asked with a serious tone, which was hard to do with Rouge's naturally seductive voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan Tails change Sonic back?</span></div></div>",

So I wanted to see if you could test it out for me.\" Sonic looked at him with a bit of uneasiness. He wasn't to sure about this. Though the thought of being able to go a bit faster, being able to keep up speed, and might be able to be strong or stronger than Knuckles did interest him quite a bit though. \"You sure it's safe? It won't mutate me or anything like that right?\" \"Don't worry about it. If you do experience weird side effects, I'm sure they're only temporary.\" After some thinking, Sonic then agreed to it. \"Okay, Tails, I'll try it.\" he said while grabbing the bottle of pills and was about to leave.

He then set the bottle of pills on the counter, prepared a glass of water, and read the directions on the side of the bottle that Tails wrote. \"2 pills for every 3-4 weeks.\" Sonic then complied with the directions and popped the pills into his mouth and washed it down with the water.

His ass began to expand, becoming round and tight, and his chest ballooned out into two plump GG-size breasts. Sonic began to moan louder and louder, still completely unaware of his transformation. His figure became more slender, his hips got wider, his nose shrunk, his eyelashes grew out, as did his quills, which drooped down to his shoulders. His fur tone changed from a dark cobalt to a much lighter shade of blue, and finally, his penis shrunk and was replaced with a vagina. By now, Sonic was screaming in ecstasy, rubbing his, or rather, her, dainty hands over her newfound feminine body, and as the process completed, Sonic shuddered and orgasmed, spilling cum out her pussy and consequentially jolting herself awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic blinked groggily, and sat up from the couch, much too sleepy to notice the wetness in her crotch, or her incredible new body. She slowly walked to the bathroom, and that's when she noticed that she felt heavier than usual. She looked down at herself, and the shock of what she saw woke her up immediately. \"I TURNED INTO A GIRL!\" she screamed, before realizing in horror that even her voice had become much higher than before. She ran to the closest mirror and examined herself, praying that this whole ordeal had just been one very strange dream, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a deviant thought entered her mind. <i>What if...</i>, she thought, her cheeks blushing bright red. <i>What if, I played with myself...</i> Sonic shuddered at the thought, and yet at the same time, she started fondling her left breast with her hand. She let out a low moan, remembering that with size comes sensitivity. She worked her right hand down to her vagina, which was already wet with her feminine juices, swallowed hard, and fingered herself.  She started to moan even louder, and beads of sweat began to roll down her hot, naked body, which just turned Sonic on more.  <i>Oh..ungh, this is amazing...Ah...</i> Sonic managed to say, as she masturbated faster and faster, losing herself in the moment. In fact, she was so into her own pleasure, that she didn't even notice the bathroom door slowly creak open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it who opened the door?</span></div></div>",

She also found sexier versions of her friends' outfits- Amy's dress, Sally's open vest, Fiona's skimpy leotard, Shade's skintight body armour, and so on.

The changes only continued as Tails felt his manhood slowly suck in as it was replaced by pink, virgin womanhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what have I done?\" Moaned Tails as he gave in and started rubbing his new vigina. As he did, he failed to notice his limbs becoming more slender and womanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have created my line to fame\" Replied Rouge in a jokey but seductive tone as pressure built up in the young fox's chest as 2 large breasts, as big as Sapphire's bursted from his chest like water balloons. Next line was his hands and feet shrunk a few sizes, resulting in hi-HER shoes and gloves to fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic I-MY VOICE!!\" Tails squealed, snapping her out of her horny trance as she noticed her voice became more girly and feminine. But that was nothing compared to the pressure she was having in her head with her short hair......</span></div></div>",

They pulled apart, panting and gasping, then without instruction, Sonic got on her knees. \"You want me to...do it with my mouth?\" she questioned, looking up at Tails in an almost innocent manner.

That's good...\" Sonic looked up at him again, the innocent look replaced by a more sultry one, as she takes the cock into her mouth and starts to slide her lips up and down it's shaft. The thick head almost seems too big for her lips. \"Mmmmm...Mmmgh!\" she moans, muffled by Tails' dick in her mouth.

Sonic!</b>\" he shouted suddenly, his seed spilling uncontrollably from his cock, flowing into Sonic's mouth in hot jets. \"Mmmmng, mmgaaaah?!?\" she exclaimed, letting Tails' cock slip from her mouth. The last spurts of cum land on her face, covering her with his fluid. \"Mmmmmmm!

Good\" Tails laughed to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic began rubbing her breasts. \"Like. I feel so tingly and stuff!\" The Pills effect on her was fast acting as her breasts swelled even bigger than before, filling out into her hands, and overflowing, until they stopped once they had reached the size and shape of a pair of soccer balls. \"Wow! They're so big and bouncy!\" She giggled playing with herself, not even noticing her hips and rear widen to give herself an extreme hourglass figure. Tails went over and caressed her body, running his hands down her sides, and groping whatever he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a fine slut aren't you.... hungry for me... hungry for my cock. In fact, just being without it inside of you makes you feel lonely. You feel empty without me.... Right?\" Sonic nodded her head and licked her lips. Tails pushed her on the bed and got on top of her. \"Do you want me inside you?\" Sonic nodded, the lust having overcome her. Tails did what he said and thrust into her repeatedly, causing moans of even more pleasure to escape her mouth. \"You know... Sonic is such an unfitting name for you. It needs to be more fitting to who you are now...\" He began while thrusting furiously into her \"Hell, you're already one.... How does the name Slut sound? Slut the Hedgehog...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic, or now Slut as Tails referred to her only heard bits of what he was saying, but couldn't help but scream yes at every push her performed on her.

Plus Slut had woken him up with a morning blowjob, so he had that going for him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was toiling away on one of his machines, testing a sample he received from Slut. Tails, while waitng for the analysis to finish turned to watch his personal bimbo. She had picked out some special  clothes for herself to wear, and as he expected, it was as little as she could possibly wear without being considered naked. She had on the tiniest of bra's that look like they could instantly snap off from the weight of her enlarged breast, and a T shirt (If you could call it that), that failed to even cover what the bra could. And on her bottom she had a stretchy pair of mini shorts that left nothing to the imagination when it came to her rear. Slut showed no sign of embarrassment however as she simply continued to fondle herself and giggle constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails could feel himself getting hard just watching her, and would have gone over for some fun if he didn't hear the machine finish its test.He pulled out the file from the machine and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Slut.\" He said. \"You're Pregnant, looks like two rounds was enough to do the job.\" The Bimbo tilted her head \"Pregnant? Like what's that?\" Tails smiled at her and said.\"Why don't you go out for a while... I need some alone time.\" Slut pouted and stroked his crotch. \"Just don't let any of that foxy cream go to waste... Leave some for me.\" She finished licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go out, You're already pregnant, there's not much else that can happen to you.\" Tails told her, which she finally did as he said and skipped out of the workshop. Even though this was what he planned for. The fact that he had impregnated Sonic was still alot for him to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ring was gone, to Sonic's amazement. He was too dumbfounded that he was suddenly somehow wearing Amy's outfit in the middle of a clothing store. This too was weird to him, as he was certain that he was just inside an old antique shop, not a women's clothing store. Hurriedly, he ran into one of the booths, though not as fast as he would have liked to. Closing the door behind him, he analyzed himself in the mirror. He felt strange looking at himself in this mirror. It sent butterflies to his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic felt tingly as alien sensations, the kind that only either corrupt magic or chaos energy could create. Slowly, Somic unwillingly felt his back arch forward with a revolting crack. His hips widened, flaring out while the muscle and fat in his torso rearranged itself into his thighs and butt, making him fill out the panties he was wearing with extremely girlish proportions. As his legs thickened to be unmistakably feminine, his waist, losing a lot of the fat he gained from eating all those chili dogs over the years, caved inward and his belly flattened. His ribs also curved slightly, becoming less wide and more inward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic couldn't help but watch in horror with his mouth agape, turning around to visualize his rear end in the mirror. Little did he know, his feet too shrank to fit into Amy's heeled boots. The fur that was originally blue began to turn into a light pink as it moved up his body, starting at his feet and working its way up. He groaned unwillingly as he felt two bubbles formulate underneath his nipples, which became prominent instead of hidden. They grew to be rounder, filling out under his skin as mammary glands formed and matured to fit into the matching white cotton bra. Her flesh bubbled out into two prominent C-cup breasts. And as his  hands shrank along with the muscle in his arms deteriorating, he cupped them, feeling a strange sensation roll in from his genitals. Sonic shot one hand down in between his crotch as his newly grown boobs had already foreshadowed his next loss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice raised in pitch as he sensually mosned, cupping one of his boobs and fondling it while he tried to reach in and stroke his cock but the panties seemed to strain tighter given his new volumptuous rear. His hand pressed up against his changing groin, causing it to push in faster, which caused Sonic to grunt as he accidentally forced his sex to change faster than anticipated. His balls and penis were sucked up into his pelvis where they dissolved into egg cells and a newly formed vagina. Ovaries and a womb grew out of the vestiges of her male sex, making her 100% biologically a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looked up at the mirror once more. Her fur had completely become pink, all that was left now was her head. She breathed heavily as she witnessed her eyelashes grow outward, symbolizing femininity in her universe. Her nose shrank down to a cute button nose. Her quills shrank and became more like hair than spikes, forming her bob haircut, which completed her look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm Amy..?\" Sonic grabbed at herself in the mirror, feeling all over. She ran a hand up her thigh and blushed when she felt in between her legs. Definitely a girl now. \"But\u2014why\u2014how?\" So many questions ran through Sonkc's mind as she tried to come up with a logical explanation for this. None came to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even think of what to do next, Sonic heard a knock at the changing room door. Who was it?</span></div></div>",

It is a small box that comes from a jewelry company, \"I didn't order anything, but it has my address...\" he thinks aloud as he carries it inside. He opens it up and discards the box it came in, and takes a look at the gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a small black ring box, inside is a strangely metallic-looking silver ring with ridges and a ruby heart in the center of it. Sonic shakes his head, \"This thing looks weird, what am I supposed to do with it?\" he asks, looking inside it curiously. He sees his own name, \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" written inside. \"That will make it hard to explain, must be a prank... but this looks too expensive to be a prank.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand takes the ring and puts it on, but it doesn't even look like it will fit. He manages to get it past his knuckle, starting to think this is a bad idea. He tries to take it off, but it's already started growing. The metal spreads over him like a suit, a burning sensation at the edges as it spreads. His form is slowly changed to be more feminine, with hardly a belly. The color of the suit turns blue, and most of his features stay the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what will he become?</span></div></div>",

Her hair was long and voluminous, and pulled into a pair of twintails- Eggman appreciated the pun, even if she couldn't comprehend it- with pink highlights added in. Her legs were long and shapely, her feet small and dainty. Her arms with slim, and her hands delicate. Her two tails were well-groomed and shiny, with pink highlights at the tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore clothing that might as well have been painted on. White stockings rose up to her thighs, stopping before a strip of pink cloth masquerading as a skirt. A white boob tube just barely managed to contain her chest, nipples easily showing through, with glittery pink Egg logo on the front. She wore sparkly pink platform sandals with sheer high heels that she seemed to be somewhat unsteady on. Her face was caked in makeup, very obvious lipstick, eyeshadow, and blues, all pink in colour. She'd gained a large amount of jewelry as well: A large amount of bracelets, rings, anklets, Eggbrand earrings, and a pet collar with a logo-shaped tag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your old friend Tails... She went looking for you and blundered into the same trap. I was more careful with her mind, since she had knowledge that I needed, but now it's all gone and she's a lovely pet.

She knew that she had been active before then, she could tell from the minor corrections in her code that could only be made through trial and error, so she guessed that she had previously held memories that Master had use for, and they had become irrelevent after the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, the day of her new first memories seemed to be Victory Day, a national holiday for all non-robotic members of the Empire. The day of Master's great conquest of the rest of the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered being reassigned to Maid Team FF, where she worked with her new colleagues, a golden vixen, a pink hedgehog, a brown squirrel, a yellow rabbit, a tan lynx, a brown coyote, and a purple walrus. All of them were identical to her in all ways except their heads, and the vixen's twin tails. They seemed to be odd features for a vixen to have, but Master ensured her that it was nothing to be concerned over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body had been modified again. Like her Team, she had her feet removed and replaced with hover engines. According to Master, it was so they wouldn't walk over already-clean areas, but even so, he seemed to take an unusual amount of delight in removing her feet in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose first memories were ten years old now. That's what her chronometer told her, anyway. She had been cleaning almost non-stop ever since. She would pause for maintenance, but otherwise, she continued to clean. Sometimes she brought Master his food, but mostly, she cleaned. She mopped, dusted, scrubbed, unclogged, brushed, swept, buffed, polished, vacuumed, and used many other methods too. She smiled all the while, because Sophia the Maidbot lived to serve, clean, and obey her Master.</span></div></div>",

He then got out of the woods and into a small plain that leads back to a small suburb which is just right next to the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then decided to walk some ways in the plains. When reached the half way point of it, he spotted a black box. He approached it curiously. \"What could be in it?\" he said to no one in particular. He then picked it up with both hands and took off the lid. Sonic was surprised to see that it was a remote control! Then he began to examine it more. What was odd about it was that it had a setting called Gender-Bending with a dial that switched between M and F which could only mean Male and Female. There were numbered buttons and other settings too like Reality Alteration, but the gender-bending caught his attention more. So he decided he could have some fun with it as he dash back to into the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does he use it on?</span></div></div>",

When the light died down Sonic looked himself over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?\" he said but then covered his mouth with his new dainty feminine hands. \"What happened to my voice?\" he asked to no one in particular, now noticing his voice was a lot lighter. He poked his new breasts and fondled them a little bit \"ooh that's good.\" \"KYAAAA! I'M FONDLING MYSELF!\" he screamed before calming down a bit.

A mere month go, they had been bitter rivals. Now some magic fruit and some ill-advised sex later, Sonic had become Saria, the ebon hedgehog's blushing bride-to-be, and she loved it. Her heart swelled every time she looked at him, especially knowing that, within the year, they would be parents. Spending time with him had been a wonderful experience, and despite his emotional issues, he'd quickly become a real romantic. In truth, she found her month-long life as his lovely bride more fulfilling than a lifetime of running could ever be. She'd always run, never staying in one place for long, because she felt like something was missing, something didn't fit. But now, it did fit. It fit perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow, meanwhile, was happier than he had ever been. He'd never expected to experiece love, and he had to admit, the place it came from was rather unexpected. Their hook-up had hardly been romantic, just drunken sex on a night that changed the course of Sonic's life forever. He remembered Tails and Knuckles being female that night too, but they had returned to normal next morning. If not for his presence at the bar, Sonic would still be Sonic. But once he'd impregnated her, she was Saria for life. It couldn't have gone better for him. He at first feared that he might be selfish, that he might be ruining Sonic's life by trapping him in the form of a busty, pregnant woman, but Saria soon proved to be just as happy as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the duo had even made sure that Saria would remain female after the birth. Tails had made a machine that removed the fruit's magic from her body, ensuring that, once she was no longer with child, there would be nothing to make her male again. Her name had been legally changed, and now she was his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hedgehogs gave their vows, and exchanged rings, and finally kissed, embracing tightly.</span></div></div>",

Only for nothing to happen. \"Of course it wouldn't be that easy....\" She sighed and crossed her arms. \"So we can just change each other by just speaking anything we want...

She opened the door and turned on an emitter that relayed chaos energy to weaken Sonic so he couldn't just sprint out. He tried running out the exit but fell flat on his face. Rouge giggled as she clasped the bra around Sonic's torso. He struggled violently even but was too weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this..?\" He asked hollowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't answer him as she slipped the panties up his legs and stuffed him into the jumpsuit, zipping it up his back. The heels were zipped up his legs and the gloves stretched up his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what..?\" Sonic groaned as he sat on the bench in the small changing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now?\" Rouge took out a small remote control. It had a few buttons but in the center rested a large dial. She turned it all the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic gasped as in an instant, his entire body morphed. D-cup breasts erupted out of his chest, swelling into the bra cups and pressing a firm, deep cleavage into the breastplate. His waist pulled back in as the weight was redistributed into his hips and butt, making them both inflate and puff out. Sonic felt like he was sitting on a cushion of muscle now. He became a her as his penis sucked itself back inside, causing a quick orgasmic feeling to sweep over the newly formed female. Her thighs thickened as her feet shrank to better fit the heels that were previously several sizes too small. The muscle on her arms deteriorated and her hands shrank also. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fur on Sonic's body turned white, all of it falling off except for the fur on her head, leaving smooth and supple skin from the neck down. Her ears grew larger and more pronounced while two bat wings blossomed from her back. As her eyelashes elongated, mascara and blue eye shadow coated her eyes with pink glossy lipstick on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" Sonic gasped in Rouge's voice. A second ago, she was Sonic in Rouge's outfit. Now she was Rouge in Rouge's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why did you make me you?\" Sonic asked, gripping her breasts as if to test if they were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Rouge's response?</span></div></div>",

Sexy little nothings purring from his throat, he puckered his lips and leaned forward to show off non-existent cleavage, eyelids resting in a sultry half-open as he blew a kiss to make any woman roll her eyes. Sonic's heart dropped even further into his stomach, its beat increasing with his panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Take off the shoes and walk away. Take off the shoes and walk away.</i>Sonic repeated the self-command, putting as much emphasis as possible on every syllable. To his complete surprise, he broke his sexy come-hither pose, walking over to the changing room's bench. Trying not to think about how expertly he had rolled his hips as he strutted to the bench, or how femininely he was crossing his legs as he sat down, Sonic continued his mantra, inner voice growing fast with hope. <i>Take off the shoes-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic felt himself slip off the left shoe, the coquettish motion accompanied by the feeling of all of the bows and ruffles of the shoe brushing against his foot. He could have screamed with joy. A shift in position, and then the right shoe was off as well, neatly set aside with the other member of the outrageous pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Walk away, walk away, walk away. </i>Sonic's repetition was reaching a fever pitch, his thoughts blurring together. He could taste the freedom, the masculinity, all just waiting beyond the changing room door. He could deny the stories if anyone said they saw him. He could do whatever he need to do, if he could just get out of this hellish nightmare of a mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic felt himself stand up again, rising quickly and lightly to stand in front of the mirror. Trying to ignore the feminine shoulder and hand posture he immediately assumed, he slowed the pace of his thoughts but increased their volume, putting more force into every word of his begging prayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struck a new pose, resting one hand on his hip and letting the other stroke his quills. Chest stuck out in sharp contrast to his drawn-back shoulders and rear, he fluttered his eyelids, announcing his self-satisfaction with a girly little purr of a \"Mmhmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mantra was spiraling out of control, words blurring together and volume at a horrified high. <i>Please walk away, <b>please</b> walk away.</i> When he began to move, Sonic, for the slightest moment, felt another great surge of hope. When he realized where he was moving to, he felt an overwhelming urge to vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeels tapping on the imitation marble floor with each step, he moved towards his pile of recently-acquired clothing. The movement itself caused Sonic's insides to go cold as he delicately placed each foot in front of the other with each little mincing step, causing him to wiggle in places he'd rather be still. Once again assuming his kissy face, he glanced over his shoulder and appreciated himself in the mirror, placing one hand on his hip while the other ran up his thigh and rear in a caressing motion that made him want to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a swiftness and certainty that made him wince, Sonic reached into the pile and pulled out the panties. He could feel bile in his throat at the sight of the frilly pink mass resting in his hand. Before he could further regret his situation, Sonic bent over and stepped into the ruffle-and-lace nightmare of women's underwear, pulling the panties up so quickly and decisively that Sonic could only mentally yelp in shock at the sensation of his privates being forcefully compressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were somehow even worse when worn. The ruffles, protruding noticeably in lines of delicate ballet pink, were laid over a base of slightly darker pink lace. A silk bow, several size, rested at the very top of the panties' rear, completing the image of incredibly-sexually-active-yet-still-a-sickeningly-ladylike-princess that the undergarment was going for. It must have been padded, because his rear and hips now looked several times larger, able to give Rouge a run for her money in the curves department.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic felt like crying, stomach knotted and frigid with the most extreme terror he'd ever felt. It certainly didn't help then that, after briefly modelling the panties with a gleeful strut, he returned to the pile of clothing and selected the matching padded bra. Having an unwanted imitation of the most obvious sign of femininity made Sonic's blood run cold. Despite the numbness, tried again to reason with himself.<i> Stop it, oh god stop it, please just take it all off.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncaring, Sonic donned the bra, staring downward at the pair of mounds just large enough to suggest a modestly flat chest. Turning to the mirror, he caressed the new garment, testing its shape and feeling with his hands and arms, each movement accompanied by another little appreciative murmur. At the sight of his obvious arousal with the frilly horror, Sonic began to beg with new fear.<i> Take it off, off, now, please-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, as evidenced by the certainty of his motion, where the stockings. The opaque, delicate little things, limp in his hand as he sat down and bunched them up, turned Sonic's pleas to panicked nonsense. They stretched gently past his foot and calf, stopping at upper thigh and turning his legs into white porcelain. Lace surrounded the edges, a delicate white to his panties' suggestive pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, he paused, sitting with complete stillness as the noises of the busy store outside leaked into the room. <i>Oh god, yes, please, stop, please.</i> Sonic's thoughts, broken and jittery from the cycle of hope and despair, managed to solidify for another pseudo-prayer as he got up and sashayed towards the center of the massive room, not even pausing to look in the mirror. The plea grew desperate as the sashay continued past the center of the room and to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door with a gentle turn of the handle, Sonic stepped out into the hallway minced towards the changing room attendant. When the attendant looked up from her book, she went from surprise and confusion to professional courtesy in a second. \"How may I assist you, ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoll-smile stretching with childish glee, Sonic played with his quills and batted his eyelashes as he drawled in a voice that could only be described as hyper-feminine. \"Hi, I, like, need to try on a corset, but, like, can't tie it? I feel really really silly but I don't know, like, how to do it?\" Sonic's urge to vomit returned in full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, ma'am, I'd be delighted to help.\" the woman returned with him to the room, clearly amused by the strange sight in front of her. During the short walk, Sonic engaged in nonstop small-talk, filling his already half-coherent thoughts with <i>darling</i>, <i>sweetie</i>, and <i>soooo pretty</i> as he strutted and sashayed, gesticulating with his hands in a way that made Sonic want to stab himself with the stiletto heels of the shoes that started all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they began the long and arduous process of lacing the corset, Sonic's begging once again devolved into nonsense, now just a general plea to stop this torture before it went any farther, only quieting when the corset tightening began. It was like being stuck between collapsing walls, forcing your bones into positions they would have never otherwise considered. When it was done, his breathing was so high and light he doubted he could run so much as a hundred meters without passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corset itself was a work of art in torture. Starting at the top of his panties and reaching up to forcefully position his fake bust, it was a gleaming hourglass of light pink leather and white frills. The attached garters, delicate lace-edged things, hooked into his stockings and forced them up higher on his legs, making him feel compressed in every area except for his head. The corset's laces rested at his lower back in a petite bow on top of the corset's attached and frill-laden bustle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking the attendant, he began to prance around, blowing kisses to the mirror. He looked like a fairy princess. No, a fairy <i>bride</i>, excited in her wedding lingerie. The thought made his begging start anew. Turning to the attendant (who really was trying her best not to burst out laughing), he struck a pose. \"Am I, like, soooo pretty?\" The answer was immediate. \"Oh, very pretty, ma'am. I think the boys are going to go crazy over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic wanted to die, and the feeling only grew stronger as he started to put on the dress. It was a nightmare of a gown, gigantic puffy-spherical shoulders ending with white-laced sleeves, bust as tight and revealing as possible, rear adorned with a massive pink silk bow, the fabric of the dress squeezing his body like a mermaid gown until his knees, where it exploded out in a mess of frilly underskirts. The attendant helped him with the clasps in the back, complimenting his figure. She helped him put his heels back on, and then, at last, it was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight in the mirror turned Sonic's thoughts into a sobbing mess. Looking like himself until his chin, and then becoming a fairy princess out of some fairy tale, reminded him of just how severe the difference was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my, god. It is all so, like, darling. I'll take it all.\" Sonic gave her the one thing the had left from before all of this- his credit card he had brought to buy new shoes. The attendant's eyes lit up with the prospect of the commission she would get from the sale. \"Oh, sweetie, I am, like, going to totally wear this out of here! Thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few minutes, Sonic was standing outside of the changing room, dressed in a pink nightmare. If he could, he would have screamed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His thoughts a barely-coherent mess, pleas and prayers for release from this torture intermingling with the giggles, coos, and other feminine outbursts... though they could hardly be called outbursts with how they completely controlled him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, even with the completion of his nightmarish new attire, he had no control over himself, and worse yet, the bizarre mind running his body on autopilot didn't seem remotely satisfied. Even more horrifying thoughts kept splashing across his desperate begging for release- She wanted makeup, she wanted hair-style, she wanted other things that didn't bare mentioning, but currently, she seemed most focused on accessories. Sonic wasn't quite sure what that meant, outside of the usual gloves, most girls he knew didn't seem to focus on that much. Sure, Amy had her hairband, and Fiona had her bow- Thinking of the vixen's oddly-cute ribbon seemed to excite the autopilot, and judging from the bows on his boots, on his panties, and on his dress, it wasn't hard to see why- but otherwise, he didn't really know much about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store assistant soon returned, and handed Sonic his card, smiling. Any amusement she had for the hedgehog's attitude seemed to have evaporated now, and she seemed more grateful to him for adding a hefty amount to her paycheck for the month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, do you have accessories here?\" His voice asked needily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not.\" She said. \"There's a great store that does just down the nearest escalator outside, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, great, like, thank you!\" He beamed, curtseying involuntarily. With that, he turned on his high-heel and began to strut out of the store. His new attire emphasised his swaying hips even more, and inside, he just wanted to die of embarrassment, especially when he left the store and happily made his way down the escalator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl-mind beamed with excitement as she spotted the store through his eyes, and almost skipped there, if not for the tightness of the dress around his legs. Instead, his body strutted gracefully into the store, and began to peruse their shelves...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sonic focused every atom of his sense of self (what was left, at least) into making his rebellious body stand still and end the sensation of the dress's silken cloth rubbing against his pantied rear. The fact that he seemed to be hellbent on strutting and prancing like a possessed backup dancer was making it hard, but he persisted, even when it struck him that his current motion was carefully designed to make it seem like he wanted the other customers staring at his unfortunately feminine new look, maybe even checking out how his hips rolled and how the tightness of the dress accentuated his sweet a\u2014.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the mental equivalent of a scream, Sonic snapped himself out of a feminine trance. What the hell was going on? Surely he had to be dreaming; there was no way any of this was real. Before he could try to convince himself further, Sonic realized what his body was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling to himself with girlish glee, Sonic was limpwristedly perusing an incredibly diverse selection of handbags. To his absolute horror, he found himself ignoring anything that wasn't both pink and ludicrously covered in bows, frills, pearls, or any disgusting combination of the three. Several potential handbags and a few clutches had already been selected and set aside, all of varying sizes and shapes but united by almost blindingly bright shades of pink. With a squeal of joy Sonic found himself reaching behind the modest, respectable items and retrieving what he could only describe as a monstrosity. It had to be the least efficient, most ridiculous looking thing he had ever seen. Frills seemed to pour off of the edges, and the hints of princess-pink leather that peeked through the ruffled, lacy decorations were bedazzled with glittery hearts. An oversized satin bow, patterned with sequined kiss marks, hid the handbag's clasp. Disgust and fury mingling in his throat, Sonic's face lit up in a smile, a disgustingly adorable little coo squeaking from his lips in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill carrying all of the other bags and clutches for some reason, Sonic slipped the abomination of a handbag over his shoulder and started to mince off towards the nearest employee, a young fox whose boredom was so severe that she looked like she had been at her desk for the better part of a week. Her genuine double take made Sonic shiver in disgust, his masculinity wounded in an entirely new way when she held her hand over her mouth to stifle a laugh. \"Thank you for visiting Haute Couture Boutique... ma'am.\" the hesitation gave Sonic the distinct feeling that, while there was a chance he could be seen as male even in his ridiculous dress, common courtesy required that it was never going to take place. \"How may I be of assistance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Help. Please.</i> \"Oh, you are such, like, a cute little girl,\" Sonic could see the hatred flash in the fox's eyes as he flailed his hands in what he feared was an attempt at friendliness. Little girl? She was clearly in her late teens. What the hell was she\u2014no, HE\u2014trying to do to himself? \"Sweetie, I could just eat you up, I swear.\" The fox coughed, glancing at the items covering Sonic's arms, her patience clearly wearing thin with the ridiculous sight before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, right. Aren't these just the cutest? I want to buy, like, all of these.\" Sonic thought for a moment that his body had actually allowed his twitching anger to gain control, but he quickly realized it was actually his changing from ridiculous pose to another as he showed off the worst of the pink horrors. \"This one is so, sooooo pretty.\" The fox's stare shifted up from the purse back to Sonic's smiling face. For a moment, Sonic could see the full extent of her confusion and disquiet, but to his horror it melted away into professional courtesy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, ma'am. How would you like to pay, cash or card?\" Sonic tried to clench his teeth in involuntary panic when he realized what was going to happen. He couldn't afford any of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, card. I'm not very good at, like, counting...\" Sonic tried to zone out the rest of the small talk that took place as the fox placed all of the selected handbags and clutches (except, to Sonic's disappointment, his squeal-marked favourite, which he proudly wore on his shoulder) in a pink shopping bag bearing the store's logo, but his will broke when he heard himself start asking for more fashion assistance. It had been so many minutes of boring purse-browsing that he had nearly forgotten his previous glimpse of the girl-mind's other desires. Fear spread like fire through his nerves, but not so much as a twitch escaped to the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am, we carry a wide variety of gloves. Do you have a particular item in mind?\" Sonic dreaded the answer, but when it came he was still surprised by how genuine his voice sounded. \"I want them, like, long? And pink? Or white?\" a giggle escaped from his lips as Sonic found himself placing one hand on his frilly pink hip and gesticulating with the other. \"I think we'll be able to accommodate you, ma'am. If you'll follow me,\" the fox stood up from her desk and began to move into the heart of the store. The sight of her outfit, a utilitarian black pantsuit, left Sonic feeling\u2014to his disgust when he realized what he was wishing he could wear an undeniably female outfit\u2014envious of her relative gender neutrality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny wish on Sonic's part to find some less extravagant clothing was dashed when they reached the gloves. There were only a few pairs on display, the majority of them feminine but not truly horrible. There was, however, a pair of evening gloves near the end of the display, appropriately labelled \"Princess Collection - Pink &amp; Flirty\", that gave the rest of Sonic's outfit a run for its money. The fox was telling him that they were the finest stretch satin, and that their delicate pink tint and lace decoration would compliment his dress, but all Sonic could focus on were the bows, two little satin pieces of horrible pink that rested on the wrists of the gloves and topped the built-in lace cuffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sonic could begin to feel the full extent of his hatred towards this newest offense, his attention was drawn by the fox to the hem of the gloves and the elaborate floral lace designs. Sonic's feeling of sickness jumped up a few notches when he heard himself coo and purr in delight as he stepped up to the gloves and began to inspect the details of their femininity. A few moments later, and Sonic found himself wearing the twin pink horrors, moving his limp wrists in a way that eerily reminded him of a stereotypical princess. Their exorbitant cost was immediately added to the growing list of new debts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the perfume counter only took a few moments, but Sonic wasn't sure if he should be thankful about it; he had squealed over the fox's explanations and advice to run forward and select a pink glittery bottle labelled \"Pink Sugar Dolly Girl: Flirtatious Chiffon\". Sonic's numbness only increased as they continued to the jewelry counter and began to examine the glittering gemstone novelties. Pearls, necklaces and matching earrings were inspected and either accepted or rejected based on how noticeably expensive they were. After what seemed hours of indecision, he finally settled on a glitter-pink choker connected to a large heart-shaped pink gemstone that rested delicately over, and nearly completely hid, his adam's apple. The matching earrings, also heart shaped, were worn after a few minutes of piercing (it was easily the least painful thing to happen to him all day). He decided to be conservative, to his relief, and only bought two of the many different pearl necklaces that caught his attention, selecting childish pink and classical white at the suggestion of the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter yet another round of payments, the financial pain now just another dull thud in his now omnipresent headache, Sonic stood in front of one of the store's many mirrors and struck a series of poses. The fox, still weary but visibly excited by the commissions she had to look forward to, complimented every swing of the hip and pursing of the lips. Sonic was starting to doubt that any nightmare could last this long, or feel this horribly real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, are there any good places for a makeover around here? I think I need to try something new...\" the fox smiled politely, her forthcoming answer clearly a matter of routine. \"Of course. There is a beauty store that specializes in cosmetics and hairdressing, Sweetie's Salon, just a small walk away. In fact, I believe they specialize in makeovers, although I must warn you, they're a little expensive. If you just continue down the way and make a right, you can't miss it.\" Sonic curtsied in thanks, making the fox giggle, and then set off.</span></div></div>",

With the overload of shopping choices behind her, she'd become much more focused again. During these trips, it was harder than usual for Sonic to get a thought in edgewise, no matter how hard he tried. All he could do was listen to the stream of giggles and coos and squeals as they coalesced into terrifying planning and plotting once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realised that she was starting to check off her makeover's progress as she walked. <i>Shoes, check. Clothes, check. Bags, check. Gloves, check. Jewels, check. Perfume, check. Just makeup, hair, and her body to go!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic screamed internally when he heard that giggle. Thinking of it as shoes, clothes, accessories, makeup, hair, and whatever 'body' meant (He had his suspicions, and he didn't like it), at least sounded like it was only half-way done. Separating \"Accessories\" into its constituent parts made it clear that the makeover was on the home stretch. This store was going to be the last one before his \"Makeover\" was complete, and whatever crazy idea for giving him a female body came into play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was any small light in this, it was that, with any luck,he might have control again after this hellish day was over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic entered the salon, feeling a little relief as her female half once again dissolved into the distracted buzz of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ma'am, how may I help you today?\" The woman at the desk spoke up to him. She was a cute hyena girl, face made up and hair style and cut into an adorable perm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get, like, a full makeover!

With every sensualized step the sound pounded into his head, underscoring the limpwristed swinging of his arms and forcing him to stay conscious of the nightmare that his day had become. When I find out who did this, there's going to be-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's thoughts were interrupted by an ungodly squeal of excitement shivering up from his throat. His body had just noticed one of the several monstrous pink rose bouquets that filled the waiting room, and was now prancing over to it with a particularly swishy gait. As he screamed with frustration internally, Sonic found himself bending over until he was completely horizontal past the hip, face buried in the roses. Breathing the nauseating fragrance of the flowers at this close of a distance made Sonic's thoughts go hazy,  and it took him a few moments to realize what his body was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the silken material of his dress stretched extremely tight across the padded curves of his suggestively positioned derriere, he was still slowly swinging his hips to some silent beat, clearly putting on a show. It was who the show was for that worried him most of all. Glancing back coyly, one hand still stroking the rose against his cheek, Sonic fluttered his eyelashes. A masseur, just walking out of the adjacent hallway's many doors, stared back in mixed bewilderment and thinly-veiled revulsion. Sonic's heart clenched in his chest as he mentally screamed for his body to resist whatever was forcing it to act like a sex-starved drag queen. As he did so, his free hand slowly ran up his thigh to rest on his now even more suggestively swaying rear, rubbing the silken material of the dress with a gentle caress before lightly squeezing it. A soft little purr of pleasure rose from Sonic's throat as he gently kissed the rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blushing masseur, eyes widening in shock and disgust before being averted, quickly set off down the hallway. Sonic, giggling to himself like the contented little flirt his body apparently desired to be (while his mind reeled in shock at this glimpse of the horror his body had in store for him), quickly straightened up and turned around. The hyena receptionist stared at him from beyond the doorway, eyes as wide as the masseur's. Apparently satisfied with his scandilizing of the staff, Sonic gathered his skirts in preparation for sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic, to his mixed despair and rage, found the motion somehow even worse than the prissy  mincing of his new style of walking. Sitting in the dress was a careful matter of daintily smoothing out the rear, positioning the bow, and then, after everything else was prepared in the most prim and delicate way imaginable, lightly lowering himself into the seat and crossing his legs. Sonic had nothing against crossing his legs normally, and had never even really thought about it before, but something was changed. The sensation of stockinged legs, rubbing against each other and the dress that ensheathed them, was an inescapable reminder of what his body had done to itself. It didn't help that his legs seemed to always be in slight motion, forcing the arousing sensation to stay ever-present in his mind as he assumed poses that he could only hope he would never find himself assuming again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of just staring at the salon's decoration while daintily fussing with the roses, Sonic found his eyes involuntarily drawn to a laminated sheet of paper resting on a chair to his left. He hadn't even completed the first sentence before a mental groan of anguish filled his head (only, of course, to be promptly and completely ignored) as he pressed his hands to his cheeks in sheer and unadulterated glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the hyena receptionist finally walked over to Sonic, he was still engrossed in the contents of the single piece of paper, eyes glittering with joy as he invisibly begged for release from the torture that was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. God. I had no idea you were, like, a spa! I just have to have the full package, honey. It's definitely time I had a real makeover. I need to be like, sooooo pretty. Ohmigod I'm so excited!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena nodded and smiled as Sonic prattled on. He could have sworn he saw gold coins flash in her eyes for a split second. Was that the sound of a cash register? \"Of course, ma'am! It will be just a few more minutes while we get the World Class Experience ready for you. Please, enjoy a magazine while you wait, I'll be back shortly!\" With that, she was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic, almost squealing with a glee that terrified him, put every ounce of will he had left into imagining himself running out the salon's ridiculous doors. When he gave up and focused back on the nightmare that his day had become, he was holding a magazine, no doubt snatched from one of the nearby tables covered with piles of them.<br>\r\nThe cover alone filled Sonic with the urge to vomit.

Mocked by most women and read by those who never mentally graduated past the \"i love cute clothes and cute boys!!! teehee!!!\" phase, Sonic knew of its existence only because he had once heard Vanilla forbid Cream to ever read it. She had been talking about something to do with inappropriate content and the enforcement of \"patriarchal\" gender roles. The cover, an image of a disquietingly eager looking young echidna woman dressed in a pink Playboy Bunny costume and surrounded by two questionably older (and questionably clad) male hedgehogs, told Sonic that she had been more than right to do just that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic tried his hardest to zone out from this parodically-feminine nightmare, desperately searching for anything to let him ignore the hell his life had become. It wasn't very successful, and after a moment trying his hardest to think of the running shoes he had intended to buy before the nightmare began, he found his attention being forced back to the pages in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerched delicately over his crossed legs, pages held as if they could cut his precious little gloves, Sonic was greeted with a centerfold extravaganza of lewdness. Unrealistic, inappropriate, and uncomfortably erotic was the only way he could describe the depiction of male body that greeted him, but least comfortable of all was the text the accompanied the image; he had no interest in learning how to \"please your man in a way that his ex never could\" or \"be his dirty little princess\". Unfortunately for Sonic, it seemed his body disagreed. A terrifyingly aroused sounding purr tickled his throat as he ran one gloved finger down the last place he wanted to imagine touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm dreaming. It's not real.</i> It sounded hollow, even to Sonic, but at this point it was all he had. No amount of rage or fear or sadness mattered to his body. All he had was the hope that it would be over sooner rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the hyena returned to take him to his appointment, he had gone mostly numb with horror at the sheer amount of unwanted sexual response his body had generated in response to the magazine. As he gleefully rose from his seat to accompany the hyena into the heart of the salon/spa, purse daintly positioned over his crotch to hide the telltale sign of his unwanted arousal, he could only hope he wouldn't be putting any of it into practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that wait, ma'am, but we're finally ready to get started. Are there any concerns before we begin with the undressing?\" To both Sonic's disgust and despair, the hyena seemed nearly as eager to start as his feminized body.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Like, definitely not!\" Sonic tittered like a man possessed, still carefully keeping his purse in its position as he limply flapped and gestured with his free hand in an almost frantic burst of glee. \"This is going to be so great, right? Why would I want to, like, not start right now? Where can I get ready?\" As he squealed out his falsetto excitement, Sonic found himself swinging his padded rear from side to side in a little happy dance that made his urge to vomit return in full force. The hyena stifled yet another laugh, hand barely able to hide the grin as she watched the dragged up hedgehog act girlier than her princess-obsessed toddler niece ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessionalism returning with a deep breath, the hyena\u2019s forced smile returned. \u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me, we can started right away ma\u2019am.\u201d she offered, almost giggling again as Sonic struck a particularly over the top pose and ran his hand down his corseted waist, before walking off into the heart of the facility.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic followed close behind the hyena, the movements of his mincing strut hilarious in their exaggeration. Still seeking to keep his purse in its strategic position, he kept one hand daintily pressing the handbog into his crotch in a fashion that was anything but subtle in its attempt to hide what was going on. If anything, it may have been even more mortifying. His other hand perched limply at chest level and occassionally flapped up to give sultry little waves to the wide-eyed staff members they passed. Hips swinging wide in a come-hither strut that ended with each foot placed not merely in front but a little over the last to maximize the sensual rhythym of his steps. The incredibly distracting and infuriatingly arousing rubbing of his stockinged thighs, confined tightly in the pink prison of his dress, was just insult to injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic had never felt more like screaming. It was all a nightmare. It had to be. The clicking of his heels on the tile floor pounded into his skull, the scent of his perfume made him want to gag, it all felt so real, but it simply wasn\u2019t possible this was happening. How could it be? Prancing around looking like a eight year old barbie fanatic\u2019s runway reject? Squealing his joy for the entire city to hear at the thought of a makeover? What reality could be so horrible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic\u2019s was torn away from his thoughts by a mewling noise of mixed arousal and surprise coming from his pursed lips. The unfortunate male masseuse from before had just walked out of one of the spa rooms and into the hallway and now stood mere feet in front of them, looking uneasily at Sonic as he paused to let them get past. Sonic, to his horror, took full advantage of the opportunity. As Sonic placed his previously occupied hand on his hip and waved coyly with the other, the masseuse simultaneously paled and even turned a little green as the handbag moved to reveal just how glad the hedgehog was to see him. Sonic, trapped in his mind, felt every bit as disgusted but could only mentally sob as he brushed past the unfortunate employee, waving hand lowering to stroke the stunned man\u2019s chest with a horrifyingly sensual delicacy. Before the man could protest or voice his discomfort, Sonic and the now very uncomfortable looking hyena woman moved on. Not before Sonic blew a kiss to the harassed man and gave him a new show of his skill in presenting his own padded rear, of course. That would have only mortified Sonic, and it was now clear that Sonic\u2019s body wanted nothing less than absolute horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic regained his mental composure just as they reached the undressing rooms. The hyena lead him inside to a larger room colored in soft pastels and decorated with an almost overpowering floral theme. Sonic barely even noticed the room itself as he was too busy mentally yelling in helpless anger at his own reaction. As soon as he had entered the room, he had exploded in glee. \u201cOhmigod, it\u2019s so, like, pretty!\u201d The phrase was repeated what had to be at least a dozen times as the feminized hedgehog pranced between the room\u2019s many vases full of lilies and roses, bending over just as he had in the waiting room to both put on a show and appreciate the sickeningly strong scent. The hyena waited awkwardly until Sonic had rearranged the last vase and now stood smiling blankly, apparently now aware of why she had come in the room in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re ready to begin ma\u2019am, I thought while you change I would walk you through the World Class Experience and get some information on how we can make it a perfect experience personalised just for you .\u201d The hyena glanced at her clipboard before returning her gaze to the ridiculous sight in front of her. Sonic met her gaze with a mindless giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! I\u2019m a little shy, teehee...\u201d To both his and the hyena\u2019s horror, he began to reach for his dress\u2019 zipper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-ma\u2019am! The dressing room is right behind you.\u201d The hyena looked more than a little embarrassed as Sonic glanced behind him to see the extremely obvious open doorway into one of the room\u2019s two individual dressing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Like, okay!\u201d Sonic chirped without a worry as he mentally sighed in relief. With another giggle, he minced inside the room and closed the door. After it swung open just as Sonic\u2019s zipper was halfway down, the hyena very kindly reminded him to lock it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, our World Class Experience really is something special. We\u2019re going to start you off with...\u201d As the hyena began her sell of the spa/salon\u2019s service, Sonic felt a new burst of cold, impotent rage. Why? How? As he internally cried and shouted, his body purred with satisfaction as it began to dismantle the mess of drag-barbie fashion that covered him.</span></div></div>",

The contented murr from his bodyjacker didn't sound good, however. And nor did the clarification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a few options for the first stage, actually. We will remove the hair from your arms, front, and muzzle automatically, but there are some additional services too. Removal of back-quills is popular for a lot of hedgehog ladies like yourself, and girls without full-body fur are often interested in a neck-down shave, to make their form completely hairless below the face.\" The hyena spoke from the other side of the door, as Sonic carefully extracted himself from the outfit. The girly mind seemed to be taking its time to mull over these options, and it seemed quite interested in all of them, though how interested was tough to register with the excited babble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that, any remaining fur is given a full wash and conditioning, to make it soft and shiny. At this stage we also like to offer fur dye treatment.\" Sonic felt like vomiting when his mind was immediately flooded with images of herself in a completely pink form, hairless just like Rouge from the waist down, wearing her fairytale costume with a gormless smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic screamed internally again, but fighting the urge to refer to himself as a woman was becoming an increasingly impossible task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said... perhaps the dyejob wasn't such a terrible idea. After all, he was barely recognisable as a pink hedgehog. Maybe that would actually be less embarassing than his identity as Sonic being associated with the barbie-doll nightmare she was becoming. Something that Sonic was acutely aware of as her outfit gave way to his form. If there was any doubt as to the identity of the man who had strutted into the spa, acted like a slutty drag queen, and sexually harassed some poor man just trying to do his job, it would soon be gone.</span></div></div>",

He than dash into well sanitary and maintenance bathroom that was just outside of the food court which was thankfully empty, and occupied one of the stalls.

Sonic was anxious and nervous at the same time. Was he really going to try something intended for females? Well, he came this far, and there seem to be no turning back at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took out the cream with his fingers and started to rub it into his chest. It felt cool to the touch, but after awhile it felt really nice. It started to make Sonic's skin very sensitive that it made him moan at the feeling.

Well, it was some rumors Knuckles heard that led him to start this expedition. After what seems to be a two hour trek deep into the old place and ending up in some kind of hallway, their surroundings looked 'fancier' than before as the walls were painted in more detail with some jewels embedded in them and some kind of purple silk drapery were hanging off the walls. They walked down the hall until they reached a huge door with an engraving of two giant echidnas standing like guardsmen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them pushed the door open.

However, he kept thinking about the pendant. There was something enticing to it. Maybe it could be very valuable? It won't hurt to take it, right.

Sonic sheepishly stood back up and smiled weakly. \"I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright. Just be careful.\" Knuckles replied and walked away, getting back to work. Sonic scratched his head and looked at the pendant. There was something special about it, he was sure. Suddenly another pain wave brought him to his knees, and Knuckles ran over. Suddenly, Sonic's butt grew and became rounder. His eyes widened in surprised. Immediately after, his hips widened and stomach shrank, giving him a sexy hourglass figure. The rest happened so fast. His lips puffed out and became poutier, his eyelashes and fingernails grew longer, his arms and legs became less muscular,his spikes collapsed and became droopy, long, and silky, he grew D cup breasts, and finally, he became a she. \"What the fuck just happened to me?!\" Sonic screamed. Knuckles just stared speechless, his boner apparent. Sonic immediately covered her boobs and crotch, blushing. \"Listen Knuckles. We need to change me back.\" Sonic said, flinching at her new girly voice. Knuckles finally snapped out of it. \"O-ok. Have you touched any suspicious looking artifacts while here?\"<br>\r\nSonic hesitated. \"No...\" She said. \"Listen Sonic. If I'm gonna help you, you need to be truthful.\" Knuckles said. Sonic sighed. \"This pendant.\" She replied. \"Take it off. Maybe that'll reverse the effects.\" Knuckles suggested. Sonic nodded and tugged, but it wouldn't budge. \"It's stuck!\" Sonic exclaimed. \"No it isn't. You just didn't pull hard enough.\" Knuckles retorted. He began pulling, but the pendant wouldn't come past the head. It somehow shrank, and they wouldn't take it off without taking Sonic's head off too. Knuckles stepped back in defeat, and accidently brushed against one of Sonic's boobs. She let out a small groan of pleasure. \"Um... maybe we should get some clothes on me.\" Sonic said, blushing. \"Good idea.\" Knuckles said, also blushing.</span></div></div>",

Across from his bed in the southeast corner was a door with a small window on top, probably the only exit there is in this place. In the northwest corner, there was a bathroom. Right next to his bed was a nightstand with a single drawer was a glass filled with some kind of weird pink-purple-ish liquid. He picked it up and took a sniff. It smelled a bit sweet, and a bit strong. Was he supposed to drink this? Probably what his captors want him to do and it might knock him out again or worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got out of bed. Another thing he realized that his personal belongings, his shoes, socks, and gloves were gone, leaving him literally naked. He checked under the bed, but found nothing. He then pretty much had it staying here so he went to the door to exit. However, the door was locked. He tried to spin dash the door down but to no avail. \"What is that door made out of?\" he questioned to no one. He then sat down back on the bed contemplating of what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

What could possibly happen? If my captors wanted me dead then I wouldn't be here anyway\" So he took a sip of the liquid, a small sip first. He was quite shocked by the sweet taste. So he finished the rest of his drink. \"Wow that drink was probably one of the best drinks I ever had.\" Then all of a sudden while admiring the taste he felt a pain in his stomach. And that pain got him down on his knees. All of a sudden he started sweating, \"Whats happening to me?\" Was all he could thought. He felt like he was about to pass out but the pain kept him awake through what was next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic felt pain in his legs, he could feel them reshaping themselves, becoming more slender. He could feel himself lose a few inches in height as his legs shrank slightly. His feet also became dainty and smaller in size. His hips became a little wider and he could also feel his butt also became tighter. He could feel his body reshaping itself and painfully shaping into an hourglass figure. His next change really hurt him, he could feel his \"manhood\" shrink until no more and replaced by a vagina. His stomach then became much more slender. \"<span class=\"cblue\">Whats</span>..<span class=\"cblue\">happe</span><span class=\"cppink\">ning</span> <span class=\"cppink\">to</span>-\" He quickly covered his mouth as he realized his voice was getting lighter and more girlish like, sounding almost slightly like Blaze. Then he almost squeeled when 2 massive breasts sprouted from his chest. He had breasts that were bigger than Rouges. Next his arms became more slender and feminine. His hands becoming smaller and more girlish. His face started to tingle as well. And he could feel his quills droop down and almost become longer and more hair like, 3 bangs fell down onto his face. Lastly his fur became a lighter sky blue color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...What just happened?\" was all Sonic could say. He looked down and the first thing he noticed were his breasts. He poked one and right away noticed they were real. He immidieatly ran to the bathroom trying to ignore the new *bounce* that his boobs were giving him. He looked in the mirror and all he could see was a sky blue beautiful hedgehog with slender arms and beautiful legs. 2 breasts that were big enough to put Rouge to shame. A pretty face with a cute little nose and light green eyes that give off a radiant cuteness and cute eyelashes. If he were a guy still he would probably fall head over heels for the image. But he feels depressed knowing that its just his reflection. He er now SHE walks back out and sits on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

It was now two years since she had been captured and transformed into a girl, and her body had recovered from the experiment, and, with some healthy physical therapy and exercise, she had blossomed into an attractive, eighteen year-old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer marriage to Shadow had come quickly, and, along with Rouge, he had been helping her adjust to her new life.They had chosen the name Sophia together, and Rouge had helpfully instructed Sonic on fashion and makeup and all of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, she had scoffed at all of that, from the wedding to the tips and the attempts to change her name and make her embrace her new body. She'd been kidnapped and used for some weird experiment that made her a female and forced her to plop out ten babies that were immediately taken from her. And yet, the long she spent as a girl, the more she began to feel at home in her new body. The more she was dragged on shopping trips and forced into salons, the more she enjoyed herself. The cosmetic changes had come piece by piece. First, her use of makeup steadily increased. She went from not using any, to using tiny amounts, to applying more and more, until she used just as much as Rouge. Rarely did she go out without her lipstick and eyeshadow. She even took to doing her nails, despite them always being covered. Then she began using perfume. Then her dress sense changed, gone were the tomboyish outfits of her early days, and instead, she wore dresses and skirts and blouses and even some rather sexual clothes. The colours went from her normal reds and neutral greys, whites, and blacks to more vibrant- Pinks, purples, yellows, greens to match her eyes. Her running shoes got girlier, then got heels, and soon she was wearing stiletto-healed boots, which, with Rouge's help, she learned to walk perfectly in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one day, she did it. SHe gave up her iconic quills, having them restyled into long, soft hair, that was useless for fighting robots. SHe went out alone, and came back with all the documenation saying that her name was now Sophia, and did the one thing she could never have seen herself doing: She gave up heroism. Realising that she no longer enjoyed running outside of the gym, that her usual attire was useless for fighting, and her quills were no longer a weapon, she told her friends that her powers no longer mattered to her, and they were pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with a GUN device that had been made for use on enemies, Rouge drained away Sophia's powers. She was no nothing more than an ordinary girl. She began dating Shadow, and soon found herself accepting his proposal. They were married the very next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was two years ago now, and Sophia sat up, stretching with a sigh of...</span></div></div>",

Shadow insisted on not jumping in early, and so it had taken them almost two years to conceive, but eventually, Sophia got her wish. Now she rested on her bed, rubbing her hands over the swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia got up from her bed carefully, and slowly padded over to her floor length mirror, twirling a lock of blue hair idly as she admired her beautiful form. She let out a giggle as she imagined what her sixteen year old self would've thought of the new her. That adventurous free spirit, never allowing himself to be tied down, always on the move, always fighting, somehow becoming a demure and dutiful housewife- Shadow's salary from GUN was more than enough to support them. Sometimes, Rouge joked about the idea of the GUN doctors specifically tampering with her mind to make her docile and submissive, but even though the idea seemed plausible, Sophia couldn't bring herself to care. In fact, if she had been brainwashed, she wanted to meet the one who did it to thank him personally! She had gone from a restless and wild existence to a content and luxurious lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA kick from the baby roused her from her thoughts, and Sophia entered the bathroom to run herself a bath.</span></div></div>",

The bathroom was just as white as the room he awoke in. There was a sink with some clear plastic cups near the faucet, a medicine cabinet, a toilet and a shower stall. He took a closer look at the medicine cabinet over the sink and opened it up. Inside there were only a packet of pink tablets that were unlabeled. He examined them and wondered about their purpose and what they were for, but he set them down for now and he decided to check the shower stall. It had opaque glass walls and door for entry. He opened it to see a shower head with a loofah around the neck. On the floor, he saw an unlabeled clear shampoo/conditioner bottle with a white gel like fluid inside, and there was a bottle of body-wash as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic took some time to think about all this, and it just seemed all too fishy and suspicious to him. But what could he do? He obviously can't get out, and no way of knowing how to. Well, maybe he could take a shower to freshen up. He could try a tablet too, and it isn't like it was going to kill him since his captors could have done so when he was out anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

It wouldn't hurt to at least try it. Sonic then took a plastic cup and fill it with water from the sink. He opened up the packet and took out one tablet out of the 24 inside. \"Well, here goes nothing.\" he said aloud while popping the tablet in his mouth afterward. He then washed it down with the water. He waited for a moment to see if anything would happen. After a couple of minutes, his stomach started to hurt, leaving him to lean on the sink because of the pain and started to have weak knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his limbs becoming slender and sleek. He looked at his hands in panic as they became more dainty, long fingers and longer nails. His feet lost a couple of shoe sizes, now with smaller toes. His butt started to expand outward a bit and so did his hips. His waist then thinned, making his torso more hourglass shaped. His chest then ballooned out to EE cup breasts, putting Rouge's to shame. His manhood started to recede into his and was replaced with a pair of moist 'lips'. The fur color of his inner thighs and around the crotch area were now light tan. His winced in pain as his face started to change as well. His face became rounder and smaller, his nose turned into a small bump, and his eyelashes were now fuller and longer. His quills bend down and flowed more hairlike, and he also grew three bangs on the top of his head. Finally, his fur color changed to a lighter shade of blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now a total she! Sonic just panicked and gasped as she stared at her reflection in the mirror. \"Wha-?\" she stopped and covered her mouth realizing that her voice was higher pitched than usual. She looked down at her breasts, and touched them and felt them, confirming that they were hers. She then looked again at the beautiful hedgehog in the mirror, and just gotten depressed. It was a girl that Sonic would have wanted to date, but problem was that she was now that girl. She became mopey at her predicament that she was in and didn't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Then he applied the Body Wash and was mesmerized by the clean relaxing feeling. He was so taken in by the feeling that he never realized that the shampoo, conditioner, and the body wash were changing his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe failed to notice that his body was shrinking, His legs becoming slender. His arms started to get thinner and more slender with dainty hands. His hips were becoming wider. His butt was becoming tighter and more feminine. He lost a little of height too. His manhood also shrank and replaced with a vagina. And even while his chest was swelling he was still to mesmerized by the feeling. His face became more feminine and his nose shrank while his eyelashes grew. His quills drooped down and became more hair like and longer. Finally his fur became a lighter blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished he turned the Shower off and grabbed a towel and wrapped it around him. He noticed something was off with his center of gravity. It felt like something was weighing them down. He looked down and saw 2 breasts big enough to put Rouge to shame if one were to compare. He looked between his legs and could find nothing at all, only felt a vagina. He squealed in shock \"What happened? OH!\" He covered his mouth with his hands and noticed they were more dainty. He looked in the mirror and saw a female light blue hedgehog with slender legs dainty hands and a sexy hourglass figure. He saw his face and noticed his nose was smaller and his eyes were lighter green and screamed again! \"I...turned into... a GIRL!\" He sat back down on the bed  and nearly fainted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then</span></div></div>",

And second what happened to you?\u201d asked Sonic.<br>\r\n\u201cFor the first one, the Pink Emerald can enhance any life form to take many additional attributes to help a species propagate faster,\u201d explained Tikal to Sonic as she unconsciously rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains a lot,\u201d said Sonic to herself after she nodded understanding what was explained.<br>\r\n\u201cAs for the second, me and Chaos fused into a single being, that why I look so different. Actually I now have almost all of Chaos powers, his mind became part of me,\u201d explained Tikal.<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but what about that?\u201d asked Sonic as she pointed to Tikal\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I can show you,\u201d said Tikal as she closed her eyes in concentration and not long after the skin of her belly started to change color, slowly becoming more transparent until it was clear like water.<br>\r\nFloating inside her belly were many chao and they seemed to be sleeping quite comfortably.<br>\r\n\u201cThe like to sleep in there so I occasionally let them to climb inside me,\u201d said Tikal giggling as she saw on the chao stir and open its eyes.<br>\r\nThe small chao saw that it was in a new place, so it swam to the surface and came out like one would when emerging from under the water.<br>\r\nAfter that the little one floated around a bit before it saw Sonic and immediately hide behind Tikal.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's ok she is a friend,\u201d said Tikal as she gently picked the chao and showed it to Sonic.<br>\r\nOnce it calm down it floated closer to Sonic and started to chant its own name excitedly.<br>\r\n\u201cAren't you full of energy,\u201d said Sonic as she takes the chao in her arms.<br>\r\nThe chao looked at Sonic in curiosity before it started to suck on Sonic's nipple.<br>\r\nSonic moaned as the little one drank her milk, she was so distracted that she only noticed the other chao when she felt another mouth on her other breast.<br>\r\nSonic looked around and saw that all the chao were awake and waiting for their turn. She turned to Tikal, now without the pregnant looking belly, when she heard her laughing.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Sonic.<br>\r\n\u201cHow long have you been a hermaphrodite?\u201d asked Tikal instead of answering Sonic's question.<br>\r\n\u201cLess than an hour, why?\u201d asked Sonic.<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, no wonder that you seemed so distracted. You didn't have the time to used to your new body,\u201d said Tikal.<br>\r\nAfter that they just enjoy the comfortable silence while Sonic was breastfeeding the chao.<br>\r\nWhen the chao finished their meal they got comfortable in the bed and fell asleep.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you came back Tikal?\u201d asked Sonic.</span></div></div>",

The subject on his mind was mostly girls, and he also thought about some of his friends who need a girl since he thought they would be better off. While he was in deep thought, he aimlessly walked into an alleyway between two bricked buildings and a dead end consisting of a wooden fence with some holes in it. Sonic then gotten out of his trance, and was about to head out of the alley. However, he saw something through the holes that got his attention. He approached the fence and peeked through one of the holes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw was an old fashioned well with a wooden crank and bucket, and a stone cylinder base and opening. On the ground, next to the well looked like some kind of coin. Curious about this, Sonic tried to move one of the posts to see if it opens and luckily, one did. He went through the hole and closed it. He discovered that he was in a four-way like intersection spot with fences blocking the exits. He looked back on the ground and picked up the gold coin. What was odd about it was the writing on the coin. \"For 1 Wish.\" He was a bit confused about this. A wishing well and a gold coin. It seemed like he was lured here on the spot like some kind of elaborate prank. Though the one who would be behind this was nowhere to be found yet exactly the same time Sonic was about to wish on helping others, maybe even himself. It wouldn't hurt to use it since at least, it wasn't any of his money and would be something for fun. He then said his wish while tossing the coin in. \"I wish....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he wish for?</span></div></div>",

When the light faded, Sonic then realized that his shoes, socks and gloves were missing! \"Huh? What's going on?!\" he said aloud and in complete shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a strange sensation started to flow throughout his entire body. He looked at his hands and noticed that they were changing. His hands now looked smaller with slender fingers and long claws/nails. His arms then slenderized as well. His feet went through identical changes as they lost some shoe sizes, and his toes became dainty and petite. His legs suddenly had a womanly tone and definition as well. His waist then thinned out, and his hips widen, where it altogether gave him a curvy feminine shape. His fur color around the inner thighs turned a peach/tan color like his arms and chest. His bum then expanded too. He then felt pressure in his chest which Sonic responded in dread as a pair of breasts grew from A cups to DD cups in a matter of seconds. Not to mention they were topped with quarter sized nipples. He felt pressure in his groin next as his manhood was quickly replaced with new womanhood. His face became more female as his nose shrunk into a little bump, his eyelashes grew longer along with a smaller and rounder face. His quills became more hairlike and grew downward, and 3 bangs on his forehand. Finally, his fur color turned into a brighter blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was now a she! Sonic was now in distraught with her sudden gender change and left naked. \"What-?\" she paused mid-sentence to discover that her voice was now higher pitched then before. However, it wasn't over just yet. Lingerie then began to materialize on her body as a pink bra and panties covered her private areas. Then, a small red t-shirt, that gives a midriff effect as it showed off her belly, magically appeared on her body and a pair of tight jeans as well along with a pair of shoes that are a feminine version of her previous ones. Sonic was just stunned that of what had occurred and decided to leave the place immediately while trying to figure out what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas reality been altered?</span></div></div>",

Why?</i> As his mind raced from possibility to possibility, each thought growing more and more nightmarish, he started to tremble, knees and hands quivering with fright. A panicked whine started to rise from his throat, growing in volume as he began to search for any sign of his old room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovements frantic, Sonic ran over to his closet, throwing the doors wide. His terrified whine squeaked out into nothingness as he was presented with a wardrobe fit for a Disney princess. Where his shoes and gloves once were, a variety of hyper-feminine women's clothing was arranged in long rows of blinding pink frills and ethereal white lace. Hands shaking, he rustled through the frilly garments, searching for any sign of the room he knew or his famous shoes, socks and gloves. Where they were usually placed, he found only a pair of pink kitten heels, a pair of opaque white tights, and some frilly gloves that would have looked at home on a southern belle. Panic, now mixed with disgust, made him pull back from the closet, retreating with faltering steps as if the foreign clothes would attack him.</span></div></div>",

Upon opening it, Sonic was greeted with the staircase to his room he had known for years, but it was now painted a delicate shade of pink, its handrails decorated with fake flowers and pink ribbon. The wallpaper of the adjacent wall, once a simple blue, was a pink damask nightmare, somehow even girlier than he had feared. From his view down the stairs, it looked like the rest of the house was likewise remodeled for a preteen princess, every previously masculine or gender-neutral element now frilled, floral, or painted pink. Heart beating so fast he felt like it was going to explode, Sonic made his way down the stairs, his grip on the feminized handrail weakened by how much his hand was shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he saw who was standing in the living room, his heart sank. Before he could consider any other course of action, Sonic blurted out, \"W-what's going on?\", voice a trembling mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Who was there?</b></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sonic's question hung in the air, its quivering fear still palpable. Amy Rose, her usual dress exchanged for a simple combination of jeans and sweater, stood across the room, staring at Sonic's collection of photographs of friends and family arranged on the newly feminine mantelpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic hesitated at the foot of the stair, his heart-rate only increasing with each moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not here.\" Her voice was a soft murmur, gentle and calm in sharp contrast to her usual hyperactive squeaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The photos. I'm not in any of them.\" There was something about her voice that was far more terrifying to Sonic than any roar or scream. She was talking like someone just waking from a dream, only half-conscious and less-than-half interested in what was actually happening. \"Sonic, why don't you have a picture of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I, uh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to look at him. Sonic's heart dropped to his stomach. Her eyes weren't sad so much as they were empty. She looked like every ounce of her naivety had been torn away in an instant, and the only thing that remained was her understanding of just how badly she had been used. He tried to step away, but his legs wouldn't listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to love you, Sonic. You knew that.\" The hurt in her voice turned Sonic's stomach into slush. What the hell was going on? Did she do this? Was she another victim? She gestured to the mantelpiece, the movement lacking any sort of anger but dripping with something he felt could be pity. \"Not a single photo. You didn't even answer any of my letters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic stood in silence, knees shaking, mouth open but unable to think of anything to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moment of silence, Amy turned back to the photos, gently lifting one off of the mantel. He knew it well. It was a picture of him and Knuckles at the beach, waving at the camera with confident grins. Amy had asked to come, like she always did. Sonic, fear growing, remembered with perfect detail how he laughed at her and sped off, glancing back to see her standing teary-eyed. \"Things have changed, Sonic. I'm... different.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's heart seized up as Amy turned to look at him, photo turned so that he could see it. Where he expected to see himself and Knuckles, he saw only Knuckles, sitting alone. \"W-wha-\" The picture changed again, and now Knuckles was gone as well. Sonic's mouth opened wider as his eyes bulged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to change things, Sonic. I can make it right, all of it. I can do it all, now.\" Amy, looking directly at Sonic, let go of the photograph's frame. It smashed to the floor with the sound of glass shattering, but when Sonic looked down, there was only the photo, now blank. \"I can do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic tried to step back, speak, do anything, but his body refused, leaving him stationary and silent as he trembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're never going to save anyone again, Sonic. You won't have to. I've taken care of Eggman. I've taken care of all of them. You're not a hero, Sonic. Not anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell is she talking about?</i> If he had been able to move, Sonic would have called her crazy, but here he was staring at her in paralyzed awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never were. No, not really. What sort of hero lets his lover's heart break, over, and over, and over? What sort of hero lets you chase him, but never tells you it won't work, never tells you there was no chance in the first place? Lets you live your life in worship?\" Amy's voice stayed calm, but Sonic saw hurt blossom in her eyes. If he could use his vocal cords, he would have begun to whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could make you love me. I could make you feel for me what I used to feel for you.\" She paused, looking down at the blank photo. It vanished, reappearing in her hand, unhurt and now once again in the frame. The picture was no normal, except that once again only Knuckles could be seen. \"You don't deserve it.\" She looked up at him, the hurt in her eyes growing cold and calculating. \"And even if you did, I could never look at you like that again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the picture back on the mantel. Sonic shivered when he realized that all of the other pictures were now likewise devoid of his presence. A slight whimper managed to escape through his frozen lips, hinting to the thoughts behind his widened eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Sonic, I'm not going to kill you. If I chose to, I could, but I am making things right. I am fixing things. No, you are going to be punished. Severely, yes, but in accordance with your crime.\" Sonic's whimper grew louder, straining against his paralysis as his eyes grew even wider and his knees threatened to buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used me, Sonic. You played with me. I wasted years. I was a little girl when it started. You <i>played</i> with me. Treated me like a novelty, a pet. You fed my addiction, always taking care to break my heart just when I was felt our love was perfect.\" The hurt was back, simmering in her eyes. For the first time it had escaped to her voice, making the syllables of 'played' a knife in Sonic's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to see how it feels. See how it hurts. You're going to spend every hour of your life obsessing, pleading, chasing. You're going to be a lovesick girl. You're going to swoon, beg, cry at the sight of your lover. We'll start with a year. A year of dresses, boys, the things you made me think about. After that, I'll decide if you deserve more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sonic could move. He backed away as fast he could, hands in front of his face as if he could protect himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No running.\" Her eyes glittered with disgust, their shine hardening in disapproval at his attempt at escape. He froze in place, once again a trembling statue. \"You're going to act this part, Sonic. Walk like a woman. Move like one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic, free again, took another faltering step back, lowering his hands down to his waist and drawing his elbows in, just as Rouge and Amy did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Go upstairs and get dressed. I'll be waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic moved up the stairs as quickly as he could while maintaining the feminine posture his body now required. When he was in his room, he broke down and cried, curling into a ball on the floor. What the hell happened? Was she even Amy? She talked like some sort of robot, but her eyes were definitely alive. What was he going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer command rung in his head. Get dressed. He glanced over at the closet, its doors wide open to display the fashion nightmare inside. When searching for his clothes, he had seen a variety of different styles, all united by their femininity but ranging from cute to sexual. The thought of wearing anything from inside there disgusted him, but if she was serious he needed to get dressed before she got any more upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up slowly, wiping tears from his eyes as he looked around the room, noting all of the horrifying changes he had missed in his previous panic. Where his racing trophies had previously stood on their stands, an ornate vanity now filled up the wall. Frilly and puffy curtains, their appearance alone enough to make him feel nauseous, hung around his window, matching the design of his girly bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill sniffling, he moved towards the-</span></div></div>",

He watched in horror, unable to stop hs body, which did exactly as Amy had bidden him. Yet even as he began to dress himself, his mind was occupied by her statement that he would be a girl. Was that true? She seemed to be altering reality around herself, maybe she could really do that..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's fingers gripped a bra, and wrapped it around his chest, fixing it in place. It hung loosely, hinting of things to come... making him gulp in terror. Once the bra was in place, he grabbed a corset, adding that to himself as well. It seemed to tie itself, pulling itself tight and squeezing his midriff in a way he never expected it would, leaving him sort of breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole ensemble was white, with soft pink frills, and looking at himself, he just wanted to curl up and die... But his body walked over to the kitten heels placed neatly by his bed, and stepped into them, strutting with a disturbing amount of grace as he returned to the closet, and his fingers closed on the pink nightmare that would be his new dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tight and form-fitting for a girl of his age, with a wide skirt that reached close to his knees. White frills encircled the hem, while the whole thing was starched to stick out. The top part of the dress had a low neckline, which would've exposed his cleavage, if he had any, with frills around that, too. A flower pattern covered the chest, with a pink, heart-shaped gemstone in the centre of the petals. Puff-ball sleeves covered her arms, with frills around the base of them. A large bow rested on the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Sonic pulled on the long gloves she'd seen earlier. <i>He'd</i> seen earlier. He wasn't a girl.

He was waiting for the doctors to return so they can finally start the procedure, and he had to stay in bed. He only just stared up at the ceiling while hoping that this will be over with. He then just looked out the opened door out of boredom and saw random people going down the hall. However, Sonic recognized one of the patients that passed by. He then shouted out, \"Amy?\" Amy in a hospital gown turned around and saw Sonic. In her usual fangirl mode, she immediately dash to her hero. \"Oh, it's nice to see you Sonic!\" \"Amy stop! I can't breathe!\" Amy then let go of her grip, as Sonic coughed hoarsely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sonic, what are you doing here?\" she asked. \"Well, I'm getting my tonsils removed today so I'm just waiting here until the doctors return. By the way, why are you here?\" Amy suddenly blushed and got nervous. \"W-well, I'm getting surgery too. I'm receiving breast implants.\" Sonic turned all shocked at this. \"Implants?! But why?\" \"Well, I...I wanted to know what it'll be like to have bigger boobs, and I wanted to look more, um, pretty..\" she said while blushing in embarrassment. \"If you're doing this for me, you don't have to. You look fine as you are.\" Amy blushed deeply yet again, \"Thanks Sonic, but I'm doing this because I want to. I think I'll go back to my room now. Bye!\" \"Bye!\" Sonic replied back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic waited for about half an hour til finally a doctor came in with a syringe. Sonic then gulped a bit at the sight of the needle. The doctor then plunged the needle into Sonic's shoulder and injected anesthetics into his bloodstream. \"The operation will begin shortly. Just relax while the drug do its work, and you'll be out like a light.\" Sonic just replied with a nod as he suddenly felt woozy and drowsy. After about a couple of minutes or so, he was out like a light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some moments later, Sonic was now in the recovery room still knocked out. After a about 15 minutes, the drug was wearing off. Sonic stirred a bit in his bed trying to wake up. While moving in bed, he felt some heavy weight on his chest for some reason.

He went inside and saw many shelves with toys, books, clothes, and other kinds knickknacks and antiques. He took his time examining and browsing the many items on the shelves until he found something of interest. It was pretty old, looking like it was dated centuries ago yet still held it good condition, it was very thick and looked heavy, seeming to contain about a thousand pages or so. The title was simply called 'The Genderbook' and Sonic started to skim through it only to realize that nearly all the pages were blank! He then went back to the page that was right after the title page, and found a rule stating, \"You can change a person's gender by writing down their NAME:____ and write GENDER:______. You can also control the rate of change by simply adding INSTANT (fast change) or GRADUAL (slow change) next to it.\" There were other rules for changing age, height, body mass, breast size and etc. Sonic was deeply intrigued by this and decided to buy it and it was really cheap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter purchasing the book and feeling really eager to try it out, Sonic then dash home and headed to his room. He sat on his bed while opening the book, and grabbed a pencil that was on his nightstand. He wrote down NAME:____ and GENDER:_____ as the rules stated. Though he still don't know who to test it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does he test it on?</span></div></div>",

Well, at Sonic's local drug store at least as most of the medicine ran out. Though what was left were some pills for allergies, and some cold/fever/pain relieving medication, which what he really needed yet it was for women only. The box was pink with a picture of pink pills on it which definitely screamed girly product as it is. The reasons for being it women only were that it not only suppress the symptoms, but also helps with menstruation cycles and other things that apply to women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic decided to buy it since despite being for women only, it can help with his cold of course so it wouldn't hurt for a guy to try it, right? He also rather have this cold gone now, than to wait for more medication and staying in bed while using up tons of tissues for weeks. Sonic purchased the pills and headed straight on home to his apartment. It was on the second floor of an apartment complex, and filled with a kitchen in the same place as the living room, a master bedroom located in the back, a guestroom, two bathrooms (one in the master bedroom and one in the hall connecting that connected the living room and master bedroom), and a living room. He then opened the box, and took out two capsules from the packaging. He checked the back of the box reading the directions about how he needs to take pills about every 4-6 hours, and the side effects about drowsiness and other things that he didn't finished reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then popped the pills into his mouth and drank a cup of water to help it go down smoothly. After a couple minutes, he suddenly felt drowsy. \"Whoa, those pills' effects worked faster than I thought.\" Sonic said to himself. He then went to his room, the master bedroom, to sleep. Not knowing certain changes when he awakes.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of changes will he experience?</span></div></div>",

While she'd initially been very confused by her new form, she now embraced it. She sat at her vanity table, brushing through the soft locks of golden hair that had once been stiff quills- they still had a similar shape, but they were useless for fighting and really just a hairstyle. She applied her makeup, and dressed in her Eggman Empire uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman had watched her conversion with growing delight, first her steady acceptance of his care, then her growing to love her new creature comforts, then her embracing her new feminity, and most importantly, the day she had strode into his throne room, proudly wearing her uniform, proclaiming her allegiance to her Master, and calling herself \"Sophia.\"</span></div></div>",

He walked over to a holographic screen and on it it showed four anthros with bored expressions, munching on some pizza. \"I don't see your point sir.\" The small alien said impatiently.  \"I've been watching these four.

He tosses the package to the couch and gets a drink, setting it at the edge of the table and moving the package there. \"It better be worth my nap...\" he grabs the package, tearing the paper to shreds and stopping as he sees just what's inside, staring for almost a full minute. \"Who'd send me panties?\" he questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has a feeling this isn't a prank even Knuckles or Shadows would do, just by the look of them the garments would be unnecessarily expensive for a joke.

They feel a bit tight, but comfortable. \"Interesting...\" the hedgehog rubs himself through the panties, and finds himself calling his friend and stalker, Amy Rose, without realizing it.

May I ask if you had another reason to come here?\" she gives him a quizzical look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles, \"Oh yeah, I was going to see about an application, but the same guy told me you wouldn't be hiring unless someone quit.\" Sonic starts to walk off, and the girl stops him. \"Hold on!\" she calls, and Sonic returns in a flash. \"Yeah?\" he knows what she's going to say, but she goes ahead and says \"Julie quit this morning, as a matter of fact. Fill out this...\" she slides him an application, \"And then go down to H.R, down this hall, make a left, then the door at the end.

Honestly it was better than most of the other beds she'd ever had. She noticed a treadmill in the corner, along with a TV screen and a bookshelf. She was surprised that Eggman would provide entertainment for her, but decided not to question it, and have a look at what was on offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the books seemed to be Eggman Empire propaganda, as did everything on the TV. Still, it was better than sitting and moping, maybe she cold have some fun mocking the content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic cued up a channel and sat back to watch.</span></div></div>",

Sally was her friend and she loved her, but she too was unhappy with the actions of her father, and very much an exception to the rule. Eggman taking over had brought her and her friends together too... Maybe it was a good thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fought GUN a lot too, and it wasn't like GUN were the most righteous people around. They'd committed many horrible crimes, and been a pain in Sonic's own backside on numerous occasions. It wasn't like his enemies were exactly heroic. Perhaps Eggman was right to fight them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was the smartest man on the planet... Maybe Tails had more intelligence, but he didn't exactly have the drive to use it. Eggman did, and if someone was going to rule the world, it should be the smartest, the best, not just whoever was rich enough, or born into the right family... There was some merit to Eggman's rule...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis forces had all been equal opportunity legions... Mobian, human, and robot working in harmony for a common goal... It was more than could be said for other nations... Bringing people together equally could hardly be a bad thing, could it...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, his actions had done good... He had united the warring nation of Chun-Nan, with his legion accepting people regardless of their clan, and proving very popular with this method. There was proof positive that he could be the great leader he fancied himself as, and help the people that needed it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven she was benefitting from his kindness! Even though she had been his hated enemy, he was now providing her with a comfy outfit, a cozy, almost luxurious bedroom, and he was going to feed her, when he could've shoved her in a cell and locked her up for hours of testing. He was even researching her transformation and caring for her while they both awaited the results...</span></div></div>",

Due to her changed body, and lack of natural abilities, she was completely helpless! All she was doing was making herself even hornier and dripping over the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any sort of word, the grabby hand carried her over to a metal opening in the wall, and lazily tossed her in, shutting the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sonic was recovering from her horny enhanced dazed state, the conveyor belt she was on moved down its track, soon stopping and hoisting her up with so she was on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red light scanned over her for about a minute before deciding upon her form. With a DING! A hole opened up in the ceiling, and a shiny, silvery liquid fell on top of Sonic, much to her struggles. It snaked its way all over Sonic's womanly body, even forcibly entering through her mouth, nose, butt, and pussy, making sure it covered every inch of her body, inside and out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly after the liquid set into place, it started transforming the hedgehog. Turning her skin into a perfect and shiny steal, her elbows, knees, ankles, wrists, and shoulders all turned into joints to better help with her movement. Her feet forcibly shaped in the style of High Heels, coloring themselves a shiny red. Her boobs and behind were a special metal, made to perfectly replicate her perfect Boobs and Ass, soft and squishy, overloaded with Pleasure censors, much like her now Sex Doll-like pussy, now being a simple entrance way, with a tube leading to a storage tank for any cum she would collect. What became of her mouth also lead to the tank, her throat converted to a tube leading to it! These liquid would be used to act as fuel for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Lips with puffy and soft, and her mouth interior was installed with state of the art Taste Receptors, letting her taste and identify what was put into her. Her vocal cords were replaced by a speech box, equipped with a special, especially slutty and arousing voice, programmed in such a way, only certain things could be said from her. No free speech for this drone! Her eyes were a simple black screen, with green pupils inside of them, her eyes forced in a half shut position. What became of her brain was now a state of the art Eggman Branded AI Module &amp; Storage System.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll complete with a proud Eggman Logo, permanently a part of her backside, just above her perfect ass and exterior entrance hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Physical Conversion into Whore-Bot tm complete!\"</span> the voice said as Sonic was coming to her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"> <span class=\"cppink\">\"Whore-Bot Sonic horny!

So every year, he stayed inside and taped up his letterbox, making sure that none of her seventy-odd cards would reach him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when he heard a knock at the door, he feared the worst. He went over to the peephole and looked through, spotting a rather beleagured delivery man on the other side. He seemed to be holding a large bouquet of flowers. Roses, as per usual. Amy always gave him red ones, but these were pink... Maybe it wasn't from her? Deciding that it would be cruel to leave the man standing there, he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delivery for Miss Sonic the Hedgehog?\" The man drawled uninterestedly, looking at the clipboard in his other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, it's <i>Mister</i> Sonic the Hedgehog?\" Sonic prompted. He was both confused and a little insulted, that someone could mistake him for a girl, and that this man had apparently not heard of him, the world-famous hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sir. Probably a website glitch or a mis-written order.\" The delivery man replied, handing Sonic the flowers. \"Sign here please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic leaned the bouquet against his shoulder as he signed with his free hand. The man gave short thanks and quickly left the premises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, Sonic looked at the gift. The bouquet was huge, nearly the size of his head- Something Tails was keen to remind him was rather large- and all of the roses together smelled overpoweringly sweet. He took a look at the card, reading it carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'To my dearest Sonic,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoses are pink,<br>\r\nMy darling is blue,<br>\r\nBe my valentine,<br>\r\nBecause I love you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour secret admirer.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poem was cheesy, almost terrible. But it wasn't Amy's writing. It wasn't nearly flowery enough, and the \"I\"s were not dotted with hearts. This was actually from someone new... Or at least, someone he didn't know was crushing on him. He began running through the options... Rouge? Unlikely. Sally? Maybe, but she'd probably be more direct... Mina? He was fairly certain she was still with Ash. Blaze? Did they do interdimensional deliveries?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he wondered, he realised that the roses would need a vase, but he frowned a little. He wasn't sure if he wanted pink roses on display in his house. On the other hand, if his admirer was one of his female friends, they'd be insulted if he didn't. Deciding that he'd rather put up with Knuckles than break some girl's heart, he went to fetch a vase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he placed the bouquet in the vase, however, he...</span></div></div>",

So, he kept it on unzipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he looked at the pants, and decided that a baggy set of combat pants was probably the best way to go.

He only needed clothes really, no point in bothering with them, he thought. Just as he was turning away however, a little nagging idea in his head suggested that he shouldn't be so hasty, and some of the items might be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain he looked at the items, and eventually decided that he would at least see what they looked like. Digging around he found some fingerless black gloves, which he slipped over his hands absentmindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext his hands brushed up against a leather collar, quite wide and featuring large metal spikes pointing outwards. At the front of the collar, a small tag hung, such as dog would have to show their name. This tag however showed only a small picture of what looked like a cartoon ghost. He felt it over on his hands, it certainly suited the style of clothing in the wardrobe, and seemed to be something the owner of all this clothing might possibly wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason Sonic couldn't take his eyes off the collar, the leather felt so soft, and the spikes were really shiny, it looked the perfect size for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic caught a glance of himself in a nearby window, the blackness outside made his reflection clear, and so he looked upon himself. Here he was, in some abandoned house, wearing clothing that made him look like a mall Goth. His huge platform boots peaked out from the baggy combat pants he wore, and the chains dangling from the pants rattled and clinked together when he moved, his t-shirt was too small for him, and his hoodie couldn't be zipped up. Yet, his appearance didn't seem to bother him, indeed he was quite liking the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attention returned to the collar, he had come this far, and he might not get the chance to try something like this again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Sonic passed the collar around his neck, and snapped it into place. It felt so comfortable, and looked so perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his head the ghost was delighted, the collar greatly amplified the ghosts abilities, and signalled Sonic's acceptance as a host.

The tables and chair were all dusty and shabby looking, and a large mirror covered the entire length of one wall. Moving quickly through the room, Tails stopped suddenly when he caught movement out of the corner of his eye. Looking around carefully, he almost jumped when he spotted his reflection looking back at him in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails laughed to himself, it was only the mirror! He approached for a closer look, brushing cobwebs aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis reflection seemed different somehow, kind of more appealing, like a better version of himself. As he continued to watch, the reflection began to change, becoming more feminine and shapely. Clothes appeared on the body, a ripped leather jacket, knee high boots and a tartan skirt. Next the face darkened with makeup and ear, nose and lip piercings faded into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was at a loss to explain what he was seeing, why did he like the reflection in the mirror so much, why did it seem so fitting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails heard a soft voice speak in his ear \"Do you like what you see?\". Totally mesmerised Tails could only nod dumbly in approval. The soft voice continued \"We can help, if you only ask...\"      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tails gaze travelled down, from the spiky black hair, to the ears filled with piercings, and onto the large nose and lip rings. Still loving the feeling, he took in the small black t-shirt and ripped leather jacket, combined with a tartan miniskirt. Still captivated, he finally noticed the huge boots and fishnet stockings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stared in wonder, he realised that he still needed to complete the transformation, to achieve the perfect image he had been shown. The Archdevil still held him securely, and began to whisper to him again. \"Do you like it...wouldn't it be nice to complete the process...all you need to do is ask, and show your devotion to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was captivated by the image staring back, and the soft embrace of the Archdevil. \"Please, complete it...please help me...I'm yours...\" He drawled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ghost floated past, carrying a spiked leather collar, not dissimilar to the one around the Archdevils host's neck. \"A token of my esteem.\" She whispered softly \"Wear it with pride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails slowly reached and grasped the collar, and quickly passed it around his neck, snapping the buckle into place. The Archdevil smiled evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails felt light headed as the changes began to overtake his body, his face became softer and more feminine in appearance, while his legs began to grow longer and curvier. His arms and hands became dainty, his waist pulled in, and his chest began to expand, rapidly filling the new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tails came round and looked in the mirror, a goth girl stared back, a perfect replica of the image first glimpsed in the mirror originally. The new girl turned to face the Archdevil, and knelt before her. \"How may I serve you my Mistress?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Archdevil smiled at her new servant, \"I have selected you to help me in a most important task, I need you to become a demonic host.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails felt a flash of excitement pass through her body, the chance to have her body enslaved and used for a demons bidding filled her with a twisted pleasure.   </span></div></div>",

This did not stop the process, and they continued to expand further and further until the tube top began to tear, leaving the breasts contained by the fishnet and the remains of the tube top. Sonic gasped in pleasure as piecings appeared in the nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms and hands became smaller and dainty, as muscle mass was removed.

From the bottom-rung Badniks and rubber-clad organic drones (Mobians and humans encased in latex suits that hid their identities, brainwashed into mindless anonymity), to the more high-ranking robots and Legionnaires, and even some willing allies, all of whom glanced at her appearance in surprise. Some of them looked a little aroused, while others seemed to find the whole thing very amusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at the slaves, the Mobians who had their free will stolen from them, she felt something start to grow within her. A need to be like them. It was hard to believe, and harder to explain, but she almost wanted them to do that to her, to dull her mind until she couldn't think straight anymore, then suit her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching from above, Eggman grinned madly, spotting the Eggpawn carry her toward the factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile letting Sonic submit herself to the droids was amusing, her conversion into a slave wouldn't be as satisfying without his own personal input. He wanted to aid the process, shape Sonic into the perfect servant. Of course he could let her just get turned into any old drone, and he couldn't lie, that would certainly be amusing, but he felt that the destruction of his nemesis needed more of a personal touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a seat in his office, the mad doctor activated the Eggpawn's override. The droid paused, then turned on its heel and began marching toward his office instead. Sonic wasn't sure where she was being taken now. Could robots get lost? Or was there something else happening? She hoped it wouldn't be bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her relief, and even delight, the robot soon arrived outside Eggman's main office.

Being at the mercy of her enemies sent a tingling sensation down her spine, and she relished it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's attention was pulled back to her current situation as she progressed deeper into the Badnik processing machine. Sonic had always had nightmares about being captured and imprisoned inside a Badnik, but now that it was about to happen, she felt a odd sense of peace and relaxation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no time to think further as she was curled up tightly, and held securely. She couldn't see, but could feel the Badnik shell slowly being built around her. Eventually the process was completed, and Sonic's vision returned as the Badnik's optical sensors came online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn access door opened on the Badnik processing machine, and a new Crabmeat Badnik scuttled out slowly. Inside, Sonic watched as she took her place alongside the other Badniks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic had always pitied those animals unfortunate enough to become Badniks, even for a short while. But now she had experienced it, she decided that she had been mistaken. Her Badnik was comfortable, safe, and she didn't have to worry about anything anymore. Sonic sensed the Badnik programming melding with her mind, and felt the irresistible urge to obey. Being a lowly minion was so easy, orders were passed down, and you simply obeyed. It felt so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Crabmeat scuttled off slowly, ready to help the other Badniks to capture more animals. Sonic settled in to her new home, particularly enjoying the slow speed she was travelling at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknown to the hedgehog girl, the green hill zone began to slowly fade away, replaced with the blank metal walls of Eggman's building. This was a simulation area, Eggman could create any location or item he required temporary. It was normally used to test his inventions and plans, today it had another purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was awoken from her peaceful bliss as the Crabmeat fell apart, dumping her on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and dusted herself off, and looking down at the remains of the Badnik, several emotions washed over her. She was on one hand, embarrassed that she had let herself be captured, but on the other, she had for some reason, somehow <i>enjoyed </i> the experience. She stared at the Badnik for one last time, not without a tinge of regret that her time as a Badnik had been so short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large screen flicked into life in front of her, and was swiftly filled with Eggman's grinning form. Sonic felt compelled to pay close attention to the doctor, and another feeling swelled up inside her body, was that almost admiration? She quickly dismissed the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you passed the first test, well done!\" The doctor laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for the next one?\" He asked, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic thought carefully, and found herself looking back at the smashed Crabmeat, which for some reason excited her so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or would you prefer something else maybe?\" Eggman probed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At one end sat Eggman, protected by a glass screen. Sonic remembered this being a tough fight, but she had prevailed in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time however, she considered that the outcome would most likely have to be different. Certainly if she wanted to pass Eggman's test, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the chamber, Eggman's voice cracked over the loudspeaker system. \"Surrender the emeralds, and I'll take you to your friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Sonic gathered up the six emeralds she had, and placed them on the floor in front of Eggman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman for his part, smiled cruelly, while the glass screen withdrew. \"Good girl.\" He said. \"Now follow me.\" He commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Sonic felt a tingle of pleasure roll down her spine when Eggman had praised her, it felt so good to be praised and to submit wilfully.

Eventually they came to a wider area, and found Tails held securely in a glass tube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman spoke again. \"Here is your friend, safety held. Since you were so happy to let me have the chaos emeralds, maybe you would like me to look after Tails?\" Eggman asked. \"I promise he'll be happy as a Badnik slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA monitor screen displayed a Badnik version of Tails, the model spinning slowly. The feelings Sonic had experienced when she was a Badnik came rushing back, the pleasure and comfort of being a lowly slave...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo pass the test, Sonic knew she would have to give Tails up. She didn't however expect it to feel like this, she almost wanted Tails to be a Badnik, she knew he would enjoy it, just as she had. Another thought flashed through her mind, what if she was captured by Badnik Tails? Then forced to join him as a Badnik? She shuddered inwardly, but not with fear, but with some sort of twisted desire.

A short while later, a Badnik entered the room from another doorway. Catching the light, Sonic noticed it was the Tails Badnik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman spoke to her again. \"Well done!\" He praised. \"You will find the next test through that door over there.\" He said, extending an arm outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic shuffled forwards, then looked back, staring at the Badnik her best friend was now trapped inside.

Or perhaps it was her duty to steal the Master Emerald and put the Death Egg back in the sky? Maybe both would suffice... And of course, tricking the echidna into becoming a Badnik and then submitting to the process herself, as was usually the rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his control room, Eggman watched and grinned. THe previous trials had led Sonic by the nose somewhat. He presented her with fairly obvious solutions, and let her go from there. However, with each of the tests, he'd gradually made it a little less clear. It was making the captive hedgehog actively think about ways she could please him, forcing her to act in his favour on her own accord.</span></div></div>",

Venturing inside she found various Egg-mobiles, each fitted with various tools. She remembered these! There was the flame mobile that set fire to the trees, the freeze spraying one, and the depth charge dropping one!

So far she had been made to see how her former life had caused so many problems for Eggman, and forced to atone for these actions by righting the wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear noises up ahead, so she set off down the street, not realizing that she was moving in an increasing slower and suggestive manner as the challenges progressed. As the hedgehog progressed, she began to feel a little strange, like she noticed a presence, it was a little familiar, but something she couldn't quite remember, like she had forced the memory from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding the corner of the street, she noticed something she hoped never to see again, Dark Gaia's minions!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver ran down her spine, that explained the strange feeling she was having, the evil of these creatures seemed to have a force of its own, spreading dread and fear to anyone close enough. It seemed that Eggman had some means of generating these creatures, in small numbers anyway. Sonic reasoned it wasn't too unexpected, since he had ample time to study them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bimbo considered her next move, back when she had fought these creatures, they had been in the service of Eggman. Yet she had destroyed them, was this the wrong she was to correct?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that there was only one way to find out, she waited while the creatures slowly advanced towards her, there were several Nightmares, their stronger cousins Deep Nightmares, an assortment of the smaller creatures, and even a Dark Master. There would be little chance of her defeating them in a battle, so she hoped that she had made the correct choice! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one of the Nightmares approached her, the feeling of dread seemed to start to melt away, to be replaced with something else, like a soft voice deep in her mind, promising to help ease her worries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thought entered her head, she had once been filled with Dark Gaia energy herself, and it had taken all her strength to resist.

Once outside the pod, the door closed again, trapping the remaining prisoners inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails could not spot the crazy doctor anywhere, but he did notice that the Roller grasping him was behaving a bit oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">&gt;&gt;Suitable target acquired.</span><br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><br>\r\n&gt;&gt;Begin installation procedure...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn access port opened on the Roller, and Tails finally noticed what was about to happen. Unfortunately for the fox, the Badnik's grip was just too strong, despite his struggles he was slowly and relentlessly forced inside the access port. Tail's mind raced, a terrible nightmare was being realized, he was going to be trapped inside a Badnik!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the fox safety forced inside the chamber, the access port closed, trapping him. Sonic had fulfilled an important part of her new role as a Badnik, she had successfully betrayed and captured her former friend, and enslaved him to her Masters service. The fox would serve well as her organic battery, ensuring she was fully powered, better able to carry out Eggman's will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">&gt;&gt;Organic battery successfully installed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;Unit fully operational.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;Begin default program...listing objectives:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;Obey Master Eggman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;Protect Master Eggman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;Capture enemies for conversion.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Still, his head stopped swimming as Eggman walked over, petting the strangely-coloured Roller on the head as he did so... Tails wasn't sure why, but those colours... he knew they should mean something, but he wasn't sure what...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you want, Eggman?\" He asked, looking up at the mad scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I want? What about what you want, fox boy? I'm betting at this moment, you'd like to crawl back inside that Roller and curl up, wouldn't you?\" He smirked. Tails gulped, cheeks flushing brightly at the madman's words. \"I don't blame you, Tails... I designed this new generation of Badniks with user comfort in mind... It's okay to admit that you want to be contained within one now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! No, I don't!\" He protested, as much to his own desires as to Eggman. The human simply shook his head, enjoying the boy's helpless resistance. \"I don't want to be a Badnik!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you will... I think you might already want it... but once you've been inside one of my new Badniks, not only will your mind become more and more like that of a good, brainless Badnik, but gradually, your body will be remodeled into a Badnik shell yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you've got not chance of getting me back into that think now that you've told me that!\" Tails yelled. True, the urge to snuggle up in a Badnik like a good slave was strong, but knowing that such a grisly fate awaited him if he did was more than enough to overpower that feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have. At this point, the gloating is more for my benefit... by the time I let you off that table, you won't remember this conversation... You see, Tails... your mind is a very valuable thing. As much as I am loathe to admit it, your intellect rivals my own. And that brilliant, brilliant brain is something I can't afford to lose... so I'm going to give you a little bit of a <i>brain drain</i>, and once that's sorted, the fun can really begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tails could protest any further, a helmet landed on her head, a visor covering her eyes. It was wired into one of the mad doctor's computers, as he strode over to it and warmed the device up. \"Oh, and before you go, Tails... your new Roller buddy used to be just like you... before she went through the same process that you're about to... She used to be Sonic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorror filled Tails, for just a moment, before the helmet warmed up and his thoughts went numb. Memories and knowledge washed away, pulled out of his mind and into Eggman's computer. It was as if the scientist and pulled the drain plug out of his brain, and now his years of experience and learning were flushing down the sink. And the strangest part was that it felt good! It flooded his addled brain with the same warm, fuzzy, comfortable feeling that being trapped inside the Roller- inside Sonic, he thought with a slight giggle- had given him. A dumbstruck smile appeared on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggman watched and laughed... he was going to have fun turning the fox into a bimbo. Maybe he'd even keep the result around as a pet for a while, before shoving her into a Badnik for the transformation! Still, as he monitored the screen, it was clear that the sum total of Tails' intellect and most of his relevant memories were now his. The fox on the table was little more than an average teenager in intelligence and experience now... Save for a growing desire for life as a Badnik...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was certainly a potent foe for any of her Master's enemies, and she considered if she would make a good Slicer for her Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her right, she noticed a Coconuts Badnik bouncing around. These Badnik's always seemed to have so much fun! Maybe she could have fun as a Coconuts too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front a Octus twirled its limbs, hovering for a short while. These octopus Badniks were so cute! The fox girl fawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a sharp pain in one of her tails, and spinning around quickly, came face to face with the Crawl that had cheekily nipped her tail. The bimbo found it impossible to be mad at the Badnik, as it was simply too adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails noticed that the Badniks were starting to close in on her, it seemed that her time was quickly running out, and she would soon be safely imprisoned, serving as an organic battery to her new Badnik owner. It was simply a matter of waiting to see who claimed her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, a Buzzer swept down from the sky, its stinger opening up into a grab, and seizing the fox girl securely. As the Buzzer lifted off with its captive, Tails admired the sleek design of the Badnik she would soon be imprisoned inside, she made no attempt to resist as the Buzzer flew away with her. It seemed that the Badnik needed to land before installing its organic battery, as it soon did. Tails' heart rate quickened, as excitement gripped her body, this was it, soon she would be safety encased inside a Badnik shell, reduced to a power supply for a mindless slave.

Though it was tempting to send her out into the world on patrol, especially since her brainwashing had been so forceful thather friends likely wouldn't be able to break her free even if they recaptured her, and even if they did, she wouldn't be able to defeat him with her useless bimbo body... he had another idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, he was a scientist, and his curiosity was one thing that could never be quelled. Simply knowing that Sonic had been converted into a Badnik was not enough. He had to observe the process. After all, if there was one downside to the process, it was that Sonic was no more dangerous or effective than a common Roller now. Whereas before, she had been strong enough to break apart his armies, now she would be just a single cog in that great machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, though, by observing the conversion step-by-step, in a controlled environment with no chance of losing her, he could see if there was a happy medium somewhere along the line. A hybrid of the Badnik's perfect obedience and ability to convert others into more of itself, and the devastating power its former self once wielded. A sort of \"Super-Badnik\". True, it was too late for Sonic, and seeing the complete change would mean the same for Tails, but if he got the procedure worked out, he could easily subject Shadow, Knuckles, and any of his foes' powerful allies or enemies to the same process. He could even abduct that obnoxious green Sonic and his conniving Tails-analogue if he felt the need to have a Sonic and Tails among his Super-Badniks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he was getting ahead of himself. Until he saw exactly how the Badnik's internal roboticizer converted its victims, he couldn't know if such a hybrid was even possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the matter of Tails' absorbed thoughts. The fox's memories and knowledge were something he had specifically made sure to absorb... but actually getting his computer to read them properly was hard. It, being a fairly unintelligent and non-sentient machine, was struggling to properly interpret the non-linear and non-logical thought patterns of a living being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a demon of his own creation. He'd tried making intelligent robots in the past- Mecha Sonic, Metal Sonic, Brutus, Gemerl, and so on, but they had all betrayed him. Some of them thought they could do his job better than he could, some were a little too much like him, and the clash of egos had resulted in a schism, some simply had their own goals and used him as a means to further that. As a result, he'd sworn off intelligent machines for a while, and most of his subsequent builds were dull-witted and sycophantic. Loyal, and not smart enough to betray him, but at the same time, rock-stupid. He'd finally realised the problem with this after his failure with Mecha Sally. He'd, for a moment, had the brightest tactical mind completely slaved to his will, and he'd used her as a glorified attack dog. What's more, her close proximity to Sonic during most of her missions allowed him to eventually capture her, whereas if she'd been kept in his lair as a tactician, under several layers of mind control, he might've still had her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd once again started working on smart robots, but so far, he'd had little success making them smart in a useful way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alarm snapped him from his thoughts. Another incursion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked the monitors, and sighed. A low-priority attack in a low-priority area. The robots in that district would handle it easily. It had distracted him though... working on his plans and doing administration at the same time wasn't easy... he wished there was a way to split the workload.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had he been thinking about, again? Oh, smart robots and Tails' memories, of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspiration struck, and Eggman grinned. If the issue was that he needed something to run his city, he needed a smart robot to understand Tails' absorbed knowledge and memories, why not solve both those problems with the same system... He could convert what he had of Tails into an AI. He'd been able to brainwash all of Tails with ease, let alone half of him! Better yet, he could fill in the gaps in the fox's knowledge with more loyalty to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Tails' body in her hovering tomb for a moment, he began to work on the computer, setting the programs to slowly build the AI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Badnik had been chosen well, it was the closest of all his designs to mimicking Sonic's actual abilities, and thus would be the easiest transition for both the physical and mental aspects of the change. Not only would the Badnik's attacks slot nicely into the little bimbo's muscle memory, but she already favoured the same ball attacks as her new shell anyway. It was the simplest possible conversion for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, even a change that quick would take time, and he wasn't overconfident enough to just let his new creation roll off and get popped open by a Freedom Fighter before she was done turning into his newest pet. If that happened, they might actually be able to free her, and then this whole plan would've gone to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, the best option was to simply keep her by his side until such a time that the shell had done its work and she could be properly deployed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, without the necessary battle experience to aid her conversion, something might've gone wrong, so he shoved her into the simulator again, leaving her to spend hour after hour, day after day, watching herself as a Roller, fighting for her Master and taking out all of his enemies with her rolling charges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it was time for the fallen hero to emerge from her mechanical cocoon. It had taken almost a week, with Eggman using his machines to lead the former Sonic's friends on a wild goose chase and make sure they never found a trace of the real Sonic, but the effort was worth it. Even seeing the glorious finalised form of his once-nemesis would be worth it, let alone getting to command her as his loyal minion. All that training and conditioning, all paying off in his newest slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he brought the Roller out of the training room, and opened the shell, eager to see what was inside.</span></div></div>",

Soon, he reigned supreme overthe whole planet. Any who resisted had shared Sonic's fate, but he had taken special delight in his treatment of Sonic's closest allies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them had been subjected to the same bimbotizing beam that Sonic had, and having the barely resisting sluts lined up in seats, watching a video feed of Sonic's conversion, just to rub salt into the wounds, had been more than satisfying after the long years of fighting and humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly two of their number had escaped this. He had noted Tails' intellect, and thought it too useful to destroy, so he took the fox, and broke him, warping him until, where the innocent, friendly boy had been, there now stood a busty, evil assistant. She worshipped her Master just as much as she had once worshipped Sonic. Her entire life was dedicated to assisting her Master in his scientific endeavours, aiding him in perfecting his machines, making sure he could never lose his grip on the slave population he had worked so hard to build up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had lasted for all of two days, before Eggman realised she was smarter than him, threw a fit, and drained her intellect entirely, adding it to his own. With Tails now just as much a bimbo has her friends, if not moreso, he considered sending her to be turned into a Badnik now, but truthfully, he didn't really need any more Badniks. So instead, he kept her in his throne room as a brainless pet, her gloves and boots now resembling paws (Rendering her hands completely useless), her control collar now more resembling that of a dog or cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Eggman had regretted one thing about losing track of Sonic, it was that he couldn't keep her as a trophy in his throne room. He had been forced to settle for the next-best thing: Princess Sally. True, Eggman didn't have the technology at point where he captured her, butit didn't take much more than a week to create, test, troubleshoot, and clear for use. During that time, the former royal had been locked in a darkened room, illuminated only by a large TV screen showing her Eggman Empire propaganda films, as the audio was blasted into her ears by the headphones she was forced to wear. Perhaps the old Sally might've resisted this, but under the effects of the Bimbotizer, she had little resistance left, and by day two,she was wholeheartedly believing everything she saw and heard, and singing along with the Empire's national anthem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he took her out of the room, she bowed, saluted, and pledged herself to obey him. He redressed her, not in the pink latex of a bimbo, but the more respectable standard uniform, before placing her on a golden pedestal, and commanding her to smile and salute. She obeyed, shouting \"All Hail Eggman!\" at the same time, before the machine activated and froze her body in that moment of obedient bliss for all eternity. He didn't know if she was still self-aware, and he didn't really care, but he knew that, if she did know what had happened to her, she'd be thanking him.</span></div></div>",

The main reason why she built it however was she came to the conclusion that the perfect life for her now was actually the life of a bimbo as the doctor would have no worries and would be taken care of for the rest of his days in bliss.

The Badnik's own mind, simple as it was, was linked directly to hers, and she spent all day being constantly exposed to the Badnik's own stream of consciousness, which was mainly an endless repeat of its most recent directive. Even if this hadn't driven her stir-crazy, Eggman had included a more vicious function in the droid shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of the apparatus connecting her to the Badnik shell was a pair of earbuds, through which constant pro-Eggman propaganda was played. Eggman didn't just want to break her, he wanted to ensure that she worshipped him, but even this was not enough for him. The records were laced with a subliminal message, worming its way into her brain as she mindlessly drank in the repeated messages about the glory of her Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt told her, simply, that she was a Crabmeat. She would always be a Crabmeat, because Master wanted her to be a Crabmeat. She had no desire to escape her fate. She had no life outside of being a Crabmeat.

He had been put on trial and found guilty with little argument or defence, and the nature of his punishment was yet to be decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one small consolation prize, however: The fate of Sonic. It was the only other story on the news, and it warmed his blackened heart every time he saw the once-great hero's condition.

She had looked him right in the eye and told him that, if Nicole couldn't fix Sonic's mind, the she would be sorely tempted to have him publically executed, and she had half a mind to carry it out herself.

Her tail pointed down and splitted in two. Her fur started turning blue color and fur grew on her arms with a flare pattern on her wrists like wave. The spines on her back melted, leaving it flat and clear. Her quills started fusing together and become wave's hairstyle. Her face turns feminine and starts resembling waves. Her mouth started turning a yellow gold and became a birds beak. She made a \"oof\"sound and noticed that her voice has changed to wave's voice and the changes were done. The only thing that didn't change was her eye color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic: wow l. Wave I think I really like this look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave: really? I'm actually glad you liked it. Ok. And do you think we should change your name? Like as if you are my sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic: sure. Call me... wind the swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave: alright wind. Give me a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave then reaches into her bag a piece pls put a blue version of her extreme gear, like it was made for wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave: ready to race?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWind: you bet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave and Wind then boarded their extreme gears and went to the finish line. After 3 seconds, the two take turns off and begin racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho won the race?</span></div></div>",

With a smile, he flipped it upwards, the lights to the factory all turned on with a humming sound, blinding Sonic for a moment as his eyes had to adjust to the sudden introduction of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sonic was recovering what was effectively a flashbang, the various faceless drones started to come to life around the factory, moving to their desired stations and starting up the various pieces of equipment, causing the various machines to make noises as they started up and got to work doing... whatever they were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sonic finally got done rubbing his eyes, he got a good look at the drones that moved on past him, paying him no mind, getting a better look at them in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all very basic when it come down to things. Thin metal bodies, colored differently to each other, though with no usual legs, instead, their \"Legs\" were just simple mounts for their wheel, which was a simple sphere that also allowed them to turn. Their faces were blank, being nothing but a black visor for eyes. The stand out feature of these drones however were the fact they were very much based off of a womanly body structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge spherical breasts were on their chest, and their midsection was thin. On their behind was a large bubble butt, with a port of some kind above it slightly. One of their hands was fashioned in the style of a crane-game styled hand, while the other was a tool of some kind, different between the drones. Screwdrivers, torches, brooms, they all had something different as their other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>CLAMP!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic flinched as he felt something latch onto his arm. he was distracted and quickly tried to yang his arm free, but there was no budge. He looked at the drone that had a hold of him, and it was exactly like all the others, aside from its other hand, which was a.. tablet of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">*ERROR!

Quickly enough, the drone reached its desired location and in a surprisingly strong fashion, tossed Sonic into the machine, the hatch closing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic landed on what felt like sand paper and groaned, trying to collect himself. As he got to a stand, he failed to notice the plethora of mechanical devices rushing towards him, ready to do their work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what will the machine turn Sonic into?</span></div></div>",

His waist turning impossibly thin as his hips widened out. His butt inflated many times over as his cock shriveled up and pulled itself inside his body, being replaced with the female equivalent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long after, large round boobs started to grow and inflate on his chest, causing a high pitched moan to escape her lips.

While a tight fit a first, the metals were successfully placed overtop her complete lower half and welded together seamlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP IT!

Her Vagina even extending outwards into a new port on her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her brain wasn't safe as it was simply converted to a simple data cell, which was already nearing its capacity.
