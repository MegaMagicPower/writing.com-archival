Even in just shorts and a tank top, it's almost unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up to you from the sidewalk is your sister, Nikki. She's about your height, with her brunette hair tied back in a big pony tail. A few strands of hair fall down on either side of her cute freckled face. Much like yourself, she's just in shorts and a tank top as well. As her flip flops slap the path up toward you, you notice something in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not your phone,\" you tease. She's always on her phone texting her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiles, \"Be nice. This is something you'll want to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe points it at a lawn gnome next to the steps. At first you think she's an idiot. What is it going to do? Shoot out a sticky dart or something? Then, with a strange beam that quakes the air it passes through, she hits the gnome and it shrinks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap up and stumble a bit over to your sisters side, \"Did you just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YUP! It's a size remote! I found it at an old warehouse downtown when I was skateboarding with my friends,\" Nikki explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of stunned silence you look at her, \"Really? Then where's your board?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki reaches into the pocket of her shorts and takes out a VERY tiny skateboard. It looks like a toy! But clearly, it's hers. Customized with all the graphics she stuck to it over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I?\" you ask, your voice quivering. You LOVE the idea of being shrunk. Or really just being small compared to someone else. Your sister knows that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wide grin Nicole passes you the remote, \"What do you think I'm showing you for? I'd like to play with it too, but well, I guess this is a way you can finally experience that weird fantasy of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShooting her a glare you comment, \"It's not weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you tell your girlfriend about it instead of me?\" Nikki replies with a snide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're nervous, that's why. What if she doesn't like it and dumps you? More importantly though, you could really have some fun now. You could be a bug at her feet. Or make her tower over the entire city!</span></div></div>",

Thanking Nikki again and giving her a long, uncomfortable hug in this heat, you take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't long before you travel across the neighborhood and get to Lauren's apartment. It's a smaller three story building that she lives in with her folks. To your surprise she's in the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hey, what are you doing here? Lauren asks, brushing back her chestnut brown hair. You've always loved that about her. Her hair is so long too. Thin, very straight, with a cute fluff of bangs. You stand there, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a moment as your mind processes the million ideas racing through it. \"Pardon?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour girlfriend bursts out laughing, \"You must have come over here for something! What's that in your pocket? Got a TV remote in there or are you just happy to see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe joke was cute, but you suddenly felt very self conscious. This was it. She'd pointed out the size remote. Sure, you could just brush it off as nothing. But it's why you came to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking Lauren straight in the eyes, you swallow hard. \"Can I... I can tell you anything, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes on a serious expression. \"Yeah of course. Everything is okay right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize you just awkwardly asked to talk to your girlfriend after she asked if you were turned on by her. \"No no, it's nothing bad between us! It's... well, you know how we've never discussed what I like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like, what you... 'like' like? Well yeah, because you think I can't take it,\" Lauren replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, who told you that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles, \"Your sister. We talk often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she didn't tell me. Go ahead, how crazy can it be?\" Lauren urges on. At the same time one of the other tenants goes walking by. A guy in a red striped polo shirt and jean shorts. Had he heard anything?</span></div></div>",

It hits the guy checking his mailbox and he instantly dwindles down to a couple inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're stunned,  Lauren is stunned, and the other tenant is VERY stunned now that he's down at these two giants sandaled feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you just do!\" your girlfriend exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got nervous. He heard too much,\" you try to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spins around and throws her arms up, \"Heard WHAT? You haven't said anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't dawn on you but she was right. The guy really hadn't heard anything at all. Maybe that you had something that turns you on that you were nervous to tell your girlfriend, but that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't those things illegal? I saw on the news this girl was using one at the park. She was arrested. You can't go around shrinking people!\" Lauren scolded you. Then she notices, it's not the remote in your shorts anymore that's making you look excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush, but seeing the tiny man on the floor next to your girlfriends feet is too much. Just the idea of her moving her foot over top of him and stepping down is far too exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This?\" she motions to the guy on the floor, \"You're turned on by this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly, \"I didn't want to tell you this way. Ever since the stories have been showing up on the news I can't get it out of my head. I've always loved this stuff. Shrinking movies, comics, everything like this. But knowing it was real. That it was out there somewhere and I could end up shrunk. I couldn't believe it was true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But HE isn't you. Why would you do this?\" Lauren asked. Finally calming down. At least she wasn't angry about you liking size change. Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in her eyes, trying to calm down, you explain.</span></div></div>",

But him getting stepped on would be awesome to see,\" it's stupid, this is stupid. Why would you say this! This can't end in any good way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of judging you, Lauren presses her body against yours. You look up from your embarrassed gaze toward the floor. She's grinning broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barefoot or with my sandals on?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassion overwhelms you. Did your girlfriend just dive right into your fantasy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispers in your ear, \"I'll be honest. This is my fantasy too. I even hate this guy. He's always keeping us up all night. Loud music, screaming at his wife, he's a complete pain. I know, he looks like a perfect gentleman, but he's a jerk. I want to crush him for you honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kiss her deeply and press her up against the mailboxes, pinning her hands to the wall. The tiny man on the floor is almost crushed under the shuffling of both of your feet. Was this really going on, he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What should I do?\" Lauren finally asks with a wicked grin.</span></div></div>",

You took a deep breath and continued. \u201cI want to see him enter your mouth and go down your throat. I want to place my hand on your sexy belly and feel him squirming.\u201d You explained. Your girlfriend continued to be quiet. The tiny man at your feet stayed still, afraid of what was going to happen. After a minute of silence, you couldn\u2019t take it anymore. \u201cOh forget it!\u201d You yelled before running out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back to your bedroom and collapsed on the bed. It felt like you really messed things up. Your girlfriend probably thought you were a creep and didn\u2019t want to speak to you anymore. After about 10 minutes, you heard your door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Nicole. I did it, I told her.\u201d You said. The person stayed quiet. \u201cShe rejected me though, I\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d You could hear the person approach you and sit on your bed. She started to rub your back a little. \u201cYou might as well shrink and crush me, at least I can make you happy\u2026I guess.\u201d The woman giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if I crush you, we can\u2019t have lunch together.\u201d She said. You turned around to see the person was actually Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLauren, you\u2019re here! But\u2026\u201d You started to say. She immediately put her finger to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were pretty rude you know, you didn\u2019t give me time to respond. I know I was pretty weirded out at first but to be honest, I also have a pretty weird fantasy involving a tiny human as well so I can\u2019t judge.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren suddenly reached into her pocket and pulled out the tiny man from before. He was tied up and squirming. Just the sight of him was enough to spark your interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo does that mean\u2026you\u2019ll eat him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I am pretty hungry, so yes, yes I will.\u201d She said. \u201cThen, I want you to help with my fantasy.\u201d You could see the excitement in her eyes and smiled. You nodded causing her to kiss you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how shall I eat him? Will it be whole or chewed up? Shall I eat him plain or prepare him on a plate?\u201d She asked. The tiny man\u2019s struggles became panicked at her suggestions.</span></div></div>",

So what, you want to be tiny. She probably wants some vampire guy to suck her blood while they get it on. Girls like that stuff man. Phht, at least any girl I've dated has. Go for it!\" he edges you on, still looking around for Justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawns on you. If Justice is really showing up, you could be tiny at her feet.

You pulled a chair out, and sat across from her as she looked up, slightly annoyed that you would have the audacity to take her company without asking. She stopped chewing gum for a moment, setting her phone down on the table next to the napkin container, and looked up to address you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah? Do you need something?\" She said rudely, waiting for an answer as though she was owed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I just thought that you might think this was pretty cool!\" You said, unsheathing the remote and displaying it to the gorgeous bombshell who sat across from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why is that?\" She questioned, not knowing a thing about the mysterious device that you had managed to get your hands on. To her it seemed to be just a remote control for a television, or maybe one of those fancy fans that moved on command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Watch this.\" You said gleefully, watching as she loudly smacked her gum. You set aim for the table next to yours, and showed the true power of the remote as it dwindled in size, now more so fitting inside of a dollhouse rather than a shopping mall. You plucked it up, setting it on the table as you watched her face turn to one of amazement, thrilled about the technology that was being presented to her for the very first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's amazing!\" She said as she quickly snatched it from your hands, your face obviously telling that you were nervous with the device in the hands of such an unpredictable woman. She observed it as a grin crept onto her face, letting you know that she was already thinking up some pretty big plans for the tool that you had supplied her with. Without warning, Justice </span></div></div>",

Glancing past the many fast food stalls, you looked over the tables like a falcon eying it's prey as you tried to determine who you'd first share your knowledge of size changing tech with. That's when you spotted the naturally black haired, now dyed with streaks of blue game shop employee that you had befriended over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Gwen was a few years older than you, and had worked at GameShop ever since you were still in high school. She was pretty, in an alternative way as many people would put it, but you couldn't refute that she was beautiful no matter what. With a slightly long face, she had gauges in both ears, along with a ring nose piercing on the side of one of her nostrils, and even though she sometimes smelled like cigarettes you still loved her company, not that you would cheat on Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Approaching her, you saw her glance up momentarily from her phone as she nibbled a salad, soaked in ranch dressing. She smiled warmly as she greeted you, motioning for you to take a seat across from her. Not wanting to disappoint, you obey and sit down on the cold metal which presses against the back of your legs, exposed in the shorts as part of the metal touches against your bare upper arms from the tank top's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey! How are you?\" She said with the same smile, having not eased it slightly since you got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Pretty good, just trying to find someone I knew at the mall. Just my luck that you happened to be here.\" You said with a small grin, easing your feelings of anxiety about exposing Gwen to your device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! Actually on break right now. Got about fifteen minutes left if you wanna chat about something.\" Gwen said as she started to shovel more lettuce into her mouth, chewing softly as she awaited you to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's actually what I came to do, talk about something that Nikki gave me.\" You said as you pulled the remote out, shaking it slowly as to better display it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her face started to look a little confused, the same smile still there. \"What's that? And who's Nikki?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Nikki's my sister. And this, is a shrink remote. Watch!\" I said as I shrunk down her coke, watching as her smile turned to disappointment, but then amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so this thing can change sizes? Like everything?!\" She said in astonishment, obviously confused at what seemed to be something out of a weird science fiction dream rather than real life. It took her a minute to even process it, but eventually she seemed to have settled down, never really being to out of her element in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, this thing can shrink or grow anything, or anyone for that matter. At least that's what my sis told me.\" You replied, seeing Gwen look amazed at you and the device. After discussing it, the two of you decide to use it to</span></div></div>",
