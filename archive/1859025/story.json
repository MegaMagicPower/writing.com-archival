He wasn't really looking for anything inparticular, and in fact hated clothes shopping. But he was just wandering around and when he had seen the store, he had just felt like going in there, almost as if he was drawn to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, he decided to walk arond it for a bit. Normally, he would want to leave a place like this as soon as possible, but had thought about that this time. As he walked down the aisles, his hand accidentally brushed against a piece of clothing. And unfortnately for him, that was all that it would take to innitiate the change that he would soon experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of clothing did he touch?</span></div></div>",

But even so, he still felt like something was off, and he felt slightly taller. When he looked down, he quickly noticed why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was now wearing a crisp, white, womens blouse, and from his waist was a short, tight, black skirt that came down to mid-thigh. A pair of shiny, black pantyhose were on his legs and a pair of two inch tall pumps were on his feet. And underneath those, he had also gotten a lacy bra that he now wore underneath, and underneath his new skirt was a matching pair of panties. A purse was even slung over his shoulder. He was now dressed in women's clothes!</span></div></div>",

As he looked arond inside of it, he found a variety of things. Among them were make up(Which he wasn't aware yet, but was currently applied to face), a compact mirror, some money and debit cards, a phone, and a driver's license. Looking at the license, he was even more shocked by what he saw. It was his picture on it! But in the picture, while it was his body, he could see that he was wearing women's clothes, seeing that he was wearing a white blose like the one he currently wore, and saw that his face had make up on in it. Another odd thing about it was that it had all of his information on it, including his name and age, even though there should be no concievable way that a 10 year old should be able to get a driver's license. As he put the license back into the purse, he saw there was even a set of keys in the purse, one of which was definitely for a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here?\" John wondered aloud worriedly.</span></div></div>",

As he does, he doesn't realize that he doesn't have any problem walking in the pumps, even though he has never worn shoes with heels before in his life. In fact, he seemed to unconciously know how fast he could move in them and the skirt without tripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left the store, he quickly made his way home to get changed, not even realizing that people would see him on his way there, and he didn't pay attention to any he passed. But as he passed them, they didn't pay much attention to him either, not finding the sight of a 10 year old boy dressed like a women to be strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got home, he noticed that there was an unfammiliar car in the driveway, but didn't have time to wory about it. He then ran upstairs to his room, and when he got there he was relieved. He'd be able to get out of these clothes and into something else. But his hopes were quickly dashed as he opened his closet and instead of his own stuff he saw clothes similar to what he was wearing. Checking his dresser drawers yielded the same result. All of his clothes had been replaced with women's clothes, all of which was made to fit a 10 year old boy instead of a grown woman.</span></div></div>",

Aside from seeing that his closet was full of woman's clothes now, everything else was radically different. His bed was bigger now, not too large but definately made for an adult. Places were his toys and such were gone now, ;eaving lots more empty space than there was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a new desktop, with a labtop sitting on top of it. The walls were no longer colored, now being a normal peach kind of color.On top of his dresser was what seemed to be some pieces of jewelry, with a make-up case sitting with them. Along the wall, thaks to the empty space, a vanity set was now placed, with a large mirror fit for an adult woman. Simply put, there was nothing kiddish left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on? Why are these clothes sticking to me and changing everything?\" wondered John. His 10-year old mind couldn't really comprehend just what was going on right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, what happened?</span></div></div>",

I guess.\" said John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks honey. I'll see you at home. Love you.\" he said before hanging up.

He shook his hand a couple of times before he finally looked down at it and saw that there was a big wedding ring firmly on it. He might have taken it off right away, but there was something about it that made him want to leave it on, almost as if it were important to him somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This can't be real\u2026 what am I feeling\u2026 what am I SEEING?!</i>\" John thought as he stared at the ring. He stood there a while longer, just staring and thinking, struggling to understand with his 10 year old brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, his mother came out again, snapping him out of his daze. \"Is something wrong? You've been standing there for quite a while now,\" she said to him, but her tone sounded different; it was less like she was talking to her son, and more like one of her own friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm\u2026 I'm fine, Mom,\" said John, too lost in his thoughts to notice much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Ellen, please,\" his mom said as if John had addressed her by her last name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay\u2026 Ellen\u2026\" John said, even more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did Donald want, if you don't mind me asking?\" Ellen asked, considerately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He\u2026 he wants me to pick up some things on my\u2026 trip to the mall later\u2026\" said John, still not sure about all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lemme make you some lunch before you go. Don't try to be humble now, I insist! I won't take no for an answer,\" Ellen said, like it was some sort of special treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\u2026\" answered John slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had finished his meal, John went back to \"his\" room and sat down at the desk inside. He lifted the lid on the laptop and found it was already on, but locked. He wondered for a minute why he even sat down at this computer because it definitely did not belong to him, despite it being in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he began to type something. As he did, he could feel the ring on his finger, which seemed to fit him perfectly, just like the rest of his clothes. He pressed enter and the computer logged on. John was too busy observing to wonder how he could have known the password. He really didn't use computers much, and didn't even have an email address. Nevertheless, he began to operate the machine as if he had been using it for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe somehow knew exactly where everything was. He opened his mail and looked at the email Donald sent. \"Okay. I can handle that,\" a few words escaped from John's mouth, who was unsure where exactly they came from. He printed the list like a pro and stuffed it into his purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had looked back after leaving his room, he would have found that it had vanished, but it was not gone from reality completely. A few miles away, in Donald's house, the master bedroom beginning to get larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in a daze, he made his way to the door and called out a \"goodbye\" to Ellen. \"Come back soon, Amanda,\" she answered from the other room as John stepped out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Amanda?! Was she actually talking to me\u2026?</i>\" John thought as he stepped into his car mindless of how odd it really was for him to even own a car. He sat down in the driver's seat and found that he could reach everything perfectly, despite being only 10 years old and still using a booster seat. It was almost as if the car was smaller on the inside than on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, he took the keys out of his purse and started it up. He had absolutely no idea how to drive, or where the mall was, yet somehow he managed to pull it off without the slightest problem. No one found it odd to see a such a young boy driving, and some of the men even gave him looks which seemed to be complimentary, but made him feel quite uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was driving, John felt a sudden urge to check on his makeup. At the next red light, he began to apply more to his face. \"I have to look my best in public,\" he said aloud, but wasn't sure why he said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the mall, he got out of his car, locked the door, and began to walk toward the door, haphazardly swaying his hips as he did so. He wondered just why he was here, other than to pick up the items on the list, and wasn't sure which store he should go to first, but as he was thinking, his legs made up his mind for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe first was going to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Perhaps it was because he was walking in them more often or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as if on autopilot, he continued on his way. Eventually, as he walked through, he came to one of the items on his list. It mentioned something along the lines of getting a haircut. Raising an eyebrow, he put a hand to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wierd. My hair doesn't feel long enough for a haircut.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, he found his way to a Great Clips store inside the mall, where he just walked in casually. He concluded that he might as well see this through. Nothing might happen since his hair was short. As he walked in, one woman saw him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Amanda! Back for your usual?\" she asked, still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usual?\" John asked himself. There was that \"Amanda\" line again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, got you down for your usual at this time.

You know that I don't need to be called Mrs. We're friends after all.\" said Carol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confused John even more. He never met her before, so why would she say that? Anyway, Carol grabbed his hand, leading him to the back where she would apparently work on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's she going to do with me not having much hair anyway?\"</i> thought John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he knew.</span></div></div>",

You know, hair dye.\" Before John could protest, Carol quickly applied the dye to his hair, changing it to a nice light-brown color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, for the styling!\" said Carol. John wasn't sure what she was doing at first, but he felt her tug at his loosened-up hair. However, it didn't just come out completely, but it began to grow longer as she pulled. \"<i>What are you doing?!</i>\" John wanted to say, but the words only reached his lips, then vanished into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his hair had become a considerable length, Carol put it into a ponytail and showed John his reflection in the mirror. He was utterly shocked. Between the makeup and his new hairdo, he practically looked like a complete woman! He also noticed that although the dye was used before his hair grew, the new hair was still the same color as the dyed hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to pay me, this one's on the house!\" Carol said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\u2026\" said John.

Of course there's nothing wrong with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, he stood there a while longer. Suddenly, he realized that he hasn't had a chance to try on his new undergarments yet. He suddenly got an urge to find a dressing room, and somehow did so without much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt himself step inside and strip off his clothes, which finally let themselves come off. Partially on auto-pilot again, he began to pull up a pair of his new panties. Next he slipped into one of his huge new bras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, he began to examine himself in the mirror, only this time within the dressing room stall. He realized something still felt off, that is, until he moved his hands to his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he felt it, he realized that it was a bit\u2026 squishier. He sat down on it and realized that it was much more comfortable now, and he felt it inflating even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck\u2026?!\" John said as he felt his butt finish expanding, filling out the panties. Then he felt something in his chest. He put his hands on his new bra, and sure enough, there was something underneath. \"No\u2026\" he said as two tiny mounds began to grow in his hands. He tried to squish them back in, but to no avail. They continued to grow and he was getting worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried ripping the bra off, but that didn't help. They just kept getting bigger and bigger, already at A cups. He tried once more to press them back into his chest, but instead received a warm pleasureful feeling that made him moan. He had never felt anything like it, being only 10 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's new breasts now reached C cups, having been sped up by his pressing on them. At this point, all he could do was watch as they continued to expand. They grew through D and finally reached size DD where they stopped. John stared at the enormous mounds for a while, wondering what he was going to do. Suddenly, he felt his body act for him again. He put on the large bra, now fully filled out, and put his clothes back on overtop, which still seemed to fit perfectly, despite his altered proportions. Finally, he gathered up his old bra and panties as well as his other things and left the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked, he felt his hips swaying. He tried to walk normally, but between his butt and the heels, he simply couldn't. He was hoping this nightmare was almost over when\u2026</span></div></div>",

She was becoming a completely different person, with a life of her own. Events in history began to undo themselves, being replaced with others of her new reality as her memories slowly faded away. She remembered her childhood as a girl now, and her brain was beginning to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closer John drove to Donald's house, the more mature she became. Her brain slowly grew to age 13, she began thinking less like a kid and more like a teenager. She drove closer and closer as her age rose, reaching age 15 by the next couple turns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's brain continued to get older as she drove closer, coming to age 18. Suddenly a car sped right out in front of her, going straight through a red light. She managed to stop the car in time, furious with the driver, whomever he was. \"What an <i>@$%#*?#</i> !\" said John to herself, immediately putting her hand to her mouth, surprised at her sudden outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she neared <i>her</i> house. It was larger than Ellen's, since her husband was the boss of the company, after all. She pulled up in the driveway, gathered her things, and walked inside, as her age rose to 21, though she still had some of her old mind left.</span></div></div>",

There was somewhere else he had to be right now. \"I guess I'll try to figure this weird stuff out later. I've gotta get going.\" he said out loud. And with that, he made his way out of the store, and fairly calmly consider this strange events that he had just experience. As he did, he didn't notice that his hips were swinging with each step, and now walked with a feminine gait. He was walking perfectly in the pumps on his feet, despite never having worn shoes with heels before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out of the store, he absentmindedly walked to the parking lot, and over to a car that he knew hadn't been there before. Reaching into the purse and pulling out the keys he had seen earlier, he tried the car key and it unlocked the car door. \"I guess this is my car?\" he said, a bit unsure. Sure, he had a license and the key, but he couldn't drive. Not only didn't he know how to and was too young, but he wasn't big enough to be able see over the wheel and reach the petals at the same time. As he opened the car, he saw that the driver's seat had a unique setup. It had a sort of booster seat on the seat and on the pedals had attatchments on them that looked like blocks. Hestitantly sitting in the seat, he found that he could reach the pedals thanks to this settup. Then, against his better judgment, he inserted the key in the ignition, and started the car up. And from there, it was like a switch went off in his brain, and he knew exactly what he was doing, and pulled out of the parking lot. He suddenly knew how to drive, and was doing it like he had been driving for years. And even stranger, even though he knew people had seen him in the car, no one seemed to find the sight of a 10 year old boy driving to be odd. In fact, when on a few occasions when he had stopped at a right light, people in the cars right next to him had looked right at him, but didn't even bat an eye at seeing him in the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drove, he wasn't really sure where he was going. But after about a twenty minute drive, he found himself pulling into the parking lot of a building, and parking into it. Looking at the building, he wasn't sure why he had come here, but he knew he had to be here. What he didn't know that the reason he had to be here was because he now worked here.</span></div></div>",

After all, the sight of a 10 year old boy wearing women's clothing would be quite the sight. However, he quickly learned that didn't seem to be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mr. Anderson.\" one man greeted him in a friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello.\" John replied, wondering who he was and how he seemed to know his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mr. Anderson.\" one woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" John said to her. One by one, everyone in the lobby greeted him, and seemed to be very friendly to him. Heading further into the building, John was wondering what was going on. He kept walking, his hips swaying and heels clicking with each step, his somehow knowing where he was going even though he was wondering what his destination was. After an elevator ride, he came to an office labled John Anderon. \"Thats my name. But what is it doing there?\" he said. Hesitantly, he entered into the office, seeing that the inside was large and was decorated by very expensive looking furniture and decorations. There was a desk by the window, and John walked over to it and took a seat. He was unsure of what was going on, but the feeling that he had to be somewhere was now gone.</span></div></div>",

There he spotted the counter, and behind it a woman in a pretty green dress with brown, waist-length hair and a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you like our office wear, Miss,\" she said, looking at him. \"Would you like to keep it on while we ring you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss?\" John asked. His voice went higher than it should have, and he still had two years before puberty proper! \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down. Boobs! The lumps his friends snickered about - they said his mom had really big ones - stretched the lacy bra so it tickled his armpits. A button on the blouse had popped open, so he saw the crack between the boobs and a peek of lilac fabric. He couldn't feel his wiener, and forgetting he was in public (his mom told him not too touch it all through his fourth year), he grabbed his crotch. Nothing; empty. Air tickled the tighter underwear from underneath the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the craning around, checking out and feeling his body, red hair spilled out in front of him and nearly reached his belly. He batted it away and found it swung from his head. John turned to the right and came face-to-face in a mirror with his new adult self: a brilliant, redhead woman with tiny scoops for shoulders and boulders for a chest. She carried herself like an older woman - it might have been the pumps - but the freckles brought out her green eyes and screamed, \"Forever Twenty-One!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store attendant had left the counter and stepped behind John. \"Are you okay, Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a Miss!\" John yelled. \"I'm ten years old!

Usually his mom saw him and scolded him for wandering off, although that might be a little harder now with his new body. Didn't Moms have some sixth sense so they knew where there kids were always? Wouldn't Mom know who he was even with boobs and a skirt? He hoped so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat at a table near the fountain at the center, legs crossed like he always crossed them. He noticed every time an older guy walked by - older like his brother Tom in college - they stared at him for a weirdly long time, eyes pointed right between his legs. It then crossed his mind that his friends always laughed when a girl at school did the same thing, though John didn't get the point of it. They just showed their underwear and it was kind of embarrassing but not more special than when boys showed their underwear, not as special as boobs or anything. Still, he put his legs down and pushed the skirt so nobody but the ants on the ground could see up his skirt, and they didn't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he heard a voice he'd known since he was a baby yell, \"CHELSEA!\" and turning his head he saw Mom running across the food court, past Taco Bell and Sbarro's, straight toward him. <i>My name is Chelsea,</i> John thought; he blanched inside. <i>That's a really girly name!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Chelsea, how are you?\" she asked, extending her arms for a hug. This was a grown-up hug, short, kind of awkward, and it didn't mean as much as the hugs Mom gave John to say she loved him, so John tried to keep that in mind when he got up and returned it. He threw in a pat on Mom's shoulder because it felt right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing good,\" he said, pretending his voice didn't sound so weird and high, but also thicker. \"I'm hanging out. At the food court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a long day at the office. So many documents...\" Mom wiped an imaginary sweat drop from her head. \"I hope this transaction goes through soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word \"transaction\" didn't mean a thing to John, but he inferred correctly that his mom and Chelsea worked at the same place, and his mom was a lawyer so Chelsea must be a lawyer too. This was a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Chelsea...\" His mom kept looking over her shoulder and walking in place. \"I'm looking for John right now. I don't know where he went. We were by Sears when I looked around and he just... disappeared! The bastard can run so fast. Did you see him anywhere?\"</span></div></div>",

His mom was aware that he had gone missing, she was probably suspecting the worst, and to top it all off John was now her co-worker and (best?) friend Chelsea, a mature lady she trusted as an equal. If Chelsea confessed she was actually a ten-year old boy transformed by a magic clothing store, who wouldn't believe her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Uh, I mean. Re... Ra, Ro\" John tried to remember what his dad called Mom when they thought John wasn't around. The only words that came to mind were \"Sexy\" and \"Mrs. Bitch,\" which he heard through their bedroom door some nights after midnight. His mom cocked her head and eyed him curiously. Whatever, he thought; he'd just go through with it. \"Forget about it! Mom, look: you think I'm Chelsea because I'm in Chelsea's skin and clothes and everything about me is like Chelsea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want John, but... I'm John!\" John said this louder than intended and a few heads turned. Mom seemed uncomfortable with the attention, but John kept going: \"While we were at Sears, I got bored so I went away and found a clothing store. I went inside the clothing store and suddenly I'm wearing these clothes and I've got Chelsea's...\" He gestured at his chest, resisting the word choice, trying to find a more appropriate fit. \"...lumps! I asked the lady at the counter to change me back but she said I had to go to Chelsea's job and live with her husband and raise her kids. I don't want to raise any kids!

Ellen could feel her cheeks redden the more people looked over at this grown woman ranting across from her. Her gut told her to obey her embarrassment; Chelsea was acting incredibly insane and silly; she just needed to lie down somewhere before she went home, and maybe then her husband Mark could take her to the doctor's. The issue of Chelsea claiming to be John entered nowhere in the equation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ellen knew her son's tone, inflection, language and demeanor, all captured perfectly now on the face and gestures and in the voice of her best friend Chelsea Whitaker. She had known Chelsea since their second year of college and she had never expressed an interest in acting. It was counter to her whole nature to impersonate a ten-year-old boy, her friend and co-worker's son, or anybody. And she did refer to plenty of specifics about that morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen tried one last time: \"Chelsea, if you're fucking with me--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not fuck, uuuhh...\" Chelsea stammered. \"Uh, you don't want me to use that word, right? Even though I'm grown-up now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dam holding back the water of belief shattered with one strike. Nobody but her son, a real little kid, would treat profanity so sacredly. She hugged her friend and whispered, \"Oh, John!\" over and over, hardly understanding the circumstances but knowing something incredibly strange had happened to lead them here. Memories of her teenage years, when she went through a Wiccan phase and called herself \"nature's sorceress\" rushed back. Guess magic wasn't so strange after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" John grumbled between kisses. \"You're embarrassing us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen held her son at arm's distance, staring him straight in the eye. \"John,\" she began, more sternly, \"You said a clothing store did this to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" John said. \"I forgot the name. It was on the first floor, though! It had a sweater and jeans on the sign above the door with sparkles around them; I think it was next to the bookstore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen ran through her mental map of the Ellison Outdoor Mall and pinpointed the area where the store should be. Frankly, she didn't know the name of the store either or whether she had seen it any other time beside that day. Se led John out of the food court, by hand at first until she remembered he was an adult now - albeit one tripping on her heels every other step. She hoped the store was there like John said so she could crack this mystery and give her son back his body. And whoever that store attendant was who told John to live Chelsea's life, they were going to have a few words, or more...</span></div></div>",

It's really hard to clean out, you know.\" Ellen told John in the middle of the trip home, passing him a box of tissues. \"If you don't, I might just keep you as Chelsea forever!\" John looked at the seat next to him. It already had a few of Chelsea's boogers on it that he picked, and he hurt his nose a few times with Chelsea's fingernails. He had tried to pick the lunulas off, but they were too strong. Plus, his mother would never keep him as Chelsea forever, but John didn't know that. \"Okay, mom...\" \"Good. Put the used ones in the plastic bag.\" John decided to just use a tissue for the rest of the trip. As they got inside, John took off his blouse and bra and put on one of his mom's shirts [with permission from her] and went on the internet, as Ellen got a call from the real Chelsea.

She recovered her breath in time to notice the ceiling had grown half a story and her arms no longer reached across the foot of the rack but only halfway, and both were bare up to her shoulders where nylon and spandex dug into softer, pudgier skin uninterrupted by the artist's touch of female puberty. Her body had compressed, squished, and bundled itself without fanfare. She registered something was amiss when she tried to stand and couldn't, her feet were too small and alien for such a motion. Then she heard the wheezing in her breath, the square chest rising and falling without the familiar lumps extending their reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo shadows fell over her and blended together. One jumped from foot to foot in childish agitation. The other hovered motionless like a sleek totem pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're a regular customer,\" the totem pole shadow said to the writhing shadow, \"your daughter can keep the swimsuit. It's a lovely day for the pool, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daughter!?\" Ellen squeaked with Minnie Mouse's vocal chords. Of course, she thought in hindsight. Isn't it obvious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store attendant bent down, out of the ceiling lights that blacked out her features and into focus. To the new Ellen, 3'9'', she seemed enormous. Ellen winced as the attendant pawed at her new pigtails, shorter than a barber's brush for sweeping off stray hair, and squealed when she picked her up. The ground fell away with startling ease; momentum swung Ellen forward until she was passed to John - her own son! two feet taller! - and he plopped her down immediately upon grabbing her. The reality of the transformation sank in once Ellen was standing, blood rushing through her body faster now that she was shorter. She also caught a quick peek of her reflection in a mirror: slight chipmunk cheeks with freckles, complementary red hair like a fireball, and a figure that promised after a few more years to blossom into adolescent beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make an adorable pair,\" the attendant cooed. She bent down to stare Ellen in the eye. \"I'm sure you'll look just like your mother when you grow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words she flicked her eyes from Ellen to John, as if to say, \"Remember who he is now,\" and turned to strut back to the counter. Ellen wanted to run after and claw her backside but she felt a hand yank her forward, out the front door of the store, and suddenly she stood in the open-air mall suffocating on an expanse she hadn't experienced since she was eight-years-old. The sky was higher, the mall stores spaced more widely. John towered next to her holding his mom's hand, unsure how to treat a woman who was supposed to be his caretaker but now wore a kid's sized Hello Kitty swimsuit. What had happened to avenging her son and reclaiming their life? Now they were a completely different mother-and-child, of mixed genders, ages, roles, everything, and the day was just beginning.</span></div></div>",

I don't know! I don't want us changing any more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw his arms in the air, and Ellen saw, with the rest of the mall's shoppers walking around them, how hopeless her son looked, even with the assured, stony features of Chelsea's face. Her rage subsided and Ellen wished she could hug all of John, instead of just his waist where she now stared at. It would be odd providing her son with motherly advice in these bodies but she had to do her best, no matter what the store attendant expected of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" she said. \"It's probably a good thing we don't try anything rash anymore. We just have to accept who we are... you're Chelsea, 35-years old, a grown woman, and I'm Melanie, your 8-year old daughter. We'll be like that for at a least a little while longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is a little while longer really long?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllen stifled a giggle at her son's dopey words, even as his shadow enveloped all of her. How funny to be talking in a girl's voice but lecturing like a mother, while the actual (in appearance) mother gapes, asks naive questions, and picks her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It shouldn't be,\" Ellen assured him, resisting the urge to add \"Hopefully.\" \"Here! Why don't we go back home. Maybe we have new bodies but live in the same building, and you're a new Chelsea who can stay home and play video games all day while I'm the eight-year old girl who works in an office!\" The attempt at a joke didn't resonate in her new, pipsqueak voice, and she was starting to shiver from the wind gusting across her bare feet, legs and arms. The elastic bands on the swimsuit dug in painfully, and if she didn't get another layer of clothes she might be blown away. \"Let's go,\" she finished lamely, extending her hand so John could take it and maintain the illusion of his authority. Together, they waddled with discomfort across the plaza toward the mall exit.</span></div></div>",

And maybe we really do have weird new lives where I work for a living and you're a stay-at-home lady who plays video games!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt it.

It'll be fun, honey! You're finally getting to drive a real car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll try,\u201d John said with a sniff.

The plaza ground to a halt to see if this foul-mouth grade schooler's mother would reprimand her, but John only returned the gazes like a deer in headlights trying to assure the car they would both be all right and no point worrying about collision. Ellen nearly embarked on a longer tirade but the morning chill snapped her to her senses. She was an eight-year old girl now, Chelsea Whittaker's daughter Melanie to be precise. She had no problem with Melanie or anything about her, but it was certainly no existence for a woman who had painstakingly built her life, career, and family nearly from scratch, and now they had to figure out how to return to their old bodies without bumping shoulders (and heels) with Mrs. Life Destroyer inside. Not much she could do currently in a constricting one-piece colored with pictures of Pooh Bear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, before she could turn to John and find the right calming words, uninhibited by the body and voice delivering them, a pleasant voice yelled, \"Chelsea! Melanie!\" from their left. Ellen was the first to turn. Her son took a second to respond to his new name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChelsea's husband Miles, with his squat body, stocky arms, and bread-loaf cheeks clean of facial hair, advanced toward them in a suit he fancied as \"casual\" although it singled him out in tight crowds of a thousand. His fuzz-brown jacket awkwardly reflected the sunlight and threatened to slide down his shoulders and off his body from being two sizes too big. He squeaked with each step as his hand-me-down loafers decompressed from all the rain, wear, and chewing dogs they had endured, and closer up the amount of grease used to pat down his hair and hide his bald spot struck John and Ellen with rancid pungency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing, ladies?\" He bent to kiss Ellen on the cheek, and then got up face-to-face with John. Miles dove into John's lips, too quickly for him to dodge or react, seizing them with a wet kiss meant to suggest they had business to attend later that night, when the kid was tucked in bed and asleep. He pulled away leaving John on the verge of tears. \"You had a good shopping day. That's a lovely swimsuit. We'll have to hit the pool when we get back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn didn't say anything, so Ellen nudged her lightly in the leg. It didn't send the appropriate message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sweetie,\" Miles continued. \"Are you guys ready to go? I don't want my day off work to go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urm... Ahh...\" was all came out of John's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Ellen chirped, horrified at the act she now had to pull. She lifted her voice artificially and forced a grotesque, cheery-as-torture smile toward the man she still considered her best friend's husband. \"I'm ready, Dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles chuckled. \"Okay, Mel. I'm glad you're ready. Hopefully we can still find the car...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loafers squished away as he returned the way he came. John and Ellen only shared a brief, concerned look, with Ellen communicating through gesture that they'd discuss this later, and hesitantly followed, Ellen stopping and wincing when her bare feet dug into the pocked, pebbly sidewalk, John teetering on his heels like a drunk.</span></div></div>",

His breasts and feathered hair grew heavier in his mind as he calculated with boyish exaggeration how many minutes of female existence a year translated into. He really, <i>really</i> wanted to throw a tantrum. \"Moooommm-!\" he whined, half a step away from pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act like a kid!\" Ellen said. \"If I think of anything else, I'll tell you, but that's the best bet right now. In the meantime...\" She searched her mind. Maybe another idea would come, but nothing sparked her inspiration. \"We just have to wait.\"</span></div></div>",

Not higher pitched, just richer and more melodic. Somehow a tiny bit more mature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked down at himself and recognized the reason: he was now in the body of a teenage girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in the very same red and white cheerleading uniform he had just touched, John now had thin yet athletic looking arms and legs, smooth and tanned. Small, perky mounds of feminine flesh pushed upward on his chest, straining a little against the sleeveless uniform shell he wore. Alternating pleats of red and white fluttered about the short skirt he wore. Small white socks that looked decidedly girly were now on his feet, rising to just below the level of his ankles. John's shoes looked like normal, white tennis shoes, but felt extra soft and supple, as though they were especially designed for cheerleading girls to jump about and do gymnastic routines in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm a girl,\u201d John whispered aloud, running his hands along his slim, new, petite frame in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I be of assistance?\u201d said an approaching sales associate. She was a pretty, brunette in a green dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's happening to me?\u201d John asked the sales attendant, trying not to betray in his voice the rising panic he now felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like what you see, miss?\u201d asked the sales associate calmly. \u201cThat's a healthy, vivacious young body. Very athletic and full of life. A good, energetic form. Bodies like that one usually go quick! You're lucky to have picked it up when you did. Shall I ring you up at the cash register?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No! I don't understand this,\u201d John cried. \u201cMy name is John, and I'm ten years old. I'm not a girl, and I'm not a cheerleader, and I don't want to be this lady! Change me back, please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother spontaneous conversion?\u201d sighed the sales girl. \u201cThat's the third one this week! I do wish you customers would be more careful. We have signs clearly posted at all the entrances.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn't see anything,\u201d wailed John. \u201cPlease, just make me a kid again, and a boy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me explain what's happened,\u201d the attendant said gently. \u201cThe clothes in this store are magic. When you touch an outfit, the clothes alter you to fit them. You can become an entirely new person, and change your body to suit any style that catches your fancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this is just an accident,\u201d sobbed John. \u201cI don't want to be a cheerleader.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry. You should have read the signs and been more careful,\u201d replied the attendant. \u201cYou cannot undo the alteration for twenty-four hours. Now if you'll come back and visit us at this time tomorrow, and subsequently touch your old clothing, you may then revert back to the person you were before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy old stuff is here?\u201d asked John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d answered the sales associate. \u201cIt will be over in the children's section, among the racks of boys clothes. However, it will disappear if anyone else chooses to touch it. Then, of course, that person would become you, in both body and style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't want anyone else buying my body!\u201d whined John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's part of the price of using our service,\u201d explained the attendant. \u201cI'm sorry; I cannot change the rules. I also need to caution you that unless you make another change in the next seven days, reality will be re-written so that you will have always been in this new body and style. But don't worry: I'm sure your old clothes will still be available tomorrow. And even if they aren't, you accidentally selected a wonderful new body. You're a very pretty young lady now, quite healthy looking, and probably an extraordinarily happy and popular girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't want to be a popular girl!\u201d cried John, stomping his dainty, new feet on the floor angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really cannot do anything to help you until tomorrow,\u201d replied the sales associate somberly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The clerk, Tanya Richardson, had trouble relating to the real-life equivalent of \"muggles,\" humans uninitiated into the selective, esoteric world of witches, sorceresses, warlocks, and wizards, the thousands of cults spread across the globe devoted to training disciples in the art of manipulating stray energy for personal and communal benefit. Recently, a few magic organizations stationed in the American Midwest, including Tanya's own, had the bright idea of teaching the magick-less (their genius moniker for ordinary, untrained people) about the reality of the supernatural. Most members started tarot card and fortune telling businesses, to no avail, but Tanya thought of something more unusual. She wanted to run a clothing store where the clothing shaped the wearer to fit them. It eliminated the pesky business of size, age, and beauty by molding human appearance the variable, where a person could dress as youthfully as they desired. Reality would alter to suit their choice and the world would keep spinning with one new believer in magic. In that regard, John was certainly an initiate, and her main job was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she saw him now, a teenage girl with makeup running, practically on her knees. Infantile, oversensitive, obstinate against all reassurance, Tanya worried John might blow her cover by running her mouth at home, telling \"Jenny's\" parents about the magic store that gave her these perky breasts and an older female body. Tanya had just left the Order of Shifters with enough knowledge to modify bodies temporarily, alter the reality surrounding them, and attach these energies to inanimate fabric. She did not have the means to relocate her store like the older disciples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only option left - and it carried as many risks that threatened her livelihood - only caught her eye because she felt sorry for John, who was so young and oblivious to real magic, not that silly cartoon crap he saw on TV. There had been three spontaneous conversions that week, and the other two had adjusted and changed back... But maybe she deserved to re-compensate John, and maybe take a break from a business that was grating her nerves more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen.\" Tanya cupped a hand on John's shoulder and looked him in the eye. She smiled like she imagined his mother might. \"Here's an option, but it's still a big responsibility, and you have to promise me if you take it that you will do the best you can until you turn back into a boy tomorrow. Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yuh...\" John sniveled, pulling snot back up her nose in an unladylike manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Yeah!\" He nodded more vehemently now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can swap bodies with you,\" Tanya said. \"I will take your place as the cheerleader girl and you will be the owner of Flexible Looks Clothing. For the next eight hours, you will run this store, ring people up, and you'll also have the benefit of preventing anyone from touching your old clothes. Mostly, we get two to three people in the store each hour, and most of them leave without touching anything because they realize this isn't Abercrombie. It's not a tough job but you have to stay responsible. After the mall closes you can take a taxi home to the address on my driver's license - that's the card in my purse, behind the counter - and while I live with a boyfriend, he'll understand if you tell him who you are and won't bother you much. If I find out you're messing with my life and not acting like I would, I have the power when I return to punish you. I don't want to, but I think that's only fair considering how generous I'm being. Does that sound reasonable?\"</span></div></div>",

As you walked in she didn't seem to notice or care that you were no longer a boy but a hot teenage girl. You sat beside her and felt your penis grow erect again. You unzipped your shorts and let it stand proudly from your crotch, and then Jennifer gripped a hand around it while giving you a lustful gaze. You knew your sister was acting strangely, but then again you weren't supposed to be even be a girl at all, so you just watched as she moved herself off the couch and knelt on the floor. You gasped when she put your penis into her mouth and her tongue slid all over the tip. After a while, she removed her t-shirt and rubbed it in between her breasts while you fondled with your own pair. Then, she stripped completely naked and moved herself onto your body, her arms draped around your neck, sliding her vagina into your massive penis. You kissed her passionately, pressing your breasts against hers into a fleshy mass of womanly goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a man entered the room, which you recognised to be Jennifer's boyfriend. \"I called him over to join the fun,\" she said, and made you turn to the side. The man unzipped his pants and inserted his penis (five inches) into your aching vagina from behind, which meant that you were having sex from both genitals in your exciting threesome. At some point you switched around to giving him a blowjob while Jennifer pressed herself against your back while teasing your crotch equipment. When you were done you even went into the shower with Jennifer, which meant another 15 minutes of lovemaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you emerged from the bathroom, towel wrapped carefully around your bust, you went back to your room to find that all of your clothes had turned into female ones. You put on an E-cup bra, and saw that all of your pants and skirts were specially made with some spare space around your crotch for your massive cock. Pleased with your wardrobe change, you decided to go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The next day...</b></span></div></div>",

One of his feet snagged onto a loose shoelace making him trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was falling, he grabbed onto a piece of swimwear and the force of him tugging it caused the entire coat rack to fall forward too. A sound of a crash echoed onto the floor, but nobody had noticed it. Eventually John gets up on his feet and this is when he sees the coat rack he accidentally dropped. There was only one piece of swimwear hanging on this coat rack surprisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swimwear was a two-piece that had a navy blue strapless bikini top and a matching bottom. If he had noticed the details closer, the bust size of the bikini top according to the hanger was a large D cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap\", he said in reflex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting the coat hanger back in place, he saw that the two-piece set had disappeared suddenly. Where did it go? He thought. He didn't realize that the changes would now take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's body began shifting in size and structure to adhere with the clothing he touched. John's height grew several inches to above five feet making him around 5 ft. 7 in. His bone structure expanded and contracted giving him an hourglass figure older women had and the traits he had as a boy were now shifting to fit a woman, internally and externally. His age rose all the way to about twenty years old and his facial features were becoming more feminine as well. There was no mirror so he can directly see the changes that were causing him grief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately his clothes didn't go along with these changes. They were stretching apart; almost to the point of breaking. He saw his chest was expanding and it was causing his shirt to break. He covered his chest tightly so no one would see it happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body changes had stopped for now, but it was now the clothes time for change. His pants shimmered away revealing his boxers in public and it quickly transformed into a navy blue bikini bottom; the same one John saw earlier. He reacted to this quickly after feeling a light breeze. His legs were now all bare. Now his clothes on his torso transformed too. The shirt contracted all the way to where his chest was and formed a strapless navy blue bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" He asked himself, not realizing his voice changed as well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, now her hair tickled her hips, her skin had a moderate tan, her lips were plumper and emblazoned with hot pink gloss, her breasts look bigger than her head, maybe an I-cup or bigger, her top was mostly unbuttoned as to show most of her cleavage, her skirt's hem had rose up her legs to the middle of her shapely thighs, and her heels stood a statuesque 6 inches upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally knew I wasn't alone in here...

A few more years left her face making her look more like a teenager than one of the heads of a major law firm. Her suit's pants legs rode up and merged, having become a taut pencil miniskirt about halfway through her speech, the bottom barely hiding her firming assets.

Standing with her was a young woman with a shoulder-length lavender bob, dressed in a short sleeve button-up shirt, crimson tie, matching pants, a strange golden bracelet with a giant oval garnet set in it on her left wrist, a pair of sneakers, a store name tag reading \"Ophelia,\" a fingerless black fishnet glove on her right arm extending to her elbow, and a nose ring on the right side, but most prominent and jarring to John were the two almost cartoonish grey horse ears sticking out her hair, the left one pierced with several studs, and the rather flat and unassuming lavender horse tail poking out the back of her pants draping to her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" is all can muster as the other woman, whom he had figured out from her appearance to be a store employee and her name was Ophelia, zipped by and plucked Gigi and Natalie off of him in an instant, grabbing each of them in a single hand, and before he could crane his head around and figure out what was going on, Ophelia had them handcuffed to the handicapped rail in the back of the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two stay there.\" Ophelia states with air of apathy. \"I don't care what you two while we talk, or do with each other, but keep it quiet, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, like, okies, scary pony lady.\" Gigi squeeks, still in shock how fast she ended up handcuffed to the rail. After a short beat as Ophelia began to walk back over to John, Gigi's apprehension seemed to fade as she turned to Natalie. \"You like, wanna make out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Natalie smiles, \"I think you totally need an 'oral examination.' *giggle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">==================================================================== ====================</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what's going on?\" Missy blankly asks, having lost her train of train of thought again when Ophelia's and John's mom bust in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, suck on this.\" Ophelia tells Missy, handing her a not-so-subtly phallic-shaped lollipop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy's eyes lit up at the sight of the kinky-looking candy \"Ooh, cock lolly!!\" Missy began to eagerly suck and pump the lollipop into her mouth, like it were the real deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it shut her up, but did it have to be so... X-rated?\" John's mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, yes. Yes it did. It's to help those that have had their minds bimbofied focused on sucking on it. It's very almost important they do, because its doing more than just 'shutting her up.' Once she finishes it, the magic in the pop can undo mental bimbofication. As for her physical changes, she'll still be in the same boat as your son as those two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... What exactly are you talking about?\" John walks up, asking Ophelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia said, \"I hate to say this, but there is no real way to undo what has happened to you today, which reminds me...\" Ophelia hits John in the chest with her palm somewhat gently, but he can feel it reverberate throughout his whole being. \"That should halt any further magic in that outfit, so you don't have to worry about becoming like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good!!\" John exclaims, \"There's something I got to do then!!\" He runs to a stall and takes that dump he had been holding in in fear of becoming a bimbo himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, John's mom asked, \"I still don't understand. What is with this place? Why are turning kids into sluts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This store is a magical consignment store where articles of clothing, costume, cosplay, and jewelry are enchanted with varying degrees of spells, hexes, pacts, rituals, curses, and what-not. The company's goal is to reconnect the mortal realm with the fae realm and change people's lives, at least that the corporate line I was fed on my orientation day. I think the suits are happy as long as I still as much magic crap as possible.\" John's mom goes to interrupt, but Ophelia continues, \"However, <b>HOWEVER</b>... not all our stuff does... this.\" She waves her hands at Missy, drool and sticky candy cream leaking out her mouth as she continues to work on the pop. \"In fact, only a fraction of our stuff is adult in nature, and as manager, I do have a great deal of say as to what gets stocked, often negotiating with wizards, witches, fairies, demons, and even gods as to what gets on these shelves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how did all of this happen?\" John's mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recently, corporate issued some layoffs and downsized the staff. A couple of my employees were a little... disgruntled, and they broke in earlier in the week and moved merchandise around to racks they didn't belong, they added or changed spells on many garments, put a number of items out on the floor that were defective or were to be sold by request only, and destroying a new line of Cthulhu Priestess robes we just got in, Needless to say Cthulhu was pissed. Anyhow, despite suggesting we close up for the next two weeks to rectify all the damage, the suits in corporate insisted we stay open and I fix it on store hours. Let's just say that between me and my only other employee Cathy, it's been near impossible to fix everything.\" Ophelia sighs, then points at Gigi and Natalie, \"Those two a week ago wouldn't have made it back into the adults area, because cameras show they both messed with stuff off of Rack 38-D, which IS supposed to have the slutty bimbofying clothes, but because I've been swamped no one caught the little perverts. The lawyer here found a regular pantsuit in section 12-A, but someone had added a bimbo hex to it as well without our knowing, and this happened. As for your son, it appears he just tumbled into a rack of swimwear by accident, and it seems our disgruntled ex-employees managed to hide an incomplete clubwear outfit from 38-D among the swimwear, leaving the miniskirt, boots, and accessories that had gone with the outfit back at its original rack. They also hid other incomplete outfits among the swim stuff too, though not as jarring as what your boy got hexed with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean this all happened because someone messed up your stock?\" John's mom groaned. \"How are you going to fix it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flush was heard. John walks out. \"I got to thinking, and... it's alright.\" John's mom was agape. \"She already said there was no way for me to turn back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you be so calm about this?\" John's mom was fuming. \"There has to be a way!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but every change is one way. All you can do is stack new changes atop the old ones, hoping the new ones might be similar to your old form. I mean, think about it. If I could change back, do you think I'd stay stuck looking like a humanized Maud Pie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no...\" John's mom weakly agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm saying. However, I will admit having enough knowledge about rocks to be able to get a masters in geology and having super-equine strength is a nice plus.\" She cracks a slight grin as her tail flicks a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did that happen, if I may ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I worked here, I had handled a necklace that had a skull with a geode inside it. The wizard that made it also happened to be an executive at Hasbro, and you know, geode, rock, Maud Pie... the rest is history. Hell, I even have her cutie mark on my thigh. Wanna see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Not right now.\" John's mom said. She then looked at Missy and asked, \"Why didn't you bring more of those things for the other two over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bimbofication is a very powerful magic, both mentally and physically, and undoing it is quite a chore, as it requires much magic and uncommon ingredients, from what many spellslingers tell me, thus our budget only allows for us to have one Mind De-Bimbofying Lollipop in stock at a time. Also, it seems there isn't much demand for bimbofication to be reversed, because most people that use the clothes on someone else are usually pleased, or their target turns their plot against them, and then you even get the rare man or woman that <b>WANTS</b> to be bimbofied, some of them Ph.D scholars. So you can see why undoing it is so hard. Those two will just have to stay airheads a little longer, unless they have the dumb luck of donning something in the store that offsets their vapidity. Right now they could don an Einstein getup and still end up with only marginally average intellect, that's how powerful bimbo hexes are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Missy's eyes light up, before she relaxes, fluids leaking out her mouth, giggling as she tries to swallow every bit of the candy. Suddenly, the glimmer of intellect shimmered back to life in Missy's eyes. \"Wha... What's this stuff in my mouth?\" She rakes her chin, and then pulls out the lollipop's stick. Swallowing the remainder of the candy, Missy then said, \"Oh god!! Where's my girl!!\" She then saw her tanned skin, open blouse, and giant breasts. She ran over to the mirror, hearing the clacking of the heels she knew she hadn't put on before, and saw herself in the mirror. \"I changed even more!! My girl will never recognize me now!!\" She looks down and tugs on the bottom of her miniskirt. \"The hell? I remember putting on pants!! And this just barely keeps me decent!! If the senior partners saw me dressed like this... oh, I'd never hear the end... Nevermind that!! My girl!!\" She runs out of the bathroom as fast one can on 6-inch heels, breasts sloshing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find that woman's daughter.\" John uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" John's mom began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like the idea of a little girl lost in store alone, and possibly coming in contact with some nasty people, or worse, nasty clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" she says with a bit of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia uncuffs Gigi and Natalie. \"Alright. You two are going to help us find Missy's little girl. No if's and's or but's. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, like, okie dokie, grumpy pony lady!!\" Natalie quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone poured out of the bathroom in search of Missy's daughter.</span></div></div>",

It was then Gigi mentioned, \"Shouldn't we have, liked, asked someone what she looked like and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe non-bimbos glared a scowl realizing how dumb they were. John then uttered off-hand, \"Ugh, I wish I knew where she was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGigi moaned and gasped, then exclaimed, \"Like, totally granted, master!!\" In a poof, they appeared at the front desk with the little girl, whom was with the cashier, a catgirl with orange hair, her name tag reading \"Amanda,\" and Missy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the piss could I forget that Gigi was also a genie?\" John grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Gigi utters, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn felt so stupid that he just wanted to sulk for a moment. Meanwhile Amanda was talking to the child, who seemed perplexed by what all was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, I still don't understand.\" the girl asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This store is a magic store, and all the clothes in it change people. Your momma didn't know that. You saw it yourself, remember? We even have it on camera. Your momma had no clue something magic was happening to her, and then she lost you, but now she found you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Big boobie lady <b>IS</b> my mommy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy groans a painful laugh at her daughter's comment and tells her, \"Apparently so, cricket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...\" the girl says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also know you weren't the one that passed gas during that last ballet recital, but took credit for it to keep your friend Suzie from feeling bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I only told mommy th... You are my mommy!!\" the little girl jumps into the arms of Missy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross.\" John comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, weren't you wearing pants before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic, honey...\" Missy responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, now that you're not... like, you know, totally out there, mind sharing your name?\" John asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy looks at him, beginning to recall her time bimbofied and her state of mind at the time. \"Oh lord... I... I can't believe I was like that... By the way, the name is Melissa Venkins, Attorney At Law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout then, loud screams filled the store. \"Just what I need!!\" Ophelia scowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, they find a teenage girl in jeans and a t-shirt doubled over. Suddenly a red demonic tail shoots out the seat of her jeans. \"Oh my!!\" the girl reacts, trying to hide her exposed rear, but then the jeans mend. Ophelia runs over and checks the jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell put a succubus seal on the button of these jeans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Succubus? As in... demon?\" Oh dear!!\" the girl meekly squeaks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sex demon, to be precise.\" Ophelia corrects her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl squeaks again and blushes in embarrassment. \"But I've never had a naughty thought. How can I turn into a succubus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she spoke, her chest shot up from B-cups to E-cups as cute petite horns poked out her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to be evil!!\" she howled as growths rose from her back. However, instead of leathery demon wings ripping out the back of her t-shirt, out grew black feathery fallen angel wings, and over her head a black halo adorned her head. Finally, it seemed the changes stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't feel any different.\" she uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems your innate naivete and purity was enough to overcome the demonic influence of the seal, as a result purifying part of it. I think you're safe now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother set of screams come from another part of the store. Running down there they find an old man with his twin granddaughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa tried on a cowboy hat, now he has boobies!!\" They yell in tandem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the old man was sporting breasts that were growing. \"I'm bewitched!\" he yells. He tries to cover his chest, declaring, \"You girls shouldn't see things like this.\" Years were melting off him as his silver hair grew out, becoming a sandy blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ophelia, is this another...\" John's mom asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia rushes over to the changing old man and says, \"No. There's definitely no bimbo magic imbued in this, but there are some other milder hexes in there I'm having trouble detecting. Those jerks that got fired loved to add stealth effects I can't find until the host is finished changing just to make my life a barrel of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do that?\" Melissa asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bracelet the main office gives all its employees allows us to scan the magic on the store's inventory, although as you see, it only works about 75% of the time. More importantly though is its power to allow us to handle the store's inventory without everything transforming us. It's basically our shield against the very magic of the store. However, as you can see with this man, and the girl before, I can't seem to halt their magic like usual. Those bastards really did a numbe... I'm beginning to wonder if they didn't have outside help. I wonder if this Azazel or Loki getting back at us for me refusing to carrying their line of demon stuff on the main floor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is our grandpa... going to be alright?\" the two girls ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he will, though you might have to start calling him 'grandma,' girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they had been speaking, the old man's flannel shirt shrunk a bit, sleeves going from long to short and the length pulling up to his narrowing waist, then magically unbuttoned and tied itself under his now E-cup breasts, exposing lots of flat, well-toned feminine abs and vacuous cleavage as the color shifted from powder blue to red. His slacks shriveled away and merged, becoming a short taut orange miniskirt. His loafers mutate into cowboy boots. Ophelia chuckles just a little when he sees his now hip-length hair be suddenly tied up near the base as similar cartoonish horse ears pop out his hair on his head, while a hole opens on his skirt, with a small strap just above it forming, as a long, thick, ropey sandy blonde horse tail shoots out the hole, reaching down and sweeps the ground as the very tip is tied up in a red sash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grandchildren were puzzled. One of them said, \"Did that hat just turn our grandpa into Applejack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former old man looks at himself in shock. \"Mind explainin' why I look like a country music singer, why I suddenly know everythin' there is to know about apples...\" he speaks, his voice now the spitting facsimile of the character he seemed based on, as he leans in towards Melissa. \"...an' if this here lil filly wants to 'buy some apples,' if y'all get my drift.\" He unknowingly tickles Melissa's chin with his new tail as he stares seductively into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no...\" Melissa pushes the former granddad back, a bit unnerved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia does another scan of him and says, \"That's it!! Our new Applejack here had extra hidden spells on her hat, like I thought. The sneaky buggers slipped mild seduction and libido booster hexes under the radar on this hat, as well as having it moved out of its proper place in the cosplay section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means...\" John's mom responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other than being slightly more amorous than normal, she should be oka...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, how 'bout explainin' how you gonna go about fixing this magical hoo-ey, missy?\" the new Applejack demands, eyebrow raised, when she slams her tail down into the floor, hitting the floor so hard it shattered it, shaking the whole store and everyone so hard they almost fell hard as pieces of ceiling tile shook loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You're going to need to learn to control that thing, sir... miss...\" John's mom utters, struggling back to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then finally noticed he had a tail. \"The hell? I got a tail?! What's goin' on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It took me over a week to get used to the idea I had one too.\" Ophelia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, more screams broke out, and they left the newly-christened Applejack and her two grandchildren for the new crises. In one aisle they found a terrified mermaid, then another they saw a mother freaking as her little girl is becoming a centaur in front of her. Down yet another aisle a boy was shaking a woman in a dress, the woman sporting green cat eats and tail, and she was on her knees mindlessly stroking her tail in pleasure. \"Oh god, this feels so good!!\" She seems lost to the words of the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the group runs up on a mother-daughter pair as they hear the little girl exclaim, \"Mommy, I don't feel so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphelia scans the pair and scowls, \"Those bastards!! They put <b>THIS</b> out here!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" John questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'The Coachman's Scarf,' an item in our failed 'Pleasure Island' series corporate tried to make as their first temporary transformation item. They were ultimately ruled defective when the 'temporary' part of the design didn't work, and most were destroyed, but one or two were kept on stock so they could come back and see if they could get it to work as intended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? Pleasure Island? Isn't that like...\" Melissa responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That island from 'Pinocchio' where boys turned into jackasses... And in this case of this scarf, adult jacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could only watch in horror and shock and mother and daughter began to gain muscle and grow grey fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, st-HAWWWW-p this!!\" the daughter begged, clawing at Ophelia until her hands turned to hooves, soon a noticeable bulge forming in the front of her dress as her size begins to increase. Ophelia could only turn her head away as their changes finished, the mother and daughter bursting out their clothes, leaving just a pair of adult male donkeys in their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what corporate says. I'm closing the doors, even if it's only for the rest of the day.\" Ophelia states with resolution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that...</span></div></div>",

He also could feel his breasts expanding in his bikini top - D, E, F, G, H, I, finally to J-cup. His skin began to tan slightly as the smell increased. That same smell made him hack and heave more, and with each cough, his hair gaining more length and shifting more and more to a bubblegum pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I can't, like... finish... I'm still me... I'm still John!! I'm still, like totally a boy.........\" John suddenly blinks vacantly as there is a audible <b>THUNK</b> in the toilet. It was clear from the look on the face; John was gone, and only a vapid airheaded bimbo was left. With that splash, an extra article of clothing joins the bikini bottom around this girl's ankles - a white pleated miniskirt and black belt, and a pair of 3-inch heeled platform sandals on her feet. \"No, look at me !! That's like totes silly!! I'm a totally sexy babe!!\" She says, giggling vapidly afterwards, as if to respond to John's final statement. A couple of more splashes occur, and she gains a pair of large gold hoop earrings on each ear, sexy sunglasses on her forehead, and a tramp stamp just over her butt with a heart in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All dones!!\" she chimes happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleans herself up, pulls her bikini bottom and miniskirt up, zips up, and goes to step out of the stall when she trips over the still woozy Natalie, who started coming back to as a result of being tripped over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie looks back at the stall and wonders where the cute bikini girl with the cough went, and hopes she was doing better, but then turns to the girl she didn't recognize. She wore the same cute top that the other girl did, but she was wearing this rockin' mini and these awesome sandals, and like, where did she get those earrings... Suddenly, Natalie's simple train of though was broken when she saw the girl holding her right knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, poor thing. You hurt your knee!! Hold on!! I'm like, a nurse, so I can make it all betters!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl formerly known as John said, \"Okie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie leaned in and said in an almost seductive manner, \"Nurse Natty will make it <b>ALL</b> better.\" She begins to kiss the small scrape, to the point of almost making out with it, and her patient begins to moan loudly. However, after a few more moments, Natalie stops and pulls some band-aids out of one of her pockets and applies them to her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanksies!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like, what I do!!\" Natalie replies. \"Say, you look familiar.

We have boobies bigger than yours!\u201d Richard retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I should have guessed from your incredibly feminine names, Richard and John,\u201d the cashier struck back with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know our names, nya?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagic. How do you think the clothes work?\u201d the cashier answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, this little girl brought us here to ask what exactly is going on,\u201d Richard stated with a pat on the head to Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m older than you,\u201d Melanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose are our reality-changing outfits,\u201d the cashier explained. \u201cYour identity will change to fit the body, and other elements of reality will shift to fit it as long as you are in those bodies, sometimes they'll cause side effects in the world around you and give you knowledge dependent on the situation,\u201d the cashier continued. \u201cJohn's catgirl costume makes himself and the surrounding area run on animesque logic as well as turning him into a nekomimi girl, and I think you\u2019ve already seen what Richard's costume does. If you change back, then everything will go back to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains the nosebleeds and the police department\u2019s new dress code,\u201d Melanie quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, now let\u2019s get outta here!\u201d Richard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh-ah-ah,\u201d the cashier said. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to either pay for those outfits or change back before you can leave again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how were we able to leave earlier and what would have happened if we didn\u2019t come back, nya?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had to disable the anti-shoplifting forcefield for a second because of those bank robbers,\u201d the cashier answered. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing Melanie here brought both of you back, someone could have lost their job for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No forcefield is too strong for Captain McNasty!\" Richard said, running back to the doors... only to run right into an invisible wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey could\u2019ve gotten killed out there!\u201d Melanie said. \u201cWere you out of your mind?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith all the combat knowledge in his head,\u201d the cashier responded by pointing at Richard trying various panty-showing kicks on the forcefield to no avail, \u201cand the logic of anime surrounding him,\u201d the cashier continued pointing at John, whose breasts jiggled as he blinked, \u201cthe chances of that happening were practically nonexistent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, almost forgot to ask, what about our parents?\u201d Melanie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor you two, they\u2019ll simply believe that John is your teenage catgirl sister,\u201d the cashier explained. \u201cFor Richard, they\u2019ll think he\u2019s their daughter that moved out and became a police captain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I the only other one aware because I saw them transform?\" Melanie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you were in the store actually,\" the cashier pointed out. \"Though it does work like that outside the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I give up,\u201d Richard said as he walked back to the cashier. \u201cHow much for these sweet costumes?\u201d Richard asked, resting his breasts on Melanie's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease get those things off of me,\u201d Melanie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout $35 each,\u201d the cashier said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal!\u201d Richard stated as he took his breasts off Melanie's head, pulled the cash out of his top and slammed it onto the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to buy your costume too, or would you like a different one?\u201d the cashier asked John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNya....\u201d John said as he thought.

I can fix that!!\" She raises her hand out and conjures forth wind and lightning, which summons a spellbook to her hand. \"Collectus Jaratim!!\" The spellbook then vanishes, but the vortex of energy remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA eldritch envelops you, namely your kidneys and bladder, as you feel <b>SOMETHING</b> fly out your back, which you see is large orbs of your urine, which then fly to the girl's hand, and is magically sealed into jars and flasked, charged with arcane energy, before vanishing into thin air. After eight or so of these leave you, you feel wholly relieved, and the magic seems to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... just happened?\" John inquisitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing ya 'nother 'victim' of that store. I can tell it my your aura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yes.\" John replies, shocked she figured it out without him saying a word about the two-piece bikini that he now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I too got changed by this place. Used to be a 32 mother of three. I also liked ta play vidya games, and every now an' then go to some conventions with my husband an do a little cosplay. Now, Halloween was coming up, and mah sheila wanted to go as a witch. I heard this store had a great costume section, and I figured I'd check to see what props I could get. While I was here, I also found props I thought I could use for my idea for a Team Fortress 2 Sniper cosplay. However, as I was getting those bloody props up, I never noticed my first initial changes. By the time I did, it was too late. Hilariously, the stuff I was getting for my girl and the things I was getting for me was working their magic on me at the same time, and their magics merged into one, turnin' me into some freakish hodgepodge 7-Year Old Australian Sniper Witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long ago was thi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two months ago.\" The little sniper witch resumed. \"When I returned home and tried to explain this, my husband couldn't take it. He... He left me, and took the kids with him.\" John could see her tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you tried to find a way to change back?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. You may 'ave thought wat I did back there was crackerjack, but that was actually rather mundane. I'm actually still learning my spellbook to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about trying other clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't know. I've tried staying away from this place or even thinking about it until today. If it hadn't of been for you, I would've gone in there and went on a shootin' rampage ta make them pay. But I saw you and felt your aura, and that's when I realized I wasn't the only one that has been affected by this store, and I couldn't do it anymore.\" She pauses for a bit. \"However, as for the clothes being the answer... Maybe there could a way to change back if you don just the right clothes, or you could just be stacking a whole bunch of strange eldritch transformations on ya'self, some of which messing with your very mind and soul, and if those happen, you may very well not remember, or care, about turning back. Catch mah drift, mate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" John nervous replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what now? ...By the way, the name's Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Grace. I'm John.\" John says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then John realized he had left mom and saw her wander into the store, and it already looked like she was grabbing something...</span></div></div>",

Haven't seen you before.\" She steps in, passing a woman and girl just outside she didn't recognize, one of which, if had told her, she would have never believed was her own son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far into the store, she saw a rack of rather alluring at best to downright slutty at worst street and clubwear on display proudly in the middle of the floor. She grabs one rack, a rack holding a pink lycra miniskirt with a white belt in it's belt loops, along with a white bikini top, exclaiming, \"Is this what young girls wear these days? For shame!!\" She looks at the top and shouts, \"I could fit my head in <b>ONE</b> of these cups!! Who did they make these for?\" About then, the clothes disappeared in a rush of smoke. \"The hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!! Mom!!\" That odd bikini-clad woman from the front of the store called to her as she ran up to her, with the gun-toting little witch in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do... Do I know you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me!! John!!\" she tries to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I being punked?\" John's mom asks, unaware of her enlarging bust and shrinking belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use trying to explain, at least with words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I explain everything... I mean, she just saw those clothes vanish, and she can't deny her tummy's going away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...\" John's mom looks down to see her new D-cup assets, a button flying off her shirt, but pushes them back to see her belly is almost flat now, but then she becomes more unnerved when golden blonde locks fall into her sight. \"What is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" John utters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said... 'at least without words.'\" Grace conjures her spellbook once more. \"I haven't tried this spell before, but I believe it's within my revenue of abilities...\" She puts her right hand to John's mother's tanning forehead, and her left to John's. \"Strem Tramfo Memorii!!\" Sparks course across Grace's body and both mother and son's glow. Finally, she let's go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John? Is that you?\" John's mom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" She says, brushing elongating blonde hairs out of her now hot 20-something face. \"I should have listened sooner, especially seeing as I saw clothes literally vanish into, like, thin air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace gasped, then turned to John. \"This isn't good. \"Your mother is undergoing mental changes as well!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Are you... okay?\" John questions his mother, whom had found a full-length mirror near the display she had just been bad-mouthing earlier, and was pouting her lips and watching them gain a hot pink luster with glitter sparkle and her eyelids got a vibrant jade eyeshadow. \"Ya know, you might have become a cute girl, but like, momma's hot!!\" John's jaw drops agape and blinks dumbfounded as his mom strikes a pose, her now itty-bitty stomach now paired with a waist that just finished contracting to the limits of feminine petiteness, and juxtaposed with her growing giant flared hips, which she shakes to one side as she rests her left hand on her left hip. Her butt goes from sagging to hard and firm, gaining a perfect heart shape. Her hair grew down to her butt as her breasts zoomed past the G-cup range into H-cups, her holding on by one button. John finally noticed one of the last things to change on his mom was her hazel eyes, turning into blazing blue eyes. \"Yeah, I am totes hot!! But my clothes are <b>SO</b> frumpy...\" John's mom comments on her final physical changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout then, her shirt begins to shrivel and merge with her tattered bra as the legs of the jeans shrink up her legs and begin to fuse up around her knees into a skirt. The shrinking shirt narrows drastically up top into tiny spaghetti straps as most of the shirt devolves into the cups from the bikini top from earlier, which manages to do its best expose as much breast tissue as it can get away with by law. Underboob, sideboob, topboob, maximum cleavage, John's mom was showing it. Meanwhile, her new skirt kept shrinking, turning hot pink and changing from denim to shiny lycra, resting atop her hips, it's lower hem barely covering her bum. Underneath, her underwear turned into a tight black thong, the tops of the straps popping out above her miniskirt. The belt from the outfit laced through the loops on the skirt and secured itself as her flats warped into knee-high 6-inch heeled white leather boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candi's totes like, a sexy mommy!!\" John's mom purrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" John interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, we should totes go clubbin' and find us sum steamin' hunks to play with!!\" Candi <i>(John's mom)</i> quips. She then twirls her perfectly manicured hot pink glitter tipped pinkie at the corner of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like that look, mate.\" Grace exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, one, that's gross, and two, you're married.\" John tries to remind his now bimbofied mom. \"What about dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at her wedding ring, which survived her transformation. \"Oh right. Kevin...\" It seemed like had a moment of lucidity, but then, \"Like, bring him along!! But first...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grace realizes what Candi was doing, and knew there was no time to dodge from this distance, so she makes a split-second decision. She begins to erect a barrier, focusing first on John, but before she can begin to defend herself, Grace found herself buried under a red and pink tartan micro-miniskirt and a white halter top that read \"Top Bitch\" in pink cursive on it. Before she can throw them off her, they dissipated into a waft of smoke and seemed to pool into her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss... At least I saved the boy...\" Grace smiles, before she looks over to see the outfit, a sexy teacher's cosplay outfit, was tattering on her barrier, but then the barrier broke, and fragments of what survived of the garment made it through snaring around John's arm before flickering for a moment then doing the same as it did to Grace. \"No. It was as I feared. My magic hadn't become strong yet to fight this accursed magic yet, and now... and now...\" Grace was finding she was getting distracted as the world seemed to be getting bigger... actually more she was growing back up. \"Right, I'm like, growing back up...\" Grace then looked down in fascination as while her height broke 5', her chest began to swell rapidly. \"I like, got boobies again!!\" John noticed all traces of her Australian accent was gone now, and that she looked like she for all purposes an 18 year old, as Grace's witch outfit began to shift, tearing in the middle, the lower half turning into that same micro-mini that hit her earlier. With her firming behind and flaring hips, the bottom of the skirt allowed John to see the bottom edge of her butt, not that Grace seemed to care anymore. Grace was also sporting a belly, waist, and legs to match your mother now, as her shoulder length white hair had taken mere moments to grow Grace's hips and turn a vibrant blonde. The top half of her witch's dress and her vest melted and shrank away into a halter top resembling the one from before, but now sporting a white and pink camo print on it, her now H-cup breasts hanging partway out the bottom and the sides, with nary any fabric on her back save a single spaghetti strap. Across the top of her breasts is written \"Top Witch\" instead of \"Top Bitch\" in red instead pink cursive, and above it is a giant heart-shaped hole cutout showing off gaping amounts of her cleavage. Finally, John saw Grace wearing 6-inch white wedge heel leather boots, as well as white knee-high fishnet stocking on her left leg, and a white and pink knee-high sock on her right leg. In fact, the only things to survive her bimbofication were her bandoleer, sniper rifle, and witch's hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace joined Candi at the mirror, and posed her butt for the mirror. That's when John saw two more things - Grace had a tribal tramp stamp over her butt crack, and that Grace wasn't wearing any underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow girl, you are totes hot!!\" Candi complimented Grace on her new bimbo bod. John blushed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis embarrassment, and his mother &amp; Grace's checking each other out, distracted him from own changed. However, something seemed off. Mana seemed to flicker around him like television static as his breasts went up from D's to F's. A blouse tried to materialize, shattered, and then finally appeared tied on, supporting his bikini-clad chest. A leather miniskirt took three attempts to manifest over his bikini bottom, sitting just under his navel. However, the magic failed to manifest the navy blue pair of heel it had in store. It was about the time the magic was putting John's hair into a bun, putting earrings in his ears, and slathering his lips crimson that John realized he was changing too. However, just as he was about to panic that he was going to join his mom and Grace in bimbo-dom, he noticed the changes winding down... if anything he felt just a little bit smarter, like he could grade a hundred papers on Dr. Zhivago... and also that he knew what Dr. Zhivago was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed Grace's efforts weren't entirely in vain after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Grace protected me from becoming like her. Now I have to figure out a way to fix us, or something... Now what? Think, John!!\"</span></div></div>",

He had made peace with the idea of losing his malehood already to have the chance to have the freedom to do what wanted just a moment ago, but did it also have to come with what he categorized in his head as \"agonizing diarrhea?\" His entire abdomen, back, head, and loins were nothing but pure fire and agony, but for some reason he couldn't scream out, like the pain was so great is choking him out. He felt his body heating up as he gripped the walls of the stall, straining, straining, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt something pass.

His growth spurt and new body assets disturbed his normal sense of balance as he was having a hard time getting used to this instant change. This dizzying sense was so different than all the times when he visited the theme park. At least there his body quickly adjusted to being on normal ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone firmly grabs his wrist, causing his body to stop moving around. He turns his head to where his rescuer saved him. She was wearing the store employee uniform like the ones he saw earlier when he came in except that she was wearing a black unbuttoned suit coat over it. There was a white tag that had a name on it which he couldn't make up because of his dizziness. He couldn't even see what she actually looked like, but he could tell it was a woman from her voice. Also to him, she looked exactly like she was the same height of him. He didn't actually think adults could be around the same size as children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" The store employee says, observing the problem at hand. \"Did you touch any of the swimwear on display?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, John responded, \"Yeah, accidentally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the? He thought after. What happened with my voice? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me your name and age.\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" His speech pattern was now slurring. \"My name is John...and I am...ten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he felt a headache coursing through. His other hand rested on top of his forehead. The side-effects of the transformation, of which he doesn't know about, were making its way by. This felt much worse than the pain before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" the employee continues. \"You'll have to come with me. A child like you shouldn't have come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" John mumbles. He gets dragged away by the strength of the woman's hand, feeling lethargic about all of this. Now his eyes were drooping. He wasn't sure if he could stay awake all the way to where she was taking him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The problem there was her voice was growing silent each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to be healed immediately,\" she says worriedly. \"Can you still walk fine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sense of touch had already disappeared.

The pain that was hurting him earlier seemed to disappear entirely. What a relief, he thought. His vision slowly becomes clearer after every passing second. On his left side there were blue curtains obstructing the glass window and on his right there was a desk, some chairs, and a mini fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAm I in a hotel? He wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn tried moving his hands around and realized that he can move his body just fine. What he does first is sitting up on the back of the wall because staring at the ceiling directly wasn't a thing he wants to see all day. Simultaneously adjusting his hands and feet, he pushes himself up and successfully makes it. The room now looks much better at this angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down to his left where there was a small table carrying a telephone and a lamp. I must be in a hotel, he figures. Was that lady from earlier taking him to this place to heal him?  He should be in a hospital instead of a hotel, but he feels better nonetheless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this bed is comfy!\" John whispers. His sense of attention was focused on the comfortable mattress. He moves his body up and down experiencing the springiness, but after a few seconds there was a heavy feeling on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down there were two big mounds of flesh right on his body covered by a navy blue fabric. What is this? He thought to himself.  Touching one of them with the palm of his hand, he suddenly gets a sensitive reaction for no apparent reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsn't this the bikini? John thought, remembering the one he saw on display at the store. The fabric covering his chest was the same color. Then what am I wearing below? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white blanket covered lower half of his body and after removing it, there it was: the bikini bottom. Immediately, he realizes that his body was different and stares at his hands and legs seeing that they were not the same. He then feels his face, thinking that there was something different about it too. Sitting down on the bed, he couldn't see for himself if he actually changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn escapes the bed and tries to find the bathroom which was conveniently the first door he sees, and inside he comes face to face with his new self on the mirror. Is this me? He wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflection showed an adult woman with long hair and a beautiful face while wearing a strapless bikini top and bottom over her curvaceous figure. </span></div></div>",

Something about him now made him look so appealing like those pictures of women he would see in department store magazines--the ones wearing those swimsuits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did they pose like?\" He asks himself while thinking in his mind of the magazines he saw. He attempts to replicate some of those poses right in front of the mirror, but eventually he stopped after a few tries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current problem for him was why he was here and why does he look like a swimsuit model. Leaving the bathroom, John noticed the door of his hotel room. He heads over and checks if he could get out. Luckily for him the door opened as he pressed the handle. He puts on a pair of open-toed sandles he found lying near the door beforing venturing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway when he got outside had the unkempt atmosphere he felt when he was in his room. No one seemed to be in the hallway right now. He looks at the walls to find a directory to where the elevators were; they were on the other side of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn begins sprinting over to the hallway elevators. While running, he felt like his body was slowing him down; primarily in his chest area. The breasts he had were bouncing with every step he took.

The numbers on the screen count downward before stopping at the pool. Along the way a small tune played in the speakers up above. John waited patiently while holding onto the railing. He felt a little scared since he was doing this by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator shaft opens, allowing him to walk freely on this level. He notices that it must be night from looking out a glass window. He also sees a large open pool outside with the light posts still illuminating the ground. So cool! He thought. He had never seen a pool that big in his entire life. How fun it would be for him to take a dip in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore John could go and enter this area, he notices a worker locking the entrance outside. The worker notices him (her) and says, \"Miss, it's already 11 o'clock and right now the pool is closed. If you want, the pool lounge hot tub and sauna is still open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut John did not want to go to that area; he was so keen on swimming in the pool. \"I want to swim here,\" he begs while approaching the worker. \"Can I? Only for a few minutes.\"  His eyes gleam with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe notices the worker unlocking the keys to the door. The worker's face blushed a mild red. Unbeknownst to John, how he approached the worker with his body tempted the worker to follow his wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only fifteen minutes and no more than that,\" says the worker. He felt a bit guilty that he allowed a hot, young woman into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn enters the pool room and he was astonished by how much bigger it was right up close. He walks along the edge and stops after going half-way. \"Cannonball!\" He shouts as he makes a high jump into the pool. The water felt immediately cold on the surface of his skin, but as he swam around it gradually started to feel warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the only person swimming, he understood what it was like to be an adult in the adult swim time. He had an entire pool all to himself. And because he was bigger, he was able to swim further into the deep end. \"Yes!  He shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifteen minutes the worker calls John saying that his time was up. He also says that this will be the only time where he will grant this. John already did what he wanted in the pool, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the pool drenched, he...</span></div></div>",

When he was with his family at parties, the hot tubs were off-limits for some reason. Apparently his parents said that they were for \"grown ups only\" before going into those hot tubs themselves. However John now had the body of a swimsuit model so he thinks he can go to the pool lounge. They did look like adults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was still wet from swimming in the large pool but he didn't have a towel he could dry off of. Still he walked to where the worker said the pool lounge was. Stopping by a mirror, he looks at himself. He still found it strange to look like someone with this type of body; yet he felt a little smitten with his appearance. Swimsuit models don't really play in the water, he thought. Normally they would wait at the side and sit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sign labeled \"Coral Outcove\" was above an entranceway covered by blue drapes. This must have been the pool lounge the worker told him about. He pushes the drapes aside where everything was mostly quiet except for a couple talking in the corner while having drinks and a couple of gentlemen having an all-out game of billiards. A woman dressed in a bikini was watching the game unfold. The hot tub and sauna was set aside in a completely different portion of this lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn thought that this place seemed a bit boring, but he chose on staying here for some time before leaving. He felt his throat to be a little parched. Maybe he should get a drink from somewhere. He finds a bar near one of the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I get for you, sweetheart?\" Asks the bartender when John approached him. \"Drinks are on the house.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsn't that what dad says to mom? John wondered. He sees the selection of drinks the bar set in stock. Now it was time for him to do something more daring. \"Uh,\" he replies, \"Can I have a Coke Zero?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" says the bartender as he fills a glass full of soda and ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom never lets me have soda, John thought. I don't know what beer tastes like but it smells weird. He sips some of the Coke Zero and feels a burst of energy going around his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sits on a barstool while he thinks of going to the hot tub and sauna or talk with the other people in the lounge. The ones playing billiards sound interesting.</span></div></div>",

From the looks of it, it was a 1v1 sort of game. He didn't know the basics of playing that game. All he knows of it was from the specials on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the woman wearing a bikini observing this game. She was sipping from a wine glass as she focused intently--at least trying to look like it. Her eyes veered off a few times at random places in the lounge from the sleek walls to the entrances to the hot tub and sauna. Her attention was still on thd game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I sit here?\" John asked while approaching here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure,\" replies the lady. \"It's been getting boring ever since those two jerks betted on who would take me out for dinner. It's already past that time, and they are still going at it.\" She was looking pretty irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said John in a surprised way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me introduce myself. My name's Mildred and your name is?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn wasn't so sure on what he should call himself. It would be weird if he stuck with his original name since he now looked like a model. His imaginative mind does its best to come up with a girly name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joanne,\" John replied. \"It is a pleasure to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the best I could do?

I had enough with their rivalry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn only took a look at the gentlemen for a few seconds. They were still dedicated into finishing that match. He quietly backs up from his seat to follow Mildred, who was going to the hot tub room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going into this room,\" she says when she stopped in front of a room. She pulls out a plastic card from her bikini top. \"Veteran stayers get the extra perk of using the private hot tub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she has been here before, John thought. The woman slides the card down the locked door. With the turning of the handle, the private hot tub was in use. Right before the hot tub was a towel rack, a mini bar, lounge chairs, and a closet with an open mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEncasing the private room was a glass exterior that had a view of what looks like a city skyline on the distance. There was a beach nearby as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me tell you a fun fact, Joanne,\" Mildred says. \"The glass that you see is actually a one-way mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" John exclaimed. \"I can't see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly girl. That is because you have to be outside to see the difference. The reason they have it was so that people could skinny dip privately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skinny dip? What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No waiting around. I'm heading inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn followed Mildred inside the hot tub. Just like when he entered the pool, the water made his skin feel sensitive, but as he slowly got used to it, the water felt quite nice. It was very warm and he could feel the jets of water streaming around his body. He stares up at the clear sky as he relaxed. Across from him, Mildred was sighing in relief. Only the area above her neck was not submerged into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is skinny dipping?\" John asks her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never ever heard of the term, huh?\" She faces his eyes. \"To put it in a similie, it's like bathing in the bathroom, but in a public area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..., John thought. \"There is no way I want to do that. It's too humiliating.\" He realizes why her body was submerged. \"Are you doing it right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Mildred stands up from her seat, revealing in fact she kept her bikini on this entire time. \"Joanne, I would only do it if I was alone.\" She slowly goes back to how she sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of silence in the hot tub, the two talked with each other in a long conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The commute to work is long, but it is worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sees Mildred getting up from her seat to grab a can of beer from the mini bar. After opening the can, she chugs the entire drink in one take. She soon returns into her usual spot at the hot tub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do you work at?\" John asks her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's mostly photoshoot stuff. I work in front of the camera in whatever outfit the director wants me to be in, which are almost always swimsuits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swimsuit model...\" John says. \"I only see them in the front of magazines and that's about it. I don't see you on those covers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I'm in the in the magazine. The editors just pick the girls that show off the best sex appeal for men.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMildred looks at John thoroughly for a couple of seconds. Her eyes move up and down his (female) body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually you might be a good contedor for the cover. To put it briely, you've got the body to wow consumers. So maybe that's why you were embarrassed to skinny dip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked down at his reflection on the moving water. He almost forgot that he now had the body of a woman. He had a very feminine appearance that complemented his curvy body. His chest was very large but it was held behind the strapless bikini top. His skin also was very smooth. Realizing the potential he had made him almost be attracted to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am honestly sure you do have it,\" Mildred says. \"Anyways...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and Mildred continued their conversation for some ten to twenty minutes.</span></div></div>",

In reality it was actually John's family that did it but he phrased it in a way to make it seem like \"Joanne\" was just a witness. That was the best story he could have thought of after hearing about the origin of Mildred's name earlier ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn grabbed a towel nearby and tossed another one to Mildred. So refreshing, he thought when he dried himself. He felt great knowing that he used a hot tub for the first time. He looked in the mirror to see himself looking dry except for his swimwear. It was dripping wet down on the floor and the quality was different to when it was dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joanne, there are clothes in the closet you can change into the hotel provided,\" Mildred says to him. Her body was wrapped inside her towel. \"Go ahead if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" John responded. He pulls open the closet handle revealing a wide small hallway with clothes arranged according to type. Closing the door behind him, he goes and picks out his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe selection right before him was like the time he was in the department store. However, he could probably assume that these clothes won't change him whatsoever. His hand touches a shirt nearby, but the shirt did not disappear at all. Now with that out of the way, there was a moderate selection of clothes for him to choose from. Even with his child mind, most of the clothes looked too small for his swimsuit body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, there was a set of clothes he had chosen. He grabs the set of clothes along with a different colored bikini bottom for underware and lies them down in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow how do I take this bikini top off? John asked himself. His hands try to take off the top like removing a shirt, but it didn't seem to budge at all. He moves his hands behind the top and realizes that there was something that held the top in place. With some effort, he was able to unlock it as the bikini top fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the closet there was a mirror on the end reflecting John's female topless body in front of him. Huh, my body is feeling looser and bouncy, he thought when looking at the mirror. He wasn't mature enough to understand what he was seeing, but he hopped in place a few times to see his chest trying to catch up with his movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter playing around a bit, he proceeds to put on his new clothing. The top he chose was similar to the strapless bikini he wore but it was white and had no emphasis of looking like swimwear. All the sleeved and sleeveless shirts were too small. For pants, he found a pair of jeans that fitted him quite nicely. He looked in the mirror and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That setup looks great on you,\" Mildred says as John exited with his wet swimwear. \"I'm changing next but you don't have to wait for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mildred walks inside the closet, he wonders if he should wait or leave already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Was this going to be the start of a new life for him? Jumping from an average 10-year-old boy to a swimsuit model? The thought concerned him, but he thought back to the store employee. He could hopefully get back there, but what about Mildred? He really wanted to be friends with her, but a grown woman and a young boy like himself having a friendship was just unheard of. His slightly stressful thought process had given him a tight grip on the bikini that started it all but before he could ponder any longer, Mildred was back out of the closet wearing some denim shorts and a black halter top. \"So, you wanna go shopping together?\" Mildred asked 'Joanne'. \"Mall's open 24 hours, though some of the stores might not be.\" Mall? This could be his chance to get his life back! If it was the mall he was thinking of... Still, he had to take the chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" John said with a burst of enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Mildred exclaimed, slipping her own sandals back on, \"Honestly, I model a lot of outfits but I don't actually go clothes shopping as often as I want to.\" John was slightly confused by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you just keep the outfits?\" John's question made Mildred laugh a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish, but unfortunately that's not how it works, Joanne.\" Mildred and John went back into the lounge, seeing that the men playing billiards were now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder who won?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't really care to be honest,\" Mildred nonchalantly replied. \"I'd much rather go out shopping with a new friend than go on a date with one of those himbos.\" Himbo? Like, a boy bimbo? John was learning so much from Mildred, though being called a friend reminded him of the complicated scenario Mildred was causing. Maybe Joanne could be his alter ego switching back and forth? But he didn't know if he could switch back, a thought that made John shudder. As they walked to the elevator, Mildred started more conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My car or yours?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't actually have a car,\" John explained, to Mildred's visible confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No car? I honestly cannot imagine living without my car with how often and how far I have to drive,\" Mildred stated, \"how do you live without a car?\" Mildred's question had a comical air to it as they got into the elevator and went to ground floor but John was slightly stumped. What was he supposed to say now? 'Oh, yeah, my parents drive me everywhere'? He had to think of something quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I just kinda... don't really go to many places, and I prefer walking,\" he said, internally wiping sweat off his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that makes sense. You just here for the pool, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, actually,\" John was so thankful Mildred practically gave him an answer, the rest of the trip outside going by like a breeze as they made more small talk about the hotel on the way, a mention of John's quick dip in the pool from earlier making Mildred a bit jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they stepped outside John could identify they were in the same city he lived in and breathed a sigh of relief. He even realized he and his family had drove past the hotel before, he just didn't recognize it from the inside. Luckily, this meant they were going to the mall that changed him... if the store was still open. \"So here's my car, it's not much but it gets the job done.\" John's mind couldn't really think of many other words to describe the car, since it was just... a car like most others. It was blue. That's about it. John instinctively went to get into the back as Mildred got into the driver's seat. \"Why are you in the back? Who do you think's getting in with us?\" John was slightly embarrassed at Mildred's observation as he got back out and into the front passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just kinda used to it, you know?\" John awkwardly laughed. Being in the front like a grown-up wasn't something he'd experienced much before as a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can relate.\" Mildred pulled the car keys out of her bra and started the car up, then looked at John's chest. \"Honestly, Joanne, I get the feeling you could help me carry a looooot of things with that rack,\" she pointed out as she put the keys in their warm pocket. \"Actually, putting that wet bikini between those girls might be a good idea so that your pockets don't get all wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just use pockets for your stuff? It doesn\u2019t look wet,\" John asked, taking Mildred's suggestion and putting the swimwear between his soft breasts, thankfully a bit warmer and more dry from where he was carrying it as they started to drive off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I'm used to not wearing clothes with pockets, so I keep a lot of things in my bra,\" Mildred explained, pulling out of the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of driving and listening to the radio, they were finally at the mall. It was practically a victory lap now. Get into the store, get his life back and... pray it went to plan, John shuddered. \"Well, here we are!\" Mildred announced, as John was anxious but hopeful as they walked in. Was it open? Was it open? Was it open? John's mind had to find out, while Mildred's mind was moreso just on what new clothes she'd find as they walked in through the mall doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here,\" John said with confidence as Mildred obliged, curious as to what her new friend was running off for, and wished she had her phone to pass some time by absentmindedly scrolling through Twitter or something. John, meanwhile, was excited as he went up the escalators. Sure enough, the store popped into his line of sight, and it was...</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t get a good look at her before but he just guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, ma\u2019am, what can I-\u201d The clerk froze for a second as she saw John again. \u201cWait, you\u2019re the kid who wandered in here and passed out, aren\u2019t you? Josh, was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn,\u201d he corrected her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank god you at least found your way back here from the hotel,\u201d she said, an air of relief washing over her. \u201cWe were expecting you would need to sleep a lot longer like most other people with such a reaction to a swap like that, but now that you\u2019re all healed up, follow me. How did you get back here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I kinda met this woman at the hotel, and we decided to go here to shop together, but she kinda doesn\u2019t know about the whole thing with the magic bikini,\u201d John explained, causing the clerk to suck some air in through her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooooooh, this might cause some issues...\u201d The clerk\u2019s worried sentence didn\u2019t help John\u2019s fears. They had arrived at the back room now, though, and there was a rack of clothes there. \u201cWhere is that bikini, anyway?\u201d As the clerk asked and put on some rubber gloves, John just pulled the two pieces out of his cleavage, and the clerk picked them up. They were mostly dry now, but she could easily see how wrinkled they were. \u201c...Did you swim in the hot tub somehow or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh...\u201d John said, feeling slightly guilty as the clerk pinched the bridge of her nose in slight frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? Between your new friend and this being unsellable now, you can just keep the bikini. For free. I know you don\u2019t have any money of your own right now.\u201d The clerk\u2019s statement did somewhat comfort John, as she handed the bikini back. \u201cI'll have to pay for it myself... Better than it being thrown out, and at least it wasn't a more valuable one, I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what about changing me back?\u201d John asked, as the clerk was immediately jolted by the reminder of what they were here for as John put the bikini back in his cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight! Yes, your clothes,\u201d the clerk began fishing through the rack. \u201cIn accordance with store policy, accidental transformees get their clothes back for free, such as yours,\u201d she said, pulling out a couple coathangers with John\u2019s Transformers shirt and denim shorts on them. \u201cLike the bikini, just touch them while transformed and you'll transform back to normal. Passing out like you did always only happens the first time from what we've seen, you\u2019ll be fine changing back and forth if you keep hold of these and the bikini. Word of advice:If you decide to change back after leaving the store, take the clothes you\u2019re wearing right now off so they don\u2019t wind up back on this rack.\u201d The clerk put the clothes into a shopping bag and handed it to John, who was greatly excited. It all went as he\u2019d hoped, and the relief was immeasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe did find your family at the mall and inform them of the situation, and we agreed to send you back tomorrow,\u201d the clerk further explained. \u201cIf you want to keep your little charade going, you can stay out for now but go back to that hotel to sleep so we can pick you up at 10 AM tomorrow and take you home as originally planned and pretend you were asleep until then, or we can take you back home now. Oh, and just to prove it:the secret word is Big Rainbow Fish.\u201d John pondered this choice, and decided to...</span></div></div>",

You should consider that it's getting a bit late though,\" the clerk said as they both left the back room, and John excitedly went back down the escalator and jogged over to reunite with Mildred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Joanne, what were you up to?\" Mildred asked her excited friend, perking up too at \u2018Joanne\u2019s\u2019 return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just picking something up I kinda left here,\" John answered. \"So what do you wanna do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, probably go clothes shopping?\" Mildred had a playful sarcasm about her voice, but then John realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, I kinda forgot to grab some money...\" In truth, John pretty much had no money, what with him being 10 and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries,\" Mildred said, reaching into her bra again to show 'Joanne' her debit card, \"I should have enough on here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much stuff do you have stored in that bra?\" John asked in slight curiosity, initially just recieving a small laugh from Mildred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much other than my hotel card, debit card and keys,\" Mildred revealed. \"I've heard there's this one new clothes store up there, I wonder what kinda stuff they have in it?\" Mildred's question made John unsure what to think, as the expert woman and the rookie woman walked over to the escalator and went up. Mildred and 'Joanne' looked around at the stores, including the store that started it all. \"Wait, does the new store not have a sign?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, seems like it,\" John observed as he was slightly worried about what might happen if he and Mildred went in there.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cEh, I\u2019ll go with the usual place,\u201d Mildred chose as she walked to the mall\u2019s normal clothes store and John\u2019s new, longer legs carried him to where his new friend was going with relief. While he normally hated clothes shopping, doing girl things as a woman was a surprisingly fun idea to him, especially now that he was assured he didn't have to be like this forever. And besides, with the skimpy top he got from the hotel, his navel was feeling a bit cold. Or maybe it was the \u2018lady brain\u2019 settling in, John thought with a doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are!\u201d Mildred exclaimed, as the two stepped into the store. John had been here with his family many times, though this time would be very different, and not just because it was night. \u201cHonestly, I have no idea why they\u2019d open a new clothes store here when we already have this one,\u201d Mildred observed. \u2018You have no idea is right!\u2019 John\u2019s thought made him smirk to himself as they looked around, and quickly John was deep into looking at the selection of tops more than he\u2019d ever been. So many different colors, so many different sizes, so many different pictures... He picked up a Mario shirt and bought it to his chest, and seeing his boobs again made John remember he was technically Joanne, a woman, at the moment, so he put the shirt back and he awkwardly made his way out of the kid\u2019s section and made his way to the women\u2019s section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMildred was already here but was too invested in looking at the clothes to immediately notice \u2018Joanne\u2019, who felt slightly less interested looking at all the women\u2019s tops he didn\u2019t know the proper names of. Joanne... the name was growing on him. Still, as he looked down, being used to the sight of his own cleavage at this point, he didn\u2019t even know what the one he was wearing was called. It wasn\u2019t quite a bra but it obviously wasn\u2019t a shirt... Well, Mildred was still here, so he might as well ask now that he\u2019s curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMildred, what\u2019s this top I\u2019m wearing called?\u201d John asked, snapping Mildred out of her trance for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bandeau,\u201d Mildred answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d John said, satisfied he now knew. The two went back to looking, since he didn\u2019t really know much about women\u2019s fashion he decided to just get something that would cover his slightly chilly stomach up, and immediately he picked up a black shirt. It looked like a T-shirt, but for some reason it was buttoned only on the top and was already partially unbuttoned, and even then the neck hole was big. Even if it was odd to him, it looked like it\u2019d be a bit more comfortable, so he immediately took it to a changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he got in, he immediately took off the bandeau and put his shopping bag down, put the shirt on and buttoned it up to find that despite still giving off some cleavage it was uncomfortably tight on his endowed female chest, so he unbuttoned it back to how it was when he picked it up. \u2018Why would they have buttons on it if it\u2019s not meant to be buttoned up?\u2019 he thought to himself. As soon as he thought that, he realised that even with the few buttons still buttoned, it was still a bit tight, so he had to completely unbutton it to be comfortable. This exposed his cleavage even more than the bandeau, but they felt warm enough to him so he didn\u2019t mind. What he did mind was that his more sensitive female nipples had really felt the cool air somehow, and were poking out way more noticeably than with the bandeau. \u2018Is this why girls have bras?\u2019 he thought. He picked up the bandeau and looked at it. There was no way it was going to work as a bra for a shirt like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the changing room with the bandeau in his shopping bag and the shirt still on, he looked around and saw the bra section but somehow didn\u2019t notice the looks a couple shoppers gave his erect nipples. Looking at the underwear on display, he felt the need to get one that matched the bikini bottom he was wearing as underwear... which color was it? He pulled his jeans forward to check, causing a couple shoppers to double take, finding they were purple. He immediately picked up a purple bra he saw and walked back. He had no idea how bra sizes were measured, but fortunately he had correctly guessed a bra that perfectly fit his swimsuit body and took it back to the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the bra on, it was undeniably an improvement for John. Having luckily guessed the right size and luckily being able to hide the bra under the shirt, he was now completely comfortable. Well, there were the tags, but his mother taught him not to take those off before buying clothes. His first bra... John was proud for an odd reason, though much like when he was a boy he wasn't the one paying for these clothes, so he had to ask Mildred. Walking back outside the changing room, John excitedly went over to Mildred to show her the clothes he found, noticing she\u2019d picked up a fair few clothes herself but hadn\u2019t really changed from her top, shorts and sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMildred, can I have this?\u201d The question that John had asked instinctively after saying it to his parents many times as a boy caused Mildred\u2019s eyes to immediately dart to his rather \u2018feminine\u2019 chest to remind him he was a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, Joanne, you\u2019re gonna make me jealous with that top!\u201d she said with a little bit of a laugh, though John did now feel a little bit guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I can change it if you\u2019re not comfortable with it!\u201d \u2018Joanne\u2019 replied, worried he might have upset Mildred. \u2018Why do big boobs apparently look good to grown-ups, anyway?\u2019 he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s cool, I\u2019m just joking around,\u201d Mildred reassured \u2018Joanne\u2019, \u201cNothing wrong with showing off some assets, and it really suits you. So is it just the top?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd a bra,\u201d \u2018Joanne\u2019 said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool, you wanna get anything else?\u201d Mildred asked. \u201cI\u2019m pretty much done, but anything for a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, I don't really know much about fashion...\u201d \u2018Joanne\u2019 awkwardly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I could hear that earlier,\u201d Mildred said with a laugh. \u201cYou want me to give you a few lessons, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn thought for a moment, and decided...</span></div></div>",

John did wonder how the total price of all the items didn't seem to faze Mildred, though. Was she rich or something? He felt it might be rude to ask directly, though, and might lead into more difficult questions that he didn\u2019t really know how to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was pretty fun even if it was short,\" Mildred said, \"but where should we go now?\" John and Mildred both pondered the question, but an answer came from their stomachs with a mighty rumble in unison, and they both looked at each other and thought the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women (well, physically women, anyway) immediately made their way to the food court with their shopping bags in hand, since they had gotten absolutely famished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you gonna get?\" Mildred asked 'Joanne'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely a burger... maybe some fries,\" John said, eager to get something in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm probably gonna get a salad, but I guess we can all have a cheat day sometimes,\" Mildred responded, causing John to blush with a smile, remembering he now had a figure to maintain. He thought. He would probably have to ask at the magic store about the details of the transformation some other time, but soon enough, they were at the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, what can I get you two?\" the male cashier asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019ll take a burger and a Coke,\" John said, feeling a bit more grown-up despite his childish lack of much conscious concern for his new figure. And the fact he still wasn't paying himself, but still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, and you?\" The cashier asked, looking at Mildred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Mildred said, hand to chin. She was looking at the menu in contemplation. John didn\u2019t really know why she seemed to have trouble with choosing, but really he'd tempted her into getting something. \"Salad and a bottle of water,\" she eventually picked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, their food was paid for and their feminine butts were parked on their chairs to eat, both immediately getting into their respective foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it again?\" John asked after swallowing part of his burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about...\" Mildred looked around to try and see a clock between mouthfuls. \"35 minutes past midnight,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, it's midnight?\" John said in surprise. Was he ever up that late before? Mildred chewed and swallowed for a moment before responding, prompting John to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think we've got time to visit one, maybe two stores after we're done eating before we should sleep,\" Mildred said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've got to get up at 10 AM,\" John explained after another bite out of his burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I've got to keep my sleep schedule in check for my job,\" Mildred said as she dug into her salad again. John could tell this might lead into another conversation, though he wasn't complaining. Mildred was surprisingly pretty cool and fun to talk to for a grown-up. \"I picked the last one, so what store do you want to go to after we\u2019re done eating?\" Mildred's question made John look at some of the open stores. He still wanted to feel like he was doing grown-up shopping, but he also wanted to go someplace his still boyish mind was more interested in. Eventually, though, he decided on...</span></div></div>",

Childish? With the kind of stuff in them nowadays?\" Mildred chewed and swallowed a small bit of what was left of her salad, as John was reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right,\" John said, comforted. When they both decided they'd had enough food, they took their drinks and bags and headed to the game store. As was probably expected, there were only a few people in the store at this time. John walked in, Mildred following by, as he'd just now realised he could buy the more mature-rated games for himself. Well, Mildred would be buying them, making him feel slightly guilty, but it was still a dream come true! But what to get? John looked around the shelves in contemplation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, some of these look pretty interesting,\" Mildred said as she looked around, \"You're probably gonna have to introduce me to some games sometime. Did you bring any to the hotel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't really bring much with me to the hotel,\" John said. 'Other than the swimsuit which was the only clothing I had with me when I woke up after passing out at a magic store because it transformed me into a woman,' he continued in a thought, slightly amused at how Mildred had no clue about the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that sucks.\" Mildred was a little disappointed, but they quickly went back to looking around, and John immediately grabbed a Call of Duty game off the shelf. He'd played it so many times at friends' houses, yet he was never allowed to buy it himself. Now, he could make the rules. The bikini that once felt like what could have been the end of his life was quickly becoming the best thing that ever happened to him. He could get any games he wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... Before the power could go to his head, looking around he couldn't really see many games catch his interest. It was just the Call of Duty one that looked interesting to him. Maybe it really was the 'lady brain'? \"There doesn't seem to me much interesting stuff here,\" John said to... no one. \"Mildred?\" Where'd she go? Looking around now he was tall enough to look over the aisles, to his surprise he saw her looking at some of the PC games. Well, she did show a little bit of interest in games earlier. John walked Joanne's feminine legs over to the PC aisle, but bumped into someone along the way. \"Sorry,\" he said, looking at who it was.

John knew that when grown-ups used that tone of voice, it was best to not press further, and he continued to walk over to Mildred. He did try to look past his breasts though, playing with them in his hands to try and see if he had gotten something on his new shirt.

It was most likely a modern PC release of a much older game. \"What\u2019d you get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just this,\" John said as he showed Mildred the Call of Duty game he picked up. \"I didn\u2019t really see much else that was very interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" Mildred said. \"So, I guess it\u2019s just these two we\u2019re getting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" John said, as the two began walking to the counter and the cashier begun checking out their games, totaling 70 dollars, and the duo were on their way out after Mildred paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to pay me back for this sometime,\" Mildred said playfully as they left the store, causing John to laugh a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2019ll try,\" John replied. He was feeling more and more like a woman. \"But what are we doing now?\" John asked, making Mildred look around in an attempt to answer his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I\u2019m not really sure,\" she eventually said. \"Do you know any other stores we can go to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really,\" John said. \"It is getting kinda late though. We might want to go back to the hotel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we should probably go, but I\u2019m still kinda curious about that new store,\" Mildred said. Unlike earlier, John was feeling a lot more confident about it. \"Do you think we should take a quick look around before going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn replied...</span></div></div>",

The duo began to walk back to the car, their shopping officially done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn not much time, they were back in the car,driving back to the hotel with their shopping bags in the back and the radio on. Unlike the first time in the car, John was quite relaxed; there were no worries about new lives or lost identities, he'd just get back to the hotel, maybe play around in the hotel room for a bit, go to sleep, get up, change back, go home, and it'd all be smooth sailing... But wait, how would he contact Mildred after he went home?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, do you think you could give me like, a phone number or some way to contact you?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can probably write my number down when we get there if that'll work,\" Mildred answered. With that out of the way, the drive went by without much chatter. John mentally told himself to remember the name of the song on the radio and admired the night city. While his mind was still very much that of a 10-year-old boy, he felt more... mature somehow. Maybe the 'lady brain' had changed him for the better, if that was a thing in the first place. Thanks to that store, John had gone from an average boy to a boy with two lives, like some kind of superhero, and being a grown woman was surprisingly interesting. This was definitely a night to remember, and was definitely not the last time 'Joanne' was going to come out to play. For now, though, they had made it back to the hotel. Not much talk was made as they walked to the elevator and went to Mildred's room, and she wrote her number down on some paper. It was much like John's room, but it had a laptop showing a lock screen on the desk next to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here is my number,\" Mildred said with a yawn as she passed a piece of paper to 'Joanne' in the hallway. \"Well, I should be going to sleep soon, but is there anything else you want to do together real quick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn thought, and answered...</span></div></div>",

Good night, Joanne,\" Mildred said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Mildred,\" John said back. Mildred shut the door with a smile, and John was once again a lone boy in a woman's body in a hotel, albeit less confused than before. He put the piece of paper in his shopping bag and walked back to his room, feeling confident, satisfied and happy. When he made it back to his room and shut the door, he turned the light on, kicked his sandals off, left the shopping bag next to the bed, unbuttoned and unzipped his jeans, pulled them down, sat his nice ass on the bed and started to undress, leaving his jeans on the floor next to the shopping bag. He took his shirt off in a boyish way, putting it on top of the jeans, and also took the bra off since it was bugging him now, and put it on the pile of clothes that was forming. He was now almost nude in his new body, and free to do whatever he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he decided to change back, at least for a little bit. He was starting to miss his original body. Not wanting to try walking back to the store just for a bikini bottom, he took the last remaining article of clothing off and put it on the bed next to him, not really paying much interest to what lied underneath. Then, he grabbed the shopping bag and emptied it out onto the bed. Mildred's number, his new game, the bandeau, the bikini that started it all, and of course his boy clothes fell out, which he immediately touched, expecting them to disappear... but they didn\u2019t. What was going on? Well, after a bit of waiting, the clothes slithered over to him, the shirt snaking over his torso and pushing the neck hole over his head, stretching out to get his arms in as well, while his shorts climbed up his legs. After that strange dress-up, he realized how tight the newly-magical clothes were now he was a woman. He walked over to the bathroom, checking himself out in the mirror. It was a miracle they weren't breaking like before, either that or the magic made them tougher. They were more reinforced than they were when they weren't magic, and it was kinda hilarious to see Optimus Prime stretched out over his female chest. Thankfully, though, they did do their job and slimmen his curvier body, pulling his hips and breasts back into a flat, boyish physique, and shrink him down to his original size. He de-aged back to ten, his face became boyish, and his hair pulled itself back into what it was before. Oh, and his underwear re-materialized under his shorts, as well as his shoes and socks. As nice as being Joanne was, it was still great to be back in his real body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to be back!\" John said, comforted to hear his regular voice again after feeling the strange sensations from earlier in reverse. Walking back to the main room, it was somewhat jarring being so small in a room he'd only been in as an adult. Still, though, it was nice to be free of worry and fully left to his own devices, free to do whatever he wanted, in whichever body he wanted. Looking at the clock, though, he saw that 1 AM had passed a little while ago. Really, that late? But he wasn't really all that tired. Should he sleep now, or stay up for a little while longer?</span></div></div>",

He looked in the closet of the hotel room out of curiosity, and it had clothes in it. Women's clothes, though, that looked like they'd suit Joanne. Something in him wanted to try them on, but John decided to have some fun with the newly-discovered feature of the magical clothes first. He took his boy clothes back off and set them on the bed except his shoes, and then touched the swimsuit. Surely enough, the swimsuit actually started moving off the bed towards him! Playful child he still was, however, he ran away from it. As the swimwear moved to his new position, he went on top of the bed to get away from them, careful not to mess with the stuff on it, and dropped down on the other side, causing the swimwear to slide under the bed. This wouldn't be enough to catch John, though, who ran into the bathroom and locked the door to see what would happen. He could hear the quiet sounds of the swimsuit rubbing against the door, trying and failing to get in, and giggled. \"Can't catch me now!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of listening to the magic bikini trying to get through a door and getting bored, John unlocked and opened the door. \"Game's over,\" he said as the boy was clothed by the feminine swimwear. The bottoms stretched and slid under his feet and crawled up his small legs to cover his private areas, and the top crawled up one leg and up his torso, stopping at his chest and clasping itself. The transformation from the morning repeated;got taller, got rounder, got older, you know. John could tell he would probably re-live that same transformation a lot tonight. \"Actually feels quite nice when it's not unexpected,\" he said to himself. However, transforming back into Joanne made him realize something;the remains of the burger he ate earlier disappeared when he turned back into John, but came back when he turned back into Joanne, and it made him realize he had to use the bathroom he was in. Pulling his bottoms down, John's now-larger rear plopped on the toilet, no door lock required as he was the only one there. His first female urination felt a lot different than his usual male ones, feeling more like the pee was naturally just leaking out rather than being pushed out. After that, though, on came the encore. Pooping felt mostly the same, aside from sitting on his wider hips and meatier cheeks. While cleaning up, John learned by experiencing for himself that women had to wipe both ends. All in all, the most unique bathroom break he had ever taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his bottoms back up, he looked at the hotel bath and towels in contemplation. Doing his business as a woman was one thing. Taking a bath or a shower all on his own, in a different body to boot? That could be kinda interesting. John decided to...</span></div></div>",

Walking back into the main room, John decided to try and clean up a bit since the mess he made was bothering him. He put the stuff he emptied out back into the bag, the game, the number, and the bandeau, then put the black shirt, and the jeans in too. When he got to his boy clothes, he pulled the black shirt out again and used it to put them in, hoping it'd work like the store employee's gloves and not change him - and thankfully, it worked. He decided to take the bikini off too and put it in the bag since he didn't think it'd be necessary for the rest of the night, but while he was putting the bikini back in the bag, he noticed some white text on the inside of the top. It was a product ID, the materials the bikini was made from, and a number labeled \"customer service and inquiries\". He decided he might call that later, since he was curious about a few things, but then put the bra and bottoms on because his attention was brought back to the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening it up now he was Joanne again, he looked at the selection of clothes in there. 'Why am I so excited about trying on women's clothing?' John thought to himself. 'Eh, as long as I'm having fun,' he shrugged. Looking through the selection, what caught John's eye was a nice red sleeveless dress which he just HAD to try on. He took it off the coat hanger and pulled the bottom over his head and put it on like a shirt, though his newly acquired melons did get in the way of putting it on they did fit just right in the dress, which showed a bit of cleavage but didn't expose the bra. John walked into the bathroom again with his hands on his wide hips, and when he looked in the mirror he cocked one leg as he let go of one hip. He loved how the dress made him look, and decided to keep it on. He thought back to the hot tub conversation, and again thought he just might be able to be a model as Joanne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back out into the room and wanted to see what else he could do tonight. He really wanted to call that number... should he?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, um, I was just calling because I had a few questions?\" John said, used to his female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can answer those. What questions do you have?\" Sam inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I spend time in one of the clothing bodies, will my regular body still age?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you can spend as much time as you want in our clothes and you won't have to worry about not aging slower,\" Sam explained. \"However, other things affecting one body in other ways like gaining weight or getting a tattoo will only apply to one body.\" So he really did have a figure to maintain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do the clothing bodies age too?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, though ages can be adjusted by bringing the article of clothing to our store and asking for an age change, though most bodies have a set minimum,\" Sam also explained, \"but pre-owned clothing cannot be altered in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's female head tilted. \"Pre-owned clothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothing that originated outside of our store that was made magical by being worn before a transformation and has the body set to the original wearer,\" Sam explained. \"Everyone who's bought from us has them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can clothes be un-enchanted?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, though only if at least one other enchanted pre-owned article exists somewhere else to change the owner back, or if the owner no longer owns any store-made clothing,\" Sam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you know about all this?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through a magical database connected to our intranet keeping track of who owns what,\" Sam explained. \"While many believe magic and technology are mutually exclusive, they actually compliment each other quite nicely, mainly allowing us to bypass the need for receipts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about when I get older and my clothes get too small?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For store clothing, they will adapt to the body\u2019s aging and growth. Pre-owned clothing will not do this, so it's advised to get newer clothes enchanted when needed,\" Sam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens if someone doesn't have enchanted clothes and transforms naked?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a failsafe, clothes do not transform in the circumstance the initiator is not wearing anything and does not have their own enchanted clothes to transform back,\" Sam answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if clothes go missing?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have both store-originated and pre-owned enchanted clothing teleported to you by calling this number,\" Sam answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another thing I've noticed is how... well, there's a bit of a size difference between me and the body of this swimsuit, so my clothes broke when I first transformed but changing back into my regular body, they didn't?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothing with our magic on them is enchanted to be stretchier to the point of indestructibility for safety and security,\" Sam explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I was transformed accidentally earlier and passed out so they put me in a hotel room, there's a lot of women's clothes in the closet here and some sandals... where did they come from, and can I keep them?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it seems like hotel staff provided a number of non-magical outfits that suited your current form,\" Sam explained. \"You can take them home if you want to, but don't have to.\" That was good - he definitely wanted to keep this dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the hotel magic too?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they just co-operate with us. They have helped a lot with magic incidents like yours, though the hotel itself is not magic,\" Sam answered. \"Do you have any more questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one,\" John said, \"Why do you guys work with a hotel instead of a hospital or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a lot easier for a multitude of reasons,\" Sam explained. \"Main reason though, hotels tend to be better at keeping secrets about magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" John said, \"I think that's all the questions I can think of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then. Remember we are available 24/7 for anything from random questions to transformation-related emergencies,\" Sam said. \"Also, Would you like a catalog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will you send one over?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam chuckled. \"Like this.\" Suddenly, a catalog popped into existence next to John on the bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, how'd you do that?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic,\" Sam answered. \"I did mention teleportation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I should've guessed,\" John said. \"Bye for now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye!\" With Sam's response, John hung up the phone and looked at the catalog, and decided to...</span></div></div>",

Wow, his arm felt longer than usual. And his chest felt... bigger somehow. And his alarm clock was gone. And he forgot that alarm clocks don\u2019t knock somehow. He slowly opened his eyes to a light brown ceiling in a room slightly illuminated by light coming in through some curtains. He sat up, the blanket falling off of him, and looked down to see long hair fall down from his head and two large, naked breasts dangling from his chest. It took him a few seconds to piece it all together. 'Oh yeah, I turned into a lady,' he eventually remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Knock, knock, knock, knock.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn, are you ready?\u201d the familiar voice of the store clerk said behind the hotel room door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I just woke up,\u201d John said in his female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you have to go home soon, so get ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d John replied. 'What was I dreaming about last night?' He got up, and groggily walked into the hotel bathroom, feeling lanky from his adult body. 'Something about being in front of a crowd of people or something...' He splashed some water on his face to wake himself up a bit more and looked in the mirror. 'Oh, yeah, I was in a fashion show, I think...' After starting to remember his dream, he saw that Joanne\u2019s hair was a mess. He didn\u2019t know why, but something about seeing his swimsuit body's hair in a state like this didn't sit right with John, even if he was going to change back right after this. Fortunately, the hotel had it's own hair brushes for some reason, and trying to remember how his mom and sister did it, he started to brush his new hair. It took him a little bit, but eventually it was presentable. 'That was easy,' he thought. He got back out of the bathroom and changed out of the bottoms, then put them in the bag where he started feeling around for his boy clothes while sitting on the bed, then eventually they started crawling out and onto him. The transformation back into John begun again, but he didn\u2019t pay much attention to the sensations until they stopped. After he was transformed, he picked up the bag full of the stuff he\u2019d acquired over the past day in one hand... quickly picked up the bra that slipped off and put it back in, and grabbed both the sandals by the straps with the other hand\u2019s pinky finger, and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d John said, looking at the clerk in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are the keys?\" the clerk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keys?\" John asked, before noticing the door did have a key on the inside, then he pulled it out and gave it to the clerk. \"Here they are!\" John then realized he was probably supposed to lock and unlock the door... oops!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, let\u2019s go,\u201d she said, as they walked to the elevator, the clerk pressing the \u201cGround Floor\u201d button when they got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I was just going to pretend you were asleep until now since we weren\u2019t expecting you to wake up that soon,\u201d the clerk explained, \u201cbut going off of that big bag of stuff you\u2019ve gotten I think you\u2019ll have to explain a few things to your family.\u201d John gulped. For some reason, he wasn\u2019t too sure about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could probably just say it\u2019s a secret!\u201d John replied, a little nervous now. What would Mom think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that could probably work, too,\u201d the clerk responded. The rest of the elevator ride went by quietly. When they arrived at ground floor, the clerk dropped the keys off at reception and out they went to the clerk's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to pay me back for the swimsuit sometime then feel free,\" she said, a hint of playful sarcasm as they got in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try,\" John said as he got in the back and put the bag next to him and the sandals on the floor. John didn't know where he would get the money, though. 'Maybe modeling as Joanne?' he thought, but he wasn't sure how to be a model. Maybe he'd ask Mildred for some pointers later. Something about modeling just felt interesting to him now. Maybe he could ask his parents or his sister or something? This car ride wasn't too eventful either, but John was thankful he was going to see his family again. As free as he felt as an adult, he was starting to miss them. Eventually, though, the clerk pulled up outside John\u2019s house, as the two got out of the car. John picked up the sandals and the bag and excitedly ran over to the door and pressed the doorbell, as the clerk followed him. After a few moments of waiting, his mother, Ellen, opened the door and looked down at him with a huge smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJohn!\u201d she said, ecstatic to see her son again, immediately embracing him in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, mom!\u201d John said, equally happy to see his mother again, and hugged her back. The clerk smiled at the scene unfolding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI missed you so much! I was so worried! Were you okay?\u201d Ellen said, holding the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I was fine,\u201d John reassured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Ellen said. After a few moments, she walked back inside, followed by John and the clerk. \u201cThank you so much for bringing him back, I was scared I might not see him again!\u201d Ellen said to the clerk, putting a hand on John\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the clerk said before she pulled a card out of her pocket and handed it to Ellen, who accepted it. \u201cWell, I think my job is done here,\u201d the clerk said with a subtle wink to John. \u201cFeel free to come to the store again, but just be more careful next time.\u201d John giggled a little at what the clerk said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d John and Ellen said in unison, as the clerk left the house and closed the door, and Ellen locked it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s in the bag?\u201d Ellen asked, walking to sit down on the sofa. Oh, boy, here was the decision...</span></div></div>",

They're huge!\" Ellen said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know...\" John said in slight embarrassment, going over to sit where he was now the transformation was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look kinda like a swimsuit model,\" Ellen pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was kinda thinking the same thing,\" John said as he slipped the sandals off and put the jeans back on, then the shirt. The swimsuit made surprisingly good underwear, but Ellen was still almost frozen in amazement.

He felt a little embarrassed by his mother\u2019s comment about his boobies but he was still happy to return the hug. It felt kinda weird since they were both technically women now, but John didn't mind as they held the hug for a while. Eventually though, Ellen let go of the hug and looked back and forth at John's new cleavage and her own chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what are you doing?\" John asked as his mother looked at both their chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your breasts are actually bigger than mine,\" Ellen said as John immediately put his arms over his rather impressive rack in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" John exclaimed, red-faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I couldn't help but check!\" Ellen explained with a giggle. \"Honestly, I'm a little jealous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, you could probably get something from the store...

John's dad wasn't home from work yet. Again, there was the same quick answer, yet John couldn't make out the voice on the other end for obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm John's mother Ellen,\" Ellen began as John looked around his parents' room. \"I touched my son's clothes and transformed into him, can I have mine back?\" Ellen asked. John saw his mom had left a pair of black pumps on the floor next to the bed that he wanted to try on, so he slipped out of the sandals from the hotel and tried the pumps on. They actually fit Joanne's feet! \"Okay,\" Ellen responded to something from the other end of the phone as John admired how his female feet looked in his mother's pumps. \"Bye!\" Ellen chirped and hung up the phone, then turned to John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you getting your clothes back?\" John asked, and Ellen answered...</span></div></div>",

It was from a woman dressed in an unbuttoned suitcoat looking very relieved. The nonchalant steps turned into a jogging pace. That woman looks familiar, John thought. Isn't that the store clerk from earlier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was not sure on what plan she has for him. He no longer felt dizzy. All that he probably knows was that it is something urgent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store clerk looks eye-to-eye with John. \"I was wondering where you might have been,\" she says in a cool tone. \"What is it with children these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at his wet body, but primarily at the swimsuit top and bottom. Her face was in disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awful,\" she mutters. \"That swimsuit will never be sold. Anyways, please come with me. I have plenty of explaining to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store clerk urges John ahead to where the elevators were at. John went ahead and followed her to the elevators with a hopeful sense on learning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the elevator, the store clerk presses the button to the main floor. John could only just follow her actions. The only noise made during this slow elevator ride was the music. Everything now had a more serious atmosphere to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator stopped directly on the main floor. Everything was dead silent as it was currently late at night. The store clerk moved ahead with John following suit. He felt the stare of someone watching him. Instinctively, he turns to find someone working the concierge desk to be the one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really should have picked you up sooner,\" says the store clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\" John asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He follows the clerk outside from the main hotel entrance. Suddenly he had felt a draft coming from all directions. His teeth were chattering while held himself together. The weather wasn't literally freezing--it was mild--but the air felt cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sh-sh-shivering here!\" He exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still wet,\" the store clerk reminded him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only John had something to cover him up. Aside from that, he continued to follow her to the parking lot, where there weren't that many vehicles from the looks of it. Compared to the grandness of the hotel, there weren't many cars. However there was a sign passing by reading \"Visitor Parking\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vehicle begins moving right up to where he and the store clerk were at. The vehicle was a dark green mini-van, and the driver inside looked to be a regular store employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to get out of those clothes,\" the store clerk said to John. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't want to do that,\" John replied. \"You're just a stranger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store clerk sighs. \"I worked everything out with your parents after you accidentally transformed. I have their conset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And before you ask, the hidden word is 'Big Rainbow Fish'. It's so bizzare that these types of phrases would have any use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I trust you,\" John says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hops inside the rear door of the minivan while the store clerk sits inside the front seat.

He leaves the bathroom and reenters the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new body he was in made him feel uncomfortable inside. He wishes that someone could help him, but for now, he just had to act normal. Something that at least created a distraction was his room. The furniture and colors look quite nice and he wonders if this hotel was any better than this. He didn't check to see if he could get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold breeze blows behind John's back; he swiftly cringes in sheer cold. All he wore was the strapless bikini and bottom making his exposed skin react to the chilly air. His mind was now set in finding the thermostat and raise the temperature--or at least get something to cover himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis room was pretty big but everything at least had some sort of sign to know what it was. He notices the thermostat right next to the door he thinks would let him out. Anyway, he presses the red button on the thermostat a few times and the temperature goes up a few degrees, making it more tolerable for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight next to the thermostat was a closet. John wonders if there was clothes inside for him to wear. Inside there was a selection of many different women's clothing, but he decided to wear an athletic jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling comfortable right now, John's next move was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were other articles of clothing he could probably wear instead of this attire. It fortunately had a worthwile value to it. He still had the mind of a ten year old boy inside his new body and patience was something he lacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn reopened the closet, looking at the clothing it contained. Something more relaxed..., he thought. He felt constricted by the bikini top and bottom. There were a lot of dresses tucked inside formally, but they were too girly for his tastes. However he kept a mental note of it for next time. He ends up choosing a pair of athletic shorts and a plain t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe enters the bathroom and locks the door. Earlier he removed the jacket so he was back to just wearing the bikini set. How do I take this thing off? John wondered. He wasn't sure on how he should take off the bikini top. After some attempts in taking it off, he figures out that he should loosen the back. Already, he felt his chest being released by the tightness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look down or in the mirror,\" he says to himself. Initially he felt dazed by removing the top but he tried to keep himself stay focused. Details were deliberately avoided for his mind's sake. Somehow he had a sense of dignity that he could stilk break. He then removes the bikini bottom but quickly replaces it with the shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all was done, John looked at the mirror again to see him wear the simple T-shirt and shorts. Feels much better, he thought. The shirt kind of feels weird. The material of John's shirt rubbed across his body strange for him. Oh so that's what bras are for, he realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe exits the bathroom once more and he spent a lot of time from just being inside. The good thing was that he felt more comfortable in this attire.</span></div></div>",

They were heading to the beach after this, which he was looking forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey John, look at this!\" cried Melanie, his 12-year old sister. She was being allowed to wear a two-piece for the first time now, and she was obviously excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked John when he looked at what Melanie was pointing at. It was a black bikini, and a pretty big one too. It was obviously meant for an older woman, probably around D-cup breasts or so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it, Melanie?\" asked John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't it look good?\" asked Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but why are you asking me? Boys don't wear those.\" said John. Despite him saying that, Melanie didn't look like she was listening.

We shouldn't pass on these.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn had no idea what she was up to, although he ended up doing as she asked him, and brought the big black bikini to their Mom.

As they began to leave, the woman winked at John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll enjoy your purchase.

It wasn't too full, only having a couple of guys in there at the current moment. That was just fine for John; he was okay with being by himself. Heck, he mostly prefered having his privacy. The other guys didn't really pay much attention to him, so he just went to a bench and sat his bag down. He didn't put his swim trunks on beforehand, so he had to do it here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, off we go.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his shirt and tossed it over his head, putting it down on the bench. He then opened up the bag, seeing all the essentials. There was a towel, his trunks, some goggles just in case, and some others. However, he did notice the big bikini in there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, what is Melanie's deal with this? What use would I have for this?\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting that aside, he stripped off his shorts and underwear, bringing out his old trunks. Of course, like Melanie said, they were old and a bit small, but he liked them too much to let go of them just yet. So, with that in mind, he put one leg in and then the other, bringing the trunks up to his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRIP! He heard the unfortunate noise as he felt the small trunks rip in the back, effectively making them unusable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, guess Melanie was right after all. Now what?\" he whined. Should he just head out in his normal clothes? But he wanted to wear a swimsuit with everyone else. That was what the beach was all about after all. What should be do? As he thought about it, his eyes eventually wondered over to the bikini. It was the only working swimsuit he currently had. Still, he wondered if he should talk to his Mom about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I could try it on and get Mom's opinion, but how does it work?\" he asked himself. He dived in and retrieved the bikini, seeing how big it was. It was obviously for a well-endowed woman with a good behind, both things John obviously didn't have. What was he to do with this? Try them on for kicks? Well, he didn't have much other choice right now. Hesitantly, he put one leg through the bikini bottom, and then the other. Slowly, he began sliding them up his legs to his waist. Obviously, due to the size difference, he couldn't keep it on. He'd have to hold it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was beginning to wonder what to do about this, he felt the material in his hands shifting a bit, causing him to let go. However, the bottom magically hovered in place, slowly contracting until it touched his skin, slowly pressing against him as it fitted his behind, shocking him greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What the heck?! How did that happen?!\" he cried out. Apparently, no one else heard that yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that wasn't all. Just as John was trying to comprehend that, he saw the bikini top hovering in front of him. Suddenly, it latched on to him, pressing its cups against his bare chest and clasping around the back, as the outfit completely covered him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here?! Why did these clothes just latch on to me? I mean, they feel nice actually, but why did they do that?\" he asked. No one could answer that question. He didn't think that he could really go out like this. What was a guy to do? </span></div></div>",

But Survival took precedence for now. Turning a corner after pulling the bikini from her ass crack she nearly ran right into one of them. It growled reaching with grasping hands, with a high pitched scream she brought the pistol up right into the beast's face and took two shots. Her rears were ringing as she wiped a sticky ichor from her face. Barely keeping her lunch down as she looked to the now headless corpse beside her... Okay aiming for the head works. Good she could do this... Moans grew closer, no doubt attracted to the noise. Cursing she got back to her feet and started running...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, as she ran she felt more energetic rather then tired, though John chalked it up to adrenaline. In truth the magic of the bikini seemed to be bleeding through into the skimpy school uniform. Years seemed to melt off her as she ran. leaving her twenties slipping back into her teenage years once more. The formally skimpy Uniform, shifted and adjusted, becoming less exposing. more tailored to her body.

Oh thank god It's Yuki, someone get the gates!\" a girl's voice cut though the tense atmosphere, the first none moan John had heard in hours. Ahead was a large school with a heavy duty gate locking it off from the potential hordes. An asian girl in a similar uniform was peeking over the wall waving as if trying to get John's attention attention.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki?\" She muttered softly looking around, not noticing her voice had snuck up an octave. \"Is she talking to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out their coming!\" moans grew louder as they started to converge on the school entrance. it was now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though just as she was home free she felt something grab her arm, stopping her forward momentum. She didn't have the time to think she turned her body and brought the pistol up with it and pulled the trigger. John felt his arm shoot back unexpectedly with the recoil, it was much higher then last time, not realizing he had gotten weaker in just a few blocks of running. Fortunately John managed to keep her balance and start running until she could get through the gate, heaving and weaving. She could hear other struggling to close the gate again, fending off the arriving zombies with brooms and sticks through the gate bars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuki!\" a missile in a school uniform all but tackled John to the ground. The girl was hugging her tightly and crying. \" I was so scared when you got separated.

For now it was best to just roll with this. \"Um, I take it you know me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" the girl looked up, she was still way too close. \"What kind of question is that?\" she sounded concerned, a hand touching the side of John's face with notable familiarity. \"Are you okay Yuki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ah, Just kinda woke up and it's all a bit fuzzy.\" it was a weak lie, John knew that but her genuine confusion apparently lent a lot credibility as the other girl gasped somewhere between sad and concerned. Her gentle touch moved to the John hair as if looking for some kind of injury. John could feel her heart speed up and face heat. She'd never felt this kind of genuine concern and attention from any girl his age... wait she wasn't a teenager, she was only 10. Wasn't she? John felt uncertain, her body was older then that right now.

Not his mom or sister or anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him, the other men in the lockers didn't seem to care at all about him. They just continued their merry business, much to John's surprise. Why didn't they bother looking at him? Surely they thought that a boy in a bikini would be something funny to look at. Then again, whatever kept them from looking at him, at least John wouldn't have to explain anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he soon heard something from the door that lead to the beach. It was someone knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John? Hello?\" It was Melanie, calling him out. That instantly got him even more worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, why did she have to come now? I can't come out like this.\" worried John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Relax. Feel beautiful.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked around to try and see who said that, but no one responded. As he did, he didn't see himself slowly heading towards the door, as if on autopilot. However, he did see just before he got to the door, trying to keep himself away from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, don't open the door.\" he cried to himself. However, his hand grasped around the handle, opening the door and allowing the sunlight to hit in. John waited for the inevitable laughing of his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow John, you look great!\" cried Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn opened one eye to see his 12-year old sister. Like she said, she was wearing a bikini for the first time, a small one as she wasn't that far into puberty. Unlike John's black one, hers was a nice light blue color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\" asked John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that bikini looks good on you, kind of like how mine looks.\" laughed Melanie. She was obviously glad to see herself and her brother in bikinis together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist.\" groaned John. He still wasn't sure about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, come on.

I feel naked.\" said John. Melanie smiled and took his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'm wearing a bikini too, so we'll both feel strange.\" she responded. John smiled a bit, happy to see that his sister was right by his side. She was wearing a bikini for the first time as well after all. Speaking of which, John noticed that she kept picking at it a bit, especially the bottoms, like something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay? You're picking at your bikini.\" said John. Melanie smiled at John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's nothing. Just feels a little strange is all. Guess that's what I get for wearing a brand new bikini right off the bat.\" she laughed a bit. John laughed as well, although something in his gut said something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do?\" asked Melanie. She felt something odd in her bikini, hence why she kept picking at it, but she wanted to get off the subject. Perhaps she could just get her mind off of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could play in the sand a bit.\" said John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good to me....\" Melanie trailed off a bit, feeling something off within her. It felt like there were bubbled surging within her, like something wanting to expand from the inside out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get much time to think about it though before John gasped at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie, why are you getting bigger?!\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked as she turned around to face him. As she did, she saw that John was looking smaller in her eyes, but it was actually because she was growing taller. Before, she was about an inch or two taller, but she was now growing closer to a full foot taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the? What's happening?\" Melanie asked as everything continued to change around her. Her hands rested on her legs, which seemed to grow and expand as puberty took full effect, making her legs long and wide at the hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie, why are you looking like Mom?!\" John nearly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on?</span></div></div>",

John froze at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Melanie?\" John finally managed to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\" the new blond snapped. \"Just who the hell are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn yelped as soon as his (former?) sister barked at him. \"Uh, I'm your little brother, John,\" he was finally able to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little brother?

This thing just attacked me! I even tried getting it off. You can try if you want.\" replied John. Melanie raised an eyebrow at him. She wondered if he was actually serious. Then again, she was curious as well to see if this kid was just lying or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist.\" said Melanie, kneeling down to his level and lightly grabbing one of his bikini straps. As she did, she gave it a slight tug. To her surprise, the top itself did not move, even when she gave it another tug. Her eyes widened more with each try, until she even tried moving a cup, and that stayed in place as well until she gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so you weren't joking after all.\" said Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you.\" said John, sighing at having to go through this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Melanie was stumped. She had been assuming that this weirdo kid was just being a little pervert, but his clothes were really stuck to him. And if that was true, perhaps his claim that this was unintentional was as well. She felt her anger slip away at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sorry for giving you a hard time there. I still don't know how you knew my name, but it doesn't matter now. Let's just go and find your mom.\" said Melanie, getting up and beginning to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Melanie.\" smiled John. Melanie actually chuckled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you talk to me like I'm your sister or something?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....well...I'm not sure.\" said John. How else could he explain that she was his 12-year old sister just a while ago. Anyway, Melanie didn't think much of it and kept on walking. As she did, John rode a bit behind her, getting a good look at the new Melanie. She looked so different now, and yet she was still beautiful, from her blonde hair to her long legs. It reminded John of his mom, but better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as they kept walking, John suddenly felt a small surge go through his legs, looking down but not seeing anything knew. When he turned to face Melanie again however, he stopped in shock. Before, he wasn't that tall compared to her, perhaps just reaching below her waist. Now, John was started to reach up to her chest area. Stumbling a bit, John looked down at his legs, seeing that they looked a little longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd perhaps....meatier too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why are my legs so long?\" John asked himself, putting his hands on his legs. They didn't look anywhere near completion, but the process had clearly started. However, did Melanie notice any of this?</span></div></div>",

We should join them!\" John wasn't exactly crazy about it. He knew <i>something</i> was up with this bikini, and he needed to be focused to keep his resistance to the magic up, and he was already slipping. <i>Also doesn't help that I'm terrible with sports,</i> he thought to himself. Unfortunately, he was suddenly pulled to the court by Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when he was actually at the court that he realized how one-sided this seemed. The opposing girls were around 5' tall while John stood at a little over 6*. Not to mention, even though he had never played volleyball before, somehow he knew how to play. The \"home team,\" if you will, served first. One of the girls bumped the ball and Melanie tried to set it back. However, the ball ended up staying on their side of the court. Luckily, John ran in and set the ball back to the other side, catching one of the girls off guard and scoring a point for him and Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the game ended, the score was 17:33, John and Melanie had won. John was glad he had managed to resist the bikini's magic during the whole game. In fact, he felt really proud for doing that and winning. Melanie was extremely happy they won, so happy that she tried pulling back John's bikini bottom and letting go [which I'm sure everyone hates when that happens], forgetting that it would'nt budge before. However, it seems she caught whatever celestial being that was in the bikini off guard, as it actually did pull back. Unfortunately the being did notice and quickly snapped the bottom shut, not only painfully smacking John, but catapulting Melanie into him, knocking him over. <i>Uh-oh,</i> John thought to himself, <i>I don't think it'll be too happy about that.</i> John braced himself for something to happen, and...</span></div></div>",

Their rears finished their expansion by the time the two got there, John's likely setting a record of some sort. As they moved towards the snack bar, John looked at Melanie, not noticing how the girl's rump is now as big as watermelons, wondering just what happened to his 12 year old sister. Is she trapped in that new body, able to do nothing but watch? Was her body simply swapped with another person, only her name being what's left of her? But the most jarring question he thought of is what would happen to him if he gave in to the magic?<br>\r\nAs he thought this, Melanie happened to notice his glance. \"What's up?\" This snapped John back into reality. \"Oh, uh, nothing,\" he said, blushing. John now noticed that Melanie's rear had grown, not attempting to point it out to her because she'd likely act like it's always been like that. He did have to admit, however, that her hips are definitely more hypnotic. Nothing like his, though, which could send someone flying if he wasn't careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally reached the snack bar, named Snack-o's Shack-o, and John noticed they had a mirror...and, conveniently, a ruler on the side that goes up to ten feet. It was when he looked in the mirror that John realized all the changes that had occurred to him. While he didn't notice his new mocha skin, but he did notice his tush and his height from said tush. It was almost the size of exercise balls--a quick surge and a small growth occurred, definitely making his butt the size of exercise balls. The fact the poor bikini bottom isn't eaten by his cheeks already is surprising. Checking the ruler, he noticed he was almost 8 feet tall!* <i>Geez,</i> he thought to himself, <i>I hope this thing doesn't plan on making me taller, cause I think my butt's done enough.</i><br>\r\nHe joined Melanie at a table, the seat creaking under the weight of his rear. \"Man, even the chair's ready to fall for your curves,\" Melanie joked, which did get John to chuckle a bit...as well as realize every single guy and girl was starting at him. He blushed a deep ruby red. He wouldn't feel so awkward if not for the fact that he has a gigantic and extremely feminine lower body, but still a very male upper-body. He looked down at his chest just as he heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Let your beauty blossom.~</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he heard that, his chest started slowly expanding. He tried his best not to freak out and looked at Melanie. As he expected, she didn't notice anything wrong. Thankfully, his chest, now breasts, didn't grow too much, only stopping around the F cup range. Though, he had a sinking suspicion that his breasts would eventually grow to be a perfect hourglass with his hips.<br>\r\nThe waitress finally arrived, a rather nice looking girl and also a \"friend of Melanie's,\" which was easy to see by the way they had greeted each other. Melanie introduced John to the waitress, her name being Lara [no, not Croft], and Lara to John.<br>\r\nWith introductions out of the way, John and Melanie are ready to order.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n*Forgot to mention this in Sporting a Tan, but I'm basing John's approximate height off of how I estimate Melanie's height.<br>\r\nAssume she's 5', now likely 6, and John is 20+\" taller than her, that makes him [now] 7-8'.</span></div></div>",

After his hair he looked in shock at his new legs and when he was doing that. His body became very feminine his butt and hips flared out his waistline came in, his hands, arms, and shoulders thinned out rounded of and became very feminine. After that his chest bloomed out to a C-Cup breast. Finely his manhood shrank into the negative and became a female vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shirt turned into a red, white, and blue bikini top.

He took a step back, not wanting to be in what could only have been the wedding section for women. He took another step back and froze when his hand brushed up against one of the dresses on the shelves. The fabric felt soft and silky on his skin, almost too soft. He didn't want to stop touching it, but he forced himself to let go and promptly bolted from the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself back in the boy's section and sat down on a bench, panting slightly to get his breath back.

John could only watch in confusion as his Ben 10 t-shirt and jean shorts began to fade into a pure white while shifting into silk. Once his jeans had changed, his socks began to follow. The didn't just change into silk, they began to crawl up his legs as well. His socks were becoming white silk stockings. Finally the details of his sneakers began to fade away as the whiteness took over. John was awestruck by this, his clothes were changing right before his eyes. He could even feel his underwear change into a pair of soft silk panties. This made John very uncomfortable. That's when his shirt and shorts began to merge together into a single article of clothing. Once the merge was complete, his pant legs expanded until they made a single hole at the bottom, becoming a white silk dress. John wanted to freak out, but he also didn't want to draw any attention to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, he just looked like a boy in a completely white girl's outfit. This was something that could ruin a 10 year old boy's reputation forever. The changes didn't stop there. The neckline of the dress began to take on a lacy floral pattern and the sleeves began to extend to his hands. His sleeves eventually formed around his hands and became a pair of white arms length gloves. It was at this point his shoulders puffed up into large balls of fabric. The rest of his torso area began to change as well, taking on ribbons, bows, and other accents. John then realized what was going on. \"My clothes are changing into a wedding dress!\" He exclaimed as quietly as he could, still not wanting to attract any attention. Suddenly, he felt what appeared to be a bra suddenly form magically around his chest. No doubt matching the panties he was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet felt strange as his shoes now began to change. They went from blank sneakers to smooth, shiny white heels with ankle straps. The heels gave John a little extra height, not that it helped. The skirt of his new dress finally began to change as well. The skirt grow to his feet and puffed out with what felt like thousands of petticoats suddenly appearing. The skirt's design began to mimic the accents of the upper portion of the dress, with the same ribbons and bows. John felt like screaming when his head began to fell strange as well. His face and hair tingled, it felt like something was happening to them, but he couldn't tell what it was. Suddenly his view was obstructed by sheet of sheer fabric. At this point John knew that this was a veil. On top of everything, he was now wearing a veil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he felt nothing else happening, he knew that the ordeal was finally over. He pushed the veil on top of his head and went in search of a mirror. As he walked through the store in search of a mirror to see the horror that befell his clothes, John found he kept almost tripping on the front of the dress. He decided to do what he usually saw brides on tv or the movies do and lift the skirt up to help him walk. This was THE single most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to him. Even more than the time he ripped the seat of his pants at recess. Once he had found a mirror, looked and was shocked by what he saw. The strange tingling feeling he felt on his face and in his hair, it was make up appearing on his face and his hair growing then forming into a perfect little bun on the back of his head. John just stood there in shock. He looked like a little girl playing dress up. Only with a perfectly fitted dress and professionally done hair and make up. His humiliation was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked around and suddenly discovered that...</span></div></div>",

When he stepped away frightened, she took a step forward and beamed cheerily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she stepped right out of the mirror, like a hologram and backed him into a corner. \"Stop, get away! What are you doing?!?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe merely giggled and crushed her palms around his face, poking his nose and making it smaller and cuter, tracing his lips as the same shade of lipstick appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no please! Stop!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled happily as she rubbed his arms, hugged his waist, and even cupped his chest as if breast were there, which suddenly there were. With her hand gradually moving down, John could feel the spirits physical presence, gliding down his chest, waist, and than groin. She cupped his male parts, and with a gentle squeeze, John yelped. A moment later, they were gone and he felt nothing, as if she'd popped a bubble, no longer to be seen. She hugged him again and reached in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, are you doing this?\" She didn't respond, putting a ringed finger to his mouth. The moment he went to speak again, she plunged in and planted a juicy kiss on his lips. He could feel her on him in full, and despite his muffled protest, they soon turned to moans as she suckered and sloshed around his lips with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn suddenly felt dizzy, like all sense and time were being drained out of him. The world gradually moved slower, even as he felt his body crunching and changing, his senses were failing him. Soon everything faded out to a warm, gentle and welcoming darkness. He could vaguely hear the sound of wedding bells as he blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It seemed a bit different though than a wedding dress. It was sleeveless, but still covered his whole torso. It also had one simple skirt that fell to his knees. On his feet, there were simple white ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when he looked at the mirror, there was no sight of the woman from the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that was a dream? Phew.\" John sighed in relief. Still, wearing this girly dress wasn't really helping. Where were his old clothes anyway? He looked around a bit but couldn't find them. And where was his Mom for that matter? He appeared to be alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Where are you?\" John asked as he tried to find his way around, though the dress didn't help much. He was certainly lost right now. The fact that the vision kept appearing in his head wasn't helping, and he felt totally bizarre at how he was changing when that woman touched him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was so weird.\" He murmured to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he was walking, he accidentally tripped over something, landing on the ground, although it didn't hurt too much.

It would be humiliating! \"Mom, I also need to get out of this dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?

Ever since that reflection in the mirror, things had gotten so weird. Still, he tried to adjust his dress as he sat, hoping to get comfortable.

The outfit he was in felt tighter, and yet strangely slightly more comfortable than ever.

His eyes felt rounder than before, and for some reason, John felt like something else about them was off. Truth be told, his normally blue eyes had now shifted to a lovely pair of green, almost striking to the eyes. Then, he looked down at his dress, which still looked the same as before. However, putting a hand on them, he felt how much they compressed against his torso now. The skirt still flowed to his knees, but the top was pressed against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and don't forget these!\" His Mom ran right up again, settling a bouquet into his hands, holding them in front of his chest. He was about to ask what these were for, but she had already ran off to the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as that happened, music began playing, confusing John. However, his legs started moving, gently gliding down the aisle. All the people around him looked with adoring eyes, as if this was a grand moment. John didn't feel too sure, and his face felt even redder now than before. This felt so embarrassing, and yet something inside him felt calm. Still, he almost tripped over his own two feet, but nothing came of it. The groom, still smiling, awaited as John slowly approached. Apparently, only John noticed how odd this was when the groom was so much taller than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, is this right?\" asked John as he got closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as he began walking up the few steps to the front, he felt something around his calves. He looked down in surprise to see the skirt expanding a bit, beginning to flow around his ankles. The material felt slightly heavier, but still felt incredibly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost every muscle in John's body wanted to flee, because this all felt so crazy to him. What was his rehearsal for anyway? The 10-year old didn't now these kinds of things, and it confused him greatly. Still, the groom at the front seemed to give part of him a sense of comfort, like a warm feeling in his chest. He wasn't sure how to treat that though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he took the last step to the front, facing the groom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi.\" John said meekly. The groom chuckled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look beautiful as always. Just try to take it in stride.\" He smiled. John felt the urge to smile back, despite how the groom towered over him.</span></div></div>",

After he received a box with two rings in it, he tried to make his way back to the altar, but his changing clothes made it more difficult than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn, with great regret released from each harrowing breath, slowly took a step forward. And than another, as the magic had been forcing him up until now, suddenly his toes were teetering on the edge as his heels clicked upwards and grew several inches up his legs. Walking upright, he tried not to hobble, but it was harder because the dress grew tighter at the waist and thighs, yet stretched out and became more decorated and lavish near the knees and below. His hands felt like they were glued to the flowers, as white liquid poured out of them and covered up his hands all the way to his arms and than shoulders, lowering his chest and arms but raising up dainty poofy sleeves all the while. His chest area compressed as the dress tightened like a corset, giving him a pressed in, effeminate waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, why is this happening? I can hardly walk as it is!\" John complained. His hands felt stiff as his gloves, dress, heels and now stocking (liquifying out from under the dress) thickened and shined like satin silk, en-coating and encasing him in a white mist of a bridal gown. He was just a kid, why did he have to go through this? And wear something this comfortable at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hardly make it through the aisle, and all the guest whispering kind compliments and confusing words all the while didn't help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she's so cute! She looks just lovely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't her dress make her look divine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to make such a beautiful bride!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, remember to take a snapshot when they kiss! Even if it's just a practice, I hope it's juicy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe random comments did strange things to John's mind, for some reason he felt like some part of his head was agreeing with them, almost welcoming them and wanting to be adored like this. He even blushed when one lady stepped out into the aisle, finding himself posing and smiling as if by instinct. The warm feelings didn't go away, they intensified even when she had finally reached the altar and approached her handsome fiance to be! This, practice dude John thought, why did he think of him as a handsome fiance? Although he was quite handsome, and quite a stud at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn shook his head to try to refocus his thoughts, but he was interrupted when something sheer and white had formed over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where did this come out of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white, flowery frilled bridal veil had appeared. It quickly wrapped around his head and covered his eyes and the back of his growing hair. \"Um, sorry about that.\" He stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem. Now, ahem, are you ready to begin now, m'lady?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn couldn't remove his hands from the bouquet for some reason, but the guy in front of him tipped it off so he could see her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, when John looked back with his green eyes into the groom's icy blue, he felt uncontrollable warmth and satisfaction for this man. He knew he shouldn't be feeling this, but his handsome features, beautiful face, tight tux and icy blue eyes drew him in so. John found himself puckering for some reason, as ruby red lipstick coated his now womanly lips as if from nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest coughed, and the groom put a finger on his lips silencing them. <br>\r\n\"Just a moment dear, we'll get there soon. Now why don't we practice our vows first?</span></div></div>",

It was also nice that the groom had taken the time to life the veil for a while, as it allowed him to see fully. His hands still wouldn't leave the bouquet though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the priest cleared his throat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest when went on in to a sermon about wedding and such like that. Most of it went over John's head, as he had no clue what was going on. He actually almost tripped on his new heels, but the groom caught him quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I got you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nice as it was, John didn't want to look up again. This felt so embarrassing! While some of him felt okay with it all, he wasn't ready to accept these weird things as reality. As he looked back, he happened to see everyone still looking intently, with smiles all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, will you, Doug Hartford, take John to be your lawfully wedded wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, they were still using his usual name, which John liked, but he just wished they would stop with this. Wasn't the girl that was supposed to do this be here by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John Dailey, do you take Doug to be your lawfully wedded husband?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn jumped a bit when he heard it directed at him, and stammered a little bit. However, as if by magic, words seemed to form out. \"I...I..I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.\" Suddenly, there seemed to be clapping from behind, as pictures began to be taken, almost as if this was the real thing. John seemed a bit taken back, especially with the large flashes in his eyes. The fact that he was still his 10-year old size didn't help either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before he could think another thought though, he felt the lips of the groom upon his own.</span></div></div>",

Where did they go?\" he asked. However, he would soon have his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt his t-shirt shift, becoming tighter against his body with the sleeves retreating to his shoulders, leaving his arms bare. The material became sturdier, showing a bit of his bellybutton as it got a bit smaller against his body. Along with that, it quickly faded from it's normal color to a deep purple color. Just as that happened, his shorts faded to the same dark purple, forming into one legging as a light skirt. John was shocked to see this, trying to cover himself even though no one was watching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened? Why am I wearing these big clothes?\" he whined, not in the best of moods to handle this. He was just a kid after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he didn't get much time to think about it. Suddenly, he shot up in height, enough to look over the rack of clothes. Before he could cry out, his hips widened out to a pleasant size with his butt becoming fuller. He felt something in his groin shrink away, as his underwear became girly panties. His shoes began to show more of his feet, becoming a pair of pretty sandals on his feet, showing his curved feet and fine toenails. On his torso, his waist thinned as two gracious mounds formed on his chest, a bra forming beneath the tank top. The breasts were a modest B-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs that happened, his brown hair grew down his back in waves as his face softened. His eyes became wider with his lips fuller and his nose cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going....\" he said before covering his mouth, hearing the voice of a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, John had become a pretty teenage girl.</span></div></div>",

His mom has handling somethingof her own somewhere else in the store. As he thought about what exactly he was looking for, the young 10-year old absentmindedly touched a shiny yellow dress meant for a healthy teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, don't want to touch that\" said John, pulling his hand back. However, as soon as he did, the dress vanished right in front of his eyes, causing his mouth to hang open in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Where did it go?!\" he asked himself in worry. Clothes usually don't vanish like that. This confused John greatly. However, he didn't get much time to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, his body was wracked with extreme discomfort, like his skinw as trying to stretch out or something. Through the discomfort, his eyes opened enough to see what was happening to him. Right there and then, he saw the floor moving further away from his vision, his legs growing much longer than they were before. The growth extended to his torso and other limps as well, lengthening themselves to the size of a teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think another thought, his body contracted and grew in different areas. His waist curved inwards, while his overall muscle mass stayed rather soft and small. His hips sprouted outwards, stretching out his shorts, while his butt expanded out to match them. His thighs became somewhat toned as did his calves. Looking down, he saw that his feet were shrinking, and that his socks had vanished. His shoes shrank and changed shape, becoming little more than straps as a pair of yellow sandals wrapped around his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing onwards, his shirt and shorts merged together into a single garment. They conformed to his body and paled to the same yellow color as the dress he saw minutes ago. The top part became a pair of spaghetti straps that went around his small shoulders. Underneath the dress, he felt a tug down in his privates as he felt his manhood shrink away. Before he could think, it was gone. The underwear covering it shrank and became lacier, forming a yellow pair of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his chest, a hige change came as two mounds of flesh emerged, pushing out the dress and showing a fiar amount of cleavage. A yellow bra formed underneath the dress and a necklace formed around his neck, resting comfortable between his breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovingon, he felt his face contort and change as it became softer. His lips puckered up a bit while his eyelashes extended and eyebrows thinned out. His brown hair cascaded down his back, flowing down his waist. Before he knew it, it was all over. He looked exactly like a healthy teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened to me?\" John asked in worry, his hands then clamping on his mouth due to the foreign voice that came from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny! It's time to go\" said John's mom who was looking at him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jenny?\" John muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get home\" said Mom.</span></div></div>",

John didn't really notice any of these things, however. Neither did he see said miniskirt disappear behind him. The boy kept walking around, looking for anything that could interest him. He wasn't really paying much attention to his surroundings as he walked, so he didn't notice his denim shorts fuse their pant legs into one. They slowly changed color and material into a bright blue as John kept absentmindedly walking his young legs around, unaware they wouldn't be young for much longer as the newly formed skirt folded into pleats. Then, it expanded to a larger size, yet clung to the boy's small hips, finishing it's own transformation and preparing to give John a pair of legs that matched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's legs slowly grew taller, and taller, and taller, but John just shrugged the feeling off as he kept aimlessly wandering around. Eventually, however, his legs were long enough to be an adult's, but were very thin and lanky as they didn't quite have the shape yet. This would be rectified, though, when they started to bulk out a bit to be a bit more grown-up, though they made his feet look small by comparison. However, even this wasn't enough for them. John's lower thighs plumped out with a bit of well-placed fat, slowly moving upwards and upwards to become thicker and thicker as they went up until his thighs had a mature, womanly shape. And for the finishing touches, the fat then filled John's rear, growing it out to an impressive size as the miniskirt went from clinging to John's small boy hips to naturally hanging off of a pair of impressively rounded hips, which had stretched out to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, John couldn't ignore how his legs felt more than a bit odd. He could swear that, somehow, his thighs and butt kept jiggling as he walked, and they just felt so... large. He looked down to see his shorts replaced with a miniskirt, and his young boyish legs had been replaced with mature, womanly ones, but the rest of him including his feet was the same, making him look a bit ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- I- How-\" John stammered in disbelief at the miniskirt and the legs it contained as he kept staring at them. He turned around and looked down at his impressive rear, feeling it to see if it was real and finding it was, then pulling the front of the skirt up to see that his boxers and what was contained in them were still there, though it made him notice how tight they felt now they were containing a butt that was more fit for a curvy woman than a 10-year-old boy. After regaining his composure, John decided he...</span></div></div>",

As he looked up from doing this, he noticed that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhis body felt a bit more strange. As he looked at his reflection in the mirror, he noted he now had long flowing dark hair and long fingernails, and then he doubled <br>\r\n<br>\r\nover as he experienced changes in his guts and then his chest expanded rapidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I am a lady...I look like I could be mom's sister,\" he said, noting his voice now seemed more sultry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, he could not stop. He now thought of himself as a she, and her name had become Joanna. He thought he should be upset about this, and yet it just compelled him to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nput on the rest of the outfit. Soon, Joanna passed into her late forties, her hair getting more and more gray as she finished slipping the skirt on and then put the low black <br>\r\n<br>\r\nheels on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, did someone just turn up the heat in here?\" she exclaimed as she past fifty, and then reached into her purse for her hormone patch. How did she/he know to do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aging continued, and Joanna put on the girdle and large bra, and then slipped the teal blue top on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing sixty, she noted that her hair seemed a little hard to handle, and then somehow she wore it piled in a bun atop her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's jes so much better,\" she said, as jowls now showed, and her breasts felt the tug of gravity and then gave in to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, she slipped some circular gold earings on her ears, and a string of pearls as well as assorted rings on her now spindly fingers. Slipping a large comfy blue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n sweater on, she looked at her new/old reflection. Her hair was now completely white, and she looked about the same age as her own grandmother--wait, maybe it was her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n sister. Yes, Alice was her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stared at her seventy year old reflection...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pulled it off, and was about to toss it on the floor when he noticed something wasn't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced down at his body, and it was completely naked.  Almost all the clothes in the room were missing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that he saw was the blue dress, a pair of blue panties, and a blue bra.  As far as shoes, he saw black high heals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to get worried someone would see him naked, so he put on the panties.  He noticed they felt very soft.  this made him want to put on the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked it up, and looked the bra over.  He examined how the straps and clasps worked.  After struggling a little bit, he finally got it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt silly being the lingerie, so he picked up the dress.  Then he slipped it over his head.  He noticed the dressw went down to his knees.  Around the belly was kind of tight, and below that it was loose.  it had short sleeves.  The neck had a V-neck that came down to a knot at the cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext he saw the heals.  He walked over to them and put his feet into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was a bright flash.  When his vision cleared, he felt a little off balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushed hair out of his eyes.  Then he stopped what he was doing.  He quickly brushed it out of his eyes and walked over to the full length mirror near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes got wide.  They weren't his anymore, or at least not the ones he grew up with.  His head now had short straight hair that was longer than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was now pretty smooth.  His eyes were beautiful, he thought.  His eyebrows were now thinner.  His eye  lashes were longer.  His nose was thinner too.  his lips were a lot puffier and thicker now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis throat was a bit different too.  It seemed thinner, and a little longer.  His Adam's apple was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoulders didn't seem to be as broad anymore.  He noticed his arms were a bit different too.  His armpits were shaved smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he noticed his chest.  it was smooth and hairless down to his cleavage.  His cleavage was from his D-cup boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the lack of feeling between the legs, he knew that he was a girl now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the size of her belly, she was pregnant.

Normally not the one to peruse clothes, John got to poking around, but quickly found a majority of the clothes were either:<br>\r\n<br>\r\na.For girls/women<br>\r\nToo expensive<br>\r\nNothing he liked/Didn't appeal to him<br>\r\nSome mix of all of the above{/a-list:reasons}<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though nothing was standing out, he had to admit it seemed like they had everything under the sun. They even had a small jewelry counter by the cashier and a giant novelty hat rack, if you're into those things, that is. However, before he was about to scuttle <b>ALL</b> hope of finding swag he liked, he noticed they did have a costume section, and Halloween was just a month away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarting about the aisles, he saw all kinds of costumes, but nothing that \"spoke to him.\" However, he had to stop and take pause at a particular headband sporting finely crafted curved demon horns. Rubbing along the material had an almost electric vibe; John swore he was touching real bone. \"Only $3.50 too. A little high for just a headband, but <b>MAN</b> this looks cool!!\" He pops them on and turns to a mirror nearby, where he practices scare poses. \"Get the right face paint and some red tights and I got a perfect devil costume for this Halloween!! I can't wait!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heads up to the counter and pays for the costume piece, meeting a rather morose and monotone older teen/young adult girl with bobbed hair, which was an odd muted purple color, almost like stone, wearing a Korn cap, <span class=\"cplum\">plum</span> colored lipstick, and wearing a large duster over her body. She chimes out in a dull fashion, \"That'll be $3.78. Tell me, why is a kid like you in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this place is new, and I was really curious about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" She says as she's handing back the change, her <span class=\"clteal\">pale teal</span> eyes still showing her malaise. \"Well... Well, you enjoy those horns there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I will!!\" John exclaims on his way out returning to his regularly scheduled plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know, but that \"electric vibe\" was more than he had suspected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have kept working at Hot Topic...\" the cashier groaned, removing her hat for a moment to reveal two grey horse-like ears sticking out of her hair and scratching the left one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home, John was all giddy about showing off his new purchase to his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice, dear, but aren't you jumping the gun?\" his mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn laughed and said, \"You can never be too prepared for Halloween, mom!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright. Go get ready for supper then!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn washed up rather quickly, but stopped when he noticed he could finally see at eye level with the bathroom mirror. Normally, he had needed a stool to see clearly, as it was perched rather high, being it was also a medicine cabinet and, you know, childproofing, and he still really needed the stool to see his face in it's entirety, but it seemed clear John had grown recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guess what!! I was able to finally see in the mirror without that crummy footstool!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's excellent. I'll tell dad when he gets in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another late night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep...\" she sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as John was brushing his teeth, he has the sneaking suspicion some of his front teeth, namely his incisors, felt sharper, but basically brushed it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, off to bed with you, mister!! I don't want to here your TV or Playstation on either!! It's a school night, ya know.\" John's dad utters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn wanders upstairs towards his room, parked in between that of his younger sister Charlotte, 6, and his older brother Axton, 14. His brother was still up, watching TV. \"Lucky... Getting to stay up because he's older...\" John mutters as he closes his door. He quietly turns in and goes to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the horns on his dresser begin to pulse...</span></div></div>",

Smoky tentacles coiled down into his dresser and began remodeling it into a scary black design with spikes on the sides. The smoke rolled across the floor and over John, sucking into his orifices. As the clock ticked on, John perspired in his sleep, horrible demonic images assaulting his dreamscape. Slowly, his legs and torso elongated as it became more lean. While it didn't wake him, he grimaced when suddenly his waist crunched inwards along with his groin. The mass cast off from his midsection helped to fuel the plumping of his rear, tearing his pajamas in the seat. Then his spine clicked - once, twice, thrice, more and more, before it decimated the remnants of the fabric covering his perfect posterior, growing out nearly 5' and dangling off the side of his bed, a spaded tail lightly tapping the rug below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As his fever dream intensified, sweat rolled off him, his body burning up, turning his skin <span class=\"clred\">beet red</span>. Bones popper as he gained another inch or two, but that wasn't the most noticeable change, as his chest began puffing up, running clean through the alphabet for minutes on end, popping button after button and straining the fabric of his top, until ten minutes later he was now sporting G-cup breasts that threatened to make the entire front explode open. It was then his sweat turned his ruined pajamas into mush, reforming them into a pair of black lace bra and panties that straddled the line somewhere between cute and sultry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn seized as his face contorted, his head thrashing about as featured lightened and shrank into cuter, more feminine shapes, as his ears extended and became long foot-long points. Finally, as the sun rose over the horizon, his hair cascaded down his head, turning snow white as it did, while two horns just like the ones from the headband jutted out of his forehead with violent force. The horns suddenly stopped their ominous glow as John bolted up, the sensation of growing the horns combined with his dreams were enough to jar him from his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's mind was reeling. \"That... That was the scariest dream I ever had?! What was half that stuff I saw? Oh, I knew I should have listened to my mom about those horror movies...\" Then he felt the pain in his forehead. \"Ow, my head... Headrush?\" John said aloud reaching for his head, but stopped when he heard his voice, hearing only that of... a cute girl. He slows down, and that's when his hand hits horn. \"When did I put...\" John's eyes went wide as his head slowly cranes over, seeing the headband on some sort of new macabre spiky black dresser that he was pretty sure wasn't there last night. \"Ooooo... kay\" John was still unnerved by his voice. Still holding his horn, he darts up and looks at the mirror in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeee!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was paralyzed by the sight staring back - this adult-sized female demon standing where he should be wearing just a bra and panties. John steps back in disbelief before tripping over his tail and sitting on it. The alien pain almost makes him cuss, but he covers his mouth before he screams, because he knows his mom would ground him if she heard him cussing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, mom!! Dad!! Charlotte!! Axton!! \"Oh man, How am I going to explain... this?\" He snaps the waistband of the panties forward to check. Yep, all girl. Also all smooth. \"I thought grown-ups had hair down there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he <i>(or should we say \"she\" from now on since he's seen for himself, or herself)</i> heard footsteps coming up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn realized her previous worry about how she was going to explain this was something she was about to face sooner than she had hoped. The door opened...</span></div></div>",

John got up and ran after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta call a priest, gotta call a priest...\" was all she could muster as she ran down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm John!!\" John began, beginning down the stairs after her, before a sudden jerk from her tail stops her in her place, making her fall on her tush for the second time in oh so few seconds, and on less forgiving stairs too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have here?\" Axton says, holding her tail. \"Who are you, and why ya chasing our mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut it out, fart-breath!!\" John groaned. \"I could tell you, but your tough meat head probably won't understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxton has a flash of recognition of John having used that same insult on him before, and said, \"Hey, those are things dingus says!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because I AM dingu...

A priest comes in and says, \"I came as fast I could. Now what is so ur... <b>HOLY CRAP, THAT'S A DEMON.</b>\" She had already spun around making for the door when mom stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't you going to, you know, get it tell us where my son is, then exorcise it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, I just got out of seminary school, and they never said shit about fighting no real demons!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a priest. Now go earn your tax-exempt status!!\" John's mom shoves him back into the kitchen, where John was sitting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, mom overreacted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overreacted.\" Axton answered John. They both sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The priests takes his time setting up, anointing some holy water, pulling out a bible, and hoping he doesn't die. \"Why am I doing this again? I mean, even in the movies, it's always the old dude exorcising the evil, and he's never alone...\" He throws some holy water in John's face. \"Um... The power of Christ compels you!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0John stares back at him like he's an idiot. \"You know, I keep trying to tell you I'm sitting right here, but noooooo, no one ever listens to the 10-year old!!\" John snarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The priest looks at John's massive rack, pinned up and forming a mighty valley of cleavage thanks to her bindings. \"10-year old, my foot. Now, um, agent of Lucifer, tell us where the boy is!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have to agree with that.\" Axton adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The priest seems flabbergasted. \"Well, I'm out of ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of crap seminary school did you graduate from!!\" John's mom yelled. \"Get the Vatican on the line if you have to!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the priest and mom argued, Axton said, \"So dingus, got any bright ideas how you got yourself in this mess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... unless...\" It then hits him like a ton of bricks. \"Crap, the devil horn headband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that dumb thing you went on about using for your Halloween costume this year...?\" Axton asks. \"Damn, I was going to steal that from you. Good thing I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The priest then noticed what they were saying and asked, \"What horns?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0John sighed, before the ropes came loose and fell to the floor, parts of it partly shredded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the...\" mom stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had nothing but time to sit here getting used to my tail here, and you should know by now Axton sucks at tying knots. I'm the one that went to scouts, you know.\" John notices the shredded rope. \"And it seems this thing on the end is quite sharp... Ow!!\" John pokes her finger and sticks her tongue on it, holding it there. Everyone stares at her. \"Well, don't look at me. Get a band-aid or something!! I'm bleeding!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really mom, you don't see it.\" Axton sighs. \"And butthole here calls me dense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Band-aid? Anyone?! No?\" John grunts before turning, \"Alright, follow me.\" She holds her finger on her tongue the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That <b>IS</b> something John would do, but I always did say he was a weird kid, being into horror movies and stuff like that...\" mom though, following them from the rear. She then shakes her head. \"No, no, that's too weird to believe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upstairs, back in John's room, the horns still sat there, lying on the new dresser. \"There they are!!\" John exclaims, pointing at the instrument of his change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The priests was holding them, saying, \"I don't see anything off about them. Looks like a normal costume piece to me, although they do look a lot like your horns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's mom bats them out of his hands, exclaiming, \"Are you even a priest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Picking up objects a demon itself says are hexed and looking at them with your bare hands? Can you <b>BE</b> more stupid?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everyone turns to look at Axton rummaging through the dresser, leering at the miniskirts and small tops. \"Mom will <b>NEVER</b> let you go in any of this stuff, though I got to say those horns got some good taste.\" He chuckles. \"Hah, look at your uniform!!\" He pulls out a girls' school uniform that's shirt appears to not be long enough to cover her midriff and a pleated tartan miniskirt with a hole in the rear that looked like it'd barely get halfway down her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, school!! What am I going to about school, my friends, going out... This is worse than when I had the mumps!!\" John falls to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it clicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you have been telling the truth all along...\" mom wavered, \"You're my son...\" John just nods, tears rolling down her face. She leans down and hugs him. \"I... I should have listened the first time. I'm always ignoring you, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, mom.\" John whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm NOT casting her back into the pit of hell?\" the priest asks, dumbfounded as he motions for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to ask me twice!!\" He runs and grabs his stuff. \"I knew I should of just kept working at the Hot Topic!!\" he exclaims as he runs out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, John asks, \"Well, what do we do now, mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grabs her head and becomes flustered again. \"Crap, how are we going to explain this?! Not to mention what am I going to say to the principal. 'Oh, please don't mind the fact my boy somehow turned into a succubus, but he would still like to attend school, so if you could explain it to the staff...' That's going to be one fun conference. And then you got the obvious problems - FBI, CIA, NSA, Fox News, they'll all want to dissect you or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you're scaring me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>WELL NOBODY'S DISSECTING MY DAUGHTER!!</b>\" John's mom exclaim, fist held up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still a boy on the insi...\" John tries to correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>BOOBIES SAY OTHERWISE!!</b>\" She interjects, holding her fist-pumped pose. She goes to the window, opens it up, and proclaims to the world, middle fingers blaring, \"<b>I LOVE MY CHILD NO MATTER HOW SHE LOOKS, SO HANDS OFF!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence, as onlookers stare at her look she's lost her mind. \"<b>THAT'S NICE. SOME OF US HAVE THIRD SHIFT, YOU KNOW!!</b>\" a random neighbor yells out, before the outside world resumes its daily grind. If John could get any redder, she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's mom for ya.\" Axton utters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout then, Charlotte groggily walks into the room and says, \"Mommy, why are you yelling? We're going to be late for school. Oh, hey Axton, weird red naked lady...\" She turns adn steps back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always knew she was a heavy sleeper, but that's just ridiculous.\" Axton responds to anyone that could hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Charlotte runs back in and shouts, \"Weird red naked lady!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding the most conservative thing they could find in John's dresser, a pair of black hot pants with a hole in the back for her tail and a pink tank top that showed off plenty of cleavage and said \"Hot Stuff!!\" in red letters across her ample chest, but otherwise was rather modest, they sat downstairs and tired to explain the situation the best they could to a six-year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're saying John's in this girl and it's all because of these horns he bought yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" mom said, waiting on baited breath to see how she processed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" A collective sense of sarcastic surprise came from all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, it only made him <b>LOOK</b> like a devil girl. It's still John in there, and John is John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really do need to have more faith in my kids. It took her 10 seconds to believe this...\" mom grumbles in her brain. \"Now the hard stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is suddenly distracted as she hears John yell, \"Charlotte!! Cut that out!!\" seeing John snatch her tail away from Charlotte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tail!! Tail!! I wanna play with the cute tail!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... tail, isn't a plaything!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems things are calming down...\" Mom then sees the clock. \"Crap!! School!! What should I do!!\"</span></div></div>",

He was pretty bored, since he was just at the mall because his mom dragged him and his sister there, though she did let John try to find something he liked in this new clothes store that popped up. John was trying to find the boys' section, but he hadn't a clue where it was. He was in the mens' section now, but it obviously was not the boys' section. However, John's hand brushed up against one of the pairs of swimming trunks on display, though he didn't really pay much attention to it... and didn't see it vanish. What he did notice, however, was he seemed to be getting taller as he walked. Was his mind playing tricks on him? He stood still, and looked down. Yep, the ground was getting further away, and his shirt was exposing his abdomen and his shorts exposed more of his thighs. Eventually, he looked very lanky from him still having childish proportions and John was a little freaked out, but this was only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pecs emerged on his chest that stretched his shirt, followed by a six-pack erupting underneath as his torso became thicker. John could feel his face becoming a bit more mature and defined, followed by his arms getting beefier. He flexed one of them and his jaw dropped at the size of his bicep, before his hands became bigger and stronger. He then felt his butt become a bit more toned, and the contents of his underwear enlarged and elongated to the point of causing a noticeable bulge that threatened to demolish his boxers, but still being a child mentally he just covered it with his powerful hands in embarrassment as his legs also beefed up and his feet got bigger. If that wasn't enough, then all of John's clothes dissolved except for his boxers, which then transformed into a pair of men's swimming trunks - the pair that was now missing on display, he saw, as he looked behind him to see if anyone saw him, which they thankfully didn't. And as the cherry on top, John felt hair grow out of his chest, arms, legs, private parts, and even his butt, and felt some stubble pepper his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-guess I shouldn't wander off,\" John said in his new manly voice, as he began to walk his tall, powerful body around to see if somebody could help him understand what the actual heck just happened to him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While John walked around and looked in the clothing store, he marveled at the variety of clothing. He had passed a section with men\u2019s suits and shirts, then a section of means outerwear, coats and so, and was now walking along a similar section aimed at women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I help you\u201d a friendly woman asked, as he turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh, not really. Just looking around\u201d, a startled John responded a bit shyly, unused to this kind of attention.<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to John, he had brushed some clothing with his back while turning around answering the polite saleswoman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn walked some meters and somehow it felt different, but he shrugged it off. But then it was this sound of click clacking shoes and someone following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned around, discovering that no one was behind him, no one made those clkick clakc heel sounds,  he felt his jacket falling in place on his legs after he rotated a half turn. That was strange he thought as he had a short jacket on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked down, John got utterly shocked at what he saw. His jeans, jacket and shoes were all gone. Instead he wore a long black coat, and reaching down to his ankles. He firt thought it was hairy, but then for some reason he now realized that this was a mink fur coat. And to his utter dismay and shock, underneath the coat, as he looked, he found that was dressed in a black and white patterned skirt suit and black high heeled leather boots, perfectly sized for his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u00c4uuh, I have a hound-tooth patterned skirt suit on\u201d he told himself silently as a matter of fact, not even reflecting on that he now knew what the pattern was called and that what he wore was skirt suit. And if he would have known, that his face was now plastered with make-up appropriate for a a slightly older but rich trophy wife, with pinkish lipstick and long pink manicured nails (which he had yet to notice), he would have been horrified.<br>\r\n\u201cMrs, can I help you? I see that you have a taste for the expensive and elegant so could I recommend you Mrs to look in this section over there\u201d, and the saleswoman pointed in the direction John had just come from as she headed to the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was absolutely dumbfounded. What had happened? He came in the shop, walked around, and now he was dressed in clothing for a rich woman, an elegant black mink fur, which he now felt that he was very proud of, and his best skirt suit, black leather boots, and now he noticed that he carried a black quilted purse at his side with some golden metal-chain attached to and now hanging over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, mrs\u201d, Jon shouted as he went after the saleswoman who had been standing at the cashier for a few seconds and was now heading through a door labeled \u2018for employees only\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn\u2019s reading skills were not good enough, to grasp the meaning of this yet, but he realized that he was not allowed to walk in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn waited and waiter, and it felt like an eternity, but already after 15 minutes, after knocking and trying to open the door several times, and without seeing another person in the shop, John decided to go out and look around the shop from the outside. Perhaps there was some other way in, where he could meet the saleswoman, and get his sneakers, pants, t-shirt and jacket back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out, unbeknownst to John he started to fiddle with his Chanel purse. It was first at the second drag on his long woman\u2019s cigarette he realized what he was doing, and he suddenly remembered that he had picked up a black cigarette case from the purse that he now carried around without a second thought and then had lit the cigarette in an all too used manner that he was now smoking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAouuuh, disgusting...\u201d John said out loud, grimacing while experiencing its foul taste, as he tried to throw away the cigarette. Somehow the long cigarette remained in his hand, and soon he found himself continuing smoking, blowing out long thin billows of smoke up to the side as only an adept female smoker can, while he continued searching for another entrance and the saleswoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One moment a sales associate asks me if i need help, the next I'm in a mink coat and this stunning skirt suit... Oh god, did i just say, 'stunning?' What the hell is happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout that time, Jimmy noticed the coat's back was shrinking up, while Hannah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, are you getting... taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn run over to a mirror and, just as it was stated, he was gaining height. But not just height. John seemed to be maturing ever so much, meanwhile the make-up John was wearing continued to remain proper and neat, but now looked like it was in it's proper place as his bone structure shifted to that of cute petite 20-ish woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam, you're right!! I'm getting taller!! What's with this place?!\" John spoke in a new alto voice, covering his mouth after speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout this time, Jimmy turned white as a sheet, uttering, \"Guys, you have to see this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at John's back, where the coat had now shrunk down to a waist-length jacket, the sight startling the friends more was the 4\" fluffy golden mink's tail lifting the seat of John's skirt up, flicking about, not to mention the shorter skirt that could now be reclassified as a miniskirt, ending halfway down his now shapely thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, John!! Your legs are hotter than Adam's sister's legs now!!\" Adam punches Jimmy in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you think my legs look THAT good?\" John nervously laughs at Adam, billowing a bit of smoke at Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then arcs his back in discomfort as his hair cascades downward in waves of golden locks that reach his tail, but more pressingly with a loud giant E-cup breasts explode out his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" Jimmy smiles. Hannah groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there's a second pop, and a third, and finally a fourth, and under the top of the suit there was some definition that some extra lumps appeared under the first set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me, but did John just grow four rows of breasts?\" Hannah uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I did... wonderful, aren't they, children?\" John tells them. The response begins to worry them about John's mental state. About that same time golden fur began to sprout out of John's legs, the backs of his hands, and his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, I spoke too soon.\" Jimmy utters. Hannah punches him in the same spot Adam had punched him earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam remains too blank and dumbfounded to do or say anything, however it seems he is fascinated by the spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam, you suddenly seem way too relaxed about all of this... Adam?\" Hannah tried to get his attention to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, John's ears moved up to the top of his head and reformed into golden furred mink ears, as light pad formed on his hands and feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute or so of not seeing any further changes, Hannah tapped John. John still had the face of a 20-something human woman, and judging from his unbuttoned blouse, his neck, all his breasts, and the rest of the front of his torso was devoid of fur, but every other inch of his body was covered in a luscious golden mink pelt that matched his glowing blonde locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, John...\" Jimmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dahling, I've never felt better...\" John uttered, wafting smoke everywhere. \"Now...\"</span></div></div>",

Their memory, personality, their attitude towards things. It would give them a completely different lifestyle. He wanted to cry out or throw it away right away, but some strange force compelled him, something irresistible and alluring about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I really going to do this?\" He asked outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at himself, now more a her, his outfoot looked as gothy and dark as one could get. But strangely he wasn't bothered already, how much else would change about him if he used the lipstick. Would he like his new self? That was a given, but would it be better or worse? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot believe I'm going to do this. I better not become some whiny emo or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe figured the only way to find out would be to try it. Although it was probably the new calm goth demeanor talking, something about the mysteriousness and potential in trying out this lipstick, and a new persona with it was just irresistible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe popped off the cap, and gave the utensil a squeeze. A creamy shade of Orchid wax lay underneath in the form of a solidified tube. He swallowed hard and puckered out his lips, coating the stick with the sensational object. It felt cold at first, but gradually warmer as he spread it across his lips, top to bottom, left to right and so on. The wax stuck and painted his mouth a royal purple color, pretty and purple, The word purple struck a weird thought in his mind, a gentle nudge or tug across his thoughts. It brought up both images of queens as well as magic and sorceresses, damsels and princesses, movie stars and vixens, repeating images and thoughts of all things feminine and yet this femininity itself was diverse and welcoming, one he couldn't help but accept and embrace at the feelings it gave him. He finally puckered up once last time and smeared a liquidity, lush full coat of it, letting the feelings and changes wash over him at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time his lips were complete and mind sufficient ally comforted, changed and settled, he took in his new feelings.

He, she felt Goth. What did that mean? With some forethought and examination he wondered himself. His clothes were different, and he certainly felt rather pretty and comfortable. And yet, he was somewhat the same. More insightful, ready to reflect and think on things. Everything seemed more exciting, but not in a shallow and colorful way, but one of examination. Things he would have scoffed at before, he now wanted the to take the time to consider. Things about magic and the occult, about femininity and womenhood, it's roles and legitimacy were now subjects on his, her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTolerance and uniqueness were another. Her past was changing, memories rearranged of a family less accepting and more plagued with problems than he knew. His goth persona often being a cause. She remembered her mother often showering her with praise as child, and then confusion at why she didn't embrace 'traditional' views of girlhood. Why she didn't date or do sexually humiliating sports or wear oppressive outfits. Sure she wasn't a ray of sunshine, but she had to protest against these things, the things that made her feel unique. The want, no need to rebel against standards, against conventions of normalcy. She remembered her geek and hipster friends who lived on the fringe of societies scorn, and yet had a deeper appreciation for them, although that was probably history re-written aswell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attitude she could said to channel was a combination of nonchalance and passive aggressiveness. Of course she was still aggressive, just not actively. She was always sarcastic, cynical and moody, raising objections and critical examination far past where it was needed. Yet it fall felt natural to her, to not question the norm and equally tolerate the uncommon all felt perfectly right to her. The freakyness of her wardrobe felt all the more comforting.  She just wished her relationship with her mother could improve, but unless she wanted to be a perky delicate flower bathing in lilacs and primroses she'd hardly expect it. Even when her mother had tried to indulge her interest, it just seemed embarrassing and often cringe deserving. She wanted to be unique and accepting, not have others try to become like her to be accepted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awful loud load of new complicated thoughts and emotional dynamics clouded her mind. Was this how all goths thought? Of course not, just her. She was unique afterall, although she scoffed and chuckled whenever she thought that, since she knew it was a lie afterall, magical lipstick containers aside. It was just whoever this character she was that the makeup had made her into obviously carried her own load of emotional baggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe John part of her, or original self thought it ironic. He thought Goths to be so mysterious and weird, but the truth is actually a lot different, for better or worse. He'd never thought that she'd be in touch with her emotions like this, and yet so far away, and so complicated away. The thought made her giggle. She also realized she had a swarmy sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was going to be this new goth girl, before she figured out any of her various persecutions, she'd rather figure a new name for herself.<br>\r\n\"Rose. Rose is my name. That sounds right, truly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bladder rumbled. \"And Rose has to go to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran off and did that. When she arrived back where she was,</span></div></div>",

Don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his pleas, his mouth was suddenly glued shut as purple-fuschia lipstick applied itself onto his lips, leaving him unable to control his lips. The effect of the lipstick quickly coated his lips, shading them not only a shiny, like juicy bright lilacs but plumper, and yet more defined, exquisite almost. The mascara quickly redrew his lashes and made them thick and long, changing his eyes to be more open and round and revealing all the while. His eyes turned purple, and eye shadow coating his eyes made the skin look darker, like a panda's. The blush and powder gave his skin a pale complexion. His facial structure reforms and soon took the appearance of a petite, rounded cute goth girl. A mirror floated up showing him his new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that, is that really me? What the hell have you done to me?!?\" He cried, covering his mouth at his more-high pitched voice. His hands now could move to grab the mirror. He tried smearing and rubbing at the makeup, but he wouldn't bulge, and his face remained that of a cute goth girl regardless. Suddenly his hair darkened over and smoothened like silk, growing bangs extending over his face like a crescent moon. His eyes could only blink in their round fullness, like dark purple marbles staring into the abyss. The levitating stopped and she fell to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I look like a girl! A goth girl!\" He screamed in his new voice, tears running done her face and carrying the dark mascara along with it in dark streaks, but not removing it from her eyes nevertheless. \"No! Stop, change me back, change me back! I'm not a girl, or a goth, this isn't right!\" Despite her pleas, the articles of makeup danced,dark clothes and goth accessories now wiggling their way to her as well. Suddenly a dark presence formed in her mind, and she closed her eyes, kneeled over and screamed. She heard eerie giggles in different feminine voices coming from the room, but the worst one was the one to manifest in her mind and soon replace her own. <br>\r\nThe mental changes were starting.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't an anime fan himself, but he knew several people, guys and girls, who couldn't get enough of the adorable catgirls.  He recalled one time how a particularly nerdy girl had decided to wear a pair of cat ears for his high school's halloween celebration.  He did admit she looked rather cute.  However that was kind of ruined when he saw a guy charge in wearing similar cat ears, meowing, purring, and even licking people.  It was all just a bit too strange for John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the longer John looked at the cat ears, the less strange and more alluring they became.  He began to wonder what it would be like to wear them.  Glancing about to see if anyone would notice, John took the cat ears and placed them quickly on his head.  After adjusting them for a few moments, John was just getting comfortable when he felt someone touch his shoulder.  Turning around he saw it was the store workers, a young attractive black haired girl.  John guessed she might be just 17, his age.  However, before he could talk, the young girl spoke first.</span></div></div>",

He remembered walking out of the house thinking himself cool looking, but now he couldn't shake the feeling he looked like some reject from a bad boy band.  \"Actually, I'm here for a bit of an overhaul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a makeover?\" stepped in the clerk, cutting off John's explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not a...\" said Joen as he looked back to the clerk.  She was young, but very beautiful, dressed in a light blue dress the hem of which just past her hips leading to a pair of cute shorts she wore underneath, which lead to her long stockings and her cute flats.  Needless to say this girl new how to dress, plus the twinkle she had in her eyes at the thought of giving him a makeover was just something John didn't have the heart to say no to.  \"Sure, I guess you could say I'm looking for a makeover.  I'm kind of tired of looking... looking like a-a... uh... what's a good way to describe this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A reject from a bad boy band?\" answered the clerk jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, exactly that actually.\"  The two laughed for a moment.  John looked at the girl in front of him.  She seemed like a rather nice individual, it might be nice to try and get to know her better.  \"Can I ask you name Miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Yuki, Yuki Chen.  And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me John.  Well Yuki, would you be so kind as to help me with my make over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to.  Wait here and I'll find something really nice,\" the girl then reached her hand up high and petted John behind the cat ears.  John smiled, happy that the girl seemed to like the cat ears.  She then rushed off to find some appropriate clothes.  As John leaned up against one of the walls he noted something.  It was weird, John remembered he not wearing the cat ears earlier, but he couldn't think of a time where he didn't have them.  Meanwhile, John had little knowledge of exactly how his life was going to change...</span></div></div>",

Stiff, he rolled his shoulders to try and get the kinks out as his broad frame melted into something softer. Muscles and fat disappearing, leaving him with a much more slender silhouette. the top of his head inching down the pillar ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could be taking so long?\" john muttered, his baritone voice lightened to a drifting tenor as he bushed the ear behind his ears again, feeling it tickle his neck. His crossed arms drifted down, until it was just his hands resting against his lap, fingered intertwined, a like shade of pink covering his fingernails.

It looked like it was designed to be relatively modest, with the top not going down too far and the skirt being a decent length. But holding it by a hanger, he could tell that it looked like it was made for someone a few years younger- not to mention, a woman! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really what I'm supposed to wear?\" But then the face of the store clerk flashed in his head. <i>I don't want to make Miss Yumi mad at me again...</i> John put aside the oddity of knowing the clerk's name and rushed to put on the uniform. As he figured, he struggled just to get his head through the hole, and while the outfit ended up being a little stretchier than he expected, he felt like it would be almost impossible to take a deep breath while wearing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds however, John felt tingles all over his body. Suddenly, the dress felt much more comfortable. Looking in the mirror, it almost seemed like he had gotten a little shorter-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done in there yet?\" Yumi called from outside, disrupting John's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-almost!\" he replied. As he took a chance to smooth out some wrinkles, his eyes went down to his dainty, hairless legs. <i>Wait, something's wrong...I almost forgot the stockings!</i> He found the black nylon accessories resting on the nearby bench, quickly pulling them up each of his legs to reach mid-thigh. He looked back in the mirror, happy with the fit as he noticed the slightest bit of exposed skin between his stockings and the hem of his dress. The top dipped down to show a little bit of his chest, but nothing he'd consider inappropriate for the job. <i>Very cute!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back outside, John did a little twirl as he presented himself to Yumi. \"Ta-da!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi takes a second to look him over. \"Hmm.....\"</span></div></div>",

It'll be more important as you get older and your chest, uh...<i>develops</i>. Besides, we want customers who like maids, not flat-out perverts. Now go and put one on!\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" John felt himself shaking a little. \"B-but where-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi grabbed a small black bra off a nearby hanger. \"I'll deduct it from your pay. C'mon, no more wasting time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDashing back to the stall, John stripped off his uniform, leaving him in just his panties as he now stared in the mirror at his lithe, feminine figure. <i>Cute and striped, just like I remember them.</i> He tried posing with hands on his hips and was surprised by how quickly he ran into skin. Holding the bra, he managed to get it on first try. <i>I don't like wearing them, but I'm glad big sis taught me just in case.</i> It ended up being pretty snug, but even though it was only a small B-cup, there was still some extra space in the cups themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat quickly changed once John slipped on the dress again, finding it to be a much easier task this time around. Now he could feel his flesh gently filling the fabric of the undergarment- a perfect fit for his size. He made sure to tug his top a little so the barest bit of cleavage could be seen. <i>Noticeable but professional. Just like Miss Yumi always says!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning outside, he presents himself once more to his boss. \"What do you think, Miss Yumi?\"</span></div></div>",

Without thinking, he quickly grabbed the hem and pulled it off like a dirty shirt, throwing it across the store. He looked down in shock, his soft skin pushed out into a pair of perky breasts, and he realized he was now standing naked in the store, with everyone looking in the direction of his high shrieking voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly turned to run, and found himself tripping over a stray garment and landing into the prom sale rack - which was full of dresses that no girl in their right mind would buy. The reason - they were unbelievably gaudy and huge, and they did a great job of cushioning John's fall, and they quickly wrapped themselves around his flailing form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing his arms around and fighting through the swishing crinoline and satin, John got to his feet, bringing forty pounds of huge prom gown with him. The pink monstrosity had found its way onto his girlish body, and had sealed him tight within the bodice. He grabbed and pulled all over, and found this gown wasn't going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Which is exactly how you are dressed now.  The diaper in question is a babyish boy print, stars and moons, with a blue border. You try in vain to claw at the diaper but your fingers find no purchase, the cashier was right, the diaper was not coming off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It's a shame too, any other piece we might have been able to remove, but the diaper is particularly resilient. Once it latches on it wont come off easily until its been used,\" you didn't have to ask him what he meant by 'used' it was perfectly clear, \"Unfortunately by that point its too late. If the diaper stays on until then you'll find your self diaper dependent for the rest of your life. Not to mention your life will get a serious makeover. The changes will be pretty slow though. We might be able to minimize the effects. As you wet it, the stars and moons on the diaper will disappear, and once they're gone it'll be too late to undo any of the changes,\" he paused, letting the news sink in, \"The diaper should last for quite a while I'd wager, may be even a couple days if you limit your fluid intake, but after that...well. On the bright side everyone you meet outside this store will have their view of reality warped a little. To them you'll have always been this way, their relationships with you won't have changed, you'll just find them shifted to accommodate this new reality as well. Your friends and family will be driven to care for you, and your needs. But we should be able to control things a bit. Just remember every time you wet that diaper your life will get a little more babyish, your bed will become a crib, your clothes will change to match, you'll begin to lisp like a toddler, you'll drink from a bottle, you will suck on a pacifier to sooth yourself, you may even get a little younger physically. And every time you wet the diaper you'll lose a little more of your control until you become diaper dependent. So the longer you can hold out the less that will change, and the more time we have to try to undo this. Again, I am terribly sorry about this, I've told management that we need to keep the fetish gear under lock and key, but they never listen to me. You can keep the diaper bag that came out of, if you want, on the off chance we fail to get the diaper off in time. Since it is magic, the bag will never completely empty, once the last diaper is removed, just zip it up and it will refill, same with the rash cream, powder and wipes that are to be found in the side pockets. There are also plastic pants in there as well, should help deaden the crinkle a little bit. We'll call you when we have a solution. I am sorry we can't do more for you at the moment,\" the cashier finished, pulling on plastic gloves and carefully handing you the diaper bag. You take it resignedly as the cashier hand you your clothes. you hand him your scrawled phone number. \"Uh oh, looks like you might have wet the diaper some already,\" the cashier gasps. You look down and sure enough, one of the stars has turned from yellow to blue and is beginning to fade. The bundle of your clothes shakes slightly, and you yelp, thinking another cursed clothing item got tangled up with your shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The movement ceases, and you touch the dropped shorts with your toe. When nothing happens you pick them up and examine them. Initially you don't find anything different until you reach the crotch. There is now a row of buttons that runs along the inseam, that unsnap, clearly designed like toddler pants, for easy diaper changes. You tug the shorts on to notice they are a little bigger too with an elastic waist band to accommodate the thick padding of the diaper, exactly like toddler shorts. You pull on your shirt, and hesitate before grabbing the diaper bag as well. You then walk out of the store praying to god they can undo this quickly. You try to pull your shirt down  over the 2-3 inches of the colorful diaper exposed above the waist of your shorts, only to find your shirt has shortened just enough to expose to the diaper wings<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start heading home confused and upset...</span></div></div>",

She was a cruel baroness that used magic to manipulate dandys and gentlemen to do her bidding, and was infamous not only for her sadism, beauty and yet vanity, lack of empathy or concern for anyone but herself, and also her utter narcissism, but mostly for her magic and dominatrix activities, which usually overlapped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the height of her power she had well over a 100 people under her control, and millions of dollars to spare (Which was a wealthy fortune when she was alive). She'd control and seduce men, and those that wouldn't fall to her whims she would control and change them with her magic. If humiliating them wouldn't good enough, she'd outright brainwash and convert them to be part of her followers, who practically worshiped her and the pain she inflicted. Despite her near cult and powerful charms, a magic hunter sought justice for her crimes and persecuted her, eventually defeating her. However the crafty Marissa transferred her essence to those gloves before she was vanquished, and the witch that cursed this place eventually left them here. It was rumored she was an admirer and noted follower of Marissa's work. And that's why you'll be soon sadly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there silent, shaking at the very words you just heard. \"Wait, you mean that's who I'm going to become?

You and the Cashier take a breather and walk to the back, past a shelf full of costumes that would make Halloween sick of itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit down again and but your shiny black hands on your laps, he tells you some more.<br>\r\n\"I told you Marissa was vain, and she was also power hungry and always scheming. Hardly a fool, she knew the hunters were coming for her, so she cast an extended spell on those gloves. Once you wear them for long enough and have become mostly Marissa, you will obtain a portion of her powers, able to alter and transform others into your followers. Those with substantial potential will also become alike to Marissa, as vain, dominant, and sexually inclined as her, maybe down to her appearance. Those will in turn seek to recruit others. The more followers and duplicates of Marissa's essence you have, the more power you, the new Marissa Magika will obtain. Eventually once you've powered up and gathered an army, the new you will most likely take it to the Magical Hunters themselves to seek revenge, if not them their descendants.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible! You mean not only will I become some hag, but one out for blood? I don't want to be this, or part of any of this!\" You whine. The cashier cannot help but agree with you, urging you to stop picking at the gloves yet telling you his sake in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. And neither do I! But my uncle is a novice Magical Hunter, and that's how I got this job. If you completely convert, he'll be among your targets, and than me I'm sure just for being related.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tear at your hair at the horror of what your hearing, running your smooth rubbery hands through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These. Damned. GLOVES!\" In a fit of rage, you manage to bite off the fingerpieces of one of them. They liquefy in your mouth, whitening your teeth with two new fangs added, while darkening your lips to an oily black as well, feminine yet perfect for giving kisses. A kiss of death more like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your fingernails, and to your horrified shock they've already grown 2 inches and been coated with a glossy black shell of color.

As he did, he even began humming a soft tune to himself, which almost seemed to give him some peace of mind. Still, as this was going on, the laces of his shoes vanished completely, as the sides of his shoes crawled down a ways. As they became more like leather, they formed into pair of soft, black ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the oddest thing was that, as Dave seemed to finish, a tiny light came out of his fingertips, coating the table as it looked even shinier.

He knew he should be finding a solution for this weird glove, but it hardly mattered to him. Nor did the knots tied at the back of his expanding hair, taking on a graceful crystalline shine, or his ballet flats combing up his legs and forming silken stockings up to his knees. His upper shirt and shorts finally became as one, and he was so caught up singing gently a tune he hardly knew his recollection of levitating the towel were not present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pretty neat trick.\" A voice said nearby.

Immediately though, he stood straight up, wondering where he came from. Why was he acting so prim and proper? Still, his mind didn't go near the strange shop, as if he had resolved to never think of it again. As you shrugged that off, Michelle had something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking at how you work, it's almost like you're a modern Cinderella.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...I couldn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good thing.

I couldn't possibly....\" Dave trailed off again, almost slipping on the ground, but caught himself with the table. As he gathered himself, he noticed that his fused shirt and shorts seemed to be getting tighter on his body. And, was it him, or was he thinner? He was sure that he was eating right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I need to go for now. I'll be here tonight.

He saw shops litter each side, and felt strangely attracted to some and afraid of others. As he crept closer to one, he looked into a show window and saw his reflection staring back. He had a near-blouse like outfit with heels, a skirt, and longer hair. But for some reason this all escape his grasp, he was more afraid of this reflection for the image staring back itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, whose there!\" But it was only him. He looked around him to see if anyone heard him, less he cry out of sheer embarrassment. But nobody payed attention so he sighed and slowly stared back at the feminine vision meeting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw slightly startled him, but he also felt strangely drawn to it. The person in the reflection was pretty. Rather pretty, if he had to say so, but a sense of modesty welled up and he didn't want to get in over his head praising it. But there was still something to be desired in it, an image of prettyness that lacked finesse, grace and charms almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around slightly, bending left and right as he kept his eyes on the image. Tucking the sleeves on his blouse, straightening out the skirt, trying for a more elegant pose were all things he tried to straighten the image he saw out. Still, something didn't quite sit right, but he felt that might fix it self over time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked his hand, only to find that raw and unladylike. So he only tapped his finger to the tip of his tongue, and began wetting his hair and shaping it, bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis shouldn't have done much, but with a sparkle and perhaps a bit of magic, his hair began to grow more, upwards this time as it became more shapely with each gentle stroke or poke. It began levying up, combing itself vertically like a that of something magical. When it was finished, it was slightly shorter at the bottom, save for two playful bangs swishing at his side, but the rest of his hair was combed up and in a style that would be more fit for royalty or perhaps a magical creature, with braids and nearly welted stands as demure and pretty as a cornucopia at a fall's lovely thanksgiving dinner. She swirled it around, hoping it wouldn't hit anybody but it stood completely in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new look put a gentle smile on her face. She walked out with her skirt swishing about, eager to go home but still keeping today and tonight's events in mind.</span></div></div>",

Her legs, all smoother than they used to be, looked nice the skirt she wore, and the heels clacked along the ground. The large amounts of hair on her head made her look quite elegant, yet also unique at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I should get home before tonight. I need to get some things done.\" Dave remembered the comments about tonight, still feeling quite embarrassed about possibly singing. There was quite a bit of time beforehand, so perhaps going home would ease her mind of it. With that in mind, she kept on walking, going past the store from earlier. The lady inside got a quick look at Dave and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say there will be a new maid around for a long time.\" she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave didn't hear that obviously, but still felt a bit tense as she passed the store. Something ticked her mind about that place, but perhaps it wasn't a good thing to think about. After all, who knew when your mother would be home after her errands. To Dave's surprise though, she felt something in one of her blouse pockets, which turned out to be a pair of car keys. While Dave's mind briefly wondered what they were doing there, she immediately thought that they were for her own car in the parking lot. That was how she got here in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I thought Mom got me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis conflicting thought process stayed with Dave even after she exited the mall and found her own car, and a nice one at that. Taking off her heels to drive, she began driving like an expert, while some towels and other materials were flying around and cleaning up the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't have this place looking dirty. Come on, keep going.\" She smiled as if dancing to music. The ride home was rather pleasant, as Dave parked it in the driveway and called the materials to her hands. Putting her heels on, she nearly skipped towards the house, feeling pretty happy. As she did though, she briefly brought a hand to her chest, feeling something itching there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it's nothing too bad.\" She blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the elegant maid was about to get some curves to go with it.</span></div></div>",

As she looked around, the house seemed different, but she couldn't quite put her glove on it. The furniture seemed nicer, but wasn't it always nice? The dishes were all sparkling and done, but of course, why wouldn't they be? And the house was rather clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no that was wrong! Sure everything was put away and orderly, but by no means did that mean the house was clean, why she hadn't remembered the last time she cleaned it! It felt like a lifetime even. Gathering a featherduster and sweeper that was on a counter mysteriously, she grabbed a spray bottle as well and began getting to work. Even the already neat house needed cleaning of course!

As she worked by scrubbing, dusting, and reorganizing she took great joy in her work, each action or newly minted area bringing her a gentle pleasure. This pleasure allowed her to work ceaselessly, and ignore the changes it brought forth. Her hips lengthened, but her thighs and waist more so. Her stomach compressed as if she was wearing a corset, and her two wispy bangs swept down to her chest, which had grown moderate breast for a young lady, but not ample enough to embarrass her or draw unwanted attention to the reclusive maiden. Her legs and arms became longer, and she was quite lanky by the end, but a few more changes of her hips, shoulders, and frontal made her thin and lean, like a fay's wing about to blow in the breeze. And the more she changed, the more she walked gracefully, as if gliding with each step and leaving none the wiser, with not even a creak or sound per her movements. She quickly got to work, but couldn't shake off the feeling that something was wrong here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually finished the downstairs and made it back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frilly, soft tortoise bed, nothing wrong with that. Posters of fairies and maids, witches and princesses, seemed alright. A bookshelf of cleaning manuals, cooking recipes, and pictured books on female etiquette, from those of adult literacy age all the way to female oriented childrens books. Couldn't see anything wrong with that. A closet full of aprons, long silky sylph gowns and dresses, heels, lingerie, nighties and strangely..wigs? There were a few other kinky things in the back of the closet that Dave blushed at, but didn't spare another look. Nothing about that seemed out of place, not even his micro-vanity by his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent all of 20 minutes dusting and cleaning until even his already femme perfectionate room was even cleaner. When he was finished, he sat down on his bed and out of curiosity, started applying makeup from the counter. Why was it so strange from he thought, didn't he do this all the time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReasoning that he was naturally modest, it wouldn't be too bad if he prettied himself up, a girl like him did like to feel beautiful afterall he thought, not even aware his thoughts had begun to shift identifying herself as a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she head the door open, and a familiar voice calling.

However, she was graceful enough where it didn't really hinder her movements at all. She went downstairs, smiling as she saw a broom fly past her, doing a tiny bit of sweeping. She saw her beautiful mother across the room, looking different herself thanks the costume Dave was wearing. Mom now bore somewhat similar looks, and she even had this certain aura around her, much like Dave did now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you did a wonderful job of cleaning up. I'm just doing some touching up.\" smiled Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you mother.\" Dave smiled with a bow. \"You taught me everything after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother and \"daughter\" seemed to really hit it off, talking about certain things. Dave saw that her mom was much like her now; a mistress of servitude just like her. How great it was to follow in her footsteps. Mom was delighted when she heard about Dave's job cleaning up at the food court, especially regarding how beloved she already was there. She brightened up more at the mention of singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'll be wonderful.\" said Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Dave said, bowing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome small words seemed to come into Dave's brain in the next few minutes. Something about that old shop mentioning permanent reality change if not changed. Perhaps Mom becoming like you, even magical, was part of that. Still, part of you had not problem with that, even as you kept tidying up, face getting red at the thought of singing again. Mom even said something about possibly coming by later to watch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave's face was still red even when she picked out a nice white sylph gown to change into at the mall. It was soon time for it to begin, and Dave began to have this sense of go going back once this event was over. Still, thoughts of servitude and pleasing others (while being shy) still littered her brain, even causing her to think more like a young woman. Even that small annoyance in her groin seemed to be getting less of a notice than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief meal, Dave was soon off to the mall again, with the event in sight now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I hope I don't mess up.\" Dave said with a sigh.</span></div></div>",

Just stay calm and try your best, and you will do a beautiful job.\"  Her mom reassured you, hugging her with her arms around her slender waist.

Like a hurricane hitting an orderly, proper and well decorated home, everything was now in tatters. Bookshelves were foiled over, couches and sofas were tossed, picture frames and knickknacks no longer in place. The whole hose was totaled, even some of the paint seemed chipped. Cracks had appeared in floorboard and on the stairs, and this was only in the very first room! Dave dreaded to see what the upstairs or the kitchen looked like, but with the sound of broken glass shatter nearby he wasn't in any rush to worry and check, he had to get cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hurried and quickly put books back on their shelves and with what little strength he had, moved the furniture back with difficulty. He'd tried hard to look for the nails and picture frames that had belonged on each wall and put them back up. Some of them were cracked, but with a poke to the tongue and than to the frame, a little magic fixed that. He took a sweeper and cleaned whatever was unfixable, mounding up dirt and debris, taking the time to lick her pointer fingers and wave them just gracefully enough that the magic worked when she repaired cracks in the floor and wall. She took a hammer and nail, and with a little concentration was able to levitate them and quickly put the picture frames, hung object, damaged stairs and all of it back in no time at all thanks to the power of a little maiden magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the room was looking spotless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!

There are 7 other rooms in this house, and the clock's ticking.\" She gave the top of the timekeeper a knock, causing minutes of sand to shake and fall towards the bottom glass chasm. <br>\r\nShe tapped the Tiara on her forehead and another gust of wind blasted through the rest of the house once more, making things even further difficult.

With all of this, there was no time to waste. She stacked up pots and pans in their correct orders, while she enchanted a mop to at least start on the water on the floor. Once they were in their cabinets and she was able to hammer down the loose ones, she turned her attention quickly to the sink, looking underneath and fixing the somewhat broken plumbing. She even surprised herself with how fast she was doing things she didn't know before. Thankfully, food from the fridge was still in tact, though a bit disorderly. She quickly took care of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job. 6 more to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave heard Diane's voice in her head, feeling the next gust down the hall, towards the laundry room. Right when she entered that, a sweater immediately hit her in the face, causing her to untangle it. As you'd expect, clothes were everywhere, on the floor and on the ironing board. The washing machine seemed to be on the verge of overflowing too. Focusing on that, she got the wet clothes out, putting them in to the dryer quickly as a little magic took care of the washing machine. Getting the ironer going, she got out which clothes needed ironing and began smoothing them out, putting them onto their correct hangers and hanging them up. Truth be told, this was a bit tiring, even as she began to sort the laundry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep going. Still got many rooms after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is crazy.\" Dave said to herself as she hung up the last of the clothes. Socks and underwear went into a laundry basket, ready to be sorted another time. The whole place was spotless now. Dave gently wiped her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, all good.\"</span></div></div>",

Each leg took longer strides, and fought over which would be in front.

All that grease and fat. Yucky! You need to watch your figure, after all, so you decide on a healthy alternative: the light chef's salad and a small diet soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReceiving your order, you sashay back towards the tables, your mature feminine hips swaying hypnotically from side to side. For a moment you worry that your ass is getting too big, as you can feel it rhythmically jiggling as you move. But you ordered the salad, so things should be fine. And besides, men like big, round, plump asses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I care what men like?\u201d you whisper to yourself as you sit down on your comfortably padded new backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and begin talking a few delicate bites from your salad while pondering these strange alien thoughts that had just intruded upon your mind. You've never before wanted men to enjoy looking at your shapely legs, wide hips, and luscious ass. So why now does the thought of some strange man checking you out make you blush with secret enjoyment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppose there's no harm in men looking at your shapely figure. After all, you don't have a penis and look just like a supermodel from the waist on down. You know that's weird for a fifteen-year old boy. But it's just one small, freakish thing in your otherwise normal life. So why does it suddenly bother you now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you take a few more bites of your salad, enjoying the crunchy texture of the fresh vegetables. As you swallow, a new thought dawns on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's really always bothered you isn't the men checking out your scrumptious behind \u2013 it's the fact that your chest is flat as a washboard! You've always felt insecure about having such a womanly figure from the waist down, but looking like a teenage boy above the waist. If only you had the breasts to match your supermodel lower torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you munch away on your salad, a slight tingling sensation begins stirring about the top of your tight, dark blue jeans. You belly tucks in a bit, smoothing out considerably. And strange, new lumps of flesh begin to sprout out from your chest, swelling up slowly into the large, round, firm orbs of womanhood appropriate atop such a gorgeous figure as yours. Next, your shoulder narrow and the muscles of your arms begin to shrink. Your entire arms, hands, and fingers are now far more dainty and petite. A rich coat of satin burgundy finish graces your newly lengthened fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing the strange tingling sensation, you stir from your reverie and look down at yourself. You're now wearing a short sleeved, tight pink top with a deep v-cut down the center, revealing the generous curves of your womanly cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was I worrying about before?\u201d you say, laughing aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have gorgeous, enormous breasts! There's nothing wrong with that. Honestly, what's with these strange thoughts you've been having today: worrying about men, being tempted to eat gross junk food, and then imagining that you had no breasts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a strange day,\u201d you say to yourself as you finish the last bite of your salad.</span></div></div>",

The laces sink into the shoe and the material starts to become a patent leather. It shines in the harsh light of the mall.

He became worried when the jacket opened on its own and fell off the hanger, swinging towards him as if it intended to wrap itself around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-!?\" he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jacket wrapped itself around John and, to his surprise, the zipper closed! John was now trapped inside the jacket but it turned out to only be the beginning as the jacket began to grow in length until it was more like a leather dress. John tried to scream but his voice was drowned out by the collar of the jacket suddenly wrapping it self around his face. Fearing he was going to be 'eaten alive' by this jacket, John struggled harder only the Jacket closed under his feet and he fell to the floor, trapped in a leather embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me!?\" panicked, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn could feel heat all through his body and he could detect movement on his body as well but he could not see what was going on. Finally, as quickly as it had started, the jacket released him and he was able to stand up again. Only as he moved to tear the jacket off, he spotted himself in a full length mirror. He was no longer a boy in jeans, white t-shirt and converse sneakers. John was now a girl, wearing platform boots, a skirt with two buckled belts and a black blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I look like a punk girl.\" surprised by his, or rather, her new voice. \"But how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered the sign in front of the store... 'Our styles will change you'.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had to admit the shirt itself was rather... girly to give it a term, but the colors were actually quite pleasing and the shirt itself was made out of a soft material.  Jason considered trying it on... just for kicks, but at the same time the largest size the store carried was just too small for him and he did not need yet another T-shirt crowding up his closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was about to set the T-shirt back on the rack when suddenly he felt a tap on his shoulder.  Turning around Jason discovered one of the store's clerks behind him.  She was very cute.  Sixteen in age, probably; dirty blonde, shoulder-length hair with just curl to notice, slim face, pretty white smile, small in height (Jason stood near 6 feet and judging from her height she was probably barely reaching 5'3\").  She wore a long-sleeved shirt with a pink core and stripped pink and white sleeves, capri length skinny jeans which revealed just enough for what Jason guessed was a pair of white and pink stripped socks, and red converse sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" began the clerk, \"That shirt looks just right for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderstanding what the clerk was going to try to do, Jason decided to hear her out at least.  \"Really, you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" continued the clerk as she took the shirt from him and placed it over his chest.  Was it just him or was the shirt slightly bigger now?  \"I'm guessing at school you're probably one of the cooler guys right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah a little, definitely not uncool,\" said Jason as he took the shirt from the clerk and held it up for inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this shirt matches you blue eyes rather nicely, plus the colorful bolt gives any outfit a real pop of power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean look at your current jeans.  Sure some would argue that the blueness of the jeans and the shirt would just be too much blue.  But you're jeans are near navy, plus the number of scraps, tears, and dirt stains give it just enough color difference to really work.  This combination could be so cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really you think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  This outfit and that shirt could easily make you... at least 20% cooler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCool, cool, that was a powerful word.  Jason had never considered it before, but he did like being cool and each time the clerk said, heck every time he though about it, Jason felt a mild tingle in the back of his head.  Yes he liked being cool.  He had to try on this shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you've sold me, just let me go try it on to make sure it fits.\"  Jason then walked back to the changing rooms, unaware the clerk was smiling as she watched the boy leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next...</span></div></div>",

He looked around, and sure enough he spotted some blue leather sandals. The fact that he was seriously looking at a demin skirt and sandals with four inch heels has not occurred to him. He grabbed a pair of the sandals and the skirt and continued to the changing room with an eager anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went inside and undressed down to his boxers, and then pulled on the thunderbolt tee. Amazingly it fitted perfectly, and Jason stood admiring his reflection in the mirror. What he failed to notice was that the shirt was exactly the same size as it had been when he first saw it, but his body had shrunk to fit it. He then pulled on the demin skirt, and again stood to admire himself, with no thought that he was wearing girls clothes.  What he failed to notice this time was the two slight bumps under the shirt, which as he reached down for the sandals, gradually grew larger. Once the outfit was complete, Jason again looked in the mirror. By now his breasts were getting quite well developed, giving added contours to the shirt, and his feature were taking on a softer, more feminine appearance. All he could see was a really cool outfit.    </span></div></div>",

The skirt didn't seem to sit flat,  and he instinctively knew that his nipples shouldn't be quite so clearly definable under the shirt as they clearly were. Of course!  He realized that you can't just throw on an outfit as cool as this and expect it to fit perfectly - it needs the proper underwear, and he had just pulled this on top of his old boxers. No wonder the skirt was sitting oddly.  Jason decided he needed to complete his new cool look by getting the right underwear. He opened the door to the changing room to head out, not entirely sure what he wanted, but determined to get something to properly compliment and complete his new look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding waiting outside was the store clerk. \"Wow, I said that shirt would suit you! That's really cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Jason heard that magic word 'cool' again he was entranced by the girl, and then noticed what she was holding in her hand. \"Oh wow!\" he said.

The bra fitted loosely around his new breasts, but they then continued to grow until they filled out the bra cups. He had minor difficulty tucking his penis into the satin panties, although within seconds of this new garment being in place his body started adjusting, with his penis shrinking away as his male organs were absorbed into his body to be replaced by a neat new vagina. All Jason noticed was that his panties felt more comfortable to wear. He then pulled back on the tee shirt and skirt, and felt ready to check out his reflection again. \"Oh, yes, that's much better.\"  By now his breasts had fully filled out the bra, and all visibility of male characteristics had disappeared, with the skirt lying smoothly down over his new panties, themselves adhering to the gentle contours of his vagina. Jason could only see that the reflection was the height of coolness, and he realized he would be the envy of his mates...         <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nHe again emerged from the changing room, this time happy with his appearance, although with no concept at all that he was now a girl in physical appearance (having lost his broad chunky football physique to be replaced by what Jason would have previously described as his view of the perfect girl). Meanwhile the psychological changes were almost complete too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything OK?\" the clerk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than OK,\" Jason replied. \"This outfit is just perfect. I really must thank you for suggesting it. I reckon I'll be the envy of everyone at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can pretty much guarantee you'll be the center of attention.\" the clerk responded. She rung up the cost of the outfit, and Jason handed over a check.  \"Have you got photo ID at all please?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes of course.\" Jason dug into his wallet and pulled out a his driving license and handed in over. The girl glanced at it, and handed it back. Jason looked at it before putting it away, not noticing anything unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well have a good day, and do come shop with us again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, thanks.\" Jason then headed out of the store, clutching a bag containing his old 'boy' clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will Jason go now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why the heck did he think think the boys would be envious? No, the girls would be envious... the boys, well, they'll probably just drool as usual. Jason looked into a shop window and noticed his reflection - obviously that of the girl that he had turned into, and noticed that his hair was a mess. I'd better get that tidied up. No point in having a new outfit and having your hair let you down.Then he noticed a stylist further along in the mall, and headed towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn entering Jason was welcomed by a female receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning miss. What can we do for you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hair seems to have grown and gotten into a bit of a mess. I think a wash and cut would be in order please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course miss. We have a special offer on manicures today if you're interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked as his nails - now a good half inch longer than they had been earlier, and really not in the best of condition. \"I think that may be a good idea, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could ask you to wait just a few moments, and we'll sort it all out for you. \"Could I just take your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, it's, um...\" Jason realized that he was having a mental block and for some reason just couldn't remember his name.

Well, she thought, how on Earth could I have forgotten my own name?  Her memory then starting piecing itself back together again, but with her growing up as a girl not a boy. With that her transformation was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes she heard her name called, and clutching her wallet she stood and moved off leaving behind the bag with her old boy clothes in, having dropped from her recollection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinda had her hair cut in a pixie style, and her nails manicured and painted in powder blue to match her outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

This kiss was quickly followed by the sound of Stephanie's leather flats hitting the floor, the yanks and throwing of Stephanie's socks, and the tugging on of the socks.  Looking to his right, Jackson saw a cute girl with long brown hair in green eyes, green shirt with brown light coat, and jeans, all very common things.

You rub your hands on your shirt to remove any phantom dirt, However as you pull your hand away your shirt begins a not so phantom change of it own, spreading from were your hand rubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one the button's fell off, the threads of your shirt unwinding and restitching across each other so that the front fused together, requiring you to tap it off over your head. The sleeves unwove, the threads slinking and crawling up over you like a hundred thousand tiny worms crawling over you, which made you notice things enough to feel somewhat itchy and a little chilly from the bear arms. The threads dove into your thin shirt, recombining with the cloth to make it thicker and more durable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't enough however and so the threads of the poly blend shirt started to swell fatter. Growing larger and thicker, until they turned into comfortable 100% cotton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt amrs continued to crawl up and disipear well past yourarms, stopping only when it was high up on your shoulder. The front of your shirt top stopped fusing at about the second to last button, and instead pulled itself in to give the collar a low hanging v-shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of collar. The shirt collar melted like chocolate in the sun. Lolling down your neck until it drooped forward and simply broke away from your neck, sliding down your body like a bead of sweat. When it reached the front of you tank top, threads burst out and faster than most could tell swiftly stitched it to its surface. The stitching then began to pull and squeeze at the collar. Contorting and folding it. It molded and melded like taffy, jerkily moving into a new shape until from that lone piece of collar your top had a stylized picture of a tiger on it. Two of the buttons on the floor rolled up your feet, thighs and stomach and affixed themselves to where the Tigers eyes would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your new tank top started shrinking.....in some places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pulled up until it showed off enough of your stomach to show the start of your belly button. It pulled . Tightened enough so it didn't look like it was big enough to fit someone who had another dinner for dessert, however it stayed quite loose on your body, too loose for someone your size, especially around the chest area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally you didn't even acknowledge you were wearing a woman's tank top. Or maybe you did as your walk started to change, and very slightly your hips started to move from side to side with every step to accomodate the shows</span></div></div>",

You let your hands down and hope the itch dies on its own. You don't even bat an eye when your nails start growing, even when you bring them up to eye level to inspect the product you grabbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom beneath your very cuticles bright red seems to flow up and along each nail, the flowing liquid hardening almost instantly as soon as each nail is covered leaving it with a brilliant shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe irritation in your chest only increased as the once hard muscle slowly softened and started pushing out at a speed even a turtle would groan at. Your cloths, altering at a much, much faster pace than you actually were jumped the gun and decided to bring in support before you even needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot far off, at the register desk, a drawer opened and a box of paperclips popped up. several tiny curved bits of metal shook in the box for a moment before flying out at breakneck speed and zipping towards you. Sliding up underneath your top causing a funny chill for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bent and curved into a new shape. Some actually fusing with others to gain thickness and strength. They warped and shifted until there were 3 industrial strength clips against your back. Right before they settled one of the hooks snagged a tiny loose thread from your top and tangled it around itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thread underwent a sort of........ well kind of like that old worm myth. It split apart, re-lengthened then plit apart again. Interlacing with its former parts until it was a patch of cloth, a patch of cloth that was growing and growing to form a strong sling around your back, locking the hooks firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it got to your front however it deviated from the sling. Spreading out into a pattern that was far more flowery and artsy. The material thickened and thickened some more until it was strong enough to act as a brick sling without tearing. Both sides soon met in the middle and to finish it off tied itself in a cute little bow. By the time it was done you were wearing a bra that by all accounts should have just fell off you from the sheer size of it, Yet stuck to you like glue, as if your non existent breasts filled its massive cups to capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your wallet slips out of your pocket and lands on the floor, Taking a single thread from your bottoms with it. The thread having not nearly as much patience as the ones in your top grows inch's in a moment, Latching onto your top and hauling it and the wallet back up to rest on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wallet swells and expands as its compartments grow and fill. The space that was only big enough to hold less than a dollars grew big enough to fit both hands. Each coin inside turning into an accessory. The penny becoming a lipstick, the Nickel's a compact and the quarter combined with the half sucked Polo mint to become a tube of high grade eyeliner. The pouch that held your cards actually broke away as a thin leather strip, a strip than lengthened and grew around itself, forming a zipper amd actually becoming a whole new wallet by itself, like an infant inside its mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning a little from discomfort you lift your french tipped hand and run your fingers through your hair. The hair sticking to and following your hand while you take it from your scalp and down your neck to scratch the small just above the hooks of your new bra. Leaving you with long, gorgeous hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now looked like a guy cross dressing as a woman. Though for how long was a matter of time, depending entirely on how fast the true physical changes would take.</span></div></div>",

Fat slowly began to pump into your flat rear, growing at an sensuous speed as your ass grew plump, jiggly and peach shaped, a perfect, pert little bubble butt, straining the tight pants as every mincing step causes your perfect ass to sway and jiggle side to side in your tight pants. Alongside these changes, your frame had shrunk to a much more feminine and dainty size.

Yes, he loved Homestuck and Jade, but he couldn't pull off wearing her God-Tier outfit! Was this a joke?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hearing began to dim as his brain began to disassociate itself with his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's not right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then two fleshy protrusions grew out of his head, and his old ears were rendered deaf. They resembled hairless dog ears at first, but that quickly changed as white fur cascaded out of them (Pun intended).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn tried screaming, but he couldn\u2019t hear it or anything else around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn knew. He absolutely, unequivocally knew exactly what was going to happen to him as soon as the robe leapt onto him.

New nerves sprouted within his head that connected his new ears to his brain and altered his nose, allowing John to hear again. The change also boosted John's hearing and smell by a factor of thousands as well as allowing him to swivel his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn\u2019s jaws realigned with an unpleasant CRACK, giving him buckteeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new smells and sounds caused him to collapse, as he was unable to process the new sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the robe, all of John's shirt under his upper chest vanished. What remained changed into a bra, which felt awkward on a chest without breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, why the fuck did guys named John always get shafted anyway? First, it was Egbert and now him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a crowd had begun to form around the entrance to the store and the lone clerk working stood agape. The flashes of the spectators\u2019 phone cameras only served to disorientate the boy even more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With expert stealth skill the ties of the ninja pants unbuckled your belt and with one deft motion whipped it around it's leg. A small patch of the leather bubbled up and squared off until it had grown a small knife pouch. The black pants invaded your jeans and assasinated them with expert skill. The blue was swiftly swallowed up by the black. Reaching downwards towards your socks the tiniest of threads from the pants invaded the thin white pair. However instead of replacing them the black from the threads expelled outwards like a quid expelling ink, dyeing them dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soles of your shoes tore away bit by bit with every step. Not in bits though. Each step left a slice on the floor as though your soles were neatly shaven.

She's your older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiles. \"Come on. I didn't mean to scare you with that story. It's just...\" She pauses. \"There's a lot of bad things that have happened at that store.

The door closes shut. You stand there in the darkened hallway, aware of the difficulties ahead. Such as, for example, resisting the urge to creep into Sarah's room and snuggle up beside her in bed, or peeking in while she's changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best distraction you can manage is directing yourself in the direction of the bathroom. You turn on the lights and close the door carefully behind you. To the left is the mirror--your stomach just barely comes up to the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow...\" You exhale. For the first time, you have a clear picture of the little girl you've become. \"Shit...\" It didn't occur to you how tiny Jane's face is; like a soft-edged arrowhead smothered by a perfect mop of hair.

A modest, white-frilled collar caps off the dress, but farther down, you observe how closely the fabric hews to your figure.

But until this moment, everything that had happened felt like a dream, or at least surreal enough that at any second you felt like you might snap out of it.

What's more, your sister and Mom have promised to take you shopping, and you and sis are going up to Stratford on Avon to see the RSC perform makes you squeal with delight (Mom read Shakespeare as bedtime stories).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you're thinking as John, you think of how this trip will translate back when the world is back to normal. You and Sarah will be sharing a room for a week at her parents expense after all. You don't know what that'll mean, but, you're close to each other. That'll be good, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are details, like that Dad wasn't involved in Sarah's life, you much less both of you, you weren't flying to London, or anything else like that. Still, a trip like this seems very cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it is.  After the first night and a break for jetlag every day is spent exploring London, either you and Sarah, sometimes with Mom and most afternoons with Dad,  whom Jane has known all her life but John has never met.

You're thinking you want to have a good time with your family, returning hugs fully, letting Sarah tease you as your sitting in the park, boywatching. Sure, you got along with your parents as John  but Mom and Dad, Sarah and you seem to be one of those families that are really tight.....And it's rather nice. In London there aren't any faces and places that remind you that you were John. Thus he disappears a little faster than he might otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, you wonder if it's plot, maybe by your mom's or Sarah. But increasingly your response is, [I]so what if it is?[/i] You all love each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday, is s special day for you and Sarah. You are going up to Stratford upon Avon for a performance of [I] The Tempest[/I] and then spending the night at a country inn while Dad and Mom stay in London. You spend the afternoon in visiting Shakespeare's daughter's home and eat at a pub named the Black Swan and called the Dirty Duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe performance of  [I] The Tempest[/I] is brilliant, unlike anything you've ever seen and with all that has changed you can't help but feel like Miranda. That realization hits you and you know you can never be the John you where before. You think you've just decided to become an actress when you grow up. Oh Brave New World indeed with such people in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you hardly notice how quite Sarah is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, in the dark, sharing a bed, she whispers to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pigeon, you know at the store last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha__\" you say groggily.

Staring back at him was one of those nerdy people you'd see in 80s movies. Rob freaked out, but then realized it was just a costume. And it was a good one, too. Very detailed as to what an 80s nerd would look like: incredibly high-water plaid pants, a short sleeve button-up, shiny black dress shoes, socks covering half of his calves, a bow tie, a pocket protector filled to the brim, and a pair of large, thick-rimmed glasses. \"This would be perfect for Hallo-\" Rob said to himself, but stopped. Instead of hearing a deep, puberty-stricken voice, he heard a squeaky squeal. \"What the?\" Rob thought out loud, but then realized more changes were yet to come. Rob's small belly from overeating disappeared, but also did his muscle from playing on the lacrosse team. In fact, he was incredibly skinny, almost bonelike. His slight tan faded into pasty skin, his teeth grew buck-toothed and braced-up, and his hair became overly greasy &amp; arranged into a hideous combover. He was a nerd, all right. An 80s nerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the changes didn't stop there: his head started to fill with all sorts of knowledge, and his interest in D&amp;D gained a +30 bonus while wielding any D&amp;D object (nerd joke). But the worst part was that he remembered his old self. He remembered Rob, the college slacker. He was a slacker no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta get back!\" Rob yelled, and he thrust out of the changing room, to be greeted by another surprise: he was in the 80s. All the people now had an 80s stlye, and some old hip-hop songs blared out of the store speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Rob thought, \"if I touch some other clothing, I'll change to that! But these are all 80s clothes... maybe someone can help me!\" What should Rob do?</span></div></div>",

He knew he had to hurry, which was against his old nature, but the thought of being stuck in the 80s as a nerd scared him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pretty, young lady that looked out of place for any time period, let alone the 80s, overheard Rob's scream from the changing room. She had been looking at candles when the room transformed around her, which didn't bother her. But the guy she had been eyeing had disappeared, and she when she heard the scream she knew, something had happened to him. She turned around to see a nerd emerge from the changing room, the panicked look on his face making it obvious that this nerd was her guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob took notice of her and was surprised that she was wearing a fancy dress like one a princess would wear. She locked eyes with him. Giggling, she introduced herself, \"I'm Elena. Could you perhaps tell me where the young man from the changing room is?\" Rob was stunned by her beauty and stuttered, \"Um, I'm him.\" Elena pretended not to believe him, \"No, you can't be!\" Then she leaned in and spoke softly, \"Silly, I know it's you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was curious. \"How did you know?\" he squeaked, the nasal sound of his new voice reminding him of Steve Erkel. \"I'm a witch. I know all about this place, that it can transform people. But my protection spell keeps me from being affected so I just pay no attention usually, not till today.\" This made Rob even more curious. He asked another question, \"Why today?\" Elena smiled, \"Because I like you.\" \"What? You like me!\" Rob said, kind of wondering why a girl like her would like a nerd like him. \"Not the nerd you, the real you,\" she continued. He was relieved, \"Oh, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob wondered if Elena could help him, or was she going to do something else to him. But Elena spoke again, \"I can help you get back.\" \"How?\" Rob asked. \"Simple, like I said, I'm a witch. I'll break the spell on the costume and you'll be back to normal,\" Elena answered. She thought to herself, \"It's a shame to let him go this easy. I should have some fun with him first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Rob trust Elena to help him or does he try to find his way back on his own?</span></div></div>",

Closing her eyes, the witch began to chant is a strange language that sounded vaguely like Latin. After a few moments she opened them. \"Ahhhh. Very cleaver!\" She touched her wand to the tape holding his new glasses together. Rob breathed a sigh of relief as he looked in the mirror and saw a healthy tan spread across his skin and he regained his former mass. In a few moments he was physically back to his old self; however, he kept his new nerdy persona and still wore the costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm. Aren't you going to finish?\" He asked Elena timidly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am finished.\" She replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my clothes? And my.....\" His voice trailed off as a nerd's trademark elegance when talking to beautiful women kicked in. \"I mean uh... You know.. My...\" He began to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhhh.\" Responded Elena in her most seductive voice. She put a finger to his lips. \"I like my men to have both brawn and brain. You look good now, but I know how we can make some improvements. Follow me.\" She lead him around the store finally she found what she was looking for, and after muttering a few short phrases to change it's spell held up a now costume. It was a Letterman Jacket, and the patches on it showed it belonged to a serious Jock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put this on.\" She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't I-\" he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it on.\" She repeated, this time more forcefully. Rob complied. Almost as soon and the jacket touched his shoulders the changes began. His slight belly one again melted away, but this time to reveal a well-formed six-pack. His extra fat melted away to be replaced with toned muscle from years of football training. He was now a serious athleat, playing something every season, and captaining most of his teams. Even before his first transformation Rob had never been much of a sports fan, but now he found he knew every rule, play, and technique. The influx of stats he now found he knew about all the latest players helped him to realize that they had progressed back to the modern era. His popularity shot through the roof. But even as his outward confidence rose, the geeky knowledge he had gained from his first change, if anything, grew as well. Sure, he noe knew the entire playbook for his High School team back to back, but his D&amp;D knowledge also modernized to include newer editions and online MMO's such and World of Warcraft. He knew every player in the NFL, but he could also name and label every element on the periodic table. He was one of the rarest, and if discovered, most scorned type of Jock to take the field. I short, he was a closet Nerd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon stared dumbfounded at the woman an new set of memories was telling him had transfered to his college and was his newest girlfriend, not sure what to make of the new life she had created for him. She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to talk be according to my watch your supposed to meet up with your guildmates in ten minutes.\" She commented in order to break him out of his daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so loud here in public!\" He yelled as he glanced around to make sure no one had heard. Another batch of memories were telling him how she had discovered his secret how he was dating her to stop he from telling anyone else. Yet he knew she was the witch who caused this in the first place! \"It's OK now since no one heard, but don't take risk like that. I'll pick you up at 7, OK?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me.\" She replied. \"Feel fee to send someone my way. I've got some more combinations I want to try.\" Rob wasn't so sure if he wanted to, but he nodded anyway before he ran off to his car. He was going to have to hurry if he wanted to meet his guildmates in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smiled to herself. This was going to be fun!</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long to find the t-shirt and sweatpants he had been wearing previously, but when he reached to grab them they began to shift and change, just as his body had not long before. He watched, transfixed as the shirt faded to white and a row of bright, shiny black buttons materialized and the front. There was a loud rip sound as the front split down the middle and the top swelled as it shifted into a dress collar. The waistline of his paints also ripped off and shifted to a much thicker fabric. It turned bright neon orange and metal clasps formed on the the ends as it became a suspender. Another one came into being besides it to complete the pair, and they clasped onto the pants, which had taken on a nasty plaid print. A couple inches tore off both pant legs. One became a bow tie that matched the pants new look. The other turned to white plastic and became a pocket protector that quickly filled to the brim. The remaining accessories needed to complete the new costume, namely the dress shoes, hideously plaid socks, and thick rimmed glasses taped in the middle, appeared underneath the outfit. The only thing left to hint at what the clothes formerly were was the images of Rob's college mascot, a black panther,  which were now printed every inch or so the the suspenders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob stared in shock at what his clothes had become. \"We'll, I guess that plan is not going to work.\" He said to himself. The sound of his new made him shutter with fear. He was stuck like this! \"Wait a minuet!\" He thought. \"I'm not stuck. I can't go back, but I know a little about this time period. It won't be so bad here. I can chose another costume so I won't be stuck as a nerd, and then get situated here. Or maybe I should stay a nerd. Didn't all those 80's shows have to geek end up filthy rich with the football captain mowing his lawn?\" He looked at the other costumes along the rack. There was a Letterman Jacket covered in patches that made it clear it was for a Jock, some strange looking black clothes with a neon green wig for a Punk, a popular Cheerleader's outfit, and some a pair of baggie sweatpants and hoodie with a skateboard below, which had to be for a Skater. </span></div></div>",

Something in the back of his mind was bugging him. Something was wrong. He thought about it for a second, but then brushed it away. He didn't like to think hard, and tried to avoid it as much as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This store looks pretty cool; I'll have to stop by after my work out. Gotta get to the gym now.\" Robbie walked out of the store and off to the local gym. He looked forward to his afternoon workout every day. It and wrestling practice were his daily highlights. If only he didn't have to do all the boring class work stuff! As he walked he saw the lacrosse team out starting some preseason practices. He felt the same felling he had felt back at the store. \"Did I forget my gym bag again?\" He wondered. But no, he had it. Must have been something he ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived at the gym. Strangely, he felt a kind of reverse Deja Vu, like this was his first time there, even though he knew he'd been there many times before. Today's workout was fairly easy, and before long Robbie was done. Before he got back into normal clothes he took a moment to admire his body in the changing room mirror. Then it hit him. His body! That was it! There was something wrong with his body. He spent a good five minutes thinking about it, but soon gave up. He was in perfect shape! What could be wrong?  His phone whent off. He was late for the Jake's party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie spent the rest to the night drinking beer, eating pizza, watching sports with the rest of his friends from the wrestling team. Besides him and Jake, a close friend who, while not as muscular as Robbie, always seemed to attract more girls with his baby blue eyes, light brown hair, and good complexion, there was Jamie, a skinny Latino who could nevertheless hold his own on the mat, and Brandon, who fancied himself a lady's man, even if the ladys didn't agree. In the fun of it all,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Robbie completely forgot about the strange feelings he had had that afternoon. He didn't even think about them again until he had got back to his dorm. What had he thought was worng about his body, he wondered as he lazily threw his muscle shirt and gym shorts on the floor. Wait a minute! His body! The gym clothes! That store! It all came rushing back to him. He wasn't Robbie the bodybuilder, he was Rob the slacker! He'd walked in that store an average looking slacker, bumped the clothes, and now look at him! He laid down on the couch and tried to decide what to do. </span></div></div>",

He stood and eyed the white door, figuring the mass of flaked paint and door chips on it meant that more people went through there to get a costume.

Taking a deep breath he walked up to the brown, stained door bellow the Male Masculinity Designs sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to Male Masculinity Designs,\" said the young clerk when he entered the department. \"It looks like your our last customer of the day. Did you have anything you were looking for?\" Rob shook his head, not quite knowing what to expect. \"Good, I've been saving the best costume for last. Follow me the fitting room.\" As he walked, Rob looked around at the department he was in. It was filled with rack after rack of costumes, with more neatly folded and stacked in the shelves that lined the walls. The costumes were expreamly detailed and authentic looking. While he walked he saw a football uniform complete with a full set of real looking pads, a  set of workout cloths and supplies for a bodybuilder, a rugged looking cowboy outfit, and a costume that looked like it could have Have been worn by one of the characters in Rock of Ages. The clerk lead him through a door into the fitting room. It was small and plain, with the only object in it being the expected three way mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back with the outfits shortly,\" said the clerk. He returned about ten minutes later carrying in the detailed costume he had picked out for Rob. It was...</span></div></div>",

door closed itself behind him.<br>\r\nPanicked, Rob tried to reopen it but to no avail.<br>\r\nafter almost a minute of struggling to open the door a women voice came out of nowhere ''sorry,but our doors are one way only mister Rob''<br>\r\n''<span class=\"cppink\">you can only come out by the door in the back of the room</span>''<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">great,what a strange place</span>'' rob wondered while turning himself to see the room he was in.<br>\r\nThe room was big and almost looked like a lounge and it was well furnished.there was two red antique couches on each side of the room,<br>\r\na large round table in the middle and many mirrors with gold ornaments everywhere. <br>\r\nhe could easily see a big double door made of what seemed to be metal on the other side of the room.<br>\r\nnot thinking twice Rob went to the table and dropped the overalls and the shirt on it and went to the door,hoping it would not be locked.<br>\r\nunfortunately for him,it was.<br>\r\nsuddenly,he heard the women voice again ''<span class=\"cppink\">the metal door can be opened only when the client wear the costume</span>''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nin despair,Rob headed to the table and took the overalls.thew were far too big for him. probably not bodybuilder sizes but still way bigger than he was.<br>\r\nthe shirt was an XL shirt made for huge person while Rob wore only Medium shirt and most of his shirts were baggy,wearing that thing would be ridiculous <br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">am i going to wear those overgrown cloth?</span>'' though Rob <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe voice started again ''<span class=\"cppink\">all our cloth are certified to fit anyone,whatever the size,sex and body type of the client</span>''<br>\r\n''<span class=\"cppink\">so worry not and try them</span>''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob though that the best thing for him at the moment was to comply to the clerk demand,and so he started to remove his clothing,starting with his shirt.<br>\r\nhe was not skinny but not muscled either,his body was normal in every aspect.<br>\r\nnext he took off his jeans,leaving him in his plain dark blue boxer short.<br>\r\nas he grabbed the overalls to wear them the woman started to talk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<span class=\"cppink\">underwear are included in every human costume, it is requested that the client strip completely before wearing the costume.</span>''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerplexed,Rob took the overall and searched them and just as the clerk has said there was a bag with a pair of underwear in it attached inside of the overalls.<br>\r\nthey were bright red boxer brief,at last two size bigger than Rob used to wear.<br>\r\nRob looked around himself,wherever he looked he saw no cameras,how the heck did the clerk knew he were going to wear the costume with his own boxer.<br>\r\nbrushing his though away,Rob shamefully took down his boxer.<br>\r\nstanding naked,he started to open the plastic bag containing the costume's boxers.<br>\r\nthey were definitely too big for him,but what else could he does.<br>\r\nhe started to put them on,they seemed to be made of spandex,but the feeling was not unpleasant.<br>\r\nwith the boxer brief on,Rob looked mostly ridiculous,he had to keep at last one hand on the boxers at all time to keep them from falling off.<br>\r\nbut out of nowhere he felt a tingling sensation in his groin,it was as if someone was tickling him and giving him a massage at the same time.<br>\r\nquickly trying to think of another thing he took the shirt,it was a simple cotton white shirt.<br>\r\nwithout thinking he putted it on,only to realize that while he did,his new boxer didn't fell off.<br>\r\nwith the shirt on,he could see how stupid it looked on him,this was definitely too big for him. <br>\r\nas he contemplated himself in one of the many mirrors, the tingling sensation he had in his groin suddenly rose to his chest and arms.<br>\r\ntrying his best to not laugh because of the tickle,he decided to put on the overalls.<br>\r\nlike the rest of the cloths,the overalls were at last two size bigger than what Rob used to wear,but he felt strangely compelled to wear them anyway.<br>\r\nand so he put them on,securing the strap on his shoulders,looking ridiculous in these overgrown cloths. strangely there were no sock or shoes with the costume.<br>\r\nthe tingling followed soon after and soon he felt it on all his body but it suddenly disappeared. <br>\r\nwith the cloths finally on him the voice started again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<span class=\"cppink\">Now that you have the proper attire,please continue through the door</span>''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">no need to tell me twice</span>'' Rob though heading to the door, not noticing that his former cloths were gone.<br>\r\nwanting to get out of the store faster he opened the door and almost run through it,only to find himself in another place.<br>\r\nas if the door was magic he found himself in a barn,dumbstruck Rob turned himself to return into the door only to find that it was gone.<br>\r\nnot knowing what to do in this new place with his overgrown cloths he heard the same familiar voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<span class=\"cppink\">welcome to your new reality,allow yourself a few minute to physically and mentally fit in</span>''<br>\r\n''<span class=\"cppink\">thank you for shopping in our store and have a good life</span>''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">what??? what do you mean by new reality?<br>\r\nwhat do you mean by fit in? you hear me? answer me.</span>'' Rob shouted.but no answer came.<br>\r\nhe was now alone in a barn with overgrown cloth.<br>\r\nwanting to know where he was he headed toward the door of the barn to take a look outside,at last to know where he was.<br>\r\nbut as he walked he felt the tingling came back but this time it was ten time worse.<br>\r\nfalling on his knees,laughing like an idiot he felt as if a hundred hands were tickling him and a hundred more where massaging him.<br>\r\nsuddenly he felt like if someone was doing him the worst wedgie ever,and as his hands went to his crotch he felt it grow bigger and bigger.<br>\r\nwanting to ease the pain on crotch he planed to take off the overalls but he never could because as he went to the strap on his shoulder he felt his arm and torso grow.<br>\r\nmoaning under the pressure of his grow,he realized that he was filling the cloths.hard muscle were developing on him at an incredible speed.<br>\r\nsoon enough he had filled the clothing completely,but he was still growing.<br>\r\nin probably a minute he had passed from 120 pound to nearly 220.<br>\r\nbut why did the growing didn't stop at the moment he filled them perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clgreen\">its normal,those are my old cloths and we are too poor to buy new one</span>'' said a strange but sexy voice in the back of Rob's head.<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">what? why did i though that?</span>'' wondered Rob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbefore the voice in his head could answer,Rob felt his skin burn and watched aghast as his white skin was slowly turning into a nice tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">wait i didn't wanted that when i entered that store</span>'' Rob plaid as his dark brown short hair started to grow longer until it reached his shoulder then turned sandy blond.<br>\r\ngiving him the look of a cool surfer<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clgreen\">don't worry</span>'' said the mysterious voice ''<span class=\"clgreen\">you will like it here</span>''<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">i want to return home</span>'' pleaded Rob<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clgreen\">but you are at home</span>'' replied the voice<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">i should not be here</span>'' said Rob<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clgreen\">don't worry,everything will be better in a few second</span>'' said the voice<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">what do you mean</span>''<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clgreen\">you got the body of a farm boy,now you need the mind of one</span>'' said the voice<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">what? NO!!! i don't want to be a farm boy, i will fight it as much as i can</span>'' replied Rob<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clgreen\">hmm....you are mentally strong. you IQ is of 138 after all,but that will soon change,we can't have a smart farm boy around</span>''said the voice<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">what? what do you mean? i don't want to be dumb, i ,ohhh...i...ghaaa...i .....i am.....not....</span>''<br>\r\nRob mind was becoming cloudy with every second, event if he fought it with all he had he was losing his intelligence.<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clgreen\">i think a IQ of 93 would suit you better, intelligent enough to do what you need to do but not enough to go search work elsewhere</span>'' <br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">Ghngn....why?.....who...are....you?</span>'' painfully asked Rob<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clgreen\">who? me? sorry i didn't introduce myself. my name is Zach, i'm 19 and i am you</span>''<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clblue\">NO!!!....i'm not......i'm...not a....a farm.....b...boy......i.....am.....

Zach!!! where are you? diner's ready</span>'' said a woman out of the barn<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clgreen\">coming ma</span>''<br>\r\n<br>\r\ncoming out of the barn he saw a woman of maybe 40 year old waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clilac\">you better hurry to eat or we will be late</span>'' said the woman<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clgreen\">why?</span>'' asked Zach<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clilac\">you already forgot? this afternoon we go to town to buy you new cloth</span>''<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clgreen\">ah yea...my shirt is far too small for me now</span>''<br>\r\n''<span class=\"clilac\">eat up and we will go</span>''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</div></div>",

Most were hanged in coat racks while some were placed onto bodies of female mannequins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I could take a look, Rob thought. With no one around he could view the section without having someone talk behind his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonchalantly, he moves over to the women's dresses. Going inside many of the dresses didn't pique his interest. He could notice their elegance in design, but he wasn't impressed. Rob had more of a preference for sexy dresses. And that was where he went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mannequins in this aisle of the section were wearing the kind of dresses  that had Rob's preference. The sexy dresses he saw were not the most revealing ones--apparently they were in a separate section of their own--but the ones that accentuated a woman's hourglass figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dress that caught his eye at first glance. Being displayed from a busty mannequin, it was a light brown strapless mini dress. Rob could imagine an attractive lady flirting to him in that outfit. Irrationally, he starts to  touch the dress fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he didn't know at the beginning was a transformation state. The duration could be Instant or Gradual. Where would it go?</span></div></div>",

He looked terribly surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did it go?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he asked that question, his body began to shift, and he was noticing these changes. What's going on with me? He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back from the display, he feels his body shrink a few inches from his normal height of 5\"9 to 5\"6. The sudden drop caused his mind to recalibrate. He became dizzy for a few seconds before his clarity returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body structure was shifting from a somewhat husky body into a curvy hourglass figure. The hair on his head quickly grew and the locks were falling around his face which was growing more feminine every second. His body fat decreased overall, but some was redistributed into the \"essential\" areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked down at himself, seeing that his clothes looked looser than normal. He was just right on time to see a pair of large female breasts protruding from his loose shirt. Are these real? He wondered. He moved his hands and felt them for a few seconds. No way! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he felt afterwards was bliss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wandered aroud a short distance and found a full body-mirror reflecting his new image. It was a long haired woman dressed in oversized male clothing but with a voluptuous sexy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is me?\" He said in his new attractive voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes weren't over. Rob's oversized shirt and baggy pants joined each other and became one large light brown fabric. The pantlegs tightened, connected as one skirt, and receded all the way to his thighs. It showed off a pair of legs that would make any guy look. His shirt part constricted his body and also receded. The sleeves and top half disappeared ending at his cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it,\" Rob said. \"This really is me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do afterwards?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked about the same age as he was before, so about 19, which was nice honestly. Looking down and seeing nothing covering him above the breasts was strange, yet exhilerating at the same time. His long hair flowed behind him unhindered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven looking underneath the skirt, Rob could see simple panties covering \"her\" groin now, making his face go red as he quickly put it back down. He really wasn't sure what to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just come in here to look around, and now he was a woman wearing a mini-dress. What could he do now? He didn't exactly have a lot of options to go with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to find help somewhere,\" he said, looking left and right to find someone. Did anyone know what happened? Perhaps an employee would know? Hopefully someone would know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob began walking through the store, looking rather odd with his boy shoes still on his feet. Still, it wasn't what he was focused on. There was a female employee close by, so Rob took that as any to ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" asked Rob. The woman turned back with a smile.

The Dress section was in full view. It was quite indicated that there was a naked mannequin on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could plainly see where it happened,\" Sam says while looking at the section. \"And from what I can tell by your shoes, you just 'happened' to be a guy who walked in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er,\" Rob replied. \"I was just only looking at the dresses. I wasn't planning to wear one, let alone become a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt that he was being put in a tight situation by Sam. The way she was acting made it seem he was going to be punished.

To be honest, it kind of made him mad. Who should care what shoes he wore? He was a man transformed into a woman. Shouldn't there be more urgency than this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....what are you looking at?\" Rob asked exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got a wide variety of flats.\" Sam responded. \"Let's see....ah, here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately pulled out some shoes, though they were actually sandals. \"Since you're showing off such a wonderful bod, perhaps these will give you those cute little feet to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, I....\" Rob started, though his new voice wasn't too convincing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try them. Come on!\" Sam said, her smile not faltering. Rob sighed as he sat down, taking his shoes and socks off. He noticed that his feet were still kind of big, not as big as they were before, but not a woman's size either. He probably figured what this would end up doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll put them on.\" Sam offered, since Rob likely didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob lifted one leg, and Sam slowly slipped the sandal on, making sure his feet and ankle were in correctly. Right as it did, Rob winced as he felt his foot begin to shrink, conforming to the sandal better. His foot arched a bit, as if he had worn heels before, and the skin and toes were as smooth as the rest of him. Smiling, Sam didn't hesitate as she did the same to the other foot. This pretty much completed Rob's womanly look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...what do you think of the result?\" Sam asked, offering a full-length mirror nearby so Rob could see.

He made some poses on the mirror that he would imagine this new body would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is absolutely spectacular!\" Sam exclaimed. She was looking impressed at the result made. Like Rob, she smiled that never ceased. \"Okay, now that's over with, come with me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Rob reacted in surprise. He leaves the mirror alone to follow Sam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking, he took a good look at himself facing downwards.  For one thing, his large breasts obstructed his view. He remained stubborn to not look at them when he slowly angled his head up. After meeting with Sam and trying on those shoes, he felt a little more comfortable in this situation. He didn't want to leave this body, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here,\" Sam says. She shows Rob a circular desk that said: Customer Service. She moves inside and acesses one of the available monitors. \"I can initiate the reversal here--if you want. Do you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...,\" Rob pondered. \"I'm starting to feel reluctant in losing this body, but I  want to remain a guy. Do you have some alternative?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The store offers two options,\" Sam replies. \"It's magic policy that we would never use permanent magic on the clothing--I'll leave you in the dark on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, we offer the clothes model: you become the dream girl you are when you wear the clothes that are available here.

Mainly math and science-related classes. Boy, did college suck at times, especially when they all assign homework at once. After closing the door and putting his purse down, he sat down at the table he had, his books sprawled all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh, well....\" He drowned on, not excited at all. Still, he opened up a math book, unknowingly crossing his legs femininely as he did. It felt completely natural now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next half hour or so, he tried concentrating, though the sensual feelings he kept getting from his new body made it difficult. He looked like a hot young woman on a date or something, yet he was doing this. He kind of had to, but still, it was hard. At a glance, his eyes happened to go to the catalogue he got from Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know....I could use a break.

It had barely been any time at all, and yet more of those clothing choices were becoming appealing to him.

After a few seconds, sleeves start rolling down his arms and he sees that he was wearing the same cardigan. This is just what I needed, he thought. He looks at the science and algebra homework he has. The problems made much more sense and he didn't have to focus on his sexy self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was another thing that was materializing, but it was not on himself. There were a few bras and panties that were stacked neatly near his bed; somehow quite accurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam,\" Rob asks, \"Why did you teleport in underwear to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a special bundle deal,\" She replies. \"It was in the catalogue.

The style of the bras gradually changed in each bigger cup-size. The B-cup bra was for casual wear, and the large C cup looked to be used for more intimate situations. The bra sizes in-between were literally in-between casual and intimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess it won't hurt trying out one, he thought. But the dress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that he had to take off the dress, he reluctantly did so anyway. He unzipped his dress from behind, allowing his body to crawl out of it. The magic effects of the clothes wore off and his sexy feminine features reverted back into his original masculine ones. The only article of clothing that was on his body was his underwear, which reverted into boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis feels awkward, he thought. His groin was back to where it was. Rebecca was now back to Rob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob grabbed the intimate large C-cup bra and stood near his bathroom mirror. He slowly fixes on the bra as he stared at himself on the mirror screen. Once finished, he watches his chest fill up the bra with a pair of female breasts. Woah, he thought while balancing himself. His hands grab his chest and fondle it a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like what Sam said earlier, single articles of clothing can enchant one body part. Rob was his normal self but with breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I put on next? He wondered. The cardigan would most likely turn his top half back to Rebecca and give him the boost or putting on the matching panty would probably turn him fully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It made sense that a bra and panty pair would create a full woman out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, sliding his boxers down, he pulled the panties up his legs and rested them on his waist. Initially, they were a bit tight, but they slowly became more comfortable as time went on. He saw his hips and butt expanding to a bigger size, with the bulge in his groin going away completely. His legs returned to their nice and long shape, completely smooth. A small smile graced his lips as his face and top half reverted back to Rebecca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, he ran over to his bathroom mirror, eager to see. There, he saw Rebecca full now, wearing a bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....this feels pretty good.\" Rob smiled. Whatever this store was where he got these, it seemed worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back into the room, getting the blue cardigan back. He slipped it on, buttoning it up since he had nothing else underneath. He could immediately feel the boost come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this feels awesome.

The springy energy of a young adult slowed down; the thoughts of the recent pop culture seemed like it wasn't from his time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this the cardigan's side effect? He rationally thought. He returned to the bathroom mirror where he finds himself older than normal. Instead of a young 19 year-old, he sees a woman who has had a long career. Her appearance was still sexy, but it lost its freshness like a fading tatoo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he wore the cardigan with the dress, there seemed to be no ill effect. As he thought this through, thanks to increased comprehension, Rob assumded that the minidress counteracted this ill effect. The aging effect only lasted up to this age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to his desk, he goes ahead and works on his homework. Even if he didn't have the energy to finish it quickly, he can still make a breakthrough. \"How I solve this...,\" he says to himself, acting like a self-tutor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours go by when Rob finished his homework. He gets up and stretches before entering the bathroom. He looks at himself again in the mirror. It seemed that the aging process continued as there were bags and wrinkles on his face; or it was just the stress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at his clock above the mirror. I still have time to go out, he reasonably thought. After taking off the cardigan, his younger body returned to full view. He could go out in the dress or stay inside in the lingerie.</span></div></div>",

Sheesh, why did they make this so confusing.\" Rob sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he was at least thankful that he could change back. With his homework done, he had some time to kill. While he wasn't the going out type most of the time, he began to wonder how it would go. His curiosity was leading him back towards the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know....I should give it a try.\" He reasoned. It was at least worth a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he took the bra and panties off, reverting back to full male before slipping the dress back on. This quickly reverted him back to being a 19-year old woman, and the dress took care of changing his boxers like before. He then walked over and slipped the sandals on as well. It was a nice afternoon so far, so he should be good, though he did wonder if he should bring some kind of sweater or top to protect against the wind. The top half of his chest was practically naked after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his coat wouldn't fit him like this. Should he call Sam again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'd probably be mad.\" Rob sighed.

Actually, we usually get more calls by this time by people who just changed. It's nothing new.\" He could almost feel her smirk. \"So, what's the emergency?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to go out, but I have no coat or sweater to go with.\" Rob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's response?</span></div></div>",

His phone was still pressing towards his ear while he left. There were fast tapping sounds coming from a keyboard, presumably the store computer. He wasn't sure on what to think of this once he exited the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the wait,\" Sam says, after minutes of silence. \"I just had to look for a coat that suited the dress. I'll assume you don't need to wear it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" replied Rob. He was outside near his parked car. The windy breeze was blowing by him, but he didn't feel as cold as before. \"Maybe put it right next to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob moves into the driver's seat, and right on the passenger's seat, a light coat was laid back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thank you for calling,\" Sam finishes. The phone call ended on that note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that's all I need for a good starter wardrobe, Rob thought. He had a dress, two different pieces of outerwear, and an assortment of lingerie. He thought that he should probably wait some time before shopping again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter starting up the car, he pulls out of the apartment parking lot. Doing something different in this dress was something he had in his mind. He was interested in trying a new activity. There was still sunshine coming overhead, so there's enough time to do at least one thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, he thought, I should visit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pulled off the freeway, driving into the parking lot and finding a space. Turning the car off, he stepped out the car, his sandals hitting the pavement. He gently put the coat on as he got out, feeling the slight chill. The coat was a nice tan color, perfect for this time. He smiled a bit and walked to the restaurant, walking through the door and to the front where he could get a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,  can I get a table for one?\" Rob asked nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, we can do that.\" smiled the person at the front, grabbing a menu and asking him to come with her.

There was chicken alfredo pasta, tomato-rich spaghetti, Italian breadsticks, and even regular pizza which he craved. His tongue swirls over his lips after seeing the options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the? He wondered. He stops pondering at the menu. He felt something that was moving around both his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob slowly slides away from his table. He cautiously made sure he wasn't ruining the pleasant mood of the restaurant. To his surprise, he notices his sandals morphing into a pair of high heels. The flat back heels grew and narrowed to form a single point, and the entire material was growing more delicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is going on? He thought. Is Sam doing something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, here's your coke,\" the waitress says to Rob, holding a glass of the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Rob replies. \"I'm ready to order now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what would you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have a slice of pizza and some breadsticks as my starting appetizer?\" Rob responds. \"And then I'll have a chicken alfredo pasta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" says the waitress.

How refreshing, he thought. Some delic--oh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squirms in his seat for a few seconds. I need to use the bathroom!

Small smoke entrails resonated from the air around. Seeing that, he knew this and the pasta up next will be a succulent feast. He sits back down to start the best meal he had in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe devoured the slice of pizza and breadsticks as if they were just appetizers (which they were).

He was going to grab his his high heels when he realized that it reverted back into sandals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it the coat? He guessed, looking at his shoulders. By conclusion, that was the most likely answer. Apparently there are no clothes in the magical store that have no enchantments. When Rob said he wanted something to keep him warm, Sam took it a step further and made it adaptable for all specific occassions. That explains the heels, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob puts the sandals back on, and he felt better knowing that his balance will no longer be an issue. The sky was becoming dark. The night was creepily approaching while the sun faded on the horizon. Once he was done in the spa, he will be done for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis place looks nice, he thought to himself when he went inside. Everything was clean and had a vibrant, yet relaxing, feel. He could probably stay in this main lobby and feel relaxed near the seating area. There were a couple of women in a group chatting in robes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should I do? He desperately worried. He was going to be out of place if there wasn't a saving grace for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing its surroundings, the coat Rob wore unbuttoned shimmered under the ceiling light. It was going to give him the look he needed. Rob noticed the shimmering and looked down; he sees his sandals have turned into foam slippers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain? He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress starts shimmering just like the coat; however after a few seconds, it fades out of existence leaving Rob exposed. (Even his underwear disappeared with it.) He reacted quickly in trying to hide his revealed parts. No one seemed to notice this for some reason while he stood in the middle of the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation eventually ended when the coat transformed into a white robe that managed in covering his body finally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhew, he sighed of relief.

He could get used to using that name more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, come over and we'll get started.\" the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob nodded and slipped his robe off, exposing his undergarments as he laid down. The next few minutes felt heavenly as the woman worked on him, making him smile in delight. It was great how women got these. It made Rob forget about any frustrations he had beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you in college?\" the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am.\" Rob said, as some casual talk was forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a boyfriend?\" The woman seemed to smile especially at that. Rob's mind went blank for a second there. How to answer that?</span></div></div>",

I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masseuse shuts her mouth before going into a frenzy-like rant. She continued to massage Rob's back as she readjusted her concious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sincerest apologies,\" she says. \"I just have a habit in going on tangents like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's forgiven,\" Rob says to her. \"I really don't want to be stressed out too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief silence from both of them, the massage continued as it was. Rob closed his eyes while the masseuse karate chopped his back several times. Unlike the motions of a massage chair, each one felt closer to home every single time. There was pain he didn't know he had until it vanished away, even if the reliever was a little too strong for his liking. A great way to vent out her anger, he guessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Becky,\" said the masseuse. \"How're you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transcendent state Rob was in subsided when he returned to the wide awake world. He slowly gets out of his laid position and sits upright. \"I'm feeling better than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Come back again if you need to. You can stay in here as long as you want until I kick you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you?\" Rob says in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman leaves the room and closes the door, leaving Rob by himself. He looked around the area to find a mirror standing right on the corner. Well don't mind if I do so myself, he thought. He gets off from the counter and walks right in front of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Rebecca, herself right in the reflection without any clothes. Rob had this lifetime moment to see himself as her in this appearance. Looking more fine than before, he thought. Being free from anything to stop it, his breasts bounced around more so than before. While he liked seeing it uncovered, he also realized that it was the source of his back problems. He continued to admire this body anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fasteneds his own robe back on and leaves the spa, but not before paying of course. Within a not so far disrance, the robe reverted everything back into his regular formal attire. This night--no this day--was a blast, he thought. He got into his car and drove back home. There was still some lectures he had for tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

The dress is probably a little to revealing for class, but it is college and it's not likely anyone will give a shit. \"If I just had shoes to match this dress, or even just shoes that fit\", Rob fusses. Rob then remembers that Carrie, a girl she had over a few weeks ago left her shoes. Rob checks under the bed and finds them. She believes Carrie called them wedges. The straps are red just like the dress. \"This dress would look better with heels\", Rob thinks to herself and then wonders why she even cares. The shoes fit perfect which Rob finds strange as Carrie had such pretty petite feet. \"Well, my feet are pretty to. I love the nail color\", Rob thinks.

You are welcome to select something else if you like.\" Something clicks in Rob's head and she states, \"You know these clothes change people don't you?

He was supposed to go into the family business and carry on the family name. Rob's life wasn't his own. \"Fuck, I did want this\", Rob realizes. It's not exactly like Rob envisioned.

She looks around, but the wallet she'd been carrying is gone. She now has this purse. She looks though the purse hoping her wallet is in there. She instead finds an ID case.

The boxer briefs she put on under her dress have become a thong. She has no idea how long it's been like that. She looks around at the world realizing that no one will remember Rob Heart.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a hot Summer\u2019s day and rob was in need of a new swimsuit. He planned on going over to his friend\u2019s family lake house next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was owned by his friend Mark\u2019s parents. They were letting them have it for the week which included access to the lake, boat, and jet ski.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the real reason Rob wanted to go was because of Alex. She was Mark\u2019s little sister and had just turned 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing up Alex was the skinny and shy band geek who had a terribly obvious crush on Rob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever over the last couple years Alex had changed. Puberty hit her like a truck and she had filled out nicely. Thanks to her growing up shy and awkward she hadn\u2019t developed what Rob called \u201cHot Girl Bitchy Syndrome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob knew the idea of sleeping with his friends sister was shallow and low especially because of her shyness and insecurity. However in his mind he didn\u2019t care. He knew Mark was obsessed with Rob\u2019s own Ex-Girlfriend Alisha, who was also going to be there. She had always acted like a big sister to Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had dated since sophomore year of high school and went to prom together and even lost their virginities to each other. They broke up about six months ago when Rob ended up making out with another girl at a house party after getting really drunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark browsed the aisles not finding anything he really cared about that much until he came across the female swim section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of it was pretty typical except for one item. It was a plain grey one piece swimsuit with a bright orange tag on it. Normally the swimsuit looked like the kind of boring one piece his mom would wear however the bright orange tag caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe wonder suit! Just imagine your dream girl and watch her come to life!\u201d The tag read. There was a bunch of warning labels underneath Rob didn\u2019t bother to read as he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what am I supposed to just imagine my perfect girl and she will appear in this?\u201d Rob said as he picked up the swimsuit off the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe because he was bored or maybe it was just curiosity. Rob couldn\u2019t resist as he played along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...Hmm...I\u2019m imagining a platinum blonde sex bomb. Huge perfectly round DD tits. Flawless tanned skin. Hair past her perfectly rounded ass and total hourglass curves. She loves looking sexy and is really horny to boot.\u201d Rob said laughing as he just described his sexual fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his shock the swimsuit suddenly began to react...It was vibrating and humming as it suddenly changed color turning from a boring grey to a bright pink color. It also began to change shape and design as it split into two pieces forming a sexy bikini that looked designed exactly for the woman he described.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is insane how cool is this?!\u201d Rob said holding up the material closer to himself to make sure he wasn\u2019t dreaming. Rob touched the material as he suddenly felt a small shock as he pulled away thinking it was static electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir can I help you?\u201d A sudden voice said as a sales attendant was standing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his shock the bikini had disappeared...It was no longer on the hook or anywhere...Had the whole thing been a day dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...no I\u2019m good.\u201d Rob said shaking his head as he left the store wondering what that was all about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left the store he almost tripped as his flip flops caught a crack in the sidewalk. Normally this wouldn\u2019t bother Rob very much but there was just one problem. He didn\u2019t come into the store wearing flip flops which were also a bright pink...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rob reached the Victorian outfits and period pieces rather easily. The costume session was large and vast with many different sections with Victorian standing out quite nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob began to search the outfits and noticed to himself how Hollywood they seemed. Victorian was definitely a style in Hollywood more than it was about being historically accurate. It made sense, just like pirates, Ancient Rome, and the Wild West, people had a certain mind set of what they wanted to see on screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese costumes definitely reflected that. Giving off that Victorian vibe but definitely adding a bit more sex appeal to the ladies and debonair style for the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust looking around Rob saw several male outfits he liked. His character was supposed to be the main romantic lead. A man from not noble lineage who wins over the heroine through his charm and heart. The main villain role was her intended fianc\u00e9. A wealthy man heir to a vast estate who intends to marry the heroine purely for financial gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was curious what kind of woman they would cast in the lead female role? Probably someone sexy yet approachable so the audience can identify with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob actually laughed a bit as he saw two female dresses standing out from the rack, both of them were really good examples of Hollywood Victorian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a crimson gown with black trim. It\u2019s top portion was similar to a corset pushing up the bosom and offering plenty of cleavage to display. The bottom half was long and frilly and swayed nicely with step to step. A pair of red heels dangling underneath to show they went with the outfit. It was definitely sexy but also had an Elegant and old school look to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other one was more gothic. It was actually multiple separate pieces that came together to form one outfit. It was a black corset with silver buckles in the front and small silver chains down the sides long black lace sleeve and a separate black frilly skirt that stopped at the knees. The separate pieces showed off just a tad of midriff and the skirt showed off enough leg to be sexy without gratuitous. There was also a pair of black heels paired with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob imagined for the first dress a tall and elegant woman, probably with long blonde hair. She was fair and elegant and proper but inside was rebellious and mischievous. She had a great body excellent curves and hourglass figure and men wanted her but no one ever saw her for who she really was. She tries desperately to hide her monstrous secret and just wants to find love with the right person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second dress Rob imagined more gothic style. A shorter girl, petite and athletic, yet still busty and feminine. She had long black hair and pale skin. She was the problem child of her family, the youngest and most prone to cause trouble.

Though very pretty it was clearly not anachronistic, any noble woman who wore this is high society would surely get caught in scandalous rumors. He shook his head, hair inching longer as he did so. But it would look nice on screen and if the other outfits matched the vibe they could go for a more Gothic, Burton-esque look for the cast...

The moon peeked over wispy clouds added that dim moonlight to the areas just outside the lamps light. A horse and carriage trotted by, few men walking long the road in the distance.

A large wolf like creature preying upon people, in the morning so torn up and in pieces families couldn\u2019t even identify them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...Rosetta? Her name was Rob? Right? Wait...her name? She was a guy...wait...is a guy? What\u2019s happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head still cloudy Rob tried his best to fight this off walking as he fight a tightness growing in his chest and groin...His final changes were finishing up as his member slithered away into a female slit as his breasts pushed out into what would normally be around a 36 D cup. Not the biggest ever but on her skinny and petite frame they were huge. His body finished forming a perfect sexy female shape as his butt swelled and his hips pushed out giving him a nice hourglass shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had she come this way? She was lost now in the back alleys on London.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlast...bugger all Rosetta. Why did you have to take a detour at shop?\u201d Rosetta began to whisper to herself in a new higher female voice and British accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandra and Catherine would never let her live this down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were her older sisters. Rosetta was the youngest and wildest of her siblings. Their father Lord Gerald Beckley owner a large amount of land out in the country with a huge estate. Having never fathered a son his three daughters now of proper age he sees to marry them off to wealthy lords to increase his families holdings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandra and Catherine were spoiled and proper ladies. They were both beautiful with with Alexandra the oldest sporting long golden hair and Catherine with her long brunette locks. They wanted nothing more than to find wealthy husbands and settle down into a life of luxury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosetta was the wild one. Born with Raven hair and pearl white skin she was admired at a young age and the favored of the three daughters by their father. However this quickly turned into jealousy and anger as Rosetta quickly developed into a sexual beauty far quicker than her siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her bust continued to grow all through her teen years growing a full size larger than either of her sisters. Her figure was flawless and her skin porcelain smooth. She never had to shave ever. Her sisters hated this and would tease her, call her a witch, a wild thing, a whore. Anything to get her to act out and lose their fathers favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosetta grew up resenting her sisters and family. She started acting out. Dressing wildly, wearing black exclusively. Wearing revealing clothes and anything just to piss off her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven thought she had never dated a man and was still a virgin she made people think she was anything but. Now that she was of age and an adult she had made this trip to London with her sisters to attend a lavish ball. Many wealthy lords were in attending. They were to start showing themselves off  to attract potential husbands. Rosetta decided to dress in a provocative outfit rather than the elegant ball gowns her sisters wore. Partially to irritate and also to show off and make her sisters jealous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosetta decided however just to ditch instead and in town she left the carriage and went shopping around London finding herself at a thrift store until dark. She had heard of the rumors around here...of the beast that comes during the full moon. She dismissed them as children\u2019s stories but now found herself running through the back alleys of London with something hot on her tail...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother howl in the distance...this one closer...it sounded like a wolf but not one she had ever heard before. Growing up in the country she had seen beasts before. Wolves would feed on her father\u2019s sheep flock and they would go out and hunt them. This sounded like nothing she had heard before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosetta was lost...only the light of the full moon to guide her way. She darted from alley to alley as another howl echoed in the distance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosetta finally thought she lost the creature as she turned and found herself at...a dead end...nothing but a brick wall standing in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d She cried out turning around only to see a dark shadow of a creature in the alley way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature stood on all fours...it\u2019s body resembled that of a wolf but much...much bigger.  It\u2019s dark grey fur shined in the moon light as it tail stiffened in the wind. It stared at Rosetta with piercing yellow eyes...razor sharp black claws on every paw as it bared it\u2019s fangs from its long snout and started letting out a low growl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh bloody hell...nice....nice...doggy...\u201d Rosetta said more terrified than ever before in her life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was strange was that even though this beast looked like a wolf it\u2019s features were similar to that of a man...it\u2019s paws more hand like... it\u2019s features more muscular and refined...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to panic...this beast was going to devour her. Eat her for dinner and use her bones as toothpicks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosetta saw her only potential escape. A ladder in front of her. A fire escape. It wasn\u2019t pulled down yet but if she could jump and pull it down maybe she stood a chance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not a chance the beast seemed to be willing to give her however...Without any warning it suddenly lunges at her with insane speed and lethal intent...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosetta darted off time the side as the beast only managed to grab her shawl and began tearing at it. It was chocking her as Rosetta managed to rip it off and run heading for the ladder as she jumped and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it! Barely her arms grabbing the ladder as it seemed stuck and jammed. She tried to use all her weight to lower it but her small and petite body just didn\u2019t weigh enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on move!\u201d She cried out as the beast Ahmad finished ripped her shawl to shreds and made another leap at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time however the beast did not miss. It\u2019s teeth sunk into her right ankle as Rosetta cried out in searing pain. She began to kick and scream as she managed to kick off her heels and force the beast to drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only paused the beast for a second as it intended to jump up again and drag her down....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the added weight of the beast for a moment had caused the ladder to shift...it was screeching now as the rusted metal suddenly began to drop rapidly right as the beast leapt at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosetta was thrown from the ladder as it suddenly dropped rapidly heading straight for the ground as....SLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosetta heard a howling...however this time it was one of pain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and saw the beast had been impaled by the ladder...the rusted metal spikes of the ladder impaled the beast right through its heart pinning it to the ground. The beast wrestled around on the ground moaning and howling as it tried to free itself blood pouring from it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took moments as the beast grew quiet...still...eventually not moving at all as it\u2019s glowing yellow eyes grew faint...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosetta managed to stand but winced in pain. Her ankle hurt like hell. She examined the wound and saw it wasn\u2019t that bad. She would live but she was walking with a limp now And could barely put any weight on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden sound of a whistle blowing could be heard in the back alleys getting louder. Rosetta heard it getting closer and closer as suddenly two constables on patrol appeared waving their torches around spotting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you who goes there?\u201d One of the called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut it you bloke! She\u2019s just a girl! Are you okay miss?\u201d His partner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...this...thing attacked me.\u201d Rosetta said covering up her bite wound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cops got closer as they sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell damn miss...I do say you got him. Rightful shame too this one was do for a hanging.\u201d One of the constables said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn is that mad eye Charlie?\u201d His partner said shinning his torch over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosetta was confused....what were they talking about? This was a wild beast right? She thought turning around as she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the wild beast was a very naked and very dead man laid...impaled by the ladder he laid there dead...he looked like a homeless vagrant...an escaped convict maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis here is Mad Eye Charlie. Been in and out of the Yard since he was a boy. Loved to stalk young ladies like yourself love. I\u2019m guessing he just hit a spot of bad luck and this ladder came crashing down on him?\u201d One of the cops asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...guess I got lucky.\u201d Rosetta said quiet. She couldn\u2019t admit what had really happened. They would think her mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell miss you are dress pretty fancy for a back alley girl? What\u2019s brings you out here?\u201d The partner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...got lost...I\u2019m Rosetta Beckley.\u201d Rosetta said showing her silver family crest on her ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hot damn miss! We are dealing with a lords daughter! I\u2019m assuming you got lost on your way to the ball? It\u2019s not far off. Let\u2019s escort you there while our boys clean up this mess. I\u2019m sure your family is missing you terribly. You got right lucky tonight miss.\u201d One of the cops said escorting Rosetta away from the grisly scene.</span></div></div>",

The story was about a group of young college kids. You had the jock, the stoner, the hot chick, the shy girl, the nerdy guy, and several other minor characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general plot was a group of friends go vacation on a resort way out in the woods call Club Luna. They are renting a super nice cabin and plan to hang out, party, spend time on the lake, etc. However when they arrive they hear reports of recent animal attacks in the area but dismiss it as bear sightings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first things seem to be going well until one night they hear a howling at night along with what sounds like screams and gunshots nearby. With no phone access, they decide to investigate the nearby cabin and find a grisly scene...Multiple campers like themselves torn up horrible and even partially eaten....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they try to get into their car and leave they see a dark shadowy figure near their car that rushes off before they can shine a light on it. They find their scar is full of large claw marks and even stranger...the brakes likes have been cut..:as if the animal knew what it was doing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally find a phone and call the park ranger he arrives and investigates blaming the scene on a wild bear in the territory. Saying the other camper group attracted it somehow and it acted defensively when they threatened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur group isn\u2019t convinced and want to leave but with their car broken they are forced to wait several days for a mechanic to arrive. In the meantime all they can do is try to enjoy themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night however the shy girl and stoner guy go off to collect some firewood when they find themselves being stalked by a large beast. They try to run but the nerdy guy is picked off quick as the shy girl tries to run but soon comes face to face with a huge terrifying wolf like creature. However rather than attack her it only sniffs her and when she freaks out the wolf bites her but she manages to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning they find the stoner guy torn to pieces. The group decides to play it safe and huddle inside to protect themselves. However the shy girl has another problem. Her wound has healed perfectly over night but she is notices certain...changes in herself. Her hearing is better, she no longer needs glasses, her sense of smell is incredible. Her body is also slowly changing, getting stronger and even sexier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group begins to investigate and finds out that it is a werewolf stalking them. It seems like this time of year is actually their mating season. They chose one person to be their mate and devour everyone else in their way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after this it\u2019s discovered that the shy girl is the chosen Mate. She can\u2019t hide her changing body anymore and is even starting to develop some wolf like features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first her friends want to kill her but soon thanks to the nerdy guy reason prevails and they let her live. They figure if she is his chosen mate they might be able to use her before the next full moon when she will turn fully and begin to hunt them down. They discover if they can kill the werewolf before she turns it will cure her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey create an elaborate trap to stop the werewolf. When they spring the trap it seems to work at first but something goes wrong later on. The werewolf escapes and begins hunting them down. The jock is taken down first followed by the hot chick a few scenes later. Leaving just the nerd and shy girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether the two of them team up and using his smarts and her enhanced skills to take down the werewolf once and for all. The two of them watch as it turns back into a human and it\u2019s revealed to be the same park ranger they met before. It seems he had been luring in campers to feed off of for some time and now finally the nightmare is over....or is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shy girl isn\u2019t changing back and is still becoming more wolf like by the minute...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when the nerdy guy reveals he is actually a werewolf too! He is actually the one who bit her that night. He had desired her to be his mate all along. He laughs when he tells her there is no cure so it\u2019s best if she just accept herself as his new mate so they can live together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shy girl refuses his offer and the two of them soon transform into werewolves and have a huge fight scene. Just when it seems the female wolf is about to lose she sees barely escapes a falling trap as it impales the male werewolf killing him instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final scene shows our heroine some time later,  she is living a life in the raid trying to accept her new life and curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob read the script and liked it, he hoped to land the role of the nerdy guy as his build called for it. </span></div></div>",

However the nature of the Metaverse has changed. The owner of the palace, a twisted and vile man of great wealth and power has the ability to change other things in the meta verse to suit his distorted desires. When our protagonist is captured by the palace owner\u2019s shadows the villain using his twisted power to turn him into the thing he desires most, a beautiful girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being turned into a girl against his will the protagonist still refuses to give up and at that moments awakens to her new persona and uses her power to escape. However something goes wrong with the Metaverse Nav as she escapes...A glitch...Something gets twisted and when the protagonist escapes he is back to reality but still a girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sets the stage for the game as our hero now a girl but start a brand new school year as girl at the new boarding academy. She slowly starts to makes friends and allies who become persona users as well over time as they try to find a way to save people from their distorted desires as well as eventually find a way to return the protagonist back to a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob wasn\u2019t sure why they went the whole gender bending route for this new game but he didn\u2019t care. He wanted to dress up as a phantom thief like Joker at the new anime con. As he browsed the outfits he found a nice looking boarding school jacket like they wear in the games. He figured maybe he could start here and go for the student look. </span></div></div>",

Looks like it's around my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight there, he decided to give the jacket a little try, putting his arms through the sleeves and patting it down a little. The size was actually pretty good, and it was comfortable all things considered. The whole idea was kind of funny though, given Rob had never worn any sort of school uniform in his life, aside from a tiny bit of sports on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this feels good,\" Rob smiled as he looked at the price. \"And that looks good too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Rob thought of what else could work. Some pants would be nice, though maybe he could substitute something for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Ugh!\" Rob suddenly lurched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust now, it felt like the jacket just got tighter or something. Rob looked down, seeing that it was suddenly all buttoned up, something he didn't do as he only did a few buttons before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he asked. \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled at the jacket, trying not to rip it. However, oddly enough, the jacket wouldn't budge, as if it was latched on to him. Okay, this was actually getting a little irritating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, enough with-AHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words were cut off at him crying out a bit as the jacket suddenly got even snugger and began to glow, slowly getting brighter and brighter until the store was getting harder to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, SOMEBODY HELP!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, his words fell on deaf ears, as the store was disappearing behind the light. Rob was feeling sick to his stomach, his senses overwhelmed by the world spinning around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, oddly enough, what little of the world he could see beyond the light looked like it was getting brighter, almost looking like something out of an animation, or something like that anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob fell to his knees, using one hand on the ground to keep himself up, barely noticing that same hand starting to look different itself.</span></div></div>",

The strangest experience he just had as his vision was clearing as he looked up and saw his animated hand in front of him...Wait...Animated hand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob shot out of bed and looked all around him. He was dressed in a plain black t shirt and boxers as he was in some kind of student dorm room. There was a school uniform with a black jacket and white pants hanging up in a closet door nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was everything around him was animated! The entire world including himself was now like an Anime!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rushed to the mirror and saw himself...or rather this new anime version of himself. He looked younger. Healthier, nicer even. He had semi long black hair that was decently styled. His body was young and fit, he looked around 17 or 18. A perfect Anime protagonist age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even a student ID sitting on the counter top with his picture on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt said \u201c Tsuki Yami\u201d 3rd year, Taiyo Academy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was beginning to put the pieces together. He had been sucked into some kind of anime world! Was it a persona style world like the games?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob looked out the window and saw a modern version of Tokyo as it was clear he was definitely in some kind of new anime world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...don\u2019t freak out. Let\u2019s just play it cool for now.\u201d Rob said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob didn\u2019t know anything about himself in this world. Who was Tsuki Yami? He was struggling to remember details of his old life and world as a strange cloudy haze made it hard to focus on those things right now. Something inside him just to accept this for now and live a normal student life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to just go along with it Rob got ready and dressed for the day. He put on his uniform as he looked like a professional student at a prestigious academy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath he went outside as saw several other students his age all leaving their dorms. They were all boys about his age dressed in the same outfits. It made sense as this was most likely the boys dorms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Rob could tell the school was a couple blocks away and the students all just walked there from their dorms. The girls dorms was right next door as he saw female students leaving it as all the students were heading in the same direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob was a little off put by the female students. Their outfits seemed...well...rather provocative for what he assumed was a nice academy. Compared to the boys who wore nice black jackets and slick white pants and black dress shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed the girls were all wearing short black skirts. Most of which only went mid thigh at best. They also wore white button up blouses which seemed designed to show off at least some cleavage. They weren\u2019t even wearing stockings or dress shoes either, they were all wearing black open toed Dress heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious as he walked with a group of students that this was not normal...Many of the girls seemed shy and uncomfortable walking around like this as many of the guy students took notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a crosswalk Rob overheard a couple younger female students complain as they were trying to adjust their skirts and tops. Apparently the tops were rather tight and the buttons would pop open on several girls especially the bustier ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe Principal Dobutsu got these new uniforms approved for the female students this year. This is totally degrading!\u201d  One female student said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! He is such an animal! Total perv, it\u2019s like we are in a zoo and just display pieces for him to stare at. If not for his wealth and political connections they never would allow him to get away with this!\u201d Her friend said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob overheard their talk as he walked towards the school. It seemed a really nice place on the outside as he took a deep breath heading in wondering what he should do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob heard a weird beeping noise on his phone as he took it out for a moment. There was a weird pop up on his screen as some kind of app was there. It was some kind of red eye...</span></div></div>",

It was like someone had ripped this suit straight out of the show. Having had her feel she began to walk away, happy at seeing such a great cosplay but somewhat sadden that she can't get it for herself. Looking back she saw that the suit was gone, looking around her she couldn't see anyone else .

The tanned leather demon hunter suit she was searching for. Breathing a sigh of relief she leans in to pick up the suit, holding it up to the light to make sure nothing was damaged when suddenly Lucy heard a voice in her head say \"Put it on.\" She wondered where that came from, although she would love to wear the suit, looked to be too big on her.

Than as if to answer her question an opening in the back appeared. Wondering how she could have possibly missed this, she shrugged it off and slipped one leg in, amazed with just how silky and comfortable it was. After slipping in another she remarked on how the suit seemed tailor fit for her. It hugged her every curve and line perfectly in black leathery beauty. She slipped her arms in right before the opening began to close, resulting in Lucy frantically pushing her head through the top opening before reaching back and wondering where the opening slit was. Catching herself in the mirror she couldn't believe how well this suit fit her. She did some posing and some faux action moves to see just how movement friendly this suit was. turns out it was a strange mixture of tight and flexible. with shiny, silky leather on display Impressed, she remembered that she now had to take it off...</span></div></div>",

Just as she was moving toward her own clothes the suit caught her foot, causing Lucy to fall down. When she turned around to see what she tripped on she saw the suit opening up to put her back inside. At first she screamed but a sleave fo the suit quickly muffled her. After that she tried to get out of the suit to no avail, feeling powerless she decided to just ride this out and see if she can't get it off afterwards. Though she expect the suit to swallow her up like Venom from Spiderman, in instead snaked up her body, holding it tight yet not forcing her inside, it wouldn't let go but wouldn't force her either. Lucy stared at it wondering what it was waiting for until it dawned on her that maybe it somehow knew what she was thinking, that she wished that she could keep wearing it, feeling its slick, silky yet leathery embrace all over. She realized what she had to say, \"I want this.\" When she did the suit rapidly engulfed her, Lucy just closed her eyes and enjoyed it. What felt different was how she could feel her body changing, she felt her legs grown taller and slightly more muscular, though not so much that it ruined her slim physique, the same happened with her arms, then she felt her waist pinch inward as well as her bosom's growth into adulthood, as well as becoming more toned. When the suit finally finished putting itself on her, she opened her eyes and marveled at her new body she realized she looked like Sango now but than realized that her face still looked... \"Aghhh!\" she clutched her face as it began reshaping itself into Sango's replica, slight Asian slant, fuchsia makeup and all. When the pain stopped and she looked in the mirro she didn't see 14 year old lucy, generigirl extraordinaire, she saw 18 year old Sango the beautiful demon hunter, she had become her own living ideal of femininity. After trying some of her newfound athleticism (and trying not to break anything) Sango/Lucy wondered what to do now?</span></div></div>",

She left the fitting room looking for the cashiers to ask about the price when she noticed her hair was falling in her way, after brushing it aside for a while she quickly gets irritated with it and just ties it behind her head in a pony tail. What she failed to notice was her increasing height as she steadily grew taller and taller to 5'3. Her arms and legs grew grew longer and subtly gained muscle. her waist pinched inward somewhat and lengthened from a 14 year old to an 18 year olds. Lucy gained a more confident stride as she continued oblivious to her changing body. She only stopped when her face began to feel strange, stopping at a mirror she looked in a mixture or horror and awe as her face was changing. her eyes gained a slight Asian slant with a touch of fuchsia makeup, her lips lightly expanded and the rest of her facial features subtly tweaked and changed. when it was over Lucy stared and said aloud \" Oh my god.\" her hand reaching for her mouth she realized that the voice that came out wasn't hers but that of Sango the demon slayer. Finally looking down she realized the rest of her body had changed to accompany her face. She had changed form 14 year old Lucy to 18 year old Sango in the span of what was at the most an hour.

Lucy's face is beet red, wondering and dreading just how much she saw. \"Don't worry, most customers have a similar experience to yours, well that or the clothes just poof onto their person and force them to fill it out.\" All Lucy could say to that was \"What?\" the clerk took a sigh and said \"Okay its clear you aren't getting it , so here goes; 1, this is a magic costume shop where the costume mold the wearer into the ideal shape for whatever costume they wear 2, because you willingly wore the suit instead of being forced into it like so many of my clientele, guess what, you get to take it off and go back to normal.\" the clerk twirled her finger in a clearly mocking sort of way \"How often have you had to explain all this?\" questioned Lucy \"Way too often\" said the clerk, \"You won't believe how many ten- twelve year old boys wonder in here and walk out middle aged housewives.\" Lucy remembering why she wanted to find an employee asked \"how much for this suit, I just have to have it.\" The clerk suppressed a giggle \"You actually wanna pay? \"I can't remember the last time someone actually paid instead of running out in a blind panic.\" Sizing up Lucy, the clerk decided \"Y'know what, give me a twenty and you can keep it, darn thing looks way too good on you.\" Lucy's face beamed in a combination of excitement and disbelief \"You're the first guest in ages who hasn't lost their mind just touching one of these costumes so I'll tell ya how this one works. Lucy rushed to her things to break out a pen and paper to write everything the clerk says down \"Okay first thing, it takes about an hour to shift between your current body and your real one, in order to change just put on or take off the suit and you'll start to change. Second thing you can slow down changing back by wearing a piece of the suit rather than the whole thing for example if say you want to go out one evening you can change, then take off the suit but keep the boots on, that should give you a few hours of fun.\" All right lets go back to the front desk and I'll ring you up \"Sango.\" Lucy couldn't help but giggle at that comment, a few minutes later and Lucy was know the proud owner of this magical, leather suit.

Though know the change was more literal. After enough stalling Lucy made sure she was the only one home and opened the suit and let herself in. The suit was as comfortable as ever, as she waited to change Lucy wondered to herself \"I wonder why this suit is leather?\" \"Most cosplayers I've seen use spandex for the suit and leather for the boots\" \"Than again no one really talked about the suit on the show so who's to say the it wasn't made out of leather.\" Lucy gave a shrug just as the changes reached her face, It felt like hundreds of ants were meticulously shifting around her very face, needless to say not very comfortable.

After a few songs Lucy looks at the clock and realizes she needs to get going, but as she was held by the mysterious man's arms for this long, maybe one more song won't hurt? As it turns out that last song is a slow dance, and as they hold each other and sway gently, Lucy looks into his eyes and he looks into hers and without a word said, their lips interlock.

It isn't until his hand starts reaching downward and finally gropes her rear that Lucy suddenly breaks out of it, immediately slapping him , while shooting him a look that just screams,\"dirty pervert\" As Lucy stormed off, she turned back and realized she never got the man's name, when she turned back he was already gone, she went to the bartender and asked if he knew, he responded, \"He's been going around calling himself Miroku or something, I dunno it sounded Asian.\" Satisfied with her answer Lucy returns home just as her body begins the more notable changes. herself again she lays on her bed thinking about the night, how it was in Miroku's arms and how she didn't want that last dance to end. She also remembers the slap and wondered where that came from, \"That wasn't me as much as..\" Lokking at the suit on her bed she dismisses her concern, returns her mother's eveningwear and goes to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Staring at the inside of the suit, she caught a look at herself in the mirror, taking one last look at herself she took a deep breath and leapt into the suit. She fell onto the ground, only realizing she shouldn't have done that after falling on her face. She looked at her back, courtesy of the mirror, and saw herself getting sealed, the suits openings closing, preparing for her fusion. As she waited she noting how cool and slick the inside of the suit feels on her skin. When it was finished she saw a phantom Sango before her \" So you want to merge?\" Lucy shook her head yes. Sango took her by the hand looked her in the eye, giving the warmest most comforting smile Lucy had ever seen. Lucy's eyes felt heavy and the moment she closed them the process began. Her legs and arms extended, gaining muscle tone and near super human strength. her hand gained light callouses from all the years of training with weapons particularly the oversized boomerang hiraikotsu, her waist grew from a fourteen year old to an eighteen year old athletes, gowing longer and gaining a tight, toned core. her breasts grew, from the American A cup to the Japanese D. Her skin toned changed to that of a Japanese woman. At last her face felt like hundreds of ants were crawling over it, reshaping every piece of bone and muscle before spreading to and extending her hair, If Lucy had her eyes open she could see her hair change from wavy brown to a beautiful, straight, shiny black. Opening her eyes Lucy saw that the transformation was seemingly finished. She blushed as she brought her hands to her face, marveling at her new permanent form. looking back over at phantom Sango, Lucy saw her coming closer Lucy fell back on her rear wondering what was happening Sango Leaned in over her ear \"Let us be one, my love\" Phantom Sango kissed Lucy on the lips as they became one. Phantom Sango began to assimilate into Lucy's person as there forms became one. Lucy could feel all the knowledge and skill of the demon slayers enter her as well as details she didn't expect, like her new place in the modern world as a demon slayer. As the fusion was nearly complete all that was left of phantom Sango broke the kiss, about to say something before Lucy interrupted her with her own kiss. as their minds had become one at long last. Collapsing on the ground Lucy closed here eyes one last time well aware that when she next opened them she would be Sango, body and soul, as she drifted of sleep a smile appeared on her face as she hugged herself, the two beings together at last.</span></div></div>",

Shrugging it off, Sango looks around her apartment. Its fairly modest, a small, open kitchen leading to a living room with a good view of town. To the right side there is a hallway leading to a bathroom and bedroom, she doesn't spend much time at home so this suits her needs perfectly. Oddly enough, the apartment feels peculiar despite the fact she must have lived here for a year. A knock on the door shook Sango out of her stupor.

Sango  sighed, but couldn't help but smile at the same time, undoing the lock, Miroku and Sango exchanged pleasantries before discussing what they wanted to do for the evening. They leaned in toward each other with a coy look in their eyes.  After what felt like an eternity in each other's arms they leaned in for a passionate kiss. Of course Miroku couldn't resist roving his hands lower, and lower... \"SLAP\" They back away from each other Miroku feeling his new bruise Sango wagging her finger with a playful smile. When the her phone rang, picking it up she found out it was a job slaying a goat demon a few blocks away. She grabbed her sword and Hiraikotsu along with a few extra supplies, while Miroku grabbed his staff and pulled some charms out of his jacket pocket, both marched out the door and onwards toward the demon, Their \"playtime\" could wait until after the job was done besides some adrenaline might put that nagging though in the back of her mind at ease, after all she's done this a hundred times over.</span></div></div>",

Amber sticks the spoon in saying \"Her comes the choo choo train! Haha aw my wittle Lucy baby is so BIG!\"<br>\r\nLucy gives a playful pouty face \"Hey! Don't you tease me enough about my height?!\"<br>\r\nThey both laugh. \"Hey sorry, but not only are ya small but you are adorable to boot\" Amber says as she winks.<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't forget freaking cute!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh of course I wouldn't little baby!\"<br>\r\n\"Haha hey! do I look like I am wearing a diaper?!\"<br>\r\n\"Well you do have a massive bottom!\"<br>\r\nThey both burst out laughing. Lucy takes a quick look around to make sure no one is around to see her goof off. \"Oh let me tell ya, I am SO wearing a diaper!\" She says as she stands up and turns around and shakes her bottom in Amber's face. They both laugh but Lucy hears the odd crinkle again, and she notices Amber's laugh get's cut short then feels her underwear get pulled up from the back ... but it felt different. She quickly turns around and grabs her butt as she glares at Amber. \"Hey! What was that? Trying to give me a wedgie?\"<br>\r\nAmber giggles \"I am sorry but I saw your diaper sticking out and I couldn't resist! I didn't know you were an actual baby! Haha\"<br>\r\nLucy gives a confused look but then looks down and notices her crotch looks way poofy. She gasps and grabs Amber's hand and drags her into the nearest bathroom. \"But my milkshake!\" Amber whines as she is being dragged by the now waddling Lucy. She rushes into the biggest stall and locks the door then drops her pants. They both gawk at her now diapered bottom, the diaper is extremely poofy with the most babyish designs anyone of them have seen. <br>\r\n\"Wow, look at that.\" Amber says \"Have any for me? haha\" <br>\r\n\"NO!\" Lucy quickly exclaims back \"I didn't put this on myself!\"<br>\r\n\"Well duh, babies need help changing!\"<br>\r\n\"No, Amber I am serious! I wasn't wearing this earlier!\"</span></div></div>",

It might be the hormones kicking inside her body. But she soon dismissed this thought whenythe started to feel jarring pain all over her body.

Zoe's heart was beating very fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Heart attack!</i> It suddennly dawned on her. Impossible. She thought. She is still very young to get a heart attack.

She was admitted to the hospital and had to stay there for several weeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, the pain stopped. Then Zoe felt something was creeping on the boobs area.

She put the diapers on the bench and questioned herself for a second. 'This is ridiculous' she thought. As she stood there glaring at the package she somehow seemed drawn to them. 'It's not like it would hurt or anything, and I know my friends would die if they saw this' She giggled and opened the package. At first the placed it over her jeans then a thought came into her head 'I am so dumb, babies don't wear anything under diapers'. She placed the diaper down and dropped her pants, she shivered a little as her belt buckle clinked on the floor. She slid her panties off and grabbed the diaper once more. She placed it on herself and as she felt the poofyness of the diaper touch her a short gasp escaped her mouth. 'Why does this feel so good? Like almost... arousing?' She brushed it off and taped the diaper up. She rolled her shirt up just a little bit to make it a belly shirt to get a better view and she checked herself out in the mirror and giggled. She looked cute, adorable, and heck even freaking hot! 'Why does this look so dang good? Maybe I should wear these all the time!' She thought as she laughed. She turned and got a good look at her rear. Her hand found it's way to her padded bum and she patted it. 'Bad girl, you get a spanking' She thought as she spanked herself. She bit her lip and turned back front as her hand found itself in the front of her diaper as she rubbed it against herself. The crinkling made it even better as she started to lose breath. She quickly shook her head and regained focus. She pulled out her phone and started doing poses in the mirror as she took some pictures. She felt proud of her poses as she grabbed her crotch and crossed her legs as if she needed to be, then made a surprised face as if she actually did. She thought that sucking her thumb would be an adorable picture and she was dang right! After a nice selfie photo season she spoke up so the lady could hear her. \"Haha hey you were right, these fit and they are pretty cute!\" <br>\r\n.... There was no response<br>\r\n\"Hello? Are you there?\" She said a bit louder.</span></div></div>",

As she stopped she heard the crinkle and remembered the diaper that she had forgotten for a sec, realizing she was just standing out in the open in just a diaper and tshirt she turned beat red. Suddenly she heard a familiar loud voice.<br>\r\n\"ZOE?!\"<br>\r\nZoe turned in horror to see one of her close friends, Lucy, gawking at Zoe with a jaw hanging down and wide open eyes big enough to see all of Zoe's diaper glory. Zoe gasped and jumped back in the dressing room ashamed. She heard a knock on the door.<br>\r\n\"Zoe are you in there?\"<br>\r\n.... There was a long pause... \"Y-yes\" Zoe finally responded.<br>\r\n\"Um hi, listen did... did I just see you in a diaper?\"<br>\r\n\".... maaayyybeeeee\"<br>\r\n\"Haha Zoe let me in, I have just GOT to see this!\"<br>\r\nZoe hesitated but figured she was gonna show Lucy some pictures later for laughs, that doesn't make being in person any less embarrassing! She slowly opened the door and just stood there with a tiny smirk on her face as Lucy looked her up and down.<br>\r\n\"hehe goo goo ga ga\" Zoe chuckled.<br>\r\nThat was it, Lucy burst out in laughter. Zoe pulled her in and the two laughed together in the small dressing room.<br>\r\nLucy finally composed herself \"O-okay haha so why... why are you wearing a diaper? hehe\"<br>\r\n\"Well this lady said they can fit anyone, so she put me up to the challenge, however after I got all diapered up she just disappeared!\"<br>\r\n\"Well that's weird, but yeah, they definitely fit you! haha!\"<br>\r\nThey both continued to laugh some more but then Zoe stood up straight and stiff with a very surprised look on her face.<br>\r\nLucy looked at her with confusion \"Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\nZoe paused \".... Well they don't JUST fit me.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\nZoe looked down at her diaper as did Lucy and they were both in shock as they saw a yellow spot growing on it.</span></div></div>",

I'm trying to hold it in but I can't stop!\" They just stood there as the quiet *sssssss* finally came to a stop after what seemed like hours.

You're, shall we say a little runny, and your diaper has leaked.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh crap!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's about it.\"  Susie undoes the sealing strips on either side of the diaper, loosens it, then wipes around Cary's bum to mop up the worst of the mess. Then she look around, knowing that she'll need something else to help clear Carly up.  On a low shelf she spots a box of wipes, which she grabs and uses. Unfortunately for Carly, her runny baby pooh has soiled both her panties and jeans.  On the same shelf Susie finds a pile of clean diapers, and picking the largest one puts it onto Carly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, your turn now.\" Carly says, and they repeat the process with Susie laying down to be changed.  Fortunately Susie has not suffered the same pooh explosion that her friend had, and Carly wipes down, and attaches a fresh diaper to Susie.<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Carly asks. \"I can't put my jeans back on, and I certainly can't go out wearing just a diaper on my bottom half.\"<br>\r\n\"Guess we'll just have to find something else for you to put on then.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but this is a baby store. Nothing will fit me!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe, but they have adult sized diaper readily available in the changing room, so I'd guess anything could be possible.\"<br>\r\n\"OK, well I'm not going anywhere like this. You go out and try to find me something.\"<br>\r\nSusie opens the door, checks that it's quiet outside, smooths down her skirt over her diaper, and step out. Meanwhile Carly waits for her friend to return. After a few minutes there's a knock on the door, and Susie comes back inside. She's carrying ... </span></div></div>",

She then pulls on the layered tulle skirt onto. \"Happy now?\" she asks Susie.<br>\r\n\"Ye-es. I said it looked cute.

What are we going to do?!\" \"We're getting out of here, that's what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two crawled out from underneath the door and hastily waddled, as their diapers were now twice as thick, toward the exit.

Unfortunately, they weren't paying much attention and ended up tripping over another package of baby diapers...these ones three times as thick as their current ones. \"You've got to be kidding,\" Carly said in disbelief. Almost immediately, their diapers started puffing out, getting thicker and thicker until they went past the girls' knees. \"How could this possibly get worse?\" Susie muttered, poking her now massive padding. Just then, as expected when you say that phrase, something fell from the nearby shelf onto the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA] A bra and pair of panties, big enough for two [full sized] women to wear at the same time.

Her dress boots were click-clacking on the increasingly slippery cobblestones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later the drops were starting to turn into a downpour. She frantically looked around for shelter, and ran into the closest store.

Row upon row of haphazardly hung clothing racks were stretching all the way to the back of the dimly-lit store. There were no other customers, and a bored looking girl was sitting behind the counter, reading a magazine. Chloe wasn't the kind of girl that usually went browsing through such stores, much preferring to get her clothes online.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Melanie went through the isle, she noticed something in the corner of her eye. It was a pink onesie, the same kind an infant would wear. On closer inspection, however, she found that it was big enough for a 14 year-old...maybe older. She was quite surprised to see such a thing. Granted, a lot of people wore something similar to this, footie pajamas, but this was something different. It was exactly like a baby's onesie, with minor differences. It had two flaps. One to check the front of the diaper, the other to check the back. The area for the diaper in specific was quite open, thus implying that this was designed for really thick diapers in mind. Also, it had closed-toed leggings with white on the feet bottoms. Disgusted, Melanie simply put the article of clothing back and continued on her way.<br>\r\nFor some bizarre reason, she couldn't get that onesie off her mind. It was an incredibly strange thing, yet it just seemed to call out to her. When Melanie snapped back into reality, she found herself next to the onesie again. As it turns out, she ended up walking in a circle. She looked at the pink bunch of fabric for a minute or two. Not really knowing what she was doing, she grabbed the onesie and took it to the dressing room. When she reached the dressing room, she couldn't help but feel childish. She needed something to counter it. She picked up a bra at least 3 sizes bigger than her regular one and went inside a stall.<br>\r\nWith the door locked, she undressed herself and was soon stripped down to her bra and panties. Looking at her figure, Melanie questioned why she was doing this. She's what most people consider average. She was 5'4\" with C, maybe D breasts. Now here she is, about to put on over-sized clothing made for babies. She started stalling for time, thinking it wouldn't fit. However, the fabric for the onesie was quite stretchy, so it's pretty likely she would be able to put it on. Eventually, she gained some courage and unzipped the back of the sleeper to begin putting it on. Before she did, however, she made sure to put on the other bra. <i>Nobody's going to see me in this,</i> she thought as she slid her feet through the leggings with ease, <i>I'm just going to try it on, look at myself a bit, take it off, and forget this ever happened.</i> By the time she finished her thought, she had moved her arms through the sleeves and zipped up the back. She started having second thoughts about grabbing both clothes. It felt weird having all this empty space...but then again, there was no way she'd grab some diapers just to complete the look.<br>\r\nMelanie eyed herself in the mirror. As embarrassing as this felt, she did seem pretty cute. It was odd that, despite there's nothing to fill it, the onesie retained it's shape as though there actually was a diaper there. The same applying to the bra. After a few minutes of spinning[ and a few random, show-off-y poses] to see how she looked, Melanie sat down. When she did, however, something didn't seem right. Her breasts seemed heavier and her legs felt like they were being spread apart by her panties, which seemed much softer than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she imagining things or did her panties really become an uber-thick diaper and breasts expand to fit the bra?<br>\r\n[Chapter is a little mediocre, but I'm still trying to get used to writing decent stories/chapters. I do apologize if this isn't up to your standards. -Ed]</span></div></div>",

She maybe lost 4\" so she was a solid 5'. She looked at herself in the mirror again \"Cuuuuuttteeeeeeee\" She said, sounding just like a teen age girl. She walked to the desk up front, \"Um, mamn, how much is this sleeper and bra?\" The clerks eyes buldged. \"Sweetie, did you lose your Mommy? Its rare for a Teen Baby girl to go without her.\" Melanies mind began to regress also \"Mommy doesn't wove me and she just got awwesded.\" The clerks eyes lowered then \"Well, do you want me to be your new Mommy?\" Her eyes shined happily \"Pweese.\" The clerk couldn't resist \"By the way the names Kelly. Now I'll pay for those and then we'll see if I can adopt you.\" Kelly smiled, paid, and Melanie stayed there for a while, having to wait for kelly to get off work. \"I do dink dey said dat I couldn't wive with Mommy no more.\" Kelly smiled \"Well thats great news sweetie.\"<br>\r\nWhen Kelly got off work she took Melanie to the town hall and got her adopted, what is the first thing they do after that?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melanie didn't see anything that called out to her.  Why would she?  These clothes were for younger girls, and she was 26.  She was so focused on looking for the women's section that she almost jumped when someone cleared their throat behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you find something miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie turned around and saw a store employee had come over.  The girl was in her late teens, probably 17.  Her brown hair was held back in a plastic clip, and she was wearing a white blouse and tan pants.  She stood a few inches shorter than Melanie.  Her name tag read Julie.  She smiled warmly, but there was a glint in her eye that Melanie interpreted as 'I enjoy sneaking up on customers.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just browsing.  But this isn't really my section.  Could you show me where...\" Melanie started to ask for directions to the women's section, but Julie cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?  I think you would look lovely in this.\"  The sales associate pulled out a navy-blue jumper and thrust it at Melanie.  The garment was clearly designed for a teenager, not an adult, and Melanie had no interest in it.  But the way Julie pushed it at Melanie, she accepted it more out of instinct than anything else.  As soon as her fingers brushed the cloth, she felt a chill run through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... no, I don't think so.  I think this is a bit too young of a style for me.\"  Melanie held the jumper out for Julie to take back, but the sales associate made no effort to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly.  It would be perfect for you.  I'll bet it even fits like it was made for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could it?\" Melanie asked.  \"It isn't even my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I won't tell.  We girls lie about our sizes all the time,\" Julie said, giving Melanie a conspiratorial wink.  \"Here, try it on.  If it's not a perfect match, I'll give you 25% off anything in the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I suppose it couldn't hurt to try it on.  You said 25%, right?\" Melanie said, indecision in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!  The changing room is right this way.\" Julie said, stepping behind Melanie and putting her hands on her shoulders.  Melanie was surprised at the sales girl's lack of personal space, but for some reason said nothing.  She found herself sulking in the direction the younger girl wanted.  Julie even started pushing Melanie to get her to walk faster, and instead of complaining about the girl's presumption, Melanie nervously picked up her pace through the store to a door in the back wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, now try this on, and remember, if I'm wrong, the 25% off is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie didn't really want to take this any further, she was already feeling a little weird about the way Julie was treating her.  And there was no way this jumper would fit her, it was obvious just holding it next to her.  But 25% off was nothing to sneeze at, so Melanie sullenly went into the changing room.  She took off her top and skirt, admiring herself in her bra and panties in the mirror for a brief second.  She looked good.  She was happy with her B cup chest, it was full without being too large, and her body showed the toning resulting from her daily workouts.  Then she looked at the girl's garment she was about to try on and frowned.  She hadn't even worn something this childish when she was a teenager.  Oh well, the sooner she got it on, the sooner she could show it didn't fit and get her discount.  Melanie took the jumper off the hanger and slid it over her head.  She somehow got tangled up and it took a few seconds for her to reach her arms out the correct holes, and get her head out the top.  She pulled the jumper down and looked in the mirror, ready to see the poor fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how did the jumper fit?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melanie gasped.  The jumper fit perfectly.  It clung to her body as though it was the perfect size, accentuating her curves just barely.  The bottom of the jumper came down to her knees, not her upper thigh like she'd expected, and there were no signs of it stretching to fit her adult sized body.  Melanie was so confused she didn't notice that Julie had entered the dressing room behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I told you, it's like it was made just for you.\"  Julie smiled at Melanie in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's impossible.  It isn't my size.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you've been wearing the wrong size, because I don't think that could fit any better.  Turn around, look at the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was in such a state of shock that she found herself doing what Julie said.  She turned around and looked over her shoulder.  The sales girl was right, from every side, this jumper fit Melanie like a glove.  Maybe this was all some sort of trick.  Maybe Julie had pulled out an adult sized item that had been mislabeled.  That had to be it.  Of course, that didn't explain why an adult would want a design this childish, but Melanie chose not to focus on that for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think?  Should I ring it up for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie blushed.  Even if it did fit, there was no way she was buying this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, don't decide yet!  Let me get you a few things to complete the look, then you can decide!\" Julie cut in.  Melanie was tiring of the girl's hyperactive way of cutting her off, but before she could say anything, Julie darted out the door.  Melanie turned back to the mirror.  She ran her hands over the jumper, but no matter what movement she made, the jumper fit her perfectly.  She could not understand how that was possible.  Melanie's thoughts were interrupted by Julie's return.  In her arms she had a pair of knee socks and black, patent leather shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, try these on, I just know you'll love how cute you look in them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie had no desire to wear either of the items, but again found herself unable to assert her own will.  It must be the shock of seeing herself fit in a girl's clothes.  So without enthusiasm, Melanie put on the socks and shoes.  She was not surprised to find they fit her perfectly.  Looking at herself in the mirror, she looked even more childish.  This outfit wasn't far off from a school girl's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a cutie\" Julie said, admiring Melanie in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie looks at herself one more time.  Is she happy with how she looks?</span></div></div>",

'Did she honestly think I was going to wear clothes more suitable for someone her age?'  Melanie shook her head.  Whatever game that sales woman was playing, she was done being a part of it.

Magic doesn't exist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Look in the mirror.  Do you notice anything different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie turned back to the mirror.  She looked at herself.  Obviously her clothes didn't fit.  But once she looked harder, she realized something else.  Julie was standing behind her, so she could see her reflection.  Before, Melanie had stood a good 4 inches taller than Julie.  But now, their reflections were almost the same height, if anything, Julie might be just a hair taller!  And Melanie's proportions had changed.  Her chest was no longer as full, it looked now to be more of an A cup.  Her hips and butt were a little narrower.  And her body looked less toned then before.  If Melanie didn't know any better, she'd say the girl in the reflection was a teenager!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?  I look like I'm your age!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you probably are.  The clothes in this store are magic.  Instead of having to find clothes that fit your size or style, the clothes in the store change you to fit them.  If you touch an outfit that is a different style than you wear, you'll find yourself changing to fit that style.  It works the same way with age, if you touch a piece of clothing belonging to a certain age group, your body will change to fit that age group.  Since the jumper I handed you was meant for a girl my age, by touching it, the magic changed your body to fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's outrageous!\" Melanie yelled, stomping her foot.  \"I don't believe in magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how do you explain your reflection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie looked, but she had no explanation.  There was no denying it, she looked like a teenage version of herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do I undo the change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't for 24 hours.  After that, if you put back on what you were wearing before you changed, you will change back to what you were like before.  But if you don't change back after a week, reality will adjust and it will be like you have always been like you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie's head was spinning.  She was stuck as a teenager for 24 hours?  And if, for some reason, she didn't change back into her old clothes in a week, she'd be stuck growing up all over again?  This was madness.  But she couldn't deny the proof in front of her eyes.  Julie looked down at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I tricked you into touching the jumper.  I just thought it might be fun to see what would happen.  You were going to change based on whatever you touched anyway, I just figured I'd pick for you instead of you doing it without knowing it.  But that was wrong, you should have picked whatever you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, although I'm not sure that would have been any better.  So what do I do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since I got you into this mess, I'll try to help.  You'll need some clothes that fit. You can put back on the outfit from before.  You're already stuck like this for 24 hours, so wearing it won't make the time any longer, but it might change you even more to fit what it thinks you should look like.  Or you can try running out of here in your current clothes, but I'm not sure how far you'll get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll go back to the jumper for now\" Melanie said.  She took off her top and skirt, then blushed at her reflection.  Her bra and panties no longer fit as well.  Julie looked in the mirror and noticed the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet we have something that fits you, I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie returned in a moment with a white cotton bra and plain cotton panties.  Melanie was disappointed as she slipped them on.  The didn't feel as comfortable as her silk undies she had been wearing, instead they felt like what she wore during her teen years when she just crossed the cusp of womanhood.  Which, she supposed, was probably only a few months ago for her body now.  She then dressed again in the jumper, socks, and shoes.  Now no one would take her for anything but a teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do now?  I can't go home like this.  I probably can't even drive without getting pulled over for being too young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.  Why don't you spend the afternoon with me!  I'll close up the store, we can go to lunch, shop, and do a girl's day.  Who knows, maybe you'll even have a little fun reliving some of your youth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Melanie agree?</span></div></div>",

But now she had a pink vinyl strapped purse that someone her new age would have.  She looked inside.  Her credit cards and phone were gone.  Instead she had an id that showed her as 16, a tampon, lip gloss, makeup, bubblegum, a pink flip phone, and a small wad of cash.  Julie snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your fabulous bag didn't match your outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls walked out of the store.

She usually felt her hair bounce around her shoulders when she walked, but now that feeling was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... something happened...\" Melanie said.  She stopped walking and reached into her new purse.  She pulled out a compact and flipped open the mirror.  She practically screamed in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssshhhh!  People will notice\" Julie said in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my hair!  Oh, look at my hair!\" Melanie sobbed.  Her near shoulder length brown hair hand changed.  Before she had it long, and it was full and bouncy.  Now her hair was much shorter.  It was combed back but only came down to her earlobes.  Much of the volume was gone, and her ears now stuck out instead of being covered.  Plus now she had bangs cut straight across her forehead.  Once again, the change was much more childish than before.  Her earrings were different too.  Before, she had a pair of small silver hoops in each ear, as well as a stud at the top of each.  Now she only had one earring per ear, a pair of pink flowers.  She also noticed her makeup was different.  Before, she had worn a bit of lipstick and some foundation.  Now she was wearing glossy bright pink lipstick, her cheeks had a pink hue, and her eyes had glittery blue eyeshadow.  It was applied in an amount only a teenage girl would think appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Melanie, you are the cutest!\" Julie said, clapping her hands in punctuation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I guess\" Melanie said without enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on BFF, let's go get some lunch!\"  Julie put her arm around Melanie and together they strolled to the food court.  The girls ordered salads and sweet teas.  As they ate, Melanie found herself enjoying gossiping with Julie about school, boys, celebrities, and all the things she used to talk about in high school.  Once they finished, what did they decide to do next?</span></div></div>",

She didn't understand.  Becca was her friend, but here she was treating her like she was her older sister.  What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does she need to pay for anything?\" Becca asked Julie, who had walked out behind Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ummm, no.  She was just trying on some clothes, but she wasn't quite grown enough to fit them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like you Melanie, always trying to act older than you are.  I keep telling you, enjoy being a teen.  You'll miss it when you're older.  Now come on, we have to get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was so confused by everything happening to her that she meekly allowed Becca to lead her out of the store.  After walking out toward the entrance doors for the mall, Melanie finally took some initiative and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becca.  It's me, Melanie.  Why are you treating me like some kid?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Melanie, I didn't mean to be so overbearing.  We just need to get going so we can pick up Ted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie brightened when she heard that.  Her boyfriend Ted!  If anyone could help, it would be him.  She got a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't you go smiling about Ted like that.  How many times do we have to have this conversation sis.  Ted is my boyfriend.  I know you have a crush on him, but he's 10 years older than you.  You really need to find a boy your own age.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was heartbroken.  Whatever craziness was going on, it wasn't bad enough that she had to be sixteen again.  Now her best friend was her older sister, and worst of all, her boyfriend was now Becca's boyfriend!  Melanie felt on the verge of tears.  What did she do?</span></div></div>",

Melanie had been too young to grow up with 80s fashion, she only knew of it from pictures, tv, movies, and the internet.  She laughed at the jacket.  It might make a good part of a costume for an 80's party, but it wasn't something she would wear other than that.  She wasn't even sure why she had picked it out.  She thought about putting it back, but for some reason felt that she just had to try it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found her way to a dressing room and slipped the jacked on over her blue tank top.

But when she went to put it back, she couldn't find the hanger.  That was weird.  She could have sworn it was right here, but she looked and looked, but couldn't find it.  She thought she should ask a store employee.  But as she walked up front, her mind grew foggy.  She couldn't remember what she was going to do.  Melanie looked around.  Why was she still in this store?  She had decided not to buy anything.  With that thought in mind, she walked out and back into the main mall hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a few stores away when she realized with a shock that she was still wearing the jean jacket.  Had she just walked out with it?  Why hadn't anyone stopped her?  She was confused, but thought that if she took it back and explained she hadn't realized what she was doing, maybe they wouldn't press charges.  She turned around just in time to hear someone whistle at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice clothes baby!  Hot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around.  Who had said that?  But whoever it was had melted into the crowd of shoppers streaming by.  Melanie blushed at the compliment, but wasn't sure why she deserved it.  After all, she thought as she looked down, she was only wearing a tank top and skirt with this silly jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what greeted Melanie's eyes was not what she was expecting.  Her clothes were completely different than she remembered.  Gone was the tank top and skirt.  Now Melanie was wearing a tight black t-shirt that somehow clung tightly to her chest and still managed to show off her taut tummy.  The t-shirt had a giant pair of red lips puckering up on the front, but the lips were done in that cheap sparkly material popular back in the 80s.  Her plain white skirt had become a quilted red miniskirt that hung just to her knees.  On her legs she now wore a pair of knee socks that alternated stripes of neon green, pink, and black, and she was wearing high-healed leather ankle boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?!\" Melanie said out loud.  How could she be wearing different clothes?  And why were they all straight out of the 80s?  Something strange was going on.  Could it have to do with this jacket?  Things had been weird ever since she tried it on.  Melanie started walking back to the store to return it.  But did she make it?</span></div></div>",

But as she looked down the crowded mall hallway, her eyes caught a glimpse of a familiar face.  It was her friend Becca!  Melanie was mortified at the thought of being seen by her friend in this tacky outfit, so before Becca could notice her, she ducked into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was safely inside, Melanie let out a sight of relief.  'Great,' she thought.  'I avoided Becca, but now I have no idea if she'll still be out there.  Well, while I wait I might as well use the bathroom.'  Melanie picked a stall and stepped inside.  While she was doing her business, her head started itching.  She reached up to scratch and noticed that her hair felt funny.  'I wonder what is going on?' she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whatever she thought, nothing could have prepared for what she saw in the mirror when she stepped out of the stall.  Melanie had brown hair that she wore straight and shoulder length.  But when she looked in the mirror, there wasn't a brown hair to be seen.  Melanie turned her head, admiring herself from every angle.  There was no doubt about it, she was 100% blonde.  And her hairstyle was completely different.  Her hair was no longer straight, it was permed to give it just a bit of curl, although the result was really just a case of frizzy big hair.  She also had big bangs, which she had never had before.  Her hair looked like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://carrotsncake.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/851717cd9e77_6DFC/80s_bangs.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://carrotsncake.com/wp-content/uploa...</a>  She reached her hand up to feel it, and understood why it felt so different.  She also noticed her fingernails were now painted bright pink, and she was wearing 4 bracelets on each wrist.  She also had on a pair of dangly plastic earrings.  Her makeup had also changed.  Now she had on more obviously lipstick, dark eyeliner, and green eyeshadow.  Before Melanie could be too confused about her changes, a strange thought came over her.  She looked at herself in the mirror and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look, like, totally hot!\" she said to no one in particular.  In her mind, she looked good and she knew it.  All thoughts of what she looked like before, or that she looked completely out of place in 2012 were gone.  She even completely forgot about Becca being outside.  All she could think about was how good she looked and how she wanted other people to see her looking this good.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie walked out of the bathroom and back into the mall hallway.  Right into the path of the oncoming Becca.  What happened?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melanie fell to the ground, pulling a black suit jacket and pants down with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch\" she muttered, rubbing her butt.  She looked around.  At least no one saw her fall, she could be thankful for that.  She shifted weight to get back up when she caught movement out of the corner of her eye.  She turned toward the suit that had fallen with her, only to see the jacket flying up in the air.  It was flying right at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" she said, scooting backwards on her hands and legs.  The jacket zipped over to Melanie, and to her great shock, began trying to slip itself on to her.  Melanie fought back in fear and confusion.  She tried to move her arms out of the way, but the jacket floated around following her arms.  As soon as it had lined up a sleeve opening with one of her arms, it shot to her, forcing her arm down the right sleeve.  Melanie grabbed at the jacket, trying to pull it off.  This proved to be a mistake, because it brought her other arm close to the other sleeve.  The jacket tried forcing her other arm into the sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was pulling with all her might, fighting off the jacket when she felt something touch her legs.  She looked down in horror to see the pair of paints crawling up to her, slipping her legs into itself.  Melanie's distraction proved her undoing in the fight with the jacket, it forced her other arm in the sleeve and clung to her.  Melanie no longer paid attention to the jacket, she was too busy reaching down and grabbing the pants.  Both her legs were already inside, and the waist had crept up to her knees.  She grabbed the waist and tried to pull down, but the pants wouldn't budge.  Unfortunately for her, lying down, she couldn't get any leverage.  Finally she realized she had to stand up.  But as she did so, the pants shot up and pulled themselves all the way up, even over her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie stood and tried to tug the pants down, but they wouldn't budge.  It was like they were glued on.  She jumped up and down, pulled, and tried everything, but nothing she could do would move the pants.  Then something even stranger happened.  She felt movement inside the pants, around her waist.  She managed to pull the pants waist out enough to look beneath, and what she saw made no sense.  The skirt she had been wearing had vanished!  Now the pants just covered underwear.  But the underwear wasn't the pair of silk panties she had been wearing, it was a a pair of cotton men's boxers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie didn't have time to contemplate the bizarre changes before she felt her shirt start to move.  As she looked, beneath the jacket her top became a starched white men's shirt, and a tie formed out of nowhere.  She felt the fabric of the shirt against her skin and glanced beneath the collar to confirm that she was no longer wearing a bra.  It was then she noticed that she no longer felt her hair against her neck and shoulders.  Melanie ran to a mirror on a nearby wall and couldn't believe her eyes.  Her reflection showed her wearing the men's clothes, but that wasn't all.  Her brown hair was now short!  Instead of reaching down to her shoulders, it was cut in a traditional men's business style.  She had about two inches of hair on top, parted to the side, and the side and back of her hair was buzzed to maybe an inch.  Her ears stuck out from her head without any hair to cover them.  Melanie also noticed that her jewelery (the earrings and necklace she had been wearing) and all of her makeup were gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie screamed out loud.  What happened next?</span></div></div>",
