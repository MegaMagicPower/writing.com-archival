Grinning, you move around a little, getting a feel for things. Nothing's really different than before, aside from you being smaller. Everything still seems familiar to you too, which is odd. It's as if you've lived here your entire life. You decide it's probably best you head into the city and try and find someone that can help you. <i>Now that I think about it, I've got no where to live...</i> Pushing that thought aside for now, you begin to circle the walls of Konoha, finally coming upon the gate entrance. To your surprise, the guard lets you in without question, giving you a friendly smile to boot. You're completely confused now, it definetely seems like you've been here all your life. But you couldn't have been right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city always seemed so cool in the show, and it's even more so in person. The streets are brimming with activity. Vendors are crying their wares, children are running around, busy mothers are hard at work cooking for their loved ones. It's heart warming, seeing the community so closely knit together like this. You begin exploring the city, not caring where you go. After all, you really don't have anywhere to go anyways. You pass over some bridges and start to head into a part of the city you've never seen in the show before. It's a little run-down, almost like a shanty town. You get an uneasy feeling and want to turn back. As you do so, two older men come out of their homes and start coming towards you, they have evil grins on their face. You then realize you have a small sack of money tied to your pants, and they want it. Freightened, you turn around and begin running deeper into the slums, desperately trying to get away from the two men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run until you feel like you're going to collapse, it's no use. You recognize the area you are in now, you've been running in circles the entire time. The two men are coming closer now, it's only a matter of time until they get what they're after. Closing your eyes, you tense up and wait for the inevitable to come...Then something unexpected happens. You hear a loud crashing noise, followed by one of the men grunting and another crash. Something's happening, and you're too afraid to open your eyes to see what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" a voice asks you. Hesitantly, you open your eyes and come face to face with...</span></div></div>",

You're now face to face with whom you consider one of your heroes (even if he is a cartoon character.) and you're speechless. He thinks you're scared stiff, and in the typical Naruto-fashion he flicks your forehead to get your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" he repeats, smiling a little uneasily at you. \"What are you doing here, this place is off limits you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...Sorry.\" You stammer out, taking surprise at your new voice. You sound much younger too, apparently puberty has yet to hit this cartoon body. Coming to your senses, you finally take the chance to see what happend a moment ago, and you can't help but smile. Both men are now tied to a light post, their heads slightly swollen from being hit a few times. \"Ouch...did you have to be so rough on them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They deserved it. Creeps trying to steal a kids money.\" Naruto mumbled, looking at them with clear disgust. \"Anyways, we gotta get out of here before Iruka-Sensei finds us. He'll go crazy if he sees us here, come on!\" Without waiting for a response, he grabs your arm and begins running back towards the entrance of the shanty town. You don't notice at first, but you two are running very fast with little effort. You're glad that cartoons aren't realistic, any human running like this would fall down dead by now. He seems to know the area well, and soon you two are back at the town square. <br>\r\n\"What were you thinking going in there like that?\" he asks, letting go of your arm and folding his arms across his chest. He's trying to be serious, but you can't help but smile at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got lost...sorry.\" You reply in your new voice, still trying to get used to it. \"Am I in trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's facade ends and his face lights up, he's now the hyperactive ninja you know and love. \"Nah, I'm just messing with ya!\" he exclaims, slapping you on the back playfully. \"Now come on, I think Kakashi-Sensei's got a mission for us!\" Eager as always, he starts to walk off without waiting for his company. Do you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your skin has tanned quite a lot even though you've been outside for all of two minutes. Your hair has changed to a lighter brown and is spiked up all over the place, looks a lot like bed-hair. Those aren't what get your attention though. What does is the fact that your eyes are now red. It's a little creepy and you decide to look away. You're in a completely new world, apparently in a new body, and you have no idea what to do. Well, a good place to start would be to head into the village and try and find some help. Following the wall, you soon find the front gates. To your surprise, you spot a familiar face at the gates. It's none other than the somewhat pervy and mysterious Kakashi-Sensei. You're too nervous to approach him, but he sees you and sets his book away in his satchel then starts making his way to you. Sighing, you look down and try to pretend he's not there, which obviously doesn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you be out doing a mission or something?\" he asks in a bored tone, clearly not wanting to be there any more than you are. You look at him slowly and shrug, not too sure what you're supposed to be doing. He closes his eye and shakes his head, mumbling something about 'juveniles' under his breath. \"Right...Well, I'm supposed to be on guard duty, but I'll be relieved of it soon anyways. Come with me, we need to find out what squad you're in.\" Do you...</span></div></div>",

Following him through the city, you finally get to get a good look at the hyperactive ninja's hometown looks like. It's big, much bigger than you expected, and absolutely crowded. There are stalls everywhere, kids running around, people moving about with crates and carts, yet it's oddly welcoming to you. There is a clear sense of hospility in the city, something not known too well in your actual home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear me?\" Kakashi asks, breaking your line of thought. You shake your head and blush a little, not having realized you had zoned out like that. He sighs then takes out his book and begins to read it, or look at the pictures, you don't really know what he uses it for. \"I asked you what your name is. It'll be easier to find what squad you're in if I have your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to think to yourself what your name could be. At first, nothing comes to mind.

Everyone at school had been extremely loud as usual, your home now seemed like a God-Send to you. Even better, your family has gone to visit your grandparents for the weekend, leaving the house to you. After washing up, you head downstairs and collapse on the couch and start channel surfing. You finally come across your favorite cartoon Naruto. It's a new season and you're excited, dinner can wait for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe episode is almost half over, and you're almost half asleep. You hadn't realized how tired you were before, it must have crept up on you. Your eyelids begin to close despite your attempts to resist, and soon you're dozing off to sleep. Something doesn't feel right though. As you fall to sleep, you feel as though you are floating through the air. You wake with a start, or at least you think you do, everything is pitch black. You try to speak, but nothing comes out. Your heart starts punding sporadically, you wonder if you're dead. Then, out of nowhere, a bright light blinds you, forcing you to fold your arms over your eyes to protect them. When the light fades, your environment has completely changed. You're in a forest now. You're not sure where, but it seems oddly familiar. It's somewhat open, so you take a look around to try and get a sense of where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No way... </i>You think in disbeleif. You turn around and come face to face with something you have only dreamed of. Standing high above you are the walls of Konoha, an awe-inspiring sight. Thinking it's only a dream, you slowly walk up to the walls and cautiously place your hand on it. It's cold and hard to the touch...It's real! Somehow...you're no longer in the world you once knew. You are now in the world of Naruto.<br>\r\n</td>",
