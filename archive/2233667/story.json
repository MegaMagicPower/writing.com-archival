Be you a simple school football team, a small local shop, or a massive corporation, you have a brand that everyone knows you by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome brands are bigger than others. Sometimes, it's hard to get your brand recognized in the sea of different faces. How do you get your brand to stand out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMascots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore specifically, Living Mascots. Every since they began appearing, connecting themselves to brands, suddenly businesses with them were getting much more attention. No one knew how or when it started, but suddenly businesses and organizations would have sexy characters helping to advertise their products or services, beings who were like living cartoons that wanted nothing more than to help the brand thrive and grow and to make people happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany assumed these mascots just sprang up from nowhere, but some knew that these weren't just ordinary characters; they had once been regular people, just like you or I. A homeless man off the street, a loner in his apartment, a passionate worker, sometimes even the business owner themselves. Anyone could suddenly transform into the new face of a brand with a new identity, and no one would question it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, the phenomenon was going to happen again. Someone was going to become a Living Mascot... but who?</span></div></div>",

Honestly, he'd never tried this brand before, as it was relatively new, and on top of that, he wasn't usually a cereal type of guy. But, his room mate had bought it, he didn't feel like making anything else for breakfast, and it was sitting right there at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down and took his first spoonful, noting the lean yet athletic panther man on the box. Pete chuckled, wondering if there was already porn of this character. He'd been online enough to know what the internet did to animal characters like this; drawing them with huge cocks and muscles, or shipping them with other, similar characters, or even genderbending them and giving them huge tits. He found the whole thing kind of funny, in a disturbing kind of way. Shaking his head and brushing some of his wavy black hair out of his eyes, he looked at the mascot again as he took another bite. He had to admit, he admired her figure: That wavy hair, those head-sized breasts, the sexy cock of her hip as she stared out with seductive yellow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggled to himself as he lifted his spoon again, only to accidentally spill some of his milk onto his cleavage, feeling the cold liquid sliding down between his round tits. \"Oh, shoot!\" he bemoaned in a heightened tone, jumping up to grab a paper towel, wide hips swaying instinctively as he moved. Quickly, Pete had it cleaned up and gave his titties a shake, purring as he palmed them. \"There we go, girls~...\" With a strut, he returned to his seat, scratching the dark fur on her neck before lifting up the bowl to drink the rest of her sweet, chocolatey cereal milk. Her long, puffy tail swayed happily as she savored the flavor of her treat, one hand on the bowl and the other slipping between her legs to rub at her hot kitten. She didn't know why eating her favorite food, the cereal she represented, made her so horny, but she certainly didn't complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela Panther stood up, stretching out her naked, furry body with a yawn. Then she smiled, knowing that today was going to be another great day of being a cereal mascot. The tall, busty panther licked her lips, as...</span></div></div>",

Well, it is breakfast time I suppose!\" she mused to herself with a smile. For Pamela's job, outside of appearing in commercials and promotional events, was to go out and spread the good word of her Panther Puff cereal, able to sense whenever a good opportunity to do so occurred. And somewhere, someone was in need of a bit of encouragement...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tired young college student was standing in an empty grocery store aisle, staring at two boxes of cereal with sleep deprived eyes, weighing his options. He needed cereal, but they didn't have his usual kind, so he had to find something else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pst! Hey!\" he heard a woman's voice call to him from somewhere. He looked around, only to hear it again. \"Down here! On the box, sugar!\" Then he looked down, spotting a box of Panther Puff cereal... with the cartoon mascot staring right at him, waving like an animated picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pamela Panther?\" he asked, bewildered. The cartoon image giggled and gestured for him to come closer. He picked up the box as Pamela gave him a flirty pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why bother with those other brands when you could have the sweet, chocolatey goodness of my Panther Puffs?\" she asked, accentuating her chest while giving him lidded eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well I uh, I don't really like chocolate cereals, and I'm trying to cut back on sugar, so-\" Suddenly, the box began to vibrate in his hands. The top popped open, a black, furry pawed hand reaching out. Then came Pamela's head and other arm, rising out from the box. He watched as her impressive rack got stuck in the lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woops! Keep forgetting how tight a squeeze these can be! One sec darling!\" With a grunt, she managed to get her boobs through, bouncing right in front of him as she kept pulling herself out of the box in his hands. She got stuck again when her hips went through, only to pop out and jump up into the air. He watched her backflip away from him, tail brushing his face briefly, before landing in front of him with a bow, the box sealing itself up and returning to normal afterwards. \"There! Now we can talk face to face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man blushed, having never seen a mascot up close before. She was... amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up to her full height, being a good head taller than him. \"Now then, are you sure you don't want some Panther Puffs? I can vouch that it's my personal favorite cereal, and I don't say that because I'm biased.\" She got close and leaned in to whisper in his ear, breasts pressing against him. \"Panther Puffs turn me on whenever I eat them... nothing gets me hotter... and, if someone has some and mentions wanting to share them with someone... well... let's just say that I'm happy to make an appearance, whenever Puffs are involved~...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone made it clear what she meant, and the man was blushing heavily. Without a word, he grabbed two more boxes of Panther Puffs from the shelf to join the one he was already holding. She smiled and licked her lips. \"Good boy~... I get the feeling I'll be seeing you later today! But first...\" She felt her fur bristle again. \"I'm needed elsewhere!\" And with a snap of her fingers, she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, I'm not sure if we should keep buying these Panther Puffs. I'm worried that they aren't good for you!\" a mother said to her young daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom! I love Panther Puffs! They're super yummy, and Pamela Panther says they help you grow up big and strong!\" the girl retorted, having just poured herself a bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on cue, before the mother could respond, Pamela strutted into the room, having appeared in their home out of thin air, as mascots are wont to do. \"That's right, sugar! Panther Puffs are packed with the nutrients needed to help little girls grow up to be as beautiful as me!\" She struck a provocative pose, which the mother seemed to take no offense to, instead considering what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you really promise that it's good for her?\" the concerned mother asked as her daughter took a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See for yourself!\" Pamela said, gesturing to the daughter while working a bit of mascot magic. Suddenly, with every bite, the girl began to grow and age, moaning in delight at the flavor of the cereal and the sensation of maturing rapidly. By the time she finished the bowl, she was a perfectly healthy young adult woman with a sexy figure that was closer to Pamela's than her own mother's modest body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! I'm all grown up now! Thanks, Pamela!\" the daughter giggled, striking a pose of her own in her stretched out outfit. They all knew that this was only temporary, but it was nice to have fun with it while it lasted. The mother looked at her daughter with a blush, then looked at the box of Panther Puffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I suppose it can't hurt at least.\" Pamela smiled, her work here done. Though, she had the distinct feeling she could have a bit more fun here before she left...</span></div></div>",

The young girl turned to Pamela, worried... \"T-This is only temporary... right?\" she frantically asked the mascot. Her mother giggled and gave her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know sweetie! I kinda like this!!!\" she chirped, holding her daughter's face between her newly inflated breasts.

She was going to be late for her big promotional event! Jumping up and spinning around in a blur, she cartoonishly changed from nude to clothed in an instant, wearing a tight t-shirt with her brand logo on it along with a revealing bikini bottom. \"Perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she ran out the door of her apartment, immediately coming out into the field where her event was being held through some form of teleportation. The organizers of the event didn't bat an eye at this, used to her cartoonish antics by now as she wiped the sweat from her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! Made it just in time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The puffs again, Miss Panther?\" an aide casually asked while walking past her. Without waiting for an answer, she directed Pamela to the stage. \"You're on in five. You know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela chuckled and saluted, earning a smile and a head shake from the aide as she strutted her way to the stage set up in the large park. Lights and cameras were prepped for her, a crowd of fans was gathered to see her announcement up front, and she was excited to get this promotion started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela stepped out in front of everyone, waving and beaming out as the crowd cheered for her. \"Good morning, everyone! Hope you've all had a delicious breakfast of Panther Puff cereal today, because I want you hyped up for what I've got to share with you today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, looking out over them. Thirsty men who loved her body, young women who admired her and wanted to be like her, families with children who thought she was cool and loved her cereal. So many people here to see her, and so many more who would be seeing this in commercials later. It warmed her heart to know she meant so much to so many people. With that in mind, she continued, knowing that she was about to feel all of their love and support in a big way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, a lot of people buy Panther Puffs every day! I could spit out a big number for you darlings, but how much would that really mean to you? Well, we've come up with a fun way to visualize just how much we sell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused again, then continued. \"Starting right at the end of this speech and going on for exactly one week, for every box of Panther Puff cereal sold, I will grow half an inch taller, as well as gaining a small amount of mass to my breasts and rear. That's not much for just one box, but for the number that people buy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't elaborate, letting the crowd murmur in wonder and anticipation. \"In order to avoid damage, I'll be staying in this park for the entirety of this event. You all are free to come and visit me as much as you'd like during this time. I'd love to have you darling little sugars keeping me company when I'm all alone out here~!\" She gave a flirty pose and a wink, earning a round of cheers from her adoring audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! That's all I have to say! Now, let's begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the event was started. And already, Pamela could feel herself stretching a little taller, a few boxes happening to be bought right at that moment. She was excited; for every 24 boxes was a foot, every 72 a yard, and if she were to hit 126,720, that would be a mile. And while her brand wasn't the biggest, she knew that she sold a LOT of boxes nation wide... She had a feeling this park wouldn't be enough to contain her. She couldn't wait to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(For reference, Honey Nut Cheerios, the most popular brand of cereal, reportedly sells about 2.7 billion per year. That averages to about 7.4 million per day.)</span></div></div>",

It was easy work for her anyway, since she didn't get tired and since she had already gained a few feet in height, standing at over eight feet right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked, the aide from earlier (Julia, Pamela though her name was) came over holding a clipboard. She adjusted her glasses and cleared her throat before speaking in a worried, somewhat stern tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Panther, are you sure this is the best idea? You know how many boxes we sell in a week. And with this being a publicized event...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela rolled her eyes with a playful smile. \"Oh, come on! You people already talked me down from doing one inch per box. You want me to go even lower than that? 'One tenth of an inch' just doesn't have the same ring to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Panther, please,\" the aide sighed. \"I know you've been looking forward to this, but we're predicting an immediate increase in sales as a response to this, especially if it manages to go viral.

How are you going to guarantee that everything will be fine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela shrugged happily, already grown to around ten feet over the course of the conversation. \"I'll figure it out as I go!

Smirking the massive mascot turned towards them, shivering at the massive size difference between her and them. \"What can I do for you, my darling little sugars?\" she purred, effortlessly rolling onto her tight toned muscular abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young men blushed at her attention, clearly they all had crushes on the Panther... or intense sexual attraction. Maybe now some of them were losing their nerve? Maybe they didn't expect her to be THIS big already? All these questions swam through the mascot's mind as her tail swayed as she looked down at them. Silence between the group pervaded before the young woman sighed, annoyed at this, and stepped forward. \"Seriously guys?\" she sniped as she stood before Pamela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These BOYS were wanting to ask you to do something kinky, Ms. Pamela.\" announced the young lady. A low rumble quaked through the ground as Pamela purred happily and chuckled. <br>\r\n\"Oh? So a special request?\" giggled the curvy mascot as she sat up. \"Something kinky eh? That's such an open... broad... request. Hmmmmm.... oh I know!!!\" she chuckled as she unclasped the bikini top, revealing her bare nipples to them. Her massive mammaries sent an intense amount of gasps and blushing through the young men, undoubtedly giving them all erections rather effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down boys! I haven't even done anything yet.\" she giggled as she leaned forward, pinching a nipple in her fingers. Brown, sweet smelling milk poured from her breast. \"Eh? How's that?\" she asked... before the young lady amongst them rushed forward to have a taste... taking all (even Pamela) by surprise. She continued to cup her hands and drink from the bountiful amount of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes this young fan began to transform. Fur began to cover her body, as her meager breasts began to inflate, and her height began to increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cindy?!\" exclaimed one of the boys, his concern for his friend, his affectionate crush, outweighing the rock-hard boner he was sporting.

Her thighs were thicc and she smelled of sweet sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, save for Kurt, the one who had had a crush on her, seemed confused by his words now too. \"Cindy?\" they asked him... \"You mean Catalina Crunch! She's here with Pamela promoting the newest cereal.\" The Panthress felt a sudden (but not unwelcome) surge in her height. \"And the more people buy of either type, Ms. Pamela grows more and more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt blushed, looking worried at his former friend. His memory wasn't effected by this change... he still remembered Cindy... and was worried she had forgotten about him. Little did he know, the Panthress was aware of this change too... and was a bit concerned about what she had done... she just wanted to give them a milk chocolatey drink from her massive tits. She certainly didn't mean to transform the girl into another mascot. She blushed as she looked at Catalina's perfectly shaped ass. The thought of licking and kissing those sexy buns, wondering if she tasted like cinnamon... filled the giant panther's mind... making her nipples noticeably harden from arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer concentration was broken when she heard the other boys jeering and teasing Kurt, who promptly stomped off in a huff. Should she try and defuse the situation? Will Catalina?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

The Franklin Ranch was home to a number of animals, including cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, and, of course, horses. Being the only real ranch in the area, the Franklins made a good amount of their money from tourism, people coming by and paying to be toured around the property, to pet the animals, and to even ride the horses. Naturally, they also had a lot of income come from their animal based products, but the tourism was what they were known for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for them, over time visitors became more scarce, and they found their products being harder and harder to sell as bigger factory farms could produce more for cheaper. They hoped it was just a rough patch, but as time wore on their savings began to dwindle further, worrying all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma Margret, the oldest in the family, was sad to see the business fairing like this, missing the old days when the ranch was in its prime. She wanted to be able to help her family run the place, but in her old age she wasn't as able to do anything to help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick, her son, hated that his mom had to see the ranch in this state under his supervision. He wanted to provide a comfortable life for his family, but with the way things were, they were struggling and stressed almost every day. His wife, Linda, was in a similar mindset, with the addition of worrying about her husband taking all the burden onto himself as the patriarch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, young Billy was worried about his home. What would happen to his family if they had to sell the ranch? What would happen to the animals, whom he cared deeply about? He worried for his mother and father, as well as his siblings, but as the youngest, there wasn't much he could do to help lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, one day, one of them changed. The ranch gained a Living Mascot, born from one of their desires to save the ranch. But which one, and what would they become?</span></div></div>",

She blamed herself more than the younger folk; she felt she hadn't done enough in her own time, and now that she was older, she couldn't do much to help everyone keep things running. She knew her son and his family were doing the best that they could, but she had to face facts that it just seemed no one really cared about coming out to ranches anymore...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Margret stood up, feeling a burst of energy and resolve. No! She refused to sit idly by as her family struggled! She walked without issue for the first time in years, her wrinkly skin tightening as her frail frame began to plump out a bit. She felt better than she had in a long time, and she was going to put herself to work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick noticed his mother coming out, and was about to ask what was wrong, when he noticed how much younger she looked now. She was still an older woman, but now it was in a more attractive, mature way. He blushed as he watched her breasts and ass swelling and firming up as her hips and thighs thickened out. He averted his gaze, trying not to think about how his mother was hotter than his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargie chuckled, noticing his embarrassment. She gave her hips a shake and one breast a squeeze, letting out a sensual moan. No man, not even her own son, could resist her fat udders, and she loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting to work moving hay bales, she huffed as she grabbed a large bundle with her bare hands, lifting it with ease as her muscles bulked up; not enough to really be visible beneath her plumper frame, but definitely enough to make her at least as strong as her son. After hauling a few bales, she patted her hands off, feeling her hoofed fingertips brushing together. She shook off her shoes to let her feet change into hooves, then let out a moo as she began loosening the rest of her clothing, which was becoming restricting on her further expanding figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick came into the cow barn a short time later, finding his mother hard at work with the cows. He chuckled a bit, blushing, knowing that they were her specialty. She did have a special connection with them, after all. She stood, finished milking them, and then turned to Patrick with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pat, dear? Ya mind givin' yer ma a milkin'? Mah udders are feelin' powerfully full this mornin'...\" she said in a low, breathy voice, sitting back on a stool and hefting a breast for him to see. The heavy round orb was over twice the size of his head, with a thick nipple that he knew from experience he could barely fit his mouth around. He came forward, grabbing the milker and began pumping her tits, massaging them lovingly as he sucked the milk out for bottling. \"Be sure ya don't waste a drop now, y'hear? That's our best sellin' product!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick silently nodded, admiring his mother's figure, as no matter how many times he looked at her, he thought she was the most beautiful thing imaginable. Seven feet tall and voluptuous, she was like a living fertility goddess with how gifted her assets were, sporting a chubby hourglass figure. And then there were her bovine traits; her beautiful muzzle, her smooth horns, her adorable tail, the spot pattern in her fur... he was definitely a momma's boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... such a good li'l calf... mama should give her li'l calf a reward for bein' so good to his ma~...\" she mooed, leaning in and licking his cheek affectionately. He blushed, erection growing in his overalls. How lucky he was to have a sexy mascot for a mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you two!\" Linda called out, smiling at the scene she walked in on. \"There'll be time for rolling in the hay later! We've got guests to entertain right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargie Moo huffed, hands on her hips as she stood up. \"Ah, shoot, that time already? Well, mah audience demands me! We'll pick this up later, hun!\" She gave her son a hip check before strutting out to greet the fine folk who traveled out here just to see her. She smiled. Life on the ranch was good.</span></div></div>",

He watched as various individuals, the collective term was 'Mascots', walked, lived, and worked around him. Tessa the Traffic Safety Raccoon helped some elementary school soccer players cross the street as they headed home after practice. Her shapely body, adorned with a large orange 'poncho' draped across her massive cleavage. The words 'STOP' were displayed upon her chest so everyone could see her. Nobody batted an eye as they went about their business, seemingly oblivious to the fact that Tessa used to be the old safety patrol lady, Ms. Bowden, before this bizarre... spate of transformations began to occur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron remembered Ms. Bowden from his own days at grade school, she was this seemingly permanent part of the school for as long as he could remember. She was nearing her sixties, and considering retiring, when... well... she became Tessa. And it's been like this for a few weeks now. People around town suddenly transforming into anthropomorphic, and highly sexualized, mascots... and nobody seemingly noticing this change.. besides himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Chuggins McGrady, the mascot for 'Chill-axe Beer', hanging out in front of the local liquor store. A literal talking 'Beer Can', Well, a beer can humanoid dressed in a Hawaiian shirt, swim trunks and sunglasses (for some god awful reason) who talked with a 'hip' and 'cool' party attitude that somehow endeared him to some customers. Cameron once knew him as Bill Treadmore, the lonely gas station attendant. He just hoped Bill wasn't so lonely anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could rattle off a whole litany of people effected by this 'Mascot Syndrome', people only he seemed to remember. He passed by more of them as he got closer to home. Freeze-E Bear the Polar Bear, the curvy thicc mascot for a local (and now popular) ice cream specialty shop. She looked like a mixture of a Polar Bear and a Snowman.. err... woman. He didn't know the woman who this frosty femme used to be... all he knew was that she was once the owner. Now... she's something much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuddle B. Caterpillar, because apparently a Day-Care service needed a mascot. She was like someone, somehow, managed to crossbreed a cartoon caterpillar with a soft plush stuffed animal. While not as sexualized as many of her peers, (aside from her modest chest that wasn't nearly as massive as Freeze-E's or Tessa's) she was still quite a large individual. She was currently soothing and comforting a crying child, holding them against her soft marshmallow-y downy soft exterior. She used to be, presumably, one of the employees. Though who that was Cameron wouldn't know off the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameron had been so lost in thought, and observations, that he suddenly realized he was home. He waved at his neighbor Robin, a literal 'Reading Robin' for the local library as he entered his family's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he entered his house, Cameron felt a bizarre... sensation. A tingling feeling down his back, and there was a burning sensation in the back of his throat as he walked into the living room... and saw what looked like a....</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Based on a series of stories I've written over the years on various accounts about people turning into sexy mascot-esque characters.<br>\r\nOther stories, for reference: <br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/tmansl997/folder/221192/Living-Mascots\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/tmansl997/folder/221192/Living-Mascots</a><br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/tomsketchit/folder/404851/Living-Mascots/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.furaffinity.net/gallery/tomsketchit/folder/404851/Living-Mascots/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and then, a person will transform into a Living Mascot, seemingly at random. Most of the time, the affected person will be A) someone who would not be missed if they were to be gone, B) someone with an unfortunate life wishing for something better, and/or C) someone who wants more than anything to see a specific brand succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe affected will usually not be fully aware of their own transformation, mind typically changing to match the body. Their new mascot form will often be associated in some way with the brand they are connected to (a sports team mascot will be based on what the team is called, a cereal mascot will be a sexier version of their existing mascot, etc.) Mascots are always sexy and feminine, though not necessarily female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis transformation also has a strange affect on reality around them. Reality will be partially rewritten to make it feel like the mascot had existed for as long as the brand had. However, certain people will be aware that things have changed and may even remember the original person the mascot had been, usually people very close to the affected or people aware of the phenomenon. The mascot will even have some memory of who they used to be, but trying to remember this brings them distress, as they always seem to prefer their new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMascots are often cartoony and defy logic, able to do a number of strange things. This includes being able to temporarily or even permanently change certain people into assistants who are similar to themselves (such as a school mascot turning the cheer team into smaller copies of herself before a game, only to turn them back afterwards.) Also, mascots seem to have some sort of perception filter on them; no matter what they do, regardless of how strange or sexual it is, no one will take issue with the actions of a mascot. Even the most conservative of people will just accept it as the way things are and move on with their day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brand with a mascot will always be successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nENCOURAGED:<br>\r\nGrowth, expansion, transformation of various kinds, sex, soft vore (non-lethal), and, most importantly, story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOT ALLOWED: <br>\r\nGore, violence, snuff, toilet or slob fetishes, foot fetish, underage sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything not listed is potentially allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPut effort into your writing. This may be fetish stuff, but have some pride in your work, please. I may edit chapters for minor grammar and spelling changes if I feel the need to, as well as adding extra options to chapters with few of them (just because I can).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there is a path you want expanded upon but don't feel like writing, you're free to ask me to try and fill it out. I make no promises.</td>",
