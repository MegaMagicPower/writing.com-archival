It startles you a bit as it came out of nowhere, and since it's the only thing that's happening on this field, you fix your sight on it. It's so tiny, it's cartoonish! You'd think it could be some sort of remote controlled toy. It's pink, with bright yellow polka dots and blue little flowery dots coloring it. It drives past you at first but then it suddenly stops and turns around to where you are again. It makes a turn as it reaches you and it circles you for a couple of spins, then it finally stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car doors open...</span></div></div>",

Then you look around trying to figure how is all this happening. You're in the middle of a field, don't they use trap doors in the circus for this sort of thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that the figure that pops out of the car is female, a very silly looking whiteface clown woman in a purple and green doll dress with a motif of blue flowers all over it, with a huge set of corkscrew purple curls and a cute little blue bow sitting on top. She runs straight at you, beaming with a smile. You smile back as it can't be helped and say: \"Heh, hi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you notice more movement coming from the vehicle, another clown comes out, and it's another woman. This one an Auguste with red curls wearing a white doll dress with red polka dots all over it and a blue vest. Then another one, again female, whiteface with yellow curls this time, red doll dress. You couldn't help but notice this one b/c she looked...kinda huge. You figure there's always a really fat one on every group of clowns, this was no different...until you look at how she reaches for something in the car, and what pops out is another fat whitefaced woman, a little smaller than the first one, in a yellow doll dress and light blue curls. She popped out so suddenly that she hit her friend and they both comically fell down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approach, you turn around to talk to the clown that came out first, but instead you get in your face the Auguste girl staring at you with an exaggerated clown's grinning look on her face and she jumps up and down all giddy. The first clown has been doing the same, and their 2 fat friends join in with complete glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So cute! So cute!\" you hear.<br>\r\n\"Oh Cake, let's take him home right now! I just wanna eat him up!\"<br>\r\n\"He is such a hubby!\" <br>\r\n\"Oh Pollyanna, can we please please please please please pllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllease take him with us??\" you hear. And you instinctively freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, how adorable, absolutely!\" comes from behind you, it seemed on a normal tone. All the girls squeaked like clowns normally do, but this one didn't squeak, and you didn't hear any of them squeak that. That's when you feel it, a very soft silk fabric on your back. And arms wrap around you, fine gloved hand puts a handkerchief in your face. It doesn't cover your eyes, you get a look at who's doing this. Another clown woman, this one white, but as a blue Pierrot with a puffy duffel on her neck. This was scaring you to no end, but you saw as there was no malice as she was doing this. She looks at you with a very innocent smile. Her fiery red lips kiss you goodnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up...</span></div></div>",

There's that fat clown again right in your face, she forces on you a big fat comical cartoon kiss, huge waves of laughter respond to this. You can't move, your hands are tied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, whatever you're seating on bumps up. The clown falls back, landing on her back lifting her doll skirt revealing the big clown bloomers. The audience laughs hysterically and a spotlight is right on top of you, you discover you're at the center stage of a circus tied up to a pole sitting on a trapeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music then starts, the rest of the clown girls prance in holding items like combs, spray cans, hair driers, and even tool boxes. They coo at you and continue to prance and curtsy at the strangely mostly adult audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide your way up to stand and look around, then the Pierrot comes in and marches straight at you giggling and blowing you kisses, she's holding some kind of suit wrapped in plastic on a clothes hanger. The lights go out but you can still see what's happening, Pierrot joins you on the trapeze tossing the suit at one of her friends seemingly now standing by and faces you. Suddenly, your hands become free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPierrot kisses you. She simply dove her head into yours and kissed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shocked and ready to run, but suddenly, entranced. Your lips agree with hers. You slowly lift your arms and wrap them around her body, she does the same more confidently and romantically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a prolonged romantic kiss that goes on for a few minutes where you feel nothing but bliss. Until it stops. Your arms go down, you are still standing but you can't move your body. She's chuckling, reaching for a microphone. \"Hm hm well, that was sweet!\" - she says to you, she puts an arm over your frozen shoulders. \"But that was it! From here on out you'll be too busy making the world happy to have time for romance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights turn on. \"Llllllllladies and gentlemen! We will now treat you to the amazing and mysterious art of transformation! Behold!\" - with that, all the clowns lunged at you. Nobody in the audience can see what they're doing to you, how exactly they're using all their tools, and what will the result be. They get to find out first though, and they burst out in the biggest laughter you've ever had at your expense. Pierrot then gets a huge mirror and presents you with what you've been turned into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've become... </span></div></div>",

But then they overdo it, due to its length, it turns into a joke fast. You wake up, Pierrot is in front of you. She kissed you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" she says. \"We don't get many people here and we didn't want you to run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" you reply. \"It just freaked me out a bit. Didn't see you come out of that car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles a bit and steps away, walks off from your sight for a moment. As you are lying down you notice her costume is actually a bit more puffier and baggier than you thought, but she sure had an angel's face on her. And what a way to wake you up, you start thinking there's gonna be an awesome payoff the minute she takes that thing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he up, isheupisheupisheup!?\" you hear booming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah crap, this I'm not gonna like.\" you think as you suspect what's coming up next. And you were unfortunately right, four clowns walk in to your view. They were the group of ladies from before, and they were just as happy as earlier to see you. They go to you, one by one, and they all give you a big fat comical kisses the mouth. They introduce themselves as they do:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rhapsie The Clown!\" started the Auguste as she flew to your face and kissed you.<br>\r\n\"Velvet The Clown! And how are you today sweetkins??\" said the the first purple clown you had seen as she slowly zoomed in on you smiling and kissing you.<br>\r\n\"Cake, The Sweetest Clown Ever! MMMMMMMMUAHH!\" was the first fat clown, and as she now was giving you a mouthful of her fat clown breath, you've had enough. You tried to push her away, but your arms were restrained. You tried some kicking as you realized that and having Sweet Cake on your face but your legs were also restrained. There was no ending this. <br>\r\n\"Pudding is here!\" finished the last one. She seemed to behave a bit like a little kid, as a clown. She only pecks you with one kiss on your forehead and pokes and tickles you with much delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright alright. That was fun. Nice to meet you all. Now could you guys please get me off whatever I am? I can't move.\" you implore. You are kissed on the cheek, Pierrot was back. She giggles: \"What about me, jerk? I am Pollyanna.\" she says to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Pollyanna, now please, get me out of this.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Oh we just can't do that! You know how there's some clowns who'll do the exact opposite of what you tell them! We really love going for that type of act!\" Pollyanna explains. <br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll play along.\" you answer. \"Theh heh ah Hell, have your little fun, girls.\" no reason to panic you guess. They may be clowns, but that doesn't change the fact that you are restrained in a room full of women! Of course, things are going to get a little bit more complex than that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhapsie jumps at you with a hug and says to your just plain clueless face: \"Oh we will, baby! We will!\" She backs up lifting you and you get a clearer idea of where you are. Sitting in front of a rainbow colored theater make-up mirror on what seems to be a very cartoony clowns only dressing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls! Let's get started!\" said Pollyanna, all the clowns cheered on.<br>\r\n\"Brace yourself handsome...\" said Rhapsie as everyone including yourself looked at the mirror. \"Cuz we are going to make you into...\"</span></div></div>",

I'm down with that.\" you tell them feeling cool and ready for what you think it's a fun time role playing with these girls. \"I'm so happy to hear that.\" Pollyanna answers you \"We're going to make you into the most cutest and most adorable baby clown. It's going to be so fun. You're going to be a baby again, no more work, no more responsibilities. No more trying to act so mature and forget about scoring a good looking girlfriend, because you're going to be a baby again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, this clown is actually starting to make you feel hot. She looks at you very carefully, always smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get started. Repeat after me: Goo goo!\" she instructs you.<br>\r\n\"Goo goo!\" you do as she says.<br>\r\n\"Daa daa!\" she said then.<br>\r\n\"Daa daa!\" you repeat.<br>\r\n\"Boo boo!\" came next.<br>\r\n\"Boo boo!\" you're still with her.<br>\r\n\"Baa baa!\" came last.<br>\r\n\"Baa baa!\" but you could do this all day. And you will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we're done with that! Velvet, your turn!\" said Pollyanna after she had finished a small part of your transformation. Velvet was next, your make-up chair folds again and you're facing this clown lying down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have fun with Pollyanna sweetie??\" asked Velvet in her friendly clown tone.<br>\r\n\"Daa daa!\" you answer, this is fun! You're getting into it! But...you could've sworn you're not that deep into character, at least not yet. And you were really about to say \"Oh yeah girl, that left me so hard, please tell me you're gonna suck this off now!\" you naughty little boy. But still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baa baa! Daa daa, boo boo!\" you couldn't stop.<br>\r\n\"Okay, you little baby, Polly will play with you again later on! I promise!

You then feel a draft from top to bottom, your clothes are gone. And then you hear an electric shaver. Velvet walks up to you with it, it looks pink and as exaggerated and cartoony as the car you saw earlier. Of course earlier you also thought that was a toy but it wasn't, so maybe that also applied here. And it did, she passes it through your chest hair and it works like magic leaving it naked, the clown moved on to the hair on your legs and then she stopped at your crotch and shaved off all the hair around your balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, what's this little baby??\" Velvet asked pointing at the boner playing with Pollyanna had given you.<br>\r\n\"Goo goo?\" you...asked?<br>\r\n\"You're a little baby now! This is something big boys do!\" she explains to you. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry Velvet! As soon as your done we'll give the baby a bath and we'll fix that in a jiffy!\" you hear Pudding tell her.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I better hurry up then!\" she says and then the worse part came, she takes the electric shaver to the hair on your head.<br>\r\n\"Boo boo boo, daa, gaa gaa!\" you...demand her to stop, this is kinda going too far, you don't want a haircut right now! And if she leaves you bald like the rest of your body, how are you going to explain it to your friends? Speaking of which, how can you even explain to them anything if you keep talking baby gibberish? Something being off here is an understatement. You feel the shaver pounding on top of you, you see lots of your hair just flying off, and you just resign thinking they just need a bald clown real bad. Okay, let's just look past this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" said Velvet then she reached for something on the table where the make-up mirror sat \"And now for the fun part!\" she pats on your head, there actually seems to be some hair left, and she empties a bottle of what looks like shampoo on it and scrubs it good with it. Out of nowhere, you hear a faucet, and a hose comes up and Velvet rinses what's left of your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she passes a towel around it and reaches for a pink little lacy silk cloth and ties it on your hair. The seat is lifted, you look in the mirror and you are horrified at what the clown had done to you. What's left of your hair was just a small strand in the middle, in baby blue color with a cute little pink bow on top of it. You look so silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baa! Goo goo goo!\" means you freaked out, but that's the best we can make out.<br>\r\n\"Oh! He looks so cute! Velvet that's just perfect!\" said Pudding. <br>\r\n\"Ha ha, see what I can do?? And don't you just love it, little baby? You look much better now! And we're just getting warmed up!\" said Velvet in a really accomplished tone.<br>\r\n\"Baby clown voice, baby clown hair...Cake, are you ready with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Cake get to do for your transformation??</span></div></div>",

You instinctively ran, away from the mirror, away from these crazy clowns. A wig and some make up and a diaper would've been fun, but you somehow feel this game got too real with this embarrassing haircut. Two doors in front of you, you enter the nearest one, and you made a big mistake. It's the bathroom, and Cake was waiting for you with arms wide open. With no hesitation she gets a hold of you and gives you one of her big fat clown smooches in the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't you look even more delicious??\" she says to you as she tosses you into a bubble bath in a round tub that was inside a bathroom that looked as cartoony as the room you had just escaped from. The bubbles confuse you, you don't know where you landed. Then you feel Cake's grip again, and she lifts you up in the surface while holding a big puffy red sponge shaped like a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still now baby! This shouldn't take long to work!\" Cake said as she began to scrub every part of your body she could get a hold of. You attempt to struggle, but she's just so strong! As she scrubs she rinses and as she rinses, your skin gets more and more pale. This continues until you're literally snow white from it. Just when it looks like she's done, she gets a good grip on your mysteriously still erected penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, boy that Velvet sure wasn't lying!

She sits you down on the floor on top of a thick white blanket, she's about to diaper you with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay baby, this is going to be your diaper! And this is the pin that's going to hold it in place!\" Pudding shows you a very large and clown prop of a pin your big puffy diaper will be held on with, but that's not all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Mr. Joy! This is gonna make sure you're our little baby forever and ever!\" she now held to your sight what looked like a deflated yellow balloon, she started blowing air into it with her mouth, it looked like a tube with a very goofy smile as it took form! She grabs your boner and fits this tube balloon into it. You stand up feeling incredibly uneasy, something's happening, it's doing something. First it deflates, reshaping your penis into a deflated balloon! But then it inflates again, you're suddenly excited, as this balloon grows and the goofy smile comes up again you start feeling a jolt of pleasure and joy. This was Mr. Joy doing his work as your new penis, and this giant balloon was so much better making you feel as big as a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're smiling. You lie down looking up feeling elated, this is the best thing that's ever happened to you. But you fall on your diaper. \"Goo goo?\" you ask right away while looking down and all the pleasure on you had disappeared. Without noticing, Pudding had slipped it on you. She's sitting next to you giggling, and gives you a kiss in the cheek. You stand up again and look at the big puffy diaper while grabbing it. You try to rip it off, wondering if you can look again at your new endowment and why it's so well concealed by one goofy diaper, but the exaggerated pin seems to be holding everything in place like magic. You try to work with releasing the pin but you fall forward...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...into Rhapsie's arms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Rhapsie get to do for your transformation??</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are now in the hands of the playful Auguste clown Rhapsie. You almost fell to the floor by way of struggling with a big puffy diaper that was just placed on you, but this clown caught you in time. She's looking down on your body as it has gone through a rigorous baby clown transformation. Your skin has been bleached, you have a comical hairstyle, and you are in diapers. At this point, it's almost complete. Then as this one clown holds you, the music starts. It's a tune you might have heard before, a one-hit wonder from the past with a bit of an unsavory tone. But since the artists are no longer relevant and in this day and age it's harmless, nothing wrong with a bunch of clowns trying to be hip playing around with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, baby, baby <br>\r\nBaby, baby <br>\r\nOooh, baby, baby <br>\r\nBaby, baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Salt'n Pepa's \"Push it\". And as you recognized that song Rhapsie started to hop with a little rhythm. She's shaking you along and making a mock dance while holding your hands and coaxing you to dance. You don't seem to be in much control but you don't completely give in, much to this clowns delight, as she continues to move along with you through another end of the room. As this happens, the other clowns minus Pollyanna are watching and dancing and hopping to the song and all of them smiling as they look on at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay, we totally have a party going on here!\" says Rhapsie to you. \"Oh my clueless little baby, how do you like everything so far??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goo goo? Baa baa!\" you asked hoping it would be: \"What do you mean clueless? What have I gotten myself into!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it just fun to be a clown??\" asked you the female Auguste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daa daa! Daa daa!\" you don't know how but, you were actually agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, I'm pretty sure anyone who takes a look at you now will figure out in a heartbeat you're a clown, and a baby! As if the big silly diaper isn't gonna give it away! But still, it's actually not funny enough! The idea of you being a clown baby really needs to stick! You have to feel like one, inside...\" as she said this, she reached for your crotch and you felt Mr. Joy getting a little pump. This excites you feeling all sorts of bliss, and leaving you wide open for her surprise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and out!\" she pushes you back immediately into a portion of the room before 3 big mirrors. She's going to give you something to wear. She walks by wheeling in a rack of assorted clown dresses and costumes and pulls out a little number for you. A light blue one piece baby puffy romper, and as soon she hands it to you, you start putting it on as if you were required to. You don't know how, but in spite of all the weirdness, you are fully complying to this. You are in your mind under the obligation to put this on now, it\u2019s your job. As you settle both your feet into what seems to be built in booties, the costume smooths out through your bottom, hiding the big baggy diaper and the silly big pin with absolutely no signs that suggest that you might be wearing something like that and it fits itself into a firm clown shape. The sleeves of this romper are long with mittens and as you fit your hands in these you button yourself up. Rhapsie's smiling in front of you still humming \u201cPush it\u201d as it\u2019s still being played in the back while tying a big comical round bonnet the same color as your romper to your head, with frills at the edges, it's what hid your silly little haircut. She then went on to tie an exaggerated huge white bib that was part of the costume. It seems pretty frilly as well, but on the center it had blue comic letters that give you your newly earned title of BABY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now stand in front of these 3 mirrors fully suited, you are feeling an alien sense of accomplishment as you fitted yourself in this costume and you examine what an adorable little clown you had become so far, feeling also thankful about the trouble your new friends went through to make sure you are a very detailed caricature, inside and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it happens, the music stops, the other clowns disappear, and the lights go out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cGoo goo? Daa daa?\u201d you ask out to the dark. Suddenly, everyone is gone and it all went black. You look around without moving from where you stand, wondering what was going to happen now. You then notice that one mirror remained, it stood out in this darkness in a dark blue tone of color at the borders and plainly showing only your reflection in this darkness. You are standing out in this darkness as well, in a light baby blue color and the whiteness in your bib and your face. You transfix yourself at this reflection for a very prolonged moment, and without warning your mind starts racing with an embarrassment you should\u2019ve had moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the Hell is happening to me?! Why am I doing this?! Why am I dressed like this?! This isn\u2019t me! None of this is right! My face, my body\u2026my body! What have they done to me!?\u201d You are thinking this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaa goo daa daa!? Goo goo baa baa baa!? Boo boo! Boo!\u201d You are saying this. You begin to madly tug away at your bib and bonnet and romper in a fruitless effort to take it all off. It\u2019s not going to happen. And so you tire yourself out, you are pressing both your mittens against the remaining mirror and look straight at it.  As you look on, you are seriously embarrassed at what you\u2019ve become, and your cheeks begin to shine a little red. It\u2019s a round comical blush forming itself and settled as a new clown feature you had seemingly just done to yourself. Your eyes roll back and you fall down as you are seemingly about to pass out from all this happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fall was very cushy, you land on what looks like a long bright pink rug and your head was in a very soft white pillow. You look up to your front, everything is still dark except the mirror with your reflection and now these items. Although from where you are lying, you can\u2019t really see your reflection in the mirror. But all of a sudden you hear giggling, and a certain Pierrot clown jumps from out of the mirror. Pollyanna was with you again. And she landed right on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhho hoh ho ho, this is too much! Just look at you! I could eat you!\u201d she says to you overjoyed, pinching and tickling and pecking your face with kisses. Pinching at your comical new cheeks \u201cOh I just want to eat these cheeks! You little baby! You\u2019re our little baby now! And that little nose! Oh yes, oh yes..!\u201d and with that she places her mouth in your nose, and she gives it an innocent little gnaw. You then start feeling a little tickling sensation in your nose, which then bursts with a honking sound into a bright red clown nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeheheh, what do you think of that? You\u2019re definitely one of us. You\u2019re all clown now. Now brace yourself, because these are officially your last seconds as a big boy.\u201d and she drives her head into yours and gives you the biggest kiss of your life. Everything just stops in your mind for what seems like minutes as this goes on and on. You are freaked out beyond belief, you want to get up and leave running, but this clown has you. And you almost start feeling as though you also have her. Whatever comes next, you just hope it\u2019s all with her from here on. You\u2019ve just finally submit yourself, and you were about to feel the consequences for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips suddenly press themselves, almost backing away from yours, but you feel her teeth. You also feel something coming out of your mouth. It first feels like plastic inside your mouth, but as you notice that Pollyanna pulls whatever it is out with her teeth from your mouth, with a very goofy look on her face, you then have an explosion of rubber all over your mouth and more plastic just swelling and covering your lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPollyanna has just magically pulled out a huge pacifier out of your mouth, and there it stayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, full time baby!\u201d she says as she pats your head and gets up. The lights come back on, you find yourself lying on a pink and blue baby carriage, for comedic purposes that fit your size of course, back inside what looked like Chuckle\u2019s Joke Shop. A bright green sheet with little drawings of flowers and hearts covers up to your head and you are tucked in. You try to move your arms and uncover yourself but you can\u2019t. You try to spit out the large pacifier but you can\u2019t. There\u2019s 5 clowns looking straight at you. And they\u2019ve just made you into one of their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell girls? What do you think?\u201d asked Pollyanna.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the best day ever! We have a little baby to play with!\u201d said Pudding.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd he looks so funny! Everybody is going to laugh the second they take a look at him!\u201d said Velvet.<br>\r\n\u201cOh everybody\u2019s just gonna eat him up!\u201d said Cake.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re gonna be a big star, Baby!\u201d said Rhapsie pointing at you and honking at your new red round nose.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right! And we\u2019re going to travel the whole wide world! You\u2019re going to be making people laugh in every city in every country!\u201d said Pollyanna <br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to see much of it, after all, you\u2019re going to be under the big red top all the time.\u201d explained Velvet.<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, that\u2019s right! In fact, let\u2019s hope you get a good first impression of the place! You won\u2019t really be leaving it for a long time the minute you step in..!\u201d replied Pollyanna <br>\r\n\u201cAnd whenever we\u2019re not working, that Mr. Joy is sure going to be busy!\u201d said Rhapsie while giving you a look of mock sensuality.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, we got what we came here for! Now let\u2019s march away, girls!\u201d said Velvet as she opened the door, there was a big parade outside, the circus had arrived and it came to seemingly pick you up. The clowns leave the store and join the parade to make their way to the giant tent, and before wheeling you away to your new life waiting you there, Pollyanna says this to you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Baby, this is it. The second we go out, it\u2019s everybody laughing straight at you. And it\u2019s never going to stop. I\u2019m not going to lie to you, it\u2019s constant, it\u2019s going to flood your mind. I\u2019m telling you this because I know you\u2019ve never been a clown before. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get used to it, eventually. Every other guy we\u2019ve picked up got used to it, so much to the point that they all decided to stay clowns! Now you, you\u2019re special, this is a first for us. This is a first for me! We\u2019re going to have so much fun watching grow up again as our little clown baby, and when I decide that you should be big clown again..! Oh shoot, looks like we\u2019re the last clowns in this parade! Oh well, more laughs for us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE END<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The cold, wet cream envelopes you eyes, nose, mouth, and ears.  Finding your arms and legs unrestrained, you jump to your feet sputtering.  As your feet touch the floor, you realize they are bare.  The girls must have taken your shoes and socks while you were seated.  When you clear your eyes of cream to look down, you see gloved hands grab ahold of your pant legs as another pair of hands belonging to Pollyana undoes your belt.  Not knowing where she's going with this, and not having time to think about it, you stand dumbfounded for a brief second before she places her hands on your chest, brings her face a kiss away from yours, and shoves you backward.  As your arms pinwheel furiously, you feel the hands on your pant legs jerk swiftly up and away, taking your pants with them.  You exposed backside lands with explosive force on to a large cream cake, placed in the seat of your chair by the clown of the same name.  Your shirt is grabbed from behind you and pulled over your head.  Blinded, with your arms bound by the shirt, the girls tickle you mercilessly and you feel someone give you a very loud and wet raspberry on your exposed tummy.  As you catch your breath after tickle induced giggling fits, your shirt is removed entirely.  You see Rhapsie, Velvet, Pollyanna and Cake standing before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieving your treatment complete, you raise the question, \"Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" says Velvet with another wicked grin, \"Oh, Pudding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quartet of clowns step aside to reveal their fifth member, Pudding, standing ready with what appears to be a fireman's hose, which is pointed directly at you.  With a playful laugh she charges the nozzle, and you are suddenly struck by a heavy stream of frothy, cool cream.  Pudding takes her time, and as you writhe and spin in your chair, she covers every inch of you.  When she finally cuts off the stream, you find yourself too exhausted to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just let the cream soak for a bit.\" Velvet tells her cohorts. \"His skin will be soft, smooth and creamy white in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhapsie, hopping over Pudding in a quick game of leap frog, calls out, \"Hey Polly, what kinds of jester girl are we going to make him anyway?  A skinny doll like you, or a bouncy ball like Cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPollyana responds, \"Of course, our new jestress will be...\"</span></div></div>",

He seems to be a pretty big figure, and this was more than just in the terms of a human fitting on that toy car, this clown had something of a real athletic physique. He was wearing red overalls but seemed shirtless, was clown white his natural skin color?? He runs up to you with a tiny blue ruler and comically attempts to take your measurements with it. Two other clowns step out of the car, one is enormously obese wearing a blue jumpsuit, the other seemed like an average person wearing a green clown trenchcoat and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gelato, I don't think this is a good idea!\" - squeaked the fat one.<br>\r\n\"I dunno Tubby, I'm kinda starting to feel it like him. If it comes down to this then we should do something fast.\" - squeaked the other one in a calm cool tone.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Cory! Congratulations lady, you messed up! You're one of us now, come on!\" - squeaked Gelato right at your befuddled face.<br>\r\n\"Alright alright, let's see what we got here.\" - you hear in the back, it was a woman's voice. Seems like the ring leader of these crazy clowns came along and emerged from the toy Beetle. Her attire was quite classic but at the same time very tight for a circus ring leader. She was a brunette with long hair and wore a black top hat, she also had with her a small whip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gelato and Cory, we're going to have to work with this figure, as it is right now it just won't do...\" - she said to her darling clowns while looking straight at still confused you.<br>\r\n\"I-I knew that...\" - quickly responded Cory.<br>\r\n\"Congratulations girl, your dull and uninteresting life has just ended and becomes a bright and funny new life in our amazing little world!\" - addresses the ring leader right at you.<br>\r\n\"Okay, this is getting creepier and creepier, before you people continue I'd like to know where I am...\" - you finally tell them.<br>\r\n\"Where you are right now is not important, is where we need you to be as soon as possible.\" - answered the ring leader.<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? This doesn't make any sense..!\" - you tell her. And with a quick snap of her whip to the air, your body suddenly reacts and stands completely still. You feel almost frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright guys, let's go. We got a lot of work to do!\" - orders the ring leader, and with that the clowns grab you and take you to their car. Cory seems to be the wheelman, er, clown. Tubby's in the passenger seat and you are in the back with Gelato and the ring leader, who has her arm wrapped around your shoulder and can't stop staring at you smiling. They drive off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh man, the clowns took you to their car?! That's not good, that's supposed to happen! Where are they gonna take you to?!</span></div></div>",

When you wake up to find yourself alone in the clown car all the doors are open and naturally, you walk out wondering what was happening now. You're still in the same grassy field but you had arrived at a circus now, a very large big red top with all the trailers and animal cages set up in the place and all the performers and handymen keeping themselves busy. You also see a line of spectators and a parking lot and you take a breath of relief thinking you were back in civilization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a white trailer near you decorated with lots of drawings of red hearts and a heart shaped door frame comes out the ring leader, smiling, then bursting into laughter when she sees you. \"Oh man, you're finally up! Did you sleep well beautiful??\"<br>\r\n\"Man, what the Hell was that all about!?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing nothing, it was just a joke. And if I or any of the clowns offended you in any way then let me be the first to personally apologize and me and the guys will make it up to you just as soon as we're done with this session, okay?\" - she explained, you calmed down and you smiled. This was a bizarre experience but not something to lose your head over, also considering how cute this ring leader was.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you step into my trailer while you wait? Come on!\" - she coaxes, you follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step in, this trailer looked more like an oddball honeymoon suite than the circus management office you were expecting. The surroundings are all white, every accessory and furniture was red, hearts everywhere. A heart shaped bed, heart shaped lamps, heart shaped desks with heart shaped handles, heart shaped construction paper cutouts dangling in strings on the ceiling. And yes hearts all over the wallpaper. You note this and you chuckle, and the ring leader blows red glitter into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt surprises you, but you can't react. It was the same as when she froze you with her whip, you now couldn't move and she stood in front of you grinning, watching your hair fall out, your clothes disappear, and your skin bleach. She then pushes you into the bed, your body may be paralyzed but it's not numb, you feel her blow the glitter into your crotch area and then the horror of no longer feeling your balls and penis. She then sits down and gets in your face and kisses your lips in a comical plunger style devoid of any sensuality. You feel something in your face contorting, emptying out features, and when she pulls out she looks as if she's holding something in her cheeks like a squirrel, she takes it to both your nipples, these explode into breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then...\" - she says, pulling out a white and red neck ruffle and fitting it on you. \"Who should we get to paint this canvas?? I was thinking Gelato since he's such a goof. But I think I have enough time to finish you up and you make your debut at the end of this session right now!

You had hair again, it was green curls shooting perfectly upwards and nothing waving to the sides. In the upper middle there was a small red bow. Your lips had inflated into a fiery red set that looked like it had been treated with heavy doses of collagen, with a red clown nose the size of a tennis ball to complement it. You were still wearing the neck ruffle but now you also had a green with drawings of red and white hearts leotard covering all your body with a ballerina's tutu on the waist and a large red bow in the back.

You blush with furious embarrassment underneath a heavy layer of fair foundation and bright pink blush.  Brushing golden curls out of your face you attempt to compose yourself and get to your feet, which you find a difficult task as the maryjanes they have slipped on your feet have  a 5 inch heel and 2 inch platform base to them.  The two men chuckle at you as you slowly make your way to an unsteady standing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looks like she could use a little help staying up,\" says the one on the left with a wicked grin.<br>\r\n\"Well, then by all means, let us toss her a line.\" says the other with a mirroring smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on the right shakes the hand of his twin and then pulls a piece of rope with a small card attached to it from his brother's sleeve.  He then turns and tosses the rope at you.  Reacting quickly you snatch the rop out of the air and as you attempt to toss it down and away from you like a venomous snake, you notice it catches on the air above your head and fails to fall.  Stunned by this defiance of gravity, you stare at the rope as its attached card turns to become legible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card reads, \"Don't Pull\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a large square patch of the ground directly beneath your feet drops away on hidden hinges.  You have just enough time to turn your startled eyes downward before you fall screaming into the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a terrifyingly long second, the skirt of your dress billows out and slows your decent as a parachute would to a slow downward drift.  As you feel the air rushing beneath your skirt, you feel uncomfortably exposed and have to stop yourself from crushing your parachute for the sake of modesty.  You can hear howls of laughter drifting down the hole at you from the men above.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor of the hole gently greets your strange new shoes and breifly struggle to maintain your balance.

Light streams in from the open door and you feel a sense of triumph at anticipated freedom.  There's just one problem; there's no way you are going to fit through that tiny door.  You look around desperately for something to help you widen the portal, and notice a small table now bathed in the light from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon the table you see a pair of vials of liquid and a pair small cakes.  They are each labelled, but rather than the 'drink me' and 'eat me' notes you would expect of this situation, they are marked with other suggestive verbs.  You pick up a bottle labeled 'sniff me' and consider it.  You know you need to shrink to get out, and with a quick mustering of courage, you uncork the vial and inhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you feel it affecting you and toss the bottle away into the dark lest its pervading odor shrink you too much.  You feel the once tight dress loosen a bit around, and then nothing.  A quick self examination tells you that although you are now about 8 inches shorter, you are still too big to get through the door.  You look to recover the 'sniff me' vial, but it appears to have dissappeared entirely, so you return to the tray.  You pick up the other bottle and read its label.  'Gargle me' is a phrase you'd never thought you'd read before, but you pop the cork and oblige.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gargle for a good half minute before you start to feel anything, and when the tingling starts this time, you feel it localized to your nether-regions.  In shock, you swallow a bit of the gargled fluid, then spray the rest across the room in a spit-take that should have been legendary.  You collapse to the floor in horror as you feel your manhood shrink back into yourself.  With feverish action you clutch the first cake you can reach from the table and wolf it down in two bites hoping it will undo the work of the last item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was the case with the last drink, the cake has a localized effect, but the growth is in an entirely different area.  You find that you now have a pair of quite lovely breasts.  On the verge of frustrated tears you look at the last pastry.  It is labeled 'throw me.'  You slump down, slip off the problematic shoes, now two sizes too small, and sigh, and wimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider the cake for a moment, pick it up slowly, and then hurl it with all your strength at the small door.  The small cake strikes the small door, the small door slams shut, and the wall around it falls away with a great crash.  As the dust clears, you can see a great gaping hole to the outside before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree now, but feeling less than triumphant, you pick up your shoes and walk out into the sunlight.

You can't even move your arms, which (like the rest of you) are held tight against the wall by the heavy, immovable canvas.  Your struggling draws the attention of a carny on the crowds side of the wall, to which your face is exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello.

A bright light shines on your face to illuminate the patrons' target, and its intensity makes it impossible to distinguish individuals in the now gathering crowd.  You open your mouth to object that aren't supposed to be here, just as a pie slams hard against the wall roughly a foot away from your face.  You shriek at the suddeness of it and a dollop of whipped cream bounces off your cheek leave a little white smudge.  The crowd laughs briefly at you reaction, and someone remarks that someone else \"couldn't hit the broad side of a circus tent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to emit the words, \"Excuse me.\" to the faceless crowd as another pie sails over head to splatter high on the wall.  A small glob of whipped cream drops down and attaches itself to your nose, gaining another brief chortle from your audience.  You blow furiously at your nose in an attempt to discard the cream as another pie dashes on the ground in front of you.  The patronizing \"awww\" from the crowd confirms that the most recent tosser was a small child.  As you are craning your neck to see if the pie that is plastered above you has the potential to slip down into your hair, you hear your prospective assailants go silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous at the change, you endeavour to ask what's going on.  You get as far as \"Wha-,\" when suddenly you feel the cold impact of wet cream, and sight and hearing become muffled by a fluffy white coating.  You spit out a mouthful of the pie as the crowd erupts in explosive cheers and guffaws.  With your arms still pinned, the best you can do is shake your head and bat you eyes furiously to clear your vision.  Just when you start worrying that you'll be unable to clean your face properly and suffocate should another tosser aim true, you are rewarded with a cleansing stream of cold seltzer water from the carny running the booth.  You sputter in indignation, and receive renewed raucous ridicule from the rabble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour demeaning distress continues for another twenty or so minutes before the carny at the booth announces that he must close for a shift change.  When he comes over to you to compliment you on your comic reactions, you explain how you've become trapped and require assistance.

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nYou were slightly rattled as you heard loud, earth-quaking footsteps, accompanied by the unmistakable trumpeting of an elephant. In fact, as you observed, it was a whole parade of elephants marching along in the distance along the horizon. You weren\u2019t quite sure why they were there; this field didn\u2019t look like a savannah. But the unusual sight piqued your curiosity. Besides, it\u2019s not like there were any other places to go, that you could see anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hurried up to the elephant parade, hoping there was somebody there who could help. Only upon getting closer did you see that the strange sight was accompanied by even stranger elephants. They looked somewhat cartoonish, with dopey grins and wide eyes. They were all seemingly painted bright pink, and oddly enough dressed up like clowns almost, with painted faces. They cheerfully marched behind each other, trumpeting loudly. The ground near them shook, and you were briefly worried they\u2019d flatten you if you startled them. Your fears of not finding another person were alleviated somewhat though, as you saw several clowns around the elephants too. You guessed the circus must be in town, or something. Bulky men, either fat or muscular, rode around on unicycles or on top of the elephants themselves, or simply bounced or marched in formation with them. They had a wide array of colorful hair, clothing, and faces, but all seemed to be having a good time. You supposed they would, being clowns and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing you noticed was the smell, and you wrinkled your nose in disgust. How could they smell so bad? Then you heard the glorious passing of gas from a few elephants in the group, and noticed the trail of dun some had left behind them, and rolled your eyes. Great, farting clown elephants, could this day get any weirder? Still, It was your best bet of finding anybody to talk to. Hopefully one of these clowns could stop fooling around and give you directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching them, despite the smell assaulting your nose, you waved your arms and yelled, \u201cUm, excuse me? A little help here?\u201d You looked through the crowd, before seeing one particular clown, sitting on the elephant in front, gazing at you, grinning like the others. He stood up, tapped the elephant\u2019s head with his big feet, and jumped as you watched in disbelief. He landed on the elephant\u2019s trunk, which curled as he slid down, before flying through the air and somersaulting, landing right at your feet as he bowed with a flourish. Impressive, you thought, before the clown looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was rather hefty, yet surprisingly nimble for his size. He looked about middle-aged you thought, with his flabby gut. He wore a tattered suit, patched with all sorts of textiles, and a top-hat with a partly torn lid that he tipped to you, exposing a bald spot on his head surrounded by curly rainbow hair. Large, ruby-red shoes covered his feet, and his hands similarly were covered in white gloves with exposed fingertips. His bright red lips and blue-colored eyes smiled warmly at you. \u201cHowdy, son,\u201d He said affectionately, \u201cWhat can I do fer\u2019 ya?\u201d He reached up, grabbing his bulbous, bright red nose, which he honked twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at him, mouth agape, still a bit surprised by the acrobatics act he had just done. He watched you, chuckling, \u201cYou could catch flies with that mouth boy.\u201d. It quickly brought you back to your senses and you shut it, before speaking, \u201cUh\u2026. Who are you?\u201d The fat clown laughed, snapping his suspenders, \u201cName\u2019s Curly, Curly the Clown. Curles to my friends though.\u201d He gestured to the parade, \u201cAnd this is my troupe. Were supposed to be performin\u2019 at the Big Top over in Clown Town today. It\u2019s our 300th tour to date!\u201d He chuckled. \u201cYour\u2026 300th tour?\u201d You said, a bit in disbelief. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been a clown a long time boyo.\u201d, \u201cHow long?\u201d you asked. He smiled, \u201cWell, just about all my life I reckon! Been one since my Daddy was in polka-dotted diapers!\u201d He laughed, \u201c\u2026Course he\u2019s always worn polka-dotted diapers, even now!\u201d He laughed again as you stared, a bit weirded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurly suddenly stuck out his hand to you, to your surprise, \u201cI take it yer\u2019 not from around these parts. Well, it\u2019d be rude not to show some hospitality. Put it there, pally.\u201d You regarded the outstretched hand hesitantly, and nervously grabbed it. Suddenly there was a buzzing shock to your palm that made you jump and recoil as Curles laughed, \u201cJoy buzzer, oldest trick in the book!\u201d He said, pressing the button and zapping himself to demonstrating, gigging like a lunatic. \u201cUh, great\u2026\u201d You said, a bit exasperated. Suddenly the clowny ringmaster grabbed you and shoved you under his arm, in something of a headlock. \u201cAw, don\u2019t feel bad son, we all fall for that every once in a while\u2026\u201d He chuckled as you gagged. You were so close to his armpit, you could smell his positively nauseating B.O.. When was the last time this guy had a bath? \u201cJust be glad I didn\u2019t ask ya to pull my finger. Oof, I could use that. My gut\u2019s been so full a\u2019 gas lately.\u201d He lifted his leg, ripping a loud fart and stinking up the place even worse. You thought you were going to be sick as he just giggled childishly, patting his rotund stomach, \u201cAh, that\u2019s better.\u201d He sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I just, ugh, get some directions please?\u201d You asked, trying not to be choked by stink, or the headlock he was holding you in, \u201cWhere is here anyway?\u201d, \u201cWhy this is Clown World, son!  Got elephant turds fer\u2019 brains, boy?\u201d You were pretty sure you had more \u2018brains\u2019 than this guy had, by a large margin. Still, you didn\u2019t want to be too rude. So, was this supposed to be some alternate dimension or something. \u201cUhh, well, that\u2019s great and all Mr. Curly--\u201d, \u201cPlease, call me Curles. Mr. Curly was my Daddy\u2019s name. Course, he\u2019s never been able to spell it.\u201d He interrupted, \u201cOhhh-kayyy\u2026. Uh, Mr. Curles, is there any way out of Clown World?\u201d He looked at you in surprise, \u201cNow why would ya ever wanna leave? This place is great!\u201d, \u201cMaybe for you, but I gotta get home.\u201d You weakly replied. Curles tapped his chin in thought, still keeping you trapped under his stinking armpit, \u201cWell, maybe somebody in the city could help ya out then. I got a few friends who might.\u201d, \u201cGreat, well, could you point me towards---\u201c, \u201cI got a better idea!\u201d He smiled, interrupting again as he finally freed you from huffing any more of his stinky musk. \u201cHowsabout you go with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, I think I can make it on my own\u2026\u201d You said, but Curles wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cI insist. You could even travel in a parade with us!\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou ever been in a parade, boy?\u201d, \u201cEr, no, I guess not.\u201d You confessed, \u201cMight be fun. C\u2019mon, wanna give it a try? You might have some fun!\u201d You grimaced. Admittedly, it did sound kinda fun\u2026 Despite the smell that is. And if you were going to the same location, you guess it wouldn\u2019t matter. \u201cUhh, fine I guess.\u201d Curles suddenly pulled you into a headlock, dragging you back into his stink, before walking you over to the marching elephants, which smelled even worse up close! \u201cGreat! It\u2019s settled. Yanno, we\u2019re actually a little shorthanded, but I could always use some extra help!\u201d He chuckled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry though, it\u2019ll be easy.\u201d He released you, leaving you gasping for air again as he laughed, \u201cUgh, fine, what do you want me to do?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratched his chin in thought. \u201cHmm\u2026 Well, I\u2019m sure I can find something. But first, some changes are in order.\u201d He snapped his fingers. Suddenly you felt a tingle in your body, which spread, turning into a tickle. You uncontrollably grinned, suddenly giggling as you felt your body change. \u201cHope ya like being in the parade, boy!\u201d Curles chuckled<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As it does, you turn and turn a little frantically trying to find the source of it, it's a bit of a scary feeling in such a vast and empty field not knowing where a sound could be coming from. And just when it grew it's nearest you, you hear somebody humming a song. And then finally you are bumped off your feet by a humongous singing creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" \u266a Everybody Wang Chung tonight! \u266b\" - it sang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get back up, you take a look at what hit you. It was a clown. A huge clown. And it was jogging. He had silly looking red sneakers and dark blue fluffy headphones with an antenna sticking out and huge red boxing gloves for the occasion. His suit was light blue and he wore a snowcap of the same color covering his bald head. And just as he was going to continue to be on his way, he suddenly stops and takes the headphones off. It was as if he had realized he had hit you, and he turns around slowly to see. He had a shocked look on his face his fat red nose couldn't hide and ran back at you to see if you were alright. This all included frantic squeaking from his sneakers and you taking a look at a gray drawing of 1-ton weigh covering the front of his suit, but this one said '24/7 Tons'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy! Oh boy! Are you alright?!\" - the clown asked panicking in a goofy voice.<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'm fine.\" - you answer.<br>\r\n\"I didn't hurt you did I?! Oh boy! I'm so so so so so sorry! I didn't see you there! I didn't see you there!\" - he kept saying.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, really. I didn't see you either. It was an accident and you didn't hurt me. Um look, where am I? What is this place?\" - you try to change the subject.<br>\r\n\"Oh boy! Oh boy! How did you get here??\" - asked the clown.<br>\r\n\"The Joke Shop. One minute I'm in my neighborhood and I notice this place and went in. Next minute, I'm here.\" - you answer, hoping it gives the clown an idea of what's happening.<br>\r\n\"Joke Shop!? Oooooh boy, not good! You shouldnt've gone in! Now you're gonna have a hard time getting back home if you came through the Joke Shop!\" - the clown replied.<br>\r\n\"Why? What is this place? Where am I?\" - you keep on asking.<br>\r\n\"Clown World!\" - was the ever obvious answer.<br>\r\n\"Clown World?\" - you say in return - \"Well, how do I get out?\"<br>\r\n\"Not if you stay here in this field!\" - tells you the clown - \"Look, I was just going to see some buddies of mine, I think they might be able to help you out! They might know more than I do at least, I don't know much about leaving this place since I sort of belong here. Come with me, I'll let you meet them!\" - he then invited you.<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's cool...\" - you agree and then finally ask - \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n\"24/7 Tons!\" - the clown introduces himself happily smiling - \"Or at least that's what everyone and everything calls me, so I figure that might be it! Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back and you nod, replying back with your name. And you are both on you're way out if this field.

But suddenly, you hear some squeaking again, 'Tons hears it too and he then stops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that one of your friends?\" - you ask, figuring a clown was on its way after your initial encounter with Tons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't answer but he's looking around, trying to make out who or what was on his way. He stops looking at the back of your direction and panics!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!\" - he goes.<br>\r\n\"What!? What is it!?\" - you ask him feeling as scared as him.<br>\r\n\"Hide! Hide! Quick, hide here! Hide!\" - the big clown then grabs a hold of you and puts you inside the nearest bush. - \"Shh! Stay quiet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah great, now this. And just who are you talking to, fatboy?\" - you hear at a distance from your hidden position.<br>\r\n\"What the- oh hi Aurora! Did you say something?? I was just doing some jogging while listening to classic hits from the-!\" - answered 24/7 Tons nervously.<br>\r\n\"Oh good grief, shut up! Just shut up! Why did I even ask?! And pro-tip: don't try to hide anything from me if you can't even hide that fat...-\" - you keep hearing, the squeaking got closer along with the voice, you made out that it was...a female voice? Out of nowhere, a soft white gloved hand grabbed hold of your head and pulled you up. You see a lady clown witch in front of you, and you both have a pretty shocked look on your faces, but - \"...ass.\" she manages to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a good look at this new whiteface clown that made the scene up and down, it was a woman alright, wearing a purple witch's robe and hat with big floppy clown shoes of the same color and red &amp; stripes tights. She had short blond hair, the standard red nose and lipstick on her lower lip with a little blush. Her eyes were neatly lashed and as you noticed that one feature, her look of surprise changed to one that seemed more pleased. Her hand then reached for one of your ears and pulled out a red flower and took a little sniff while looking at you blinking rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well helloooooooo!\" - she greeted you.<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey...\" - you responded, nervously.<br>\r\n\"And what are you doing here?\" - she asks you in a very friendly manner.<br>\r\n\"I came here through the Joke Shop, I'm trying to get back to my home.\" - you explain, still nervous.<br>\r\n\"Oh, the Joke Shop. You poor poor sap, curiosity just got the best of another little kitty...\" - she says to you as she passes her gloved hand around your face and starts petting your head - \"So you're lost now, where was the fatboy here taking you to?\"<br>\r\n\"I was taking him to Cory The Clown! He once saw the outside and he might be able to help him! Not you, you're a wicked crazy witch and a bully! Come on, let's get away from her!\" - 24/7 Tons interrupts and coaxes you to just leave quickly.<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, and you believe that?\" - replied Aurora - \"You'll have to excuse the fatboy over here my friend! He's a little bit impressionable and reactionary and the other clowns always take advantage of that and can convince him that unicorns are soul sucking creatures capable of godless carnage when provoked!\" - she addresses this to you.<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" - you ask in return, that made no sense at all.<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, just look at him! How long have you been hanging around him? Tons here, he's something of a buttmonkey! He's the clown that other clowns will be laughing at!\" - she explains.<br>\r\n\"Okay, without the buttmonkey remark that makes a little sense, but he has been trying to help me. And you're a witch and he called you a bully, so how do I know you're not trying to trick me and give me the same crap you're giving him?\" - don't know how but you got your confidence back.<br>\r\n\"Me?? Well for starters, you've said it, I'm a witch! I know magic and I use it to get around well, and THAT can help you!\" - Aurora then proceeded to place her arm on your shoulders as she kept talking to you - \"And yes handsome, I'm also a bully! But, I only bully the other clowns around here. Now you don't look like a clown, you look like about a 9 and a half and that is very rare for all my days around here. I need more of this, please let me help you out!\" - she asks you this very nicely and with a very inviting look.<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to her!\" - interrupts again Tons - \"What you said was right, she's only gonna trick you and make it hard for you to leave this place!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you have to understand Tons, I really do need all the help I can get.\" - you explain to the big clown, thinking he really might be the butt of the joke of this world and he might not really help that much - \"Okay, how does this magic of yours work?\" - you ask Aurora.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles, snaps her fingers and suddenly a purple smokes appears and absorbs all 3 of you. It quickly drifts up into the air and teleports you all somewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will it go next?? </span></div></div>",

Tons on the other hand is shaking and fumbling towards the nearest door he can find. He struggles but can't get it to open and he comically falls down. You chuckle, this was a pretty funny act these clowns were doing. You then turn your attention to Aurora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright let's see...\" - she begins moving away searching for something on a nearby creaky witch's desk. She pulls out a book and opens it - \"So you came from the store? That's a bit of a raw deal for you, you'd have to look all over the place for a way back to were you came, and Clown World is just huge! But I got something here that might make the whole thing easier!

You realize you are wearing nothing but your underwear and you bolt to your senses fully awake, you are in a huge soft white bed for a checkered bedroom with a fireplace. Aurora is lying in front of it on a purple rug wearing another set of clothes that looked distinctly...normal. White socks and long light blue jeans, a long sleeved purple shirt. There was a bottle of wine inside a wicker basket next to her and she drank some of it in a crystal glass. Her face seem plain, in comparison to when you first met her, and in her other hand she held a small piece of paper, she looked at with something of a bored yet nostalgic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" - she says to you without looking. \"Once you go through what I went through you get these...urges.\"<br>\r\n\"...I don't wanna go through what you went through.\" - you say, feeling suddenly real worried.<br>\r\n\"Well good for you, sexy boy...\" - she snaps putting the paper down and looking right at you. \"You wanna know what it's like to get turned into this?\" - she gestures to her body with both her arms. \"It's not cool, it's embarrassing as it is scary and it's something I've come to not wish on my worst enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs the basket and stands up walking up to you. Once up to you she shows you the paper she was looking at, it was a small picture of a white woman with short blond hair wearing a blue long sleeved buttoned shirt. She sits next to you and points at it. \"Before...\" - and then points at herself. \"...after.\"<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ...\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah and you don't know the half of it, never go inside their cars...but anyway, let's get back to you, now that you know what happens to people here, do you know just how coveted a plain guy like you is? No joke, all the girls locked and transformed here with me HATE the guys here...\" - she reaches out for another glass of wine and starts filling it up. \"So you have to excuse my behavior, I mean not only do you get a new instinct to act like Saturday morning cartoon character, but again, urges. A plain guy like you is simply irresistible and we have this need to make the most of it before they become just another annoying goofball.\"<br>\r\n\"It's-it's okay, look, is there a way out of here?\" - you say as she hands you the glass and you accept without noticing as you are entranced by her. She slowly moves her head toward yours and you look at each other intently for a long moment, she then closes her eyes and gives you an Eskimo kiss with her red nose and turns back. \"No...\" - she plainly answers with an uninterested look away from yours sipping on some wine. You feel a bit shocked but still smitten by her presence.<br>\r\n\"But don't worry, you stay here and I'll make sure you stay as normal and sexy as you are right now. And I'll look into it. Who knows, maybe there's a way out without you getting turned into anything...\" - she turns at you again and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then reaches for your crotch and sensually waves her body back to yours as she rubs it around, you're still too shocked to do anything about it. \"You know, you're gonna like it here. I've seen how we girls can please you normies good up to before you get careless and clowned. This might be a paradise for you, I mean just think: just you, and little old me as your very own very personal clown.

Get up, I gotta warp you outta here agai-!\"- and you hear glass break behind you, you turn to look and there's a huge plunger on your chest and you are pulled to the outside of the building and into the arms of another clown sitting on what looked like an old fashioned window cleaning bench. You look at each other for a moment before anything else happens, she's another female. She's dressed in a shimmering white fairy godmother outfit with purple polka dots. A long skirt that covered all her legs (though you note she's wearing fancy high heeled boots), bubbly shoulders, large fake butterfly wings, and a pointy princess hat with soft purple sheets swinging at the tip. Her hair was also purple and bouncy long, she had something of an elongated adult face behind her big red nose and as you looked at her with your ongoing amazement, the expression on her bleached face seemed like genuine concern. \"Are you alright?!\" - she asked.<br>\r\n\"Uh, no! What is this I don't even-!\" - your confused answer, you hear a lot of crushing sounds on the room you just left but before you can just look to see what happened to Aurora. \"Yes! Yes, I know, don't worry! I've got you, now hold on!\" - and she starts to pull the bench down. You both safely land and you see hordes of clowns in those cartoon cop costumes rush to what looked like the smiling yet evil fortress you just got pulled out of. You are running as you do this, where to you have no idea, but you are being guided by the fairy clown as she holds your hand and has her shiny star tipped wand on the other, she still has a very concerned look on her face. It's nighttime and you both head into a forest, at first you thought that would only make things darker for you, until you both reach an unbelievably bright grove with more cartoonish and smiling trimmings, including a small waterfall and what looked like living stuffed animals roaming about. \"There...\" - the clown takes a deep breath of relief. \"I think here's good spot. <br>\r\n\"And who are you now?\" - you ask her.<br>\r\n\"My name is Rasputina, The Clown.\" - she answers smiling.<br>\r\n\"I...I think I should thank you, Aurora was bent on keeping me as her pet...\"<br>\r\n\"And you did good staying at her last hideout! Usually it's hard for us to track a place of hers like that. But lucky for you, I can detect whenever a normal person ventures into Clown World!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's great! Now tell me, how can I leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile drops, she looks away in sudden dismay and walks deeper into the grove. \"Okay...\" - you answer to that worried again. \"At least you're not tricking me like everyone else has been doing.\"<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to leave?\" - she asks crossing her arms.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not my world.\"<br>\r\n\"Then why did you enter it?\"<br>\r\n\"I was trapped in here after I entered Chuckle's Joke Shop, it just suddenly appeared in my town and I was real curious to see what it was...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, that...\"- she chuckles a bit then turns around to face you again. \"So then tell me, if it had been anything else other than a Joke Shop, would you still enter it to see what it was all about?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh...what?\"<br>\r\n\"Why would you wanna go into a joke shop for in the first place?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...it was just there, I mean one morning the lot is empty and then...\"<br>\r\n\"Really? So you were just weirded out and that's it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly your body froze, you panic as she approaches you. She grabs both your hands and looks at you with a lightly sad smile on her face. \"You're here for a reason.\" - she drops your hands and circles your body slowly in examination, shaking her head in disapproval. \"No, no, no. This is just plain terrible. Would you like to know why you walked into of all things a joke shop? Because this isn't you. This wasn't meant to be you!\" - she then starts waving her wand slowly, dropping bits of that fairy dust into your body, it shines in reaction and before everything fades out in the brightness you catch a glimpse of her mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went to a joke shop because you understand this isn't you, and you don't care for it anymore. You don't care anymore for the things you thought you used to like. You don't care anymore to answer to the same people you would answer to every day. You don't even care about that girlfriend of yours anymore...although, if you bring her to me here, I'll be happy to fix her just like I've fixed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly wake up after a long sleep...</span></div></div>",

You reach your new nose to honk it worryingly and even though you were also expecting it, you see your arm has been bleached to a smooth snow white. Both your hands are the same and you start feeling up your body, before you turn your head down to see the rest of your transformed self, your hands stumble upon a baggy fabric wrapped right around your lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is how your new life as a clown was beginning, you're all alone in the woods wearing nothing but a huge pinned up diaper. \"G-g-g-ghh!...\" - you felt crushed and embarrassed beyond belief. From here on out everything was going to be more demeaning, you could already picture a lifetime of people laughing at your expense in more comical situations, you were finally their clown! But you did not want this life and you burst into tears! \"Ghuaaaa! Ghuaaa! I want my mommy! Where's my mommy!? Ghuaaa!\" - words were coming out of your mouth, you were too busy shrieking stupidly to realize what they had been. You couldn't stop crying and as you kept going, the burst of tears coming from your eyes kept getting heavier and heavier, you snap out of it for a moment realizing you had gone off like a fire hydrant! You stop and you look around you, you had soaked the surrounding grassy area to the effect that tiny patches of bright flowers started to grow instantly! They reach up and you are engulfed in a bed of them, then suddenly to your right, a large green figure emerged, it looks down on you and you see the purple petals of a flower open up to reveal a bleached young woman's face. The same happens to your left and right in front of you and there they stood for a moment: 3 women in green skintight bodysuits, large purple flower petals covered their brightly pantomime faces. They look at you with curiosity as the two to your sides descend daintily while the one up front just bends in the same manner. They examine you for a moment and notice your tears. \"Awww!\" - they all whimper in unison.<br>\r\n\"Little baby, why are you crying??\" - the one to your right asks in a tender tone as she begins to caress your face and wipe those tears, the other one then held you and started to rock your upper body, the one that stood backed away for a moment in search of something.<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, please! I don't want to be a clown! I don't want to be a clown, no!\" - you weep on them.<br>\r\n\"Quick flowers, bring the baby over here!\" - their friend had pulled up a large blue feeding chair, the other two help you to your feet and walk you up to it, just inches before you reach it however you struggle and try to panic away. \"Oh no you don't!\" - you hear, and the trio forces you to your seat with a group effort. They strap the arms between the table to hold you down, while one of them ducks to restrain your feet, another one ties up a large bib on your neck as the third one comes up to you with a small crystal jar full of green mush. Almost instantly after you see it, she drives a large plastic blue spoon full of it into your mouth! She turns the handle of the jammed item in all directions as to make sure the mushy spinach is all over your mouth! Surprisingly, you finally snap and get angry, you shake your head to take the spoon out and scream. \"Stop tha-!\" - and the other flower jammed her own spoonful interrupting you! You spit out her offering. \"Why are you doi-!?\" - and the third one rises up with hers! The three giggle and with bright smiles they keep humiliatingly feeding you in this dun act!<br>\r\n\"Open wide, baby boy!\"<br>\r\n\"Make sure to eat all of your nummy num-nums!\"<br>\r\n\"Isn't this just yummy??\"<br>\r\n\"Awww, your mommy's gonna be so happy when we tell her you've already been fed!\"<br>\r\n\"W-wait!...\" - you now want to ask but keep getting silenced. \"Where is she righ-?!\"<br>\r\n\"She's with Rasputina right now! Then when she's ready she's gonna take you home where you'll be mommy and baby forever and ever!\" - then one of them gets in your face, her smiling expression changes to a smirk. \"Wish you were someone I used to hate back when I was normal...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Holy diver, what a bizarre nightmare! But hey blog about it later if you can remember it. Right now you and your girlfriend, lying there holding you still asleep, need to get up and get ready for your big day. She takes the lead on the showers and you head to the kitchen to fix up breakfast. You do what you usually do when you brew coffee and drink milk out of the jug, and that's when the num-nums you had last night kicked in and do a number on your diaper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver realizing that the nightmare is not over. Of course, it all still feels so real. So horribly, horribly real. As real as your girlfriend casually walking in on her bathrobe. Her skin is bleached snow white from the shower with 2 round cartoon red cheeks on her face and her hair grown as far as her back and a jet black coloration you don't remember her ever having. She picks up where you left off with the coffee and stares at you in diapers with a smile. \"Baby, why don't you let me handle breakfast today?\" - she...squeaks. \"You should hurry up and clean off now, we have a huge day ahead of us!\" - and blinks rapidly. You...oblige and make your way to the shower, she's right gotta hurry it up. Down the hall you can hear her sing. \"Going baby! ~\u266a Going baby! ~\u266a No more cussing! No more texting! ~\u266a Here's your bottle! Wear your bonnet! No no girlfriend! You're going baby! ~\u266a\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw the used up diaper away and the water in the shower bleaches your skin again! And as you dry up, at the first glance of the mirror as the steam wipes off you discover that you're bald! Still scared but you don't scream, you go and get dressed. You only find diapers in the drawers for the whites and clownish over-sized baby clothing in your closet! \"Okay look...\" - your girl walks back in to get herself dressed \"...you haven't been 'pacied' yet, so I'm not under the obligation to just diaper you. Besides, nobody's looking! It wouldn't be funny! Privately it would be kinky, but you're going to be a baby and that stuff's not for you anymore! So yeah, you're gonna have to pin it on yourself, okay?\" - her side of the closet has also been replaced by clownwear. Doll dresses and colofurl jumpsuits all over the place! She stops rummaging for a moment and looks at you. \"Dude hurry it up!\" - and surprised you into putting your diaper on! \"I prepped you a bottle and left it in the microwave, you should have a few sips before we go out and play...\"<br>\r\n\"A-are you my mommy?!...\" - you meekly ask, and hope so.<br>\r\n\"Aww, you poor thing!\" - she approaches you and caresses your face. \"I'm sorry, no! I don't get to be your mommy! I only moved in so I could take care of you! I'm Nurse Pinkyboo, the clown! Nice to meet you! And you and I are gonna be an act today!\" - she pecks you a kiss in your bald head and lets go giggling. \"Nurse Pinkyboo &amp; Big Baby!\" - rummages through your clothing and picks out a light blue baby jumpsuit for you to wear! It has an adorable yellow duckies pattern and complete with built-in mittens for your hands and booties for your feet! You starngely keep obliging and you both go about getting dressed in your clown costumes. You see her bury her slender body in a mock bright pink Victorian maid suit with bubble shoulders, a red cross in the center of the apron and little red hearts for buttons tied up in the back with a huge bow, ruffles hide the bloomers and striped green socks with more little red hearts pattern. She then puts on matching Mary Janes and fine soft stage white gloves and finally fixes her make-up, big dark lashes to wave and and her lips buried in red not much like your average clown but pretty much like a Pierrot. She then puts on her tiny nurse hat and poses in front of you giggling. \"So, what do you think?? This is gonna be me now, the real me! And you?? Oh baby baby!...\" - with the hand faster than the eye, your huge plastic toy baby bottle appears and she approches you with it! \"You're Big Baby! You're a big baby is what you are! Now then, about those sips of milk!...\" - and she jams the rubber nipple on your mouth forcing down the substance and your body into a seated position in the bed! Slowly, your mittens reach up as if you were ready for a struggle, but what happens instead is you grab the bottle and drink on. \"Good boy!\" - she giggles again hopping and clapping! She's then manages to calmly finish your costume while you drink tying up a bright yellow bib with drawings of your flower friends and the big silly matching bonnet for your jumpsuit! Once you're done with your milk you look from where you are at the nearby mirror in your ridiculous baby clown costume completed, you also notice that somehow your eyebrows have rounded into arches and you have the same red round cheeks as Pinkyboo! And finally, with a honk, your clown nose returns!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh that's just nice...\" - you are surprised again by your girl, she said that in her normal tone of voice when she wants to sound sexy, almost as if she had just... \"Yeah had to break out of character for this, let me tell you something baby you look just gorgeous. A new angel just got his wings...come here...\" - she pulls you to your feet and walks you to the mirror so you can both see each other transformed, ready to assume your place in the world as clowns. \"Look at that, look at you, look at me!\" - she smiles. \"We're both angels now, baby! This is who we are, this is our calling!\" - she then turns to look at you and holds both your mittens. \"Baby, look into my eyes...\" - she says and stops smiling. \"In a couple of seconds this is not gonna matter anymore but I have to apologize. I just need to. I've lied to you this whole time and don't want to think I broke your heart. You see...I was born in Clown World. And...I'm a fairy, and this whole time...me and Rasputina have been tricking you in order to transform you. Can you forgive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence in the room after those words...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\" - you...squeak.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, that's it! You're almost finished!\" - she says stunned and smiles again. \"Quick, what's your name??\"<br>\r\n\"B-big Baby, t-the clown...\" - you shake in your booties realizing what's happening!<br>\r\n\"Where were you born??\"<br>\r\n\"C-clown World...n-no wait I...\"<br>\r\n\"No no that's right! You're a clown, you're a Clown World native! You were born and raised there! I would know, I'm the one who raised you! Okay now!...\" - she pulls out a huge blue pacifier with the big white rubble nipple and then holds your shoulders. \"I'm gonna paci you up! First you have to repeat after me the magic words: goo goo!\"<br>\r\n\"G-goo goo...\"<br>\r\n\"Gaga!\"<br>\r\n\"Gaga.\"<br>\r\n\"Gababa!\"<br>\r\n\"G-gababa!\"<br>\r\n\"I want my mama!\"<br>\r\n\"I-I...I want my mama!\"<br>\r\nAnd she dives into you and gives you the biggest kiss she ever gave you in your life! After she pulls out she giggles back in her squeaky clown tone. \"Don't tell anyone I did! That's gonna be our big beautiful little secret! Remember, I'm a big clown, and you're just a big baby! Here's your paci!\" - and she smacks it into your lips! She waits in anticipation as you slowly start sucking it up in a much bigger haze than before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay baby! It's shhhhhhowtime!\" - and you leave your house for the last time on to your new life. You first become the sensation of the town as she walks you around in a large baby carriage entertaining on-lookers and all the children and pass flyers for the joke shop!</span></div></div>",

Could it be the fact that Pinkyboo might take you to your mommy and you really really really wanna see her??

We're only getting started!\" - and you all simultaneously moved, Rasputina grabbed you and dragged you along to the back of the spacious van with crew seats around all the trinkets and jokes Pinkyboo owned on the go. Tons took your carriage folding it and after putting it away he shuts the doors closed leaving you sitting alone with the fairy right in front of you! She stares at you first, and as soon as the car sets into motion she grabs your face and takes off the paci, inspecting your face holding your chin.<br>\r\n\"Aggg!\" - you start babbling. \"Agege gagaga baba!\"<br>\r\n\"Goo goo?\" - she answers. \"Goo goo, ga ga?\" - and without waring dives in giving you a kiss in the lips! \"You're one of us now, clowny!\" - she says when finished and pops the soother back in your mouth. \"And you look just perfect as a baby, I'll break you down soon what lifestyle you're gonna be enduring.

She then makes her wand appear, she removes your bonnet and gives your chrome-dome a magical tap!<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" - you squeak backing away surprised. \"I...oh snap I just zoned out there for a moment!\" - you say and then chuckle.<br>\r\n\"God today was unreasonably hot!\" - Rasputina says browsing the fridge, she grabs a cream pie and two beer bottles placing one on the table for you. \"Here you go dude.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks pixie!\" - and she leaves to confront Pinkyboo while you kick back. Upon reentry to the closed up storefront, she smacks the clown nurse with the pie right in the face.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Where did that come from?!\" - she obviously complains but Rasputina just gives her a stern look of authority. \"Just what the Heck is up with you now?! What's wrong?!\"<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?! You don't follow instructions, that's what's wrong!\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?!\"<br>\r\n\"Only his mom was supposed to paci him and brick his mind into it! Now I have that gallut dressed like a baby boozing in my kitchen! I have him in circus mode!\"<br>\r\n\"So!? Just tap him again back to normal and let her work it again!\"<br>\r\n\"I can't do that, Pinky! You know I can't! She's gonna find out and we won't get paid! And it's all thanks to you!\"<br>\r\nNurse Pinkyboo suddenly realizes the gravity of the situation and panics. \"Oh crud Ras! I am so, so sorry! I just couldn't hold myself! Do you have any idea everything I had to put up with since I had agreed to move in with him?! All the things I had to resist and all the brilliant moments I had to keep to myself until now! It was hard, Rasputina! It was really hard!\"<br>\r\nRasputina can only sigh...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Flying through the back room they discover that the tentacles also got a hold on you and before entering they get a grip on the nurse clown!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tentacles drag you all down right at the entrance to Aurora's spooky new castle locale!

It looks like a dressing room for clowns with big backstage mirrors, barber shop stools, and cheerful clown figures composing the furnitures. Cocooned in vases the three of you are placed down in front of the mirrors individually, jester couples that carried Rasputina and Pinkyboo kiss them on their cheecks in unison and then smack them with cream pies out of nowhere on their faces! Pinkyboo suddenly realizes something, they are treating her like a clown which she only allows Rasputina to do, everyone else falls victims to her adorableness as a fairy clown! \"No no no...\" - Rasputina says and the trio watch as tubes are placed at her vase and Pinkyboos connecting and ending in faucets. They drain their magic out!<br>\r\n\"That'll teach you to blow my sex!\" - says a voice familiar to you.<br>\r\n\"Aurora!\" - you say, breaking out of circus mode, Rasputina had feared that, it's what she had wanted to prevent all along. You suddenly look at yourself surprised as you have no idea how you got yourself in this situation! The last thing you remember was you and your girlfriend getting ready for work and hoping she'd drop off with your mommy... \"Gghag!\" - your mind twitches in that confusion!<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, look at you! All that hotness buried under a ridiculous character!...\" - she then grabs the container her jester minions had used to contain the clown fairy magic. \"But guess what, Rasputina!? You can't beat me now! Not now, not ever! I win!\" - and she jugs down the magic! In a big flash of bright lights...she turns back to normal! And she's dressed like a female ringmaster!<br>\r\n\"Noooo!\" - Rasputina screams and then turns her head down in defeat! With a grin, she rips your neck ruffle off you and gives you a huge sensous kiss! Everything then comes back to you, your real name, where you live, where you were born, and the great power that this being had just granted you! A big red smile paints itself on your mouth from cheeck to cheek that complements your arched eyebrows and huge clown nose! The jesters pull down the vase and your outfit had changed from a babyish onsie to a striped white and blue clown's jumpsuit with matching big floppy shoes! The jumpsuit then expands, as it is inflatable! Once finished, you and Aurora take a moment to stare each other at your mirror smiling while the jesters also pull down the vases of Pinkyboo and Rasputina revealing them in their baggy new jumpsuits keeping the neck ruffles! Pinky's was white with small hearts scattered and Rasputina's also white with purple dots! They get forced into the barber stools as Aurora hands you your matching pointy hat! <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm gonna go get the car!\" - you say to the girls wobbling away for a moment and giving Aurora another kiss, and then the jesters begin working with pleasant smiles! They first use scissors and then the razors and they shave Pinkyboo completely bold! Rasputina only got scrapped at the top leaving her with a daffy clown doo! Then came the make up, big red smiles and arches just like their partner! Pinkyboo got a new clown nose! And then Aurora pulled it making it longer, which also magically affected hear dome, giving it a cone shape! <br>\r\n\"P-p-p-pinky...\" - Rasputina said as she began entering a haze and Pinkyboo as well, the straps that held them on their seat come off but they don't react in utter shock as to what lowly clowns the faeries had just been reduced to. The jesters then finish up fitting them with with their new big floppy shoes. Pinkyboo manages to react surprised to them for a second until the jesters grab them and you drive back in on your new tiny clown Caddy, they get forced down in along with Aurora and some of her minions and you all drive away for fun times!</span></div></div>",

It's a rather resounding quack that mutes everything, and then you meet your knees! You are suddenly enclosed as the space shrinks and the light goes out for a moment! Until you crack through some white foam, you're in a large nest, in a well lit yellow room made up of what looked like make-believe straw for a children's TV show with plastic looking green furniture and framed portraits of cartoon ducks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came your horrors: your skin had been bleached, your hair was gone and you were now smoothly shaved bald, and you wore a male chastity belt! The type that simply tuck in your member rather than exposing it caged for kinky fun. Although it was white with picures of hearts BANNED scattered, it felt strangely like normal fabric cloth but it got strong as soon as you tried pulling it out!  And that's when your entire crotch area went numb!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt on leaving the nest but as soon as your feet hit the ground, they squeak and magically puff into large yellow webbed feet! They looked like a rubbery and cartoonish accesory for a duck costume but it was an all-too-real new part of you covering the entire boot area! You quack freaking out and seemingly summoning Rasputina appearing on another magic puff of purple mist, her face beams pleasantly surprised at how promising you looked so far! She then instantly threw herself at you wrapping her arms and gave your lips a big kiss! \"Quack quack!\" - she then said before pecking your face with more kisses. \"Quack quack!\" - she repeated. \"Quack quack quackitty quack!\" - and she laughed and mocked before giving you one last peck in the lips. \"Okay now, okay! Let's wrap this one up, shall we??\" - she took her wand and gave a magic pokesie to your chastity belt, making puffy white bloomers with little blue bows appear! \"You like them??\" - she asks with genuine chirpy curiosity and really expecting an answer blinking rapidly, you answer by finally running like Hell.\"Oh but hold on we're not done yet!\" - you hear her say and the first thing you do as soon as you leave your new bedroom is bash right into 24/7 Tons' jelly clown belly!<br>\r\n\"Ice, ice, baby!\" - he's still jamming to his retro music until he notices you half-finished as a caricature and wearing bloomers. \"Oh, uh...uh-oh!...\" - he looks on with not knowing what to say about that, you then again felt the shimmering blast from Rasputina's wand on your chest and you were finally suited on a big long-sleeved doll dress! It was green with little red flowers yellow at the center scattered across! The collar was scalloped, the skirt petticoated so you could show off the detail on your adorable bloomers, and ruffles on every sleeve! Still on the ground feeling this new garment and tugging at it, Rasputina fits on the matching large bonnet with a red bow displayed on your neck!<br>\r\n\"You're one of us now.\" - she says holding you once finished, with a rather serious tone and look on her face, you're too astonished to even quack back at her! She then dives in for another big kiss on your lips, strangely enough your shock fades for a few seconds as you start to feel a little pleasure out of this one...along with a bizarre familiarity towards her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she were trolling and noticed you were starting to enjoy yourself she withdraws suddenly and acts like a clown again looking at you mockingly stern. \"Ooooh! Ohh why I oughtta!... Get up! Stand up!\" - you obey and you both look comical doing this on your big clown dresses. \"Ms. Quack Quack, that was very inappropriate!\" - she points her finger at you. \"You are no longer some big horny bruiser, you're an adorable little character in our world now and you'll behave accordingly! Tons, hold her!\" - she commands and suddenly you're at the fat clown's confused grip, as you struggle Rasputina puffs out your large yellow beak. \"You really liked that last kiss didn't you, silly man?\" - she mocks out of character again with an evil grin, the beak is quacking all by itself until she fits it in and a you feel a huge surge of magic as it settles! Tons lets go but Ras grabs your arms quickly and finally covers your hands with soft white clown gloves! \"There, all done!\" - she declares and kisses the best left of your cheek! She then locks your left arm with her right and pulls you away smiling. \"Tons come on! Wanna play with us??\"<br>\r\n\"Oooh hoo hoo, sure thing!\"<br>\r\n\"Well grab Ms. Quack Quack's right arm like the big fluffy gentleman that you are and let's go!...\" - she opens the frontdoor of your new house outside to Clown World, she gives you another seductive grin. \"Let's show her how fun Clown World can be!\" - and she nonchalantly parades you around your new life!</span></div></div>",

You breathe a sigh of relief as your terrifying plunge gives way to a soft and comfortable rest, but begin to worry again when the hole you created fills up with collapsing plush fabric.  You wriggle and crawl as best you can to get out, but in your blind wriggling, you manage to wriggle out of most of your clothing.  Digging down to get a footing, you eventually lay hands on what feels like the edge of a hatch.  After pulling and prying for about a minute, the hatch swings open suddenly, and you fall inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking lights surround you, and machinery starts whirring to life.  Mechanical arms pick you up and stuff you into a body shaped stocking.  The stocking covers your head at first, but as you feel machines stitching it up behind your back, you tear the hood of the stocking off so you can breathe easily.  More arms grab your head and hold it in place as a dye spraying device closes in on your face.  You shut your eyes as it begins to airbrush a pattern over you.  You open your eyes again when machines start braiding your hair with long strands of heavy red yarn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arms pick you up again, and while you are suspended, they slip you into red and white striped tights, a blue dress with red polka dots and an attach white apron, white mittens, and black mary jane flats.  The arms finally drop you onto the factory floor before retreating back into the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few wobbly steps, you find yourself intact and unharmed, though confused and very soft.  The stocking you've been stuffed into is very comfortable against your skin, though you feel like some plush stuffing got stuffed into it with you in certain curvy areas.  As you come to a shiny metal panel, you catch your reflection, and gasp at the perfect likeness of a life sized Raggedy Anne doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouching a mitten to your face, you find you're unable to smudge your red circle cheeks, lips or nose.  Your black drawn-on eyelashes and freckles are equally impervious as they frame your wide eyes beneath a canopy of red yarn bangs that hang down from a wig put into giant pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock suddenly hits you, and your eyes involuntarily cross as you knees knock together and you flop down to the ground in a heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" shouts the clown from before as he walks into the factory, \"you're absolutely perfect!

You're so overcome by sudden stage fright that you don't know how to react, and so you just lie there until the clown who brought you here lifts you up into a standing position.  When he steps away from you, your butterfly filled stomach stays limp, and your whole torso falls forward, leaving your legs standing straight as your yarn hair brushes the ground.  The clowns hurries to straighten you up again and brushes the dust from your yarn.  Your waist is about to bend again, but he catches you at the shoulders and lifts you, then lowers your feet to the ground again.  This time, your feet slide out on the ground under your limber legs, and you drop into the splits.

Now that you're in the pile, getting off of the pile of boxes seems the next order of business, but you're having a little difficulty there.  A box might be stable at first, but once you put your weight on it, it crumples, and you lose your balance.  As you try to crawl, a box under your arm folds, and you pitch head first into a box of small red balls.  Lifting your head out of that box, you see that the balls are actually clown noses, and one of them got stuck over your nose.  As you reach up to pull it off, the box under your other arm crumples, and you pitch forward again, this time flipping head over heels into a very large open box whose lid drops closed after you fall inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the pitch darkness of the box, you press up against the lid, but it won't budge.  The walls inside the box feel featureless and a few minutes of prodding blank surfaces finally lead you to the floor of the box.  It feels like there might be a hole in the center of the floor, but some sort of fabric is covering it.  Guiding your hands over the fabric, you find an elastic opening and step into it.  A few feet down into the hole, your foot finds a stirrup of sorts.  Figuring that it must be the top of a ladder, you slip you other foot into the adjacent stirrup, and pull the fabric up over your shoulders to slip past it, with the elastic band now at your neck.  Lowering one of your feet, you try to find another foothold, but find nothing.  You bring your searching foot back to its stirrup to rest, when you hear a chiming music begin to play around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stirrups suddenly tighten and hold your feet in place.  The band at you neck stiffens, and while it doesn't choke you, you can't seem to stretch it out again.  Trying not to panic, you listen to the music and think about where you've heard it before.  You vaguely remember it having something to do with a monkey and a weasel, when *POP!* a latch moves and the lid of the box flies open.  You look up into the light, grateful for the exit, but wondering how you'll get to it.  Suddenly, your whole body shoots upward as the giant spring beneath the stirrups releases and leaves you bouncing over the end of it, high above the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now see what you've gotten yourself into.  You're a giant Jill-in-the-box!  The fabric around you is brightly striped in primary colors, and around your neck there is a frilly white ruff.  You now remember the clown nose that you never pulled off as it sits where you can't reach it due to the body encasing fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown you went walking with before stands in front of the box, chuckling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little help here?\" you ask hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try the sleeves.\" he suggests helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do notice long sleeves draping down from either shoulder, and quickly run your arms through them, into attached white gloves at their ends.  Unfortunately, stiff rods inside the sleeves prevent you from bending your arms, and you can't seem to pull your hands back through the sleeve cuffs.  You impotently wave your arms furiously, bobbing back and forth atop the bouncing spring, dressed completely as a clown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other clown continues to laugh at you for a while, before eventually taking action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

You are wearing a faded t-shirt and loose cotton blouse, hip hugging jean shorts, and a pair of well-worn Keds sneakers with thick socks.  It's not a particularly glamorous getup, but it's comfortable and has suited your needs exploring countless nature trails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you even walk in those things without falling over?\" asked Chuckles with sincere wonder, \"you need steady shoes with a nice wide, grounded sole like mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the clown's shoes and can't help but giggle.  Even for a clown, his shoes seem overly large.  They could clearly be effective snow shoes, or even tennis rackets, with their 16 inch wide toe areas that round back to a merely oversized boot tops, all of which are dressed in vinyl in every color of the rainbow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to demonstrate the function of normal shoes to your funny friend, you tell Chuckles, \"I can walk just fine in these, thank you.  Just watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling silly and sassy, you proceed to do your best impression of a model's trip down the catwalk.  Swinging your hips with your right hand miming that it dangles the most exquisite of little purses, you make to the end the stage, spin to face Chuckles, pose dramatically, take another confident step, and give a slight shriek as you feel your heels lift high into the air, one of them carrying a banana peel that you could have sworn wasn't there a second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour back hits the soft ground and you let out an \"oouff!\" as you are reintroduced to the effects of gravity.  Your hair cascades down into your face and you leave it there a moment as you catch your breath.  While blinded by your hair, you suddenly notice that you feet feel a little colder.  You sweep your locks from your eyes and gaze upon your now bare feet.  Your Keds and socks are nowhere to be seen, but Chuckles appears to be proffering a substitute in his own style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you so, didn't I?  Those little things would never have gotten you all the way to Clownville, but these are just the ticket.  Take them with my compliments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clown hands you what appear to be the estranged relatives of mary janes.  With a wide vinyl strap just below the ankle, they boast an inch high heel and an eight inch wide toe.  White polka dots an otherwise pink surface.  Atop the toes are two cute little vinyl bows in red.  In addition to the shoes, Chuckles gives a pair of red and white striped thigh high stockings.  You hesitate to put them on, but then consider the prospect of exposing your bare feet to this strange terrain and shrug away your concerns and fashion fears and embrace the funny footwear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stockings somehow make your legs feel more exposed, but you know the shoes would feel wrong in bare feet.  The shoes fit like a dream, offering a cushy heel and snug toe area (most of the toe has padding inside of it).  You get to your feet and take a few experimental steps.  Though you have to swing your legs out a bit at each step to keep from bumping your shoes into each other, you feel stable and at home in your new clown shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much for the gifts,\" you say to Chuckles, or rather would have, if he hadn't disappeared while you were testing out your presents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe land seems quiet except the soft sound of a calliope over the nearby hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your new shoes to work and you walk</span></div></div>",

You bite your lip to stay quiet as he carefully swipes and flicks pastry from his eyes and mouth.  A breeze passes behind you, and you are reminded of your wardrobe malfunction, and your urgent wish to rectify it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, you ask him if he has a spare pair of pants.  He doesn't.  Next, you ask if you can borrow his apron (pristine, despite the mess on his shoulders).  He refuses, but suggests you follow him to fetch another one.  Keeping the menu in front of you, you follow him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing empty tables, you follow him into the kitchen area, where he retrieves a garment from a closet.  It is indeed an apron, though it's attached to a very colorful, frilly dress with attached petticoats and a pair of polka dot bloomers sewn on as well.  Between dressing like a clown among clowns, and prancing around this strange world in your underwear, you quickly choose to wear the dress.  Ditching your blouse and t-shirt, you step into the getup and straighten it out around you.  You are now clad completely as a colorful clown from your neck ruff down to your bubble-toed shoes.  The waiter zips you up and then offers you a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'll let you keep the dress if you help him out with the lunchtime rush.  You can choose either to work in the kitchen, or wait on tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will you work?</span></div></div>",
