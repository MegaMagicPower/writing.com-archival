Not tall, but not short either, Long hair, grayish blue eyes, average cup size, just the slightest hints of a tan starting to form, enough to not look pale but not enough to be readily noticeable, not in the best of shape but not overweight, rather plain sense of fashion... the only traits that really stick out are your bright red hair, and insistence on wearing glasses rather than contacts (you've always insisted that they itch) otherwise you would blend unnoticably into almost any crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this will give you a chance to shed that 'boring girl' description that you seemed to pick up during your last year of highschool? You hope so, since that has secretly been part of your motivation for doing this. even if it does make you feel a little guilty...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the forms are done and it's time to head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter a brief wait, you're brought inside one of the preparation rooms. There's a nurse waiting for you, she wastes about twenty minutes going over and repeating what you have already agreed to, and signed, before handing you a medical gown and gesturing to a privacy screen set up on one side on the room. It doesn't take long to change. Asking if you're going to be sedated now, you get a surprising response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, in order to test the spinal nerves, and make sure they're bonding correctly, you can't be fully sedated. We can use local anesthetics to mitigate any pain, but not to a degree that would effect behavior or slow responses\" The nurse explained, trying to look as comforting as he could, but you had to admit, that part... well, you weren't sure if you were more nervous or excited by the idea of being awake for the whole thing. \"If you're having second thoughts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I want to do this.\" Your answer was firm, if a touch annoyed at being asked that, again. With how they kept doing that, when you know your step mom had been admitted in half the time, you're starting to wonder if you're their first teenage patient or something. Nineteen is still a legal adult in this part of the world though, so you wish they would cut it out already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the subject, she has you follow her to another room, and lie down on a special bed there. You can see another bed opposite it as you aproach, arranged so the head of each face each other. You'd recognize the patient lying on it anywhere, even with her skull open to the air. Your step mother with a visible brain actually looks kinda neat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're laying down, the nurses strap you in place, one of them explaining that patients sometimes spasm when extracted, and they don't want you to hurt yourself. Once you're secure one of the nurses gets out clippers and trims your hairline back about an inch, so that the cuts will be concealed by it growing back in afterwards. Next comes the needles jabbing into your skull. it's kind of like the ones they use before pulling a tooth, the first few hurt, but as they continue the half numb half cold feeling seems to spread fast enough that you don't notice the rest. Pretty soon the entire top of your head is numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first cut is along the shaved strip, slowly and methodically going from behind one ear, to the other. its strange, watching the doctors work via reflections. Seeing them peel back your scalp and fold it neatly inside out against the sterile pad the just put under your head. A part of you insists you should feel scared, but instead you're just excited. This is actually happening. Then your vision gets blocked by your forehead getting folded down over your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh... Your eyebrows look weird upside down and tinted red by the light filtering through the skin behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a tugging sensation you can numbly half-feel slowly making a circle around your head where the skin and muscle have been peeled back. In some distant way you know that should probably hurt, but it just feels odd instead. The tugging sensation is gone now, and the top of your head doesn't feel numb any more. It doesn't feel like anything. After that you hear someone say that both patients are ready for 'stage two', and a moment later your senses start cutting out one after another. First hearing, then sight, smell, touch, all of the secondary senses, then large chunks of your body seem to go numb and fade away one after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon there is only your thoughts. It would be alarming but you expected this. It's actually quite calm. Peaceful.<br>\r\nIt is so bizarre being fully awake yet completely unaware of the world.<br>\r\n<i>I'm probably just a brain now.</i> you think to yourself.<br>\r\nPart of you can't help but wonder if there's a way to make this a regular thing, it's really relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll probably be like this for a while. the info pamphlet said something about an 8 hour recovery period for the grafted brain to bond to it's new body... you had assumed you would be asleep or off in some sedative induced la-la-land for that part, but it seems not...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhile you have time to think though, something you hadn't put much consideration into comes to mind... who should you tell about this after it's done?</span></div></div>",

That's kind of convenient since the hairdresser always knew what you wanted and you didn't have to talk to her all the time and instead read your comics. You wear glasses, the big ones, since those were the cheapest. Your breasts were kind of average; you didn't think much of them. After all you wear baggy clothes most of the times, jeans and sweaters that always looked too big on your petite frame. But who cares about things like that? You had a best friend after all, Abby and she was a nerd like yourself. Most afternoons you ended up in one of your rooms reading comics and discussing the latest episodes of GoT. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stepmother however didn't understand your life and you didn't understand hers either. That's why you suggested this brain transplant, a perfect opportunity since you were curious how it would be switching brains. Your stepmother agreed immediately and the appointment was set up. You filled the form in and hand it back to the receptionist. She looked through it and then pointed you to a room where you needed to go in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room a female doctor, her black hair in a strict bun, was standing. She explained you needed to undress yourself and put on the hospital gown after which the procedure would get started. You simply nod your head as the doctor leaves you to get undressed. With a deep breath you pulled off the thick sweater you were wearing together with the loose jeans. The plain white bra and the panties had to go as well. Looking down at your body you realize it would be a while before you would see it again and feel it of course. You quickly pull on the hospital gown after which the doctor came back.

The doctors would cut open your head with a special laser, disconnect your brain from your body, doing the same thing with your stepmother and then connect everything together. The only downside was that the procedure would take a few hours. You just nod your head as you are dying to see this thing through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor then told you to lie on the stretcher they prepared for you. You lie down on it and as you are wondering what would happen next you feel the sharp point of a needle in your arm. \"Sorry.\" The doctor excuses herself. \"We just need to inject you with this special formula we created. It's not like you are being anesthetized but something similar to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what will happen?\" You ask her curious. The doctor then looks around like she shouldn't tell you. \"The formula we created will allow the connections your brain makes to your body be, how should I put it? disconnected. Of course we need to replace all bodily functions with machines and that's why we need to hurry up to the operation room.\" The doctor nods to you as she moves the stretcher with you on it away to the operating room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangest is that the formula sounds like nonsense to you, but you are feeling it's effects slowly. Already you can't feel your feet anymore. You hope that it will be over soon. Being pulled into the operating room you can see another stretcher already be there; probably your stepmother lying on it. The doctors turn you around making you and your stepmother's heads close to one another. Without anyone saying anything you feel a mask being put on you. Gas enters through the mask and you can't help but breath the gas in. You try to stay awake, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, but you feel dizzy and fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you know, you are somewhere else. You feel different somehow; like someone has cut off all your limbs and your floating somehow without the need to breath. You can remember that the doctor told you about that your brains were supposed to be placed inside a jar. To make sure your brains got enough nutrients to make the jump into another body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought about being just a brain inside a jar gives you a feeling of joy, were it not that you couldn't do anything or see anything.

Not your friends nor your family. You both have to pretend to be the other person so that you really can experience the other's life. It was one of the things you both agreed on. Your father and your best friend both thought that you and your stepmother are on vacation, to strengthen the bond, at least that's the lie you both told them. As the procedure takes the whole week you needed a valid excuse not to make them suspicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're thinking this whole thing through you suddenly feel some sort of trembling. It's hard to feel being only a brain but it feels like you, or rather brain, is being shaken while being inside the jar. It probably means that your brain is charged with enough nutrients to survive the jump into your stepmother's brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a notice you suddenly feel something grabbing hold of you. It tries to hold firm but gently as not to damage your brain. The person raises you out of the jar as you no longer can feel the water you were gently floating in. It's an experience of itself and you hope you can do it sometime again. But not for now, now you were going to be transplanted into your new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor's put you into your stepmother's open skull. As you're curious to know what the next thing is, you feel yourself being covered in some kind of substance. It's then that you suddenly feel amazing, fantastic even! Like you could spread yourself all around. And surprisingly that feeling becomes reality as you develop little nerves trying to connect with your stepmother's body. As time passes you can feel yourself spreading around even faster. And as the last nerve gets connected a rumbling sensation occurs in your brain knocking you out. The doctors who are in charge of operation know the operation is a success and you and your stepmother are returned to private rooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before continuing how does your stepmother look? Is she small but full-figured or is average length and skinny?</span></div></div>",

She has long curly brown hair that rests on her shoulders, her face like her figure is rather big, showing off her double chin. She can't help it though as eating is one of her favorite hobbies. That's why she's always cooking in the kitchen, trying to get you to eat some more as well. Sadly you have to pass as you are lactose intolerant. A pleasant thought occurs that while in your stepmother's body you can finally get to eat one of her cakes. And with that thought in mind you suddenly fall asleep as your brain finds itself hooked to your stepmother's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up your eyes open wide as you look around you. It looks like some hospital room, the white walls, the linoleum floor and of course that familiar odor that hospitals always carried with them.

You can feel your fingers touching the sheets covering you, your feet resting on the mattress, your hair lying on your shoulder.

While you usually tend to put your feet completely on the ground, you now automatically put your toes down first and then the rest of your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemarkable. You think as you look at the wall in front of you. Then again, it's not the only different thing. The rest of your upper body feels different as well. It's like someone has shoved down a whole pile of pillows down your throat. You feel so large. But you try not to think about it until you have checked yourself out. You step gently on the ground, the moment you do you feel yourself being pulled forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, easy there.\" You tell yourself. Even your voice sounds different. Neat! You then quickly make your way to the bathroom feeling your behind gently jiggling. She's not only top heavy, but down below she has a jiggly ass as well. <br>\r\nOpening the door and stepping inside you take a deep breath of air as you prepare yourself mentally. This is even way more exciting than the last episode of GOT. Stepping in front of the mirror you see your stepmother's surprised look looking back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is real.\" You tell yourself as you step closer to look at your reflection. There it is, your stepmother's face. Her chubby cheeks, her shiny brown eyes which look a bit dull at the moment. Her long curly hair is all messed up but you don't pay much attention to it, you never found your hair that important at all. You're only missing the light amount of make-up. Some mascara and red lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you take a look down. Your stepmother's body; you swallow hard as this is something you were hoping for. You were always so thin like a stick, but now you feel like a real woman. You see the large breasts sticking out from underneath the hospital gown; the rolls of fat that cling to your gut; though you were surprised by your stepmother's legs. There were sturdy, but not fat or anything like that. Though they are larger than your own. Turning around and looking back you can see the ass you have now. It looks big and doughy. Exactly as you would want it to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's then at that moment that a thought occurs to you; should you try to check things out further? Or would it be too awkward and be something better for at home?</span></div></div>",

The doctors would cut open your head with a special laser, disconnect your brain from your body, doing the same thing with your granny and then connect everything together back again. The only downside was that the procedure would take a few hours. You just nod your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse then points you to a folding screen where you change into an hospital gown. You undress yourself and pull on the hospital gown instead, feeling like a real patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are then taken to an operating room where you have to lie on the stretcher. You lie down on it and as you are wondering what would happen next you feel the sharp point of a needle in your arm. \"Sorry.\" The doctor excuses herself. \"We just need to inject you with this special formula we created. It's not like you are being anesthetized but something similar to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what will happen?\" You ask her curious. The doctor then looks around like she shouldn't tell you. \"The formula we created will allow the connections your brain makes to your body be, how should I put it disconnected. Of course we need to replace all bodily functions with machines. So you get to sleep soon.\" She tells you as she goes off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangest is that the formula sounds like nonsense to you, but you are feeling it's effects slowly. Already you can't feel your feet anymore. You hope that it will be over soon. Being pulled into the operating room you can see another stretcher already be there; probably your granny lying on it. The doctors turn you around making you and your granny's heads close to one another. \"Good luck sweetie.\" She tells you. Before you can reply someone puts a mask on your face. Gas enters through the mask and you can't help but breath the gas in. You try to stay awake, but you feel dizzy and fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you know, you are somewhere else. You feel different somehow; like someone has cut off all your limbs and your floating somehow without the need to breath. You can remember that the doctor told you about that your brains were supposed to be placed inside a jar. To make sure your brains got enough nutrients to make the jump into another body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought about being just a brain inside a jar gives you a feeling of anxiety, were it not for your granny you wouldn't have done this. You just hope this is over fast and good. You weren't looking forward to be some brain in a jar for all of eternity. Then something pushes down on you and you feel yourself floating in the air, before being lied down. Was this perhaps the part of brain being put inside your granny's head? You can only hope and pray this is over soon. As you are thinking if something is going to happen, you are hit with a shock and everything fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just feels like a few minutes, but it must have been hours as you open your eyes again. You have been brought in a hospital room it looks like. Everything looks different somehow, less sharp than before. Not to mention how different your body feels, it feels less energetic. And it feels like someone put something on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Granny.\" You realize as the words escape your granny's mouth.</span></div></div>",

Looking down you see the rest of your body being clad in the hospital gown. It looks so different. Your can see your hips sticking out much more, not to mention your breasts which are pulling down the gown. Raising your arms you can see your granny's chickenwings she always hated. Now yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's weird to look at her like that.\" You tell yourself as you admire yourself in the mirror. Though you are disappointed a little, you aged from 16 to 65.

Mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is from mah head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my snacky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continues for a few minutes, with each of them pulling on your brain. If you could feel what's going on, you'd be surprised you hadn't already been torn in half by now. Eventually, something happens, and the bodies go flying apart!</span></div></div>",

Get creative!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: Brain transplants should crate story branches, as in staying with the body or moving on with the brain in the new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3: there is no limit to what you can do with a brain.  For example, Increasing or Lowering I.Q. Is fair game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all for now, please enjoy your stay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This story will obviiously only begin here, and revisit the center for additional swaps and such.  Please feel free to continue on as to what you do after reciving the surgery!)</td>",
