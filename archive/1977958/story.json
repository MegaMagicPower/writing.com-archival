It had been a decade and a half since she'd married the brute, but she still couldn't get used to his obnoxious, boorish nature. She looked around to see herself surrounded by banners carrying the Baratheon coat of arms, a rearing black stag on a golden field. Longing for some more familiar Lannister crimson, she turned her head down to her plate. On it were the various delicacies the chef had determined worthy of the royal table. Resigned to enduring a night's conversation with her husband, Cersei began to absentmindedly pick at her roast pheasant, pairing it with copious amounts of Dornish Red to make the evening more tolerable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the meal wore on, Cersei concentrated as much as possible on eating, it being the only reprieve from the king. True to royal form, there was more than enough food to go around, and dutiful servants kept the queen's plate and cup full at all times. Despite using the meal as a distraction, she couldn't help but admit to herself that the cook had really done an excellent job with this feast; she even asked for seconds of the boar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the king to entertain \"their\" guests, Cersei devoured each course set before her. Bread was followed by a thick, creamy soup, oysters, fish, pheasant, boar, beef, capon, all with their own side dishes. Usually a light eater, Cersei felt no such reservations with this meal. She slurped down her soup with such gusto that the servers could barely bring her the next course before she'd downed her entire bowl. The seafood was tasty enough as well, but the true highlight of the meal was the meats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poultry fell apart in her mouth with every bite. It was so good that after the first few bites of pheasant she resorted to using her hands to shovel the meat into her mouth, unconcerned that proper etiquette dictated that she use her silverware. She tore voraciously at the meat, her teeth ripping it off the bone with such gusto it was as if she feared it would be taken from her. She was so focused on devouring the succulent dishes before her that she paid no mind to the grease coming from them with every bite that covered her hands and spilled down onto her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of main courses, the kitchen began to bring out the desserts. Lemon cakes, pies, and all manner of sweets covered the banquet table, each one as tempting as the last. Having drunk far too much wine over the course of the night to think of restraint, her majesty immediately grabbed the nearest pastry and shoved it into her mouth. It was a glazed roll, flavored with spices brought all the way from Yi Ti. The delicious richness of it did nothing to sate her gluttony, however, and she quickly moved on to the next treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis put predictable strain on her dress, so mush so that about halfway through the feast she commanded a serving girl to loosen the strings on her corset, which was so tight breathing had become a chore. Though those at the table were too besotted to take notice of her greed, the servants were very aware of their master's behavior. The drinking was nothing out of the ordinary, but to see the queen gorge herself so was a juicy piece of gossip indeed.</span></div></div>",

She had heavier matters on her mind; specifically, what to do about Joffrey. At first, she'd been excited about her betrothal to him. However, in the short time since then, she'd come to realize what a terrible person he was. But now it was beyond her control. The marriage would bring the Stark and Baratheon houses closer together, just as Lyanna's should have. Wondering what she could do to prevent this union, she grabbed the next lemon cake and began munching as she tried to think of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ONE WEEK LATER</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It was a chilly morning in Winterfell, and Sansa was eager to get into some warm clothes. Unfortunately for her, the servants were having trouble tying up her undergarments around her newly ample frame. After an extended struggle, she finally managed to squeeze into them, but they were so tight that it was a labor every time she inhaled. Putting on a brave face and taking shallow breaths, she headed down to breakfast. To her dismay, a hearty meal proved to much for the stitching on her dress, which tore apart along a seam halfway through her third sausage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Sansa indignantly bade her servants fetch the seamstress, so she could chew her out. Unable to resist, she continued eating while waiting for them to return. After two more sausages, three eggs, and a handful of well buttered rolls, the castle seamstress burst into the room, apologizing profusely for being so lax in preparing new clothes for Sansa to accommodate her womanly figure. Not wanting to talk to the help longer than necessary, she accepted the apology and told her to be more proactive in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Just as the seamstress was finishing up with taking measurements, Old Nan walked in. She took a look at the dimensions marked down for her new clothes, and true to her typical candor, had no reservations about mentioning them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I see you're not missing any meals,\" she remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh please, I'm becoming a woman. I can hardly expect not to grow,\" Sansa retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Most certainly M'lady,\" Old Nan agreed, \"but usually in the hips and breasts more than the waist. It appears as you've done well distributing quite a lot of growth to your stomach.\" To prove her point, she grabbed a handful of Sansa's newly pudgy midriff. \"I can't imagine the Prince would be happy to see his bride turn into a cow before the wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Sansa began to retort, but it got caught in throat as an idea dawned on her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Arya Stark was not a lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, rather, she did not wish to be a lady. In truth, she had no choice in the matter, being the secondborn daughter and thirdborn child of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell and Catelyn Tully of Riverrun. Arya reviled the thought of spending her days married to some pompous lordling, an idea her elder sister relished, whilst her brothers got to be knights and soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya knew there was nothing she could do to persuade her parents to go against all the traditions of the Seven Kingdoms, but she had come up with another way to avoid being married off: she was going to get fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo man would ever want to take a fat girl to bride, Arya reasoned, and so if she piled on extra weight she would never be forced to live out the life of a lady; she could remain at Winterfell and train with weapons just like her brothers. Jon would help her with that. She could spend her days adventuring in the Wolfswood and playing games in the Winter Town. And all this dream would cost was a little bit of flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya initiated her scheme early in 298 AC. She had never eaten so much before in her life at that first dinner. In total she consumed about a dozen steamy sausauges, a hefty side of venison, multitudes of roast potatoes and a third of a pie before she found herslef incapable of continuing. Her family had been shocked, to say the least. Sansa and her mother had been absolutely mortified at the amount Arya ate, while her brothers had been amused, with Robb and Jon cheering her on as she drove her fork through her tenth potato. Arya had stumbled to bed that night, her stuffed stomach distended beyond what she had previously thought possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya had been carrying out her plan for close on a week now, and had a slight layer of pudge over her stomach. She found she quite enjoyed poking at her newfound fat with her fingers and feeling how far they sunk into the excess flesh, which admittedly wasn't yet very far, but at least they were sinking into something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now an expected part of any meal for Arya to gorge herself; the Stark girl's mother was still horrified by the amount her daughter was eating, but had not yet moved to attempt to stop her. Sansa was very disapproving: Arya had once heard her say to Jeyne Poole (in a very loud voice) that her sister was more like a pig than a lady. Arya had smiled at that. Her father seemed indifferent to the affair, although his eyes flicked to Arya more commonly than they used to during meals. Rickon didn't seem to care about Arya's gluttony at all. Robb and Jon thought her new appetite was brilliant; they both sometimes challenged her to eating competitions during meals (to the stern disapproval of Catelyn Stark). Bran had also combatted her in a battle of consumption once before, losing dismally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArya was smiling as she thought of the past week, treading through the clamorous Great Yard of Winterfell. She suddenly stopped, having heard a very particular word coming from her mother's direction. It was Maester Luwin speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...king also wishes to travel to Winterfell, my lady, to see your lord husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king?! Arya's smile widened over the course of a few seconds as she realised all that meant. The king coming to Winterfell would mean a great feast, perhaps several of them, would be provided to suitably welcome the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms to the ancestral home of the Starks. Arya licked her lips and pressed her still skinny hand against her sliver of pudge as thoughts of rich, fattening foods entered her mind.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So, he seems to suddenly get very mature, becoming a good and just King. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could be a giving lover and stay loyal to Cersei, convincing her to become a loyal Queen and making her a gluttonous SSBBW, so fat that Jaime loses interest in her, while her loving husband only gets more and more interested in her, the more she indulges herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he can have his men track down Viserys and Daenerys, taking them on as wards. Viserys is already bitter, but Daenerys is still young enough to be molded into a good and decent Lady of house Targaryen. With Robert's guidance, she might grow up into a courtly BBW. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he'll have sons of his own with Cersei, and they'll be actually his children. Being raised properly means that they'll be kind and courteous and never spoiled brats. They might end up becoming feeders themselves, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, with the Queen getting so fat and the King so clearly happy about it, presumably the Seven Kingdoms are going to be having a surge of Ladies getting fat for the prestige! </span></div></div>",
