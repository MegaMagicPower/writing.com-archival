Unfortunately, the machine has a 24 hour wait time after doing it so you are stuck like this.

A giant face high above you enters your vision. It is your mother. Either she has grown huge, or you have shrunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there!\" she smiles. Her giant hand picks you up like you are nothing. She turns to the mirror. You see your mother holding a flip flop in her hand. No one else is around. Suddenly you realize. YOU ARE THE FLIP FLOP. You try to scream but no sound escapes your new inanimate body. Your mother then turns your face to meet hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you're wondering what happened. Well, I recently found out that the BSM was capable of transferring a human consciousness into a non-human body. Naturally I wanted to test the limits of it so I used you. Sorry about that.\" She turns you around so quickly you feel like barfing. You see your body, motionless still on the chair.<br>\r\n\"Your body is on stand by. This is what we're gonna do. The BSM needs 24 hours to cool down. So you're stuck like this until then. But don't worry, you won't be lonely or bored. You're gonna be worn by Kari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom picks you up and takes you upstairs. She puts you next to the door with the other flip-flop, then calls Kari down.

It's just without a complex mind like a human has, you're giving in to your new lot in life. I'm sorry you have to deal with this, but as long as I have a say, this is my body and you're just the flip flop. Hope you enjoy that life more than I did! Summers are lovely by the way. The sweat, the smell, the.. well, you get the point.

The one person who could report the swap had been swapped as well! But where did Kari end up? And what were you?? Suddenly, she sat up and looked straight down at you \u201cWow, I sure did look weird and small. Can\u2019t believe I use to be just a toe! Being human feels great! I don\u2019t know who you are, but good luck as a toe! Ooo! I know, why don\u2019t I get you accustomed by painting your nail? Might as well get you used to your new life. I figured it out at that point. It was a 3 way swap. Kari\u2019s big toe swapped into her body, Kari became her own flip flop and I sadly became her big toe. She started walking which felt so weird compared to being a shoe, ad she left poor Kari back still on the chair probably freaking out about her new permanent life as her own shoe. Not too much better for me.. As we got to her room, she pulled out her nail polish and said \u201cPurple sounds lovely! Enjoy your new life toe. You\u2019ll be pretty in just a minute don\u2019t worry!\u201d As she started painting me, it felt so odd but satisfying. I suddenly was seeing purple and she told me I looked \u201ccute\u201d. As she finished up the other toes, she put me in front of a mirror and there I was.. A big bulbous toe with a purple coating of nail polish on me. How could I live with this? This is terrible! But as I thought that. All my mind shut down. I stopped thinking and my thoughts were replaced by thoughts of toe. I started enjoying my reflection and my new life. Hopefully Kari enjoys being her flip flop forever! I\u2019ll enjoy being this nice big toe! I\u2019m so pretty.</span></div></div>",
