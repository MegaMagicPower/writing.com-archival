Valentine's day was coming up fast, and he was looking for a place to get something for a girl he wanted to impress. \"Okay, let's see here...\" He said in a quiet, desperate voice, \"She likes baked goods, so... Muffins! That'll get her attention!\" With a plan set in his head, he bolted to the local bakery. This bakery is a bit strange. It just sort of... showed up one day. Everyone was confused, but ultimately accepted it as it was the best way to get baked goods. They had the norm for a bakery. Breads, cakes, heck, even pretzels! But their most popular foodstuff was their line of muffins, which were said to have a surprise in each flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tom got near the bakery, he slowed down a bit, just so he didn't freak the staff out. When he entered, he was greeted by a nice young woman, who said \"Hello! Welcome to our bakery! What can I get you today?\" Tom steadily walked up to the counter and said, \"Hey, I'm trying to impress this girl, and I was wondering if you had anything that could help.\" He was forcing himself to look at her face, because her chest looked to be at least Double D's. Heck, maybe even I's. \"I think we have just the thing.\" The lady responded. However, what he didn't know is that the lady was reading his mind, especially his secret thoughts, like his fetishes. She went into the backroom, and came back with a box of three muffins, two of which had green frosting. \"Just give her these, and she won't ever want to leave your side. Not to Yandere levels of love, but more of true love.\" She explained. \"Also, if you really want to get her attention, give her half of this one.\" She added gesturing to the hazelnut muffin. \"Okay, thank you! How much do I owe?\" Tom asked. \"First timers are on the house.\" She said. Tom thanked her again, and left. \"Cause their first time here is their only time here.\" The woman chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, it was Valentine's day. AsTom walked through the town, he eventually turned into the forest. As he strolled through the trees, he checked the box of muffins. There was a Vanilla and Nectarine muffin, both with green frosting, and a hazelnut muffin, which seemed pretty plain. On the top of the box was a golden star, which Tom had no clue on what to make sense of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wandering around the woods for a few minutes, he eventually reached a clear pond, and sitting next to it was the girl of his dreams...</span></div></div>",

After 3 seconds he pulled out a muffin...which, really, looked like a cupcake. It was pretty much the same muffin Natalie ate, but with blue icing. Eyes still shut, Andrew ate the muffin in two bites and Natalie watched in amazement as Andrews body began to glow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kurly was wandering about the shop, looking for something to do. She ended up going in the muffin storage area, which, conveniently, had a mirror in it. She noticed the mirror and took a better look at herself. She still looked a lot like a doll, with the exception that she now had a mouth...and apparently some organs. She looked at her diaper and found it, surprisingly, wet. As weird as it was, she kind of liked it. It made her seem much cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne transformation into a female later, Andrew's--or should I say Andrea's, new panties started thickening, and thickening, and thickening. Seconds later, the panties, now a diaper, stopped growing. The diaper was 12\" thick, reaching down to her knees. \"Wow,\" Natalie said in amazement, \"that's crazy.\" Andrea blushed at this comment. \"So, you feel better?\" Natalie smiled. \"Yes. I do.\" Suddenly, there was a beeping heard between them. Natalie checked her watch. \"Oh shoot! I'm gonna be late for school! C'mon Kurly--\" it was then she realized her doll wasn't in the room. \"Kurly? Kurly, where are you?!\" Andrea noticed Natalie looked ready to have a nervous break-down. \"I'm sure we'll find her,\" she told her \"she can't have gone too far. I'll help you look.\" They started looking around when they heard a clatter a minute later. \"Oh no, she must be in the storage room!\" Thus, they ran off to the source of the sound...well, Andrea waddled. \"So,\" Natalie started saying to Andrea, \"I got a chance to look over the menu while you were changing. Are those chocolate ones in there too?\" Andrea shook her head. \"No, they're not. I prefer to keep them in a different, more secure room since the *effects work once unless a higher rank is consumed,* so it'd be wasting if any thieves broke in and started eating all the muffins.\" When they finally reached the door, they opened it and found Kurly and a few muffins floating around her. \"Huh,\" Natalie said in surprise, \"I didn't think she'd have powers too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Example: Someone eats a Bronze Chocolate Cuteness[1/2 orig. age]. Eating another won't regress them further. However, if they eat a silver one, they will be regressed further...but that only makes them 1/4 their original age or 1/2 current age.<br>\r\nAnd no, eating a gold and then a silver will not regress or progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote for C2: We'll be following Natalie for a while. Don't worry, we'll eventually get back to Andrew/ea...and we'll meet a new character. But that's for later.<br>\r\nNote for both choices: Being the first customer ever for the bakery [in this town], Natalie gets a watch that allows her to call Andrew/ea and have him/her send muffins.</span></div></div>",

Nobody really seemed to pay attention to the diapered duo except for Nat's friend, Jessica. \"Hey Nat,\" Jess said as she sat next to her BF5e and gave a quick hug, \"Hey Kurly,\" she said to the doll, pinching her cheek. The two humans started talking while Kurly rubbed her cheek. Sure, she had no nerves to feel pain, but it still felt weird. Minutes later, the bell rang and Jess had to leave...but not before jokingly smacking her friend's rear.

Once she was done with her friend, she moved on to changing Kurly. While the mid-stage Pok\u00e9doll was being changed, Jess stared at her diapered tush in the mirror, giving it the occasional poke. \"Do you like it?\" Nat said as Kurly hugged her leg, happy to be in a fresh diaper. Jess blushed brightly, muttering \"Yes\" as she looked at the floor, \"thanks.\" While Jess didn't show it, she loved the diaper, so much that part of her wished it was forever. Kurly, being the Emotion Pok\u00e9mon, motioned for Nat to kneel down so she could tell her about the feelings she picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jess,\" Nat said, getting her friend's attention, \"Kurly tells me you kind of want to stay in diapers permanently...is this true?\" Jess was startled to have found that Kurly somehow knew, only to remember the species name for Kirlia. Jess couldn't find the words for what she wanted to say, but Nat grabbed onto her shoulder and said \"It's okay, I can understand.\" Jess eyes started to get teary as she hugged her friend. Around 10 seconds later, Jess had regained her composure, glad her friend accepted her. \"You know,\" Nat spoke up, \"I can make it happen.\" Jess seemed ready to burst with happiness when she heard that. \"Really?!\" \"Yes. I know someone with some magic muffins that can make you incontinent...and, from what I can tell, everyone would seem to think you've been that way all your life. I can call him up if you want.\" Jess nodded her head with absolute delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat pulled back the sleeve of her shirt, revealing a watch. Pressing a button made a holographic version of Andrea appear. \"Hi, Nat! How're you doing?\" The holograph asked in a cheery voice. \"Fine. A friend of mine actually would like a Baby Blueberry muffin.\" \"Oh, is that so? I suppose that would be her?\" She said as she pointed at Jess, causing the girl to blush further. \"Well, what would you like? There's Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum.\" Jess thought for a second and replied \"Well, the Gold and Platinum ones sound nice.\" Andrea looked a bit worried upon hearing that. \"Are you sure? Gold is 1 foot thick, going down to your knees. I can at least waddle in such a thickness since I'm used to it. You'd be stuck crawling.\" Upon hearing that Nat thought about how adorable Jess would look crawling around, eventually thinking about how she'd look crawling. \"As for the Platinum ones, I hope you don't plan on going anywhere. That's TWO FEET of padding, going down to your ankles. It's better off as a seat.\" Jess stubbornly stomped her foot on the ground, snapping Nat out of her day-dream, crossed her arms and said \"I've made up my mind! I want...</span></div></div>",

Okay Natalie, since you brought the point up, maybe you should choose which one\" Natalie smiled \"Well, you still need to be an adult so you should eat a bronze one.\" Andrea said \"Yeah, that's a good point. Here, watch if you want.\" She ate the muffin and felt everything about her getting stronger. She was now 28, C cups, and a very nice butt. Jess giggled \"You look good.\" Andrea blushed hearing this but smiled. The muffin arrived where they were.

Well, go ahead and eat up.\" Jess hungrily devoured the muffin, as it seems she skipped breakfast. With the muffin gone and Jess, surprisingly, full [according to Andrea, in cases like those, a muffin can supply the same amount of nourishment you'd get from a bowl of cereal], the magic started working. While Nat had expected the diaper Jess was already wearing to gain an additional foot worth of padding, it actually just doubled. Turns out that the first muffin will start from 0 no matter what, meaning if Jess had chosen a bronze muffin, her padding would've thinned 33%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Jess saw what Andrea meant. She wasn't used to such a large amount of padding and ended up falling on her tush. She didn't regret it, however, as she felt the extremely soft and comfortable inside. It was like heaven. Unfortunately, this slice of heaven was cut short as the warning bell, better known as the \"LOL, ALL YOU LOSERS GUN BE LATE\" bell, went off. \"Well, looks like I got to get back to work,\" Andrea sighed, \"and you three should get to class.\" With that, the little holograph disappeared. Jess tried standing up again, Kurly giving her a bit of a hand with her Psychic, but soon realized that if it was this hard trying to stand, waddling would be hell. So, for the time being, she decided to settle with crawling. Once the three were out of the bathroom, it was time for Jess to split from Nat and Kurly...sort of. Jess' first period class is right next door to Nat's. Which is good, as it allowed Kurly to give some quick, Psychic assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFun fact: I actually like math. :c</span></div></div>",

There were bean-bag chairs, a not-so-mini fridge, a bunch of consoles, and tons of games. Nat joyfully leapt into a chair, Jess leaping into the one next to her with the help of Kurly. While the two girls got down onto some Mario Kart Wii, Kurly ran off to feed her curiosity. It wasn't a long adventure, as she found a strange switch. Above it was text that read \"WEATHER MACHINE.\" She tried pulling on the lever, realizing that it would be a lot easier if she were a real Kirlia and not a doll. However, her effort had paid off as the lever flew to the left onto the rain setting. Suddenly, the sidewalk and street were soaked, as well as any unfortunate pedestrians. Kurly's amazement at the rain was cut short when she smelled a gross smell. She looked down at her diaper to see that it had been messed...really badly, at that. \"How is that even possible?\" That wasn't her only question, though. She also wondered when this had happened. She decided to give something a try, grabbed the lever, and pulled once more. Knowing it would go nowhere, she focused of her diapered behind. Sure enough, more lumps started showing up on the back of her diaper. Kurly let go of the lever and decided to head back to Nat, at the same time rubbing the back of her diaper and realizing she could've used Psychic the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea, meanwhile, was in the bakery, opening packages that held two new muffin types. Once everything was stocked, she decided to try one out. She pulled out a muffin, apparently called Nursing Nectarine, took off the silver cup...thing [what are those even called?] and ate all of it and a mere second. Just as quickly, her breasts felt like something was inside of them...and it was too big for the mounds to handle, because they hurt like hell. Andrea quickly grabbed, and ate, a bronze Marvelous Melon and the pain eventually stopped as her breasts started growing. She read through the instructions for the Nectarine muffins, put the paper down, and had a mischievous grin. Andrea knew Nat and Jess were just playing hooky. She only let them stay because she thought she could us some company. Now it was time for a little fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the game room, Nat and Jess had switched to Super Smash Bros. Brawl. They were going through Subspace Emissary while Kurly, who was glad to be in a fresh diaper, watched. Jess had beaten Nat for the 10th time using Pikachu when Andrea waddled in. \"Hey girls! Thirsty?\" Nat and Jess looked at each other for a moment before nodding. With that, Andrea removed her apron, shirt, and bra, leaving her in nothing but an absurdly thick diaper, as the two watched the older woman's nipples leak a bit of milk. Both turned pale as Nat said \"On second thought, no thanks.\" Andrea looked at them sternly. \"Look, I know you two are ditching, and unless you want me to call you principal and parents, you'll start drinking.\" With the speed of Usain Bolt, the two girls latched onto Andrea's breasts and started suckling. Nat had to admit, the milk was delicious and creamy. \"Alright, that's enough,\" Andrea said a minute later as the two girls backed-up and the shop owner put her clothes back on. Good timing, too, because the bell on the door rang, signaling that a customer arrived. Andrea went to greet the customer, as well as take their order, and Nat decided to peek out and see who it was. It was her crush, Nathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat snuck around to a table in a corner, pretending to have just noticed Nathan. \"Oh, Nate, Hi!\" Nat shouted to the jock. Nathan turned and replied \"Oh, hey! Natalie, right?\" Nat walked up to him and giggled. \"Yeah. Say, what are you doing here?\" The short girl barely made it up to Nathan's chest as she quickly rubbed a finger down his stomach. \"Oh, I'm just picking up a snack before I start practice. What are you doing here?\" \"Oh, you know, just hanging out.\" Nathan got to ordering while Kurly quietly ran over to Nat, poked her leg to get her attention, and then pointed at Nat's diaper. Turns out, Nat's been so nervous that she's been wetting and messing herself non-stop. Her diaper sagged down to her knees, and now that she knew, it made her even more nervous, which caused her to wet and mess even faster. At this point, the weight of her diaper forced her to sit down...right on her waste. \"Now I know how Kurly felt.\" To be honest, though, it wasn't that bad. Once Nathan got his food, he turned and knelt down to be at eye level with Nat, making her even more nervous. \"Later, Nat.\" After two mere words, Nathan got up and left, allowing Nat to finally calm down. She swooned and fell backwards, allowing Andrea to change her. \"I think he likes me.\" Was all she said during the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kurly had once again wandered into the muffin storage room she was in that morning [reminder: there's two different ones. One for the age muffins and one for the others. The one Kurly's in is for others]. Using Psychic, she grabbed 10 random muffins off the shelves. She was feeling rather mischievous herself, and it's safe to say that everyone better be prepared for trouble. In fact, she decided to make it double and grabbed 10 more. What could she possibly do with 20 muffins she randomly picked?</span></div></div>",

She took 3 random ones from her 20 supply. She got a Silver Viewtiful Vanilla out and split it in half, giving one to Nat and one to Jess. The girls blushed as their breasts, butt, and hips got larger, their cloths unfortunately not accepting the changes and bursting open other than their diapers which grew with them.

Andrea watched helplessly as her bust expanded and a button fell off of her shirt. Luckily, she saw the red icing and knew that if she kept her cool, no more buttons would be lost. Unfortunately, Kurly was nowhere near finished, and with Nat and Jess stuck in lust, Andrea had no choice but to go with it. She opened her mouth, letting Kurly place two Platinum Powerful Pears into it. Andrea could feel her butt expanding, her diaper adjusting to fit perfectly, and her legs get slightly longer. Kurly had to admit, the muffins made everyone look better. After stuffing two whole Gold Vanilla muffins in each of Nat and Jess' mouths, Kurly decided to try a muffin herself, which just happened to be a Platinum Grand Grape. Nat snapped out of her hormones just in time to see Kurly grow two feet. She was now about as tall as Nat, give or take an inch. Kurly had just finished stuffing a Platinum Sweet Strawberry into Jess' mouth when Nat yelled \"Kurly, STOP!\" Nat's harsh tone of voice had caused Kurly to stop using Psychic, resulting in the remaining muffins falling to the floor and Andrea muttering something about wasting. Nat stood up, staring furiously into Kurly's eyes. Kurly had seen those eyes before, but never because of her. The fact that Nat was practically eye-level with her made her even more scared, causing her to break down into tears. \"Kurly, go to the game room. We'll talk in a moment.\" Nat's voice was serious and Kurly definitely didn't like the word \"talk.\" Not wanting to anger Nat further, she ran off sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrea, I'm <i>so</i> sorry about Kurly,\" Nat began, already breaking the two rules Andrea had given them minutes ago, \"I don't know what got into Kurly--\" she would've continued her apology had Andrea not put a finger to her lips. \"It's okay, Nat. Remember, Kurly's been a doll her whole life. No matter how long you've had her, she'll always act the same age.\" Andrea cast a glance at the muffins in the trash can. \"Though, that's just a theory of mine. It's possible that the crumbs that brought her to life could've also affected her mental age.\" Andrea looked towards one of the mirrors and saw that there were wet patches visible on her shirt. She sighed and told the girls she'd be right back as she walked off. Jess, meanwhile, was still staring lovingly at Nat, despite now being 1 foot shorter than her now. Nat noticed this and blushed. For some reason, Nat wanted to just make out with Jess right then and there. However, Andrea came back just before it could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed differently now. Her button-up shirt was now replaced with a rather comfortable looking sweater. Her apron was shorter, revealing her diaper MUCH more. She also had her hair in a ponytail. In her hands were two baby bottles of milk, one of which she handed to Nat and told her to drink up while she bottle-fed Jess, still in a trance. Nat didn't question it and started suckling on the nipple. As she drank, she could feel her heart changing in someway. It was when she cast a glance at Jess that she realized what. The effects of the Hearty Hazelnut were going away [though, she still had her natural bi-curiousness]. Jess seemed to be snapping out of her trance, as well as growing back to full size. Nat had quickly finished her bottle and decided it was time she scolded Kurly. As she walked off to the game room, a customer had walked into the shop. She had blonde hair and a pink dress, but what really stood out was her crown. She seemed to be a princess of sorts. That was her name, in fact, Princess Peach.</span></div></div>",
