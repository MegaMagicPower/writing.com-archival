I say we find a way to amuse ourselves.\" Etna says. \"We have the whole castle to ourselves and we don't have Laharl around to tell us to do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we really should. All we've pretty much done all week is sit around.\" Says Flonne, as they begin to think about what all they could do.</span></div></div>",

W-why'd I agree to this!?\"</i> Etna thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her body starts to grow round, Flonne starts to roll Etna over so that she's upright. Etna finds that she's involuntarily farting from being filled with so much gas. However, her mind is too attached to the actual act of Flonne farting into her.

They were practically glued to the couch the entire time. All of their over-indulging and laziness had taken its toll on their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well, that's the last one...\" Etna said, mildly disappointed, as the credits scrolled upwards over the scene of the final movie. She threw the now-empty bag of potato chips she had lying on her chest carelessly over her shoulder. The floor itself was riddled with crumbs, empty bags and wrappers, and even a few soda stains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, oh well. It was fun while it lasted.\" pouted Flonne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kinda tired...I guess we should get some rest now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna reached down beside her to pick up the remote and turn off the television, but to her surprise it wasn't there. \"Huh? Hey, Flonne have you seen the remote?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had it with you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm pretty sure I-\" Suddenly, Etna recalled the remote's new location. After eating so much, the devil girl and the fallen angel had become incredibly obese, at least 500 pounds for each of them. For some reason, they did not seem very bothered by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna herself had grown mainly in the abdominal region. Her flat, washboard stomach had swollen and fattened into three flabby rolls that rested heavily upon her chubby thighs. Each roll was slightly pale in coloration, and riddled with stretch-marks and some cellulite. The demon was no longer flat-chested, although her D-cup breasts were still not very impressive (in her opinion). Her butt was very big too, about five times as big as originally. It actually felt a little good to Etna to be so gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith fingers that resembled plump sausages, Etna dug deep in between her top and middle roll, eventually pulling out the remote. Etna grinned, her chubby red cheeks and double-chin giving her an almost comical look. Etna pressed the power button, and the television shut off. Belching in satisfaction, Etna leaned back and closed her eyes to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne couldn't help but smile at how adorable her friend looked, so round and chubby and peaceful. Like Etna, Flonne had also gotten extremely fat. In contrast to Etna, who was a belly girl, Flonne's ingested calories had taken up residence generally below the waist, in her thighs and butt. Her chest was only C-cup, and her flabby 'little' belly was just in the makings of a second roll. Her legs, however, flared out nearly four feet across both vertically and horizontally. Her hips were as thick as tree-trunks, but as soft and jiggly as jello. Her ass was like a pair of beach-balls had been attached to her behind, It had sunken so deeply into the pillows of the couch that it would probably leave a permanent imprint of her gigantic ass for all to see. Flonne was happy that she was so soft all over; it reflected her kind, caring personality well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, after finishing off a tiny bag of luke-warm mini-donuts she found crushed underneath her ass, Flonne drifted off to sleep as well.</span></div></div>",

Considering how often she had been at the receiving end of Etna's own mischief, what kept her from trying some of her own? Plus it wasn't as if anyone would honestly click the \"Help Etna get thin\" option for this story, so she prepared beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prinnes, execute phase FF (Furious Fattening)! Counterstrike!\" Flonne cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna was confused, but when she saw what the hell FF stood for, then she got worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors burst open and Prinnies rushed in, holding plate after plate of food, which was carelessly tossed and filled into Etna's mouth. The bloated Demoness could only sit back, unable to use her arms properly to stop the Prinnies and her mouth was too full of food to bark orders at them! She felt her already grand self begin to swell out, becoming more bulbous and larger as dish after dish was popped into her mouth, which she was forced to eat and swallow. 1000 Prinnes, 1000 dishes. Or so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, a group of Prinnies staggered in, holding a giant hot pot above them, carrying it on a huge wood platform over their small shoulders. Etna gasped at the sight of it, which may not have been the smartest thing as it only gave them an opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Prinnies! Fill her until she can take no more!\" Flonne cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it. Master Etna, dood! This is for all those hours we spent working for you, earning one sardine less on average than your standard Prinny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Prinnes quickly poured soup in Etna's mouth before she could think to close it in time. The soup was so rich and thick and poured in so fast that Etna's mouth was forced open! Immediately, Etna's belly swelled with more fat, her breasts blowing up in front of her face as her corpulent butt, already jaw dropping in size, was pumped up and filled further and further, crushing the couch underneath her. Etna felt like a balloon being filled with food as she was forced to swallow and only gain more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">BBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPP!!!</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the last of the soup was poured, Etna unleashed a monstrous belch, signifying her new weight of 4,444 pounds. Etna's legs were thick, bloated masses and her feet were sucked inside, her arms standing out at the sides as puffy immovable masses of fat that couldn't be moved or bent at all. Etna moaned from fullness, wishing anyone would have the courtesy to rub her painfully full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne poked a finger into Etna's belly button, forcing an uncomfortable belch out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you look nice like this.\" Flonne giggled. She was teasing her, that much was obvious, but she was also telling the truth. There was a certain allure to getting her close friend all fattened up like this, feeding her copious amounts of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna on the other hand...</span></div></div>",

Etna and Flonne are relaxed to the point where they're half-asleep, though Flonne seems to be nodding off every now and then. They're unaware of what effect this is having on their bodies until Etna tries to sit up, only to feel her body stretch a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...my body feels all rubbery...\" Etna says. She groggily lifts up her arm, only to watch as most of it droops right back into the water. \"Oh. Oh!\" Etna shouts, fully awake and alert now that she fully realizes what's going on. \"Flonne, wake up, damnit! We're melting!\" she says as their bodies grow more fluid every few seconds, which becomes more noticeable as their limbs start to stretch and extend around the pool as it's waters slowly spin around, giving the tub a very odd flesh-colored lava lamp-like look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne yawns and snaps to attention as soon as she realizes she can't cup her mouth as she does, since her limbs are almost all the way over to where Etna is. \"I-I think this is probably the trap, Etna!\" Flonne exclaims, pretty much blurting the first thing that comes to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think!? Come on, we...I...I don't think we can do anything about this!\" Etna shouts, as she is unable to move her limbs at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne blinks, then giggles a bit. \"Well...we could just try to get relaxed again...I mean...this isn't so bad...I feel so loose and unwound, just like you always should when you relax, only literally this time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna sighs. \"I guess you're right. I mean...at least we'll be very hard to kill in this st-WAH!\" screams Etna, just as Flonne lets out an equally loud shout of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, everything below their heads are stretching around the tub several times, and Etna's outburst came from the feeling of her body and Flonne's becoming fluid enough to start blending together, forming a doughnut-like shape around the edge of the tub, with the hole in the middle slowly diminishing as their bodies start to lose all definition of where their limbs and such are and form into simply one large mass. The girls don't seem to be in any pain, however, with their previous shouts being out of surprise, instead. Not even their heads are able to avoid this, and most of Flonne's hair has become mixed up with the rest of their joined body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna laughs. \"Hah, what a stupid trap. All they did was make us unkillable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, this didn't turn out bad at all...now why don't we just relax as our heads melt into the rest of our body? I mean...this feels REALLY good...\" Says Flonne, as she and Etna start to feel tingly all over as their bodies start to blend together more throughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...this does have an interesting feel to it...\" Etna says, as her head finishes sinking into their bodily mass, leaving only her eyes sticking out of it as her hair swirls around. If they cared at the moment, the girls would be pondering their fate, though at this point they're too relaxed and into the new sensation they're feeling for that to cross their minds.</span></div></div>",

When the expansion slows down, their body is at 50 feet wide. While they're still expanding, it's rather negligible in comparison to their size overall, only growing an inch every few minutes. They are without limbs of any sort, though their puffy-cheeked heads still crown the top of their body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Etna-Flonne's growth slowed, Hanako and Taro are able to walk up close without having to worry about getting caught up in their rapid growth. \"Are you two alright up there!?\"  asks Hanako, while Taro presses a hand against their surface out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne giggles. \"It's pretty nice once you get used to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess it's not so bad.\" Etna says with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaro withdraws his hand. \"Wow, you're all round, but you're all soft and spongy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah!

That is, if it's even a problem right now.\" Hanako says, as she looks up at the Etna-Flonne as she says the last line. \"If you don't mind, there's no real reason to just let all the gas leave your body naturally, but if you do, we'll try to find way to you back to a much smaller size as soon as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna and Flonne take a moment to consider what they should do.</span></div></div>",

Isn't trying her up overkill?\" Flonne says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's not force feeding without making her unable to do anything about it.\" Etna says, as she turns to see Taro has tied Hanako's arms together while Hanako complains that the knot is too loose. \"If this was a real situation I would possibly try to escape from, I'd totally be able to do it!\" Hanako exclaims, pretty much as accepting of Etna's plan as Etna herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter properly getting her arms tied behind her, Etna and Flonne begin to feed Hanako the food she had made from them.

Suddenly, the walll shattered as someone gave a powerful running kick to the other side. Taro and Hanako duck to cover from oncoming debris, while Etna and Flonne just floated since they were a gas now.

Everyone else sweatdrop after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are going to fix us?\" Flonne ask in a polite voice. \"Simple.\" The writer search in the pouch of his prinny suit to pull out a hand vacuum. He aimed the device at the gas forms and turn it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a powerful suction the two gas clouds soon disappear within it's confinces. \"The vacuum gave a violent shake, \"Hey let us out!\" Etna's voice proclaim. The writer simple ignore it and soon started shaking it violentely, the two girls inside started getting dizzy. After shaking it for about a minute the writer than set the vacuum down gently on the floor infront of him. Taro and Hanako got to both sides next to him, \"What's next?\" Taro ask. The writer's sunglasses gave a malevolent glint in its reflection as the writer raise one one leg. \"One reincarnation coming up!\" The writer said as he gave a violent kick to the vacuum, sending it crashing into the other side of the kitchen. Taro and Hanako ran to the impact sight and were shock to see Etna and Flonne back in their original bodies lying on the floor in a dazed state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe writer in the prinny suit than walk up to his work, he gave a quick nod, \"My work here is done.\" He than started running back to the fourth wall only to give a nasty roundhouse kick, putting another hole in it. \"Wait,\" Hanako went up to the guy in the prinny suit, \"What are we suppose to do for the story from here?\" \"Oh yeah,\" the writer said as he scratch his chin, he than snap his fingers and started searching around in the costume's pouch. He pulled out a hugh purple tome, \"Since there's all kinds of transformation, here's a cookbook for all kind of weird stuff.\" Hanako took the tome and back away a bit. \"By the way I'm not paying for this wall.\" The writer said as he went on the other side of the fourth wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a strange guy Hanako.\" Taro said as he went next to Hanako. Hanako only shrug it off and went back to checking out the tome she got from the prinny suit guy, \"A transformation cookbook huh, sounds interesting.

Etna responds by flowing her body around Flonne's in such a way that she's wrapped around Flonne several times. She then blends everything together so she's like a gooey net surrounding Flonne. Flonne wonders just what Etna has in mind, and gets an answer before she even gets a chance to ask as Etna starts to gently press inward, just enough for Flonne to be able to feel it.

Whoops?\" Etna gives a embarrassed smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please help me Etna!\" Flonne whines, \"I don't want to be a stain on the floor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I''m coming, I'm coming.\" Etna kneels down and taken the fallen angel's clothes uses them as a makeshift sponge, soaking up the melted  Flonne and pouring her into a bucket that was nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that's all of you Flonne.\" Etna says as she wringes the last few drops from Flonne's clothes into the bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Flonne replies back. \"So what are we going to do about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna mouth curls into a devious smile, \"Well, now that I see you like this, I can pretty much say that you are even cuter know as a puddle.\" She takes the tip of her tail and starts stirring it around the bucket's contents. \"I mean you look so innocent with those worried eyes on your little face, and also,\" She lifts up her tail and licks the few drops of Flonne off of it, \"It makes me curious, how much you can transform while like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne stars back at Etna's face with a little bit of fear in her eyes, but also a sense of curiosity builds up inside her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon approaching the kitchen Etna's eyes catch sight of something lying abandon on one of the counters. <i>'Well what do we have here?</i> The red hair demon saunters up to it to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe item itself was just a mold used for desserts, a ring mold to be more precise. Made out of simple plastic and showing hardly any signs of having been used before. Nothing remarkable really...except being juuust big enough to look like it can hold the entirety of Flonne's liquid form. The observation gives Etna an idea and a grin to grace her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Miss Etna,\" The poor melted fallen angel bubbles out from her bucket, \"Your face is scary. What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry your pretty little head Flonne.\" The Beauty Queen/Demon Lord answers with a smile, \"I think I have an idea that might help the both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Flonne returns in a shaky tone of voice, \"I trust you know what you're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, Etna makes her way to one of the kitchen's stoves and places the bucket on top of its ranges. With a snap of the wrist she twists a knob and the stove comes alive burning a fire right underneath the bucket. \"Now Flonne,\" Etna calls out as she peeks her head over the bucket's top to look at its occupant, \"I need to go grab some things, just wait right there and I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I can do that at least Miss Etna,\" Flonne bubbles out, \"Hey is it hot in here or is it just me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not you, just all part of the plan.\" The red head responds before disappearing behind the bucket's walls leaving the liquid fallen angel alone with her thoughts and the growing feeling of something burning up beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh wow it's sure getting hot over here.'</i> The ditzy blonde thinks to herself as she feels the warmth quickly spread all over her. In truth the burning sensation was high, too high really to be bearable. Flonne compares the heat to the multiple times Etna decides to play \"William Tell\" with her only Fire spells instead of a bow and arrow, fire spells that always seem to miss their mark and end up cremating her. With the head coursing through her liquid state Flonne would have been screaming \"I'm on fire!\" over and over but for some odd reason the goo girl can't help but feel giddy. She can feel boiling, bubbles rising through her melted body to the surface to pop on her \"face\". Her entire being wobbles as physics gives her a heat treated massage. It was hard for the fallen angel to keep herself from 'melting' into a haze of pleasure. It didn't take long for Flonne come to the conclusion that Etna was boiling her, but it was so hard to separate herself from the pleasant feeling coursing all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eventual sight of Etna's devious face and smile is a welcome sign, at least Flonne was able to distract herself from her treatment. \"So how you holding out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the fallen angel was capable she would have given a lazy smile, \"Ju-u-u-u-us-s-st f-i-i-i-i-i-n-n-ne.\" The blonde's pleasure-filled voice was distorted by the bubbles boiling to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear.\" Etna's sly voice would have raised from red flags to the melted girl but the latter was so lost in her mind that she didn't pay much mind as the former whips out three pouches of powder and a whisk. With widening grin, Etna rips the pouches open and pour the contents into the bucket and into Flonne as well before whisking the contents together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne can barely process whatever sensations going through her head as she was stirred around and around. She can vaguely recall the scent of cherries, lemons, and vanilla permeating the air, that whatever stuff Etna put in her had some sort of solidifying effect as she can feel her liquid body slowly begin to lose viscosity as the whisk starts slowing down by resistance, all of it didn't matter as the fallen angel just lets her mind melt at the proverbial spa treatment she was receiving. \"Oh the feels nice Miss Etna.\" Flonne tries to speak coherently but all that came out were mumbles out of the goo she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna herself smiles at her work. The sweet smiles invading her senses made the demon's mouth water in anticipation as she feels Flonne reaches just the right level of consistency. After several minutes of stirring Etna cuts the heat, takes the bucket, and pours its contents into the plastic mold, making extra sure to have each and every drop is in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne herself can't help but feel a rush of ecstasy? euphoria? happiness? as she feels herself slide out of the heated confines of the bucket into a cool surface and begins to pool with a hold in the \"middle\" of her. <i>'Oh my, I can hardly even think straight now.</i> The goo girl thinks to herself, unable to even bring herself to talk. <i>'Miss Etna must try this out.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknowing of her compatriot's feelings Etna only smiles as the last drop falls into the mold filling it up to the very top. The filling a mixture of red, yellow, and vanilla all marbled together in a messy pattern. Satisfied, Etna gingerly takes the mold and places it (and Flonne) inside the refrigerator. \"Now we just have to cool you off for several hours and see if what happens okay? Later!\" Shutting the door Etna walks off to kill some time, leaving Flonne alone for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fallen angel herself can't help but notice that it just gotten dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>*Cue Time Skip*</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna was bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBored. Bored. Bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, I'm bored!\" Etna shouts out from her throne of Prinnies as she watches some Netherworld sports program involving pitting Wood Golems against Gargoyles in a game of rugby (with a flailing Prinny as the ball).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say Demon Lord Etna was bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where that love nut went off to, I haven't seen for her days.\" Etna sighs to herself as she gets (okay more like punted her throne of Prinnies away) off her chair and makes her way to the kitchen to grab a snack. \"Just when I decide to play William Tell with her she disappears off the face of the Netherworld. I can't tell if she actually found some self preservation or got lost on one of her love quests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'That little brat Laharl better not taken my dessert again!'</i> The red head thinks to herself as she opens the fridge door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and sees a mold of shivering gelatin making muffle cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well, I knew I forgot about something.'</i> Etna berates herself as she takes the mold out and flips it onto a nearby plate. She pulls it out to reveal a beautiful gelatin dessert of mixed colors across its surface, and a familiar pair of teary red eyes looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Etna, you've finally remember about me!\" Surprising Flonne was able to retain her speech despite having no mouth. \"It was so cold, cramp, and dark in there, it was scary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna at least had the decency to scratch her cheek in embarrassing at her callousness, \"Uh, yeah, my bad.\" Etna that notice that Flonne had some level of movement, \"So Flonne, you able to do something with yourself, like make a body or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe.\" The gelatin returns, \"I was in there for so long I actually felt myself harden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, my bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a glare (more like the equivalent of a eye pout) Flonne looks at the still humanoid demon across her. \"At first I thought I should let you go through the same thing considering how good it felt, but now I want you to go through the same thing I did Miss Etna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I should be surprise at your revenge plot or that you actually have a vengeful bone in your body.\" Etna deadpans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I do have my bones and body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche, and again, my bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne glares (eye pouts) even further before going back to struggling to do with her gelatin form. She could...maybe...just a little chance, be able to make some sort of form to give her some level of mobility. However it was an up hill battle, she didn't know how long she's been cooling inside that mold, she might be stuck as a dessert. For the fallen angel, the thought of being a sentient dessert in front a sweet tooth demon like Etna was not a comforting thought in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of concentration Etna sees that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's asked where she'll be going, but she says she'll set the destination herself as to keep where she's planning on taking Flonne a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first hint as to where they are is a sudden coldness, made more intense due to her not having much in the way of insulation besides the box she's sloshing about in. \"Ah...it's so cold...\" says Flonne, as she starts to recognize the sky. It then comes back to her, of course she knows where this is, this is the Frozen River area. \"Ah! This is where I first joined up with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna smiles. \"Nice, you remember!

Flonne is able to feel it too in the form of her body having more contact with Etna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...this feels nice, it certainly beats completely sinking in~\" says Etna. She then feels her feet touch the bottom of the container. And then, she feels a new sensation, that of her feet starting to spread across the bottom of the container. \"W-whoa! Geez, it feels like my feet are getting really wide and flat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne giggles. \"It feels like more of you is in contact with me, Miss Etna!

Her arms have also been stretching the entire time, but not straight to the bottom, causing them to get stretched out a lot more on their way to the bottom. As her legs start to become the next part of her to be squashed along the bottom, Etna's arms start to feel like they're floating upward. Etna sees something stringy start to surface, and realizes quickly that it's her arms, stretched out so thinly that they're just barely thicker than thread. She gets her fingers around a part of her arms that has flowed close to them and rolls it between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shivers in delight as she feels her wire-thin arm twist as if it was made of rubber. \"Ahhh...amazing~. I hope a lot more of me gets stretched out like this. Heh, I'm sure you'll be able to handle that, Flonne~\" she says, as she feels her arms continue to stretch out even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makes Flonne giggle. \"Alright!

Not long after that starts happening, more of Etna's body starts to rapidly float up to the surface on it's own. As Etna's body forms into a loose mesh along Flonne's surface, both girls seem to be pleased with how this is going. Etna in particular feels great, as she feels like her body stretches for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh...now this is more like it! Everything but my head and feet are all stretched out~.\" says Etna, as her head gently bobs in the middle of Flonne's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlonne then starts to get an idea. \"You know, Miss Etna, I think I might be able to stretch you out even more!\" she exclaims gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna smirks. \"Oooh, well, by all means, go ahead~\"</span></div></div>",

Etna's eyes light up as she sees and feels a lot more of her made as thin as string. Seeing this, she relaxes and shuts her eyes as that part of her head gets pulled under. Before long, every last bit of Etna's head has been stretched out, and now Flonne is focusing on stretching out her feet, which thanks to the earlier flattening are getting stretched longer than even her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a while with her feet, but after a while Flonne has completely stretched Etna out into a very long string. \"And there we go, Miss Etna, you are now a string girl!\" Flonne exclaims as Etna floats atop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...this feels wonderful, Flonne~, thanks for doing this for me.\" says Etna, her body wriggling with delight. \"I'm really liking this form~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething then comes to Flonne's mind. \"Ah, Miss Etna, speaking of forms, I seem to have a lot of control over my body now.

She manages to get the box to rock back and forth enough for Flonne to be freed from the box. She plops out of the box looking like a cube, and for the most part stays that way for now. \"Brr...I was getting so cozy in the box that I forgot how cold it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtna chuckles. \"Mmm, I'm still nice and cozy, though~\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, anyway, let's see if I can do this.\" says Flonne, as she prepares to try to change her shape.</span></div></div>",

I think this place is sooo cute!\" Flonne replied, as she seemed to thought their new environment was cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Flonne thought the place she &amp; Etna were in was really cute, but Etna had a bad feeling about what was going on.</span></div></div>",

This takes place after the second game, so pretty much anything can go. Feel free to throw in other characters from the NIS Multiverse as well, or possibly even characters from other universes entirely, though try to at least keep Etna and Flonne as the main characters in this story. Pretty much anything goes, except most male transformation, though I will accept a few exceptions if I don't mind the character being altered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to break the 4th wall, too. It happens in the games, especially Makai Kingdom and Disgaea 2.</td>",
