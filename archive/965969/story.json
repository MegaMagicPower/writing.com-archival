Your vision starts to normalize and you are able to look around but feel dizzy once again, not from the sensation but from the sights! You have shrunk again, this time to about 5 millimeters tall! The clothes in front of you are now literal mountains and the bottles of soda on the aisle shelves are now as tall as city buildings! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud bass filled noise starts off subtle enough but gets louder and louder, with each booming noise, the ground shakes under you a little but the intensity also increases with the volume of the noise. You look behind yourself to the other side of the alleyway and see the culprit, a gigantic, shoulder-length blonde, young woman! She appears to be a worker in the store wearing a green collared shirt, black slacks and worn black running shoes. The sight of a girl that you probably were once almost half a foot taller than and would have flirted with earlier that is now over one thousand feet in height left you in absolute shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock is replaced with sheer fear as the booms are like clapping thunder from a massive storm overhead and the ground shakes are intense earthquakes that make your barely able to keep balance! You stumble and collapse to the ground unable to move as she walks towards you! Sure that you are going to get stepped on like a tiny insect, you close your eyes hoping that afterwards you wake up in your bed from this crazy nightmare. Instead the thunderous noises stop and the ground is calm. You open your eyes and look up to see the giantess standing high above you with her feet on both sides of you, her bright blue eyes pierce right through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting a second you start to scream up to her, \"Help me please! I somehow shrunk!\" But instead of responding to you she crouches down instead. This fast movement leaves you screaming in fear instead of for help as her body seems to be collapsing towards you. She stops abruptly as her crotch lingers above and you are left almost pissing yourself. You continue to look up and take note of her name tag reading, \"Alice\". It becomes apparent that she was not looking at you but instead the clothes in the unattended clothes in the aisle. With one hand, she picks up tons of clothing and scoops them into her bosom before standing high again. She starts walking again which leaves you cringing from the loud, intense effects that follow until she disappears from the aisle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and take deep breaths. Being over the shock of seeing a giant for the first time you think you can now focus on trying to get some help. So far you are not getting many customers at the soda aisle and you doubt Alice comes back to the aisle anytime soon. You walk for several minutes before making it to the end of the aisle where you see multiple people in the distant, some with shopping carts which gives you the vision of outrunning the wheels before being plastered to the ground. The though leaves you shuddering but you ease yourself and look around realizing that with you being so tiny the ability to memorize the aisles around you is no longer possible.

A woman who looks to be fortyish or so smiles at you as you approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care for a taste sir?\" she say's \"it's quite tasty\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the samples on a plate your not sure what it is,but you really dont care,it's food that's all that matters.\"Dont mind if I do\" you say as you grab one of the treats and plop it in your mouth.\"boy this is good.What is it?\" you ask while chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's a new health product,packed with everything the body need's\" the woman said \"here have another to get the full effect\" she hands you another and somewhat bigger sample.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee thanks\" you say \"good stuff\" then walk away. You go back over to the beer to see that Matt still hadn't made up his mind yet so you decide for him and throw another six pack in the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you ought to try this stuff I just ate\" you say \"come on I'll take you\" you take Matt over to the sample table but as you turn the corner the table and the lady are gone.\"Well thats strange she was just here a few minuets ago\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she went on break\" Matt says \"Come on let's find the girls\" he starts to walk off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there for a moment thinking how odd it was that the woman left so quickly table and all.Then you shrug it off and catch up with your friend. About a minute later you start to feel sick to your stomach like your gonna puke.You tell Matt that your gonna go find a bathroom and you'll catch up with him and the girls.After asking a store worker where it was at,you find yourself doubled over a toilet waiting to empty the contents of your stomach.You begin to feel dizzy,your head is spinning a million miles an hour and you think your gonna pass out.You go over to the sink and start to put cold water on your face.You stand there for a moment with your eye's closed.When you open your eye's again.You notice that the world around you has changed,changed in a big way.You shrank.You find yourself standing only about three inches tall. You panic,your heart satrts to race,you take in your suroundings looking up at the sink that now seems miles high.You calm yourself and think how this could've happned,then it hit you \"That woman,those samples\" you said to yourself.Then you remember what she had said \"Here have another so you get the full effect\"It was her,you were sure of it,\"I have to find that woman\" you say.You start running for the door,your pretty sure you can slide up under it at your current size to get out,but just as you draw nearer to it,it swings open,the wind from it knocking you over. You pull yourself back up quickly and see who just walked in,yopu look up to see the that the person or giant now at your current size is....</span></div></div>",

You cry in desperation, unable to see anything and only hearing her heartbeat and gut's growlings, along with her booming voice echoing sometimes. The horrible smell and temperature are almost unbearable and you barely can find some air to breath, while feeling yourself half covered in some slimy juices, waving around by the contractions of the stomach's walls and her movements. You touch your surroundings panicked and desperated, already feeling your skin burning a little from the acids and gastric enzymes of her stomach. It keeps getting more and more painfull as time passes and your skin slowly dissolves, leaving you in horrible pain waiting to eventually faint and die digested alive. By the time she hits dinner, about two hours after she ate you, your skin is mostly gone and your flesh is exposed to the juices while you're still alove and awake. Stuff then starts falling over you as she eats her lunch. You can't even tell what the chewed up stuff is and don't really care as every contact with something she swallows hurts you as hell, while the level of substances quickly rises until you can't even feel the floor, your defigured face barely sticking out the mess to breath as you agonise digesting in her food, fainting and dying a couple minutes after she finished her meal, filled and ready for an afternoon of work in the store. <br>\r\nYou wouldn't have thought that's what would happen to you when entering the supermarket earlier with your friends, dying shrunk and digested alive in a teenage store clerk's stomach.</span></div></div>",

You can see the shocked look on her face as her jaw drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" she said \"Neil is that really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wave your arms\"Yes Lucy it is,I need your help!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neil your so,so small\" she says \"and what are you doing on my foot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was not the brightest of the group,pretty to look at but not much upstairs.\"Help me!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy bent down and grabbed you with her thumb and forefinger,she pulled you up to her face and let you dangle there \"Hey did you watch me go to the bathroom?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Lucy.No I didn't,but forget that I need your help,I have to find this woman who...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your so cute like this\" she said cutting you off \"I cant wait to show you to Helen and Matt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Lucy we have to find thew woman who did this to me,so she can make me normal again\" you tell her, but your word's seem to fall on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool\" she said \"I got to put you in a safe place\" with that said she opened her tote purse and dropped you down in it\" Now you just hang on in there okay?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Lucy we have to find that woman!\" you shout but she ignored you and shut the flap to the tote bag.</span></div></div>",
