As is the case elsewhere in the multiverse, very little is known about what causes the condition or how it spreads. Victims show no visible symptoms until they start transforming. Once that happens, they are expected to be fully canine as quickly as two days later, although some victims may take up to two months to complete their transformations. Victims lose all memories, personality traits and capacity for higher thought and become one hundred percent dog in body, mind and soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current record for the longest-lasting Mare\u2019s Best Friend Syndrome sufferer is a Mr. Shuttle Weaver of Canterlot, who managed to hold out for an incredible six months and eight days before finally completing his transformation into a Border Collie in Year of Celestia 983.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt present, there is no meaningful treatment available to sufferers of Mare\u2019s Best Friend Syndrome, although experts are currently working on ways of managing the condition by stopping (or at least slowing) the transformation. Such courses of treatment, though promising, are still experimental and unlikely to be approved for use by state-run medical institutions in Equestria anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, who shall our story begin with?</span></div></div>",

It had been a long time since she last acted like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight's what's going on in there? Did you botch another spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no.

It was recongibly her but it sounded little different.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike tried to pick the lock with his claws, only to feel the lock knob turn as Twilight grabbed. She shouted to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it stay back! Ruff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike did a double take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just bark?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight made a strange, dog like whimper. \"N-no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a dog or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpike could picture her hanging her head submissinvely. Ceasing his chance, Spiek finally managed to pick the lock and the door swung ajar. Twilight gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twilight you're....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked different, she was shorter, her coat was thicker and her face was between that of a dog and apony, with her muzzle being longer and her head being smaller. Spike was momentarily lost for words. Twilight struggled to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how it happened. I didn't cast any kind of spell that could have done this, I've been trying to make myself normal again but nothing's working!\"</span></div></div>",

She still felt like the Witness Relocation Program had screwed her over, and she suspected Elastigirl played some part, and took some delight in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer slender body, and elegant subdued curves and grace were now long gone. The new curvaceous body apparently to help disguise her to provide more of a contrast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what Mirage... damn it... What Megan knew was that her shoulders were sore and her back ached constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/cab7ac12830faf82d2d5b754de445f66/tumblr_ojqbfiRPtA1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://68.media.tumblr.com/cab7ac12830f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told herself, again and again, that she should be glad not to be in prison. A short life expectancy for the woman who betrayed Syndrome's entire island to be captured, as she lowered the defensive array.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe military arrived in force, tracking the ship back to the island, and without their leader they were overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer memories were fuzzy, and a slight furrow formed between her eyebrows as she thought back over past events. She knew that she'd known them, their real-life identities. But now, it was a vague memory, like seeing a face through the mist, or in the ripples of a pond. She tried to imagine each of them in their strong red uniforms. She focused on their heads, their masked faces, and tried to mentally peel away the masks. But nothing sprang out, it was all just a guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tickle came from her ear, and she scuffed at the offending itch. She didn't think her earrings were cheap and irritating. Nine carat gold did make her itch, though, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it was her hair, she wasn't happy with it. Trying to dismiss it as a low level annoyance, she forced  her hand down.</span></div></div>",

Snapping her head around she scanned the room, for her former boss. Her heart racing, she'd dreaded, feared his return, the consequences of her betrayal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew he was gone, she'd seen his body. It had to be a trick, she told herself. But the blood pounding in her ears was convinced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ss..syndr...\" her voice trembled, as she called out to the empty air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your reward for disloyalty.\" it continued, cutting across her nervous question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A recording... Just a recording...\" she breathed. It wasn't responding to her, although she was unsettled to be hearing from him. She'd assumed her body resculpting had looked for these, had removed any bio-implants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're listening to this message, You haven't heard my voice in over a month.\" it said. An edge of disquiet coming through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either you've left my service and betrayed me!\" His voice cracking with anger over the word <i>betrayed</i>, or I've ... Or you've failed me. In either case, your services are terminated.\" She heard his breath hissing over what ever microphone he'd used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a poor human being, but perhaps, you'll learn a degree more loyalty with a new form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage felt her ear warm, racing towards a painful heat, as the voice faded. Feverishly, she clawed at her ear, frantic to remove ... whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer scrabbling fingers tore at her own flesh, the nanites spreading out through her bloodstream, to every part of her body, seeking out every finger, every toe, every cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of her smooth perfect skin, she discovered hair. It grew wildly, uncontrollably. Hypnotised, she saw a layer spread across the back of her hand disappear beneath the sleeve of the dressing gown. She saw the thickening coat climbing up from her feet, her shins already covered with a deepening fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear warbled in her throat, as she knew... knew it truly was fur. That Syndrome's last act was to reduce her to a simple animal. Her thighs prickled as the furry layer reached the hem of the dressing gown. She rolled her shoulders, freeing herself from it. As if it were somehow the cause of her infection, her problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that just revealed the progress of Syndrome's nanites. She felt as well as heard the crack of her bones. Her hips and her shoulders burning in pain, she collapsed onto all fours on the floor. In the mirror she saw her bones shift beneath her skin... beneath her fur. Forming joints not made for a biped. A howl burst from her lips, as she spotted her face contorting. Her nose, her jaw thrusting forward. Her howl lost its humanity, becoming more canine as her throat stretched and distorted. Her howl renewed, as she spotted the tail springing forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear forming as she watched her reflection. Her soft chestnut eyes, altering from human to canine. Her expression was harder to read, as her skull shifted, shrank to be more in proportion with her new body. Mirage's thoughts became more muddled, her fear easing as her brain simplified, until the cracking stopped and the pain vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at her was a good girl, a pretty girl, she panted happily. Her room carried the reassuring scent of her mistress, and she curled up and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/48/88/ea/4888ea60cface9dd67106ba60b1ccd72.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let's cut the chase already, but before we go any further, I feel a spot of background information is in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna Mercedes Schreiber Fernandez, commonly known as Mirage, was an Agent with the National Supers Agency, as well as a serving superheroine. Four months before the defeat of Syndrome, Mirage, then a member of the <i>Kantonssuperheldendienst Z\u00fcrich</i> (Zurich Cantonal Superheroics Service), was in Washington, DC on business when she was recruited into the NSA and sent to Nomanisan Island to find out why so many Glory Days Supers had gone missing. Needless to say, she got captured by Syndrome and spent the next few months under mind control, until Mr. Incredible inadvertently broke the mind control chip when he mistakenly believed his family was dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the aftermath of the Operation Kronos incident, Mirage had managed to escape further punishment on the grounds of entrapment and diminished responsibility, but nevertheless felt compelled to transfer from <i>Kantonssuperheldendienst Z\u00fcrich</i> to <i>Stadtsuperheldendienst Z\u00fcrich</i> (Zurich City Superheroics Service), with whom she worked at least 90 days a year in order to stay certified in Switzerland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne year on from Operation Kronos, Mirage was still very much a hated figure for many in the NSA (especially the top brass) and she had very few friends in the Agency, most notably the Incredibles, Voyd, Rick Dicker and Winston Deavor. As a result, the city of Metroville, California had (somewhat ironically) become her favourite port of call when working in the US.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, our story now begins in earnest with Mirage\u2026 </span></div></div>",

All greeted as heroes, the occasion was sombre too. Too many lost friends, too many painful memories. This was meant to be a new chapter, a hopeful beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Gryffindors were back in the unused girls' toilets, with a disinterested Myrtle watching them. Hermione having made a breakthrough after her unfortunate incident regarding Millicent Bulstrode's cat driving her to investigate the limits and powers of polyjuice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione thought if she was marrying into the Weasley family, she should loosen up, and work on her sense of humour. She'd told Ron that the hair she'd selected for their polyjuices came from a Veela. Ron was fascinated but scared, until she encouraged him to experiment. Besides, at least he'd know what was coming, she convinced Ron this was a prank played on Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of seeing Harry becoming the double of Fleur didn't need much convincing to get Ron on board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione convinced Harry by playing on his desire for a quiet life. A little poly-juice would allow them to walk freely about the castle without being pestered every step of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouring the vile smelling brown potion into the small cups, she passed them to each of the boys. Carefully plucking the hair samples from clear cellophane bags she added them to each cup. A hiss and a small puff of smoke came from each as the hair was added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was eager to see, if this new blend of polyjuice was a real improvement on the original that had been followed for centuries. A conflicted smile played across her face at what she was about to do. A memory of explaining to Mr. Weasley about cellophane bags, and ziploks and sealed in freshness bringing forth amazement at muggle ingenuity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fake cough brought Hermione back to the here and now. The three friends clinked their glasses, and swallowed the contents in a single swift gulp, unwilling to taste the foul brew.</span></div></div>",

It was getting paler, gaining a hint of golden blonde. Her perfect features refined, her cheekbones becoming sharper. He ignored his own transformation, more fascinated with hers. Hermione's face becoming a mix of Fleur and Hermione, with the best features of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" his words spoken aloud, he'd only meant to think them. A coy smile from Hermione made him blush. But his words were cut off with a barking cough. The words themselves deeper, and more gravelly, an almost animal growl. He liked that, but part of him felt the need to see his own progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face looked much hairier, a beard and moustache that reminded him of his disguise for breaking into Gringott's. His hair a leonine mane, was thick and full. His nose was looking more prominent, perhaps an illusion from seeing it with all that facial hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hope was extinguished, as his nose darkened, flattening as it turned distinctly black. Reaching up, he found it was pushing forward, his jaw too. A few hairs sprang from the beard, straightening and standing stiffly outwards. His whiskers,... the words triggered a fear. He realised Hermione had tricked him... him and Harry. A moment too late, he blinked, rapidly his eyes watering. As he fought that back, he looked at the progress through canine eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hands exploring his face were now backed by a thick mat of hair... fur, he corrected himself. Turning them around, he saw his fingers blacken becoming pads as they curled inwards. His nose and mouth projecting unmistakably into a dog's muzzle. An attempted smile revealing transformed teeth... canines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look over to Harry saw a similar transformation. The same confusion on his face. Well, as best he could read the expression.</span></div></div>",

A startled yelp, howl spilling from the muzzle of each dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione watched fascinated seeing the potion was still on track, and neither Harry nor Ron were in any pain. She saw four canine eyes widen in fear and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly just resisting the temptation to smile as their tails pushed outwards. Harry's face was entirely transformed into an Irish wolfhound. Despite this, there was still a recognisably human expression on his face. She ruffled the fur on his head, and instantly the concern was erased as a large red tongue slipped past his teeth. Happy panting, and animal instincts now taking a part in his decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSinking down to rest on one knee, she turned to Ron, or rather the Scottish deerhound that he'd become.

Little is known about the cause of the condition or its spread, and infected humans show no discernible symptoms until they start transforming. Once that happens, they are generally expected to be fully dog anywhere between two days and two months later (depending on the strain and how much the victim fights the changes). Man\u2019s Best Friend Syndrome targets both the body and the mind, and victims lose all human memories, personality traits and cognitive abilities. There are now growing fears that Man's Best Friend Syndrome could be weaponised and used by rogue states, criminals and terrorists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all you Bronies and Pegasisters out there, there's even an Equestrian version of the condition called Mare's Best Friend Syndrome, which targets ponies, zebras, donkeys, and possibly griffons and dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, time for a few rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2022\tNo scat.<br>\r\n\u2022\tAll transformations (both physical and mental) are to take place over time \u2013 no instantaneous transformations.<br>\r\n\u2022\tAll chapters are to be at least one full paragraph in length (but preferably longer), with the only exceptions being options lists.<br>\r\n\u2022\tPlease proofread chapters thoroughly before submitting them.
