Yet the night seemed diffrent from the rest he had experienced, there was a strange darkness in the stars that made him feel very uneasy. \"I do sure know how to pick the days I go camping\" he thought to himself. He made his way over to his tent and took his gray belt jacket off. He then tossed it in the small 2 person tent. The inside of his tent was orange with black corners and white stripes coming from to top down the sides. \"Damn...so tired\" he said to himself. He crawled over to his sleeping bag and quickly dose off. He was unaware of how much his life was going to change forever.</span></div></div>",

There's another way!\" yelled Krystal inside the small blue pod. \"No there's no other way.\" he said to her trying to sound as calm as he could to her. \"No please! I want to be with you, I  don't want to be without you!\" she said beating on the glass casing of the pod, as tears strened down her face, matting her blue fur. \"Slippy do it! Launch the pod now! Before we get closer to the black hole!\" Fox said to the frightened little frog. \"We can't Fox! The Arwings are draining the Great Fox's reactors. They are draining them due to extensive damage they took when we last fought Wolf and his team.\" said Slippy to Fox who was down in the Pod Launch Bay. \"Fox the only way she will make it out is if we jettison them into space. It's up to you, Fox.\" said Slippy in the most serious way Fox had never heard from his longtime friend. Fox just felt hopeless hearing the only option he had. What should he do?       </span></div></div>",

Fox's head was innundated with thought, decisions he should make but was scared he would pick the wrong one. He finally knew what he needed to do. \"Jetison all the arwings.\" he said expression less. \"No Fox! Please don't do it!\" Krystal yelled in tears. \"I'm so sorry\" is al he said. He then turned around and started to walk away. \"Fox please stop it! Please! Don't leave me alone!\" she said, crying. Mist started to fill the inside of the pod. She knew what it was, sleeping gas. She watched thru the pods glass window as it was being jetisoned. The pod was then half full of gas. She looked and saw the Great Fox one more time. She saw it hurl towards the spiral. She was overcome with great sadness and then she knew she was alone. The gas started to take effect as she fell asleep seconds prior to seeing the Great Fox be destroyed. Krystal was asleep but with her extrodinary powers was still awake in her thoughts. \"What can I do now?\" she asked herself before subcoming to the full effect of the sleep gas that now caused her body to relax and enter a deep sleep. Not even her powers were match for the sleeping gas.</span></div></div>",

She began to question where she was. Where she was headed. Who she was. \"why am I here\" she wondered as she walked in her dream land that she was lost in. She just walked and walked but never seemed to get anywhere. She soon lost her grip on her mind and drifted into a lost state of mind. Still as she slept.</span></div></div>",

I know you wouldn't do it\" she said throwing himself in his arms. Fox caught her in his arms and embraced her very tightly. \" Krystal I'm so sorry I this ever came across my mind. I'm so sorry\" he said looking in her beautiful green eyes. \"Fox I love you\" she said to him as she gave him a kiss that caught Fox offguard. The kiss eventually became mutual and then Fox brocke the silence. \"i've always lived you but I've never had the courage to tell you\" he said looking at her. \"Well I wish you would have told me earlyer Fox, we would have had much more time\" she said. Fox hugged her and then walked over towards the viewing platform. They both stared at the darkness and then Fox said \" Better late than never\" he said.

Everyone stared in disbelief as the figure closed his hands and put them infront of \"its\" body. \"What in the world is it doing?!\" asked Falco. \"Look! The hole.... It's closing!\" said Slippy wild eyed. \"How is that possible!?\" asked Falco.
