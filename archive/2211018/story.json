After a few minutes of searching, he finally got what he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumerous articles about monster sightings or strange events that all happened lately. Like the occasional gnome attack or yet another squirrel uprising. None of the articles we're exactly interesting enough until you see one about\u2026</span></div></div>",

Local heroes were too busy dealing with either bigger problems or having interviews with talk show hosts to deal with the menace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Typical...'</i> Carl sourly snorted as he got up. His fingers jingles and jittered as he grabbed his navy blue hoodie. Taking a deep breath that made his whole body shuddered. This is the first time that he will actually physically had to deal with someone. Usually, he will be on the receiving end of a fight. Often finding himself in a trash can or locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not today! Today, the tables have been flipped. You going to fight for good people of Emberville, be their torch of hope and justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a new resolve in the deep depths in your gut. You wrapped your older sister's black scarf around your mouth as you zipped the jacket. And putting on your dad's hardware goggles for extra anonymity because you can't afford people figuring your now secret identity out. It's basically Heroics 101! Making sure to be extra careful, you went out in back doors and took off in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lack of speed when flying really made the trip to the farmer market, which is <i>eleven</i> whole miles from your home by the way, really...boring.

She may very well be the one responsible for all this mess, after all, mutants don't necessarily look like nonhuman things: there are mutants with great powers who look like totally normal persons....like himself for an example <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing some quite boyish clothes and she was sleeping ... either she was innocent but very courageous or she was the one who made everyone run away. The young hero couldn't simply attack her while she was sleeping: what if she was innocent. He first had to wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl walked toward her with a quite determined face. He poked her face and asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the one who caused this mess?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe unknown girl just woke up but she looked at Carl with such a furious glare it almost scared him.

Running straight towards her just as fast as a top line-breaker on his school football team. All the mildly bulky girl did smirk ever so smug-even when he landed a flimsy jab at her flabby belly. This only caused it to merely jiggled in response to a punch that is strong enough to put a good-sized hole in rock hard <i><b>cast iron</b></i>...which suddenly reminds him that mom needs a new pan. Provided that he makes it through this whole debacle in one piece, he'll help her get a new one.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Aw, that tickles!~\"  With a hearty laugh with a voice so sweet that it can give a lifelong vegan diabetic shock. Copying from Carl's previous course, her slightly meaty hand curled into a fist and was ready to pound some wannabe hero in the dirt. Her tanned freckled face had a real toothy grin on it.``My <b>turn</b>!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she unloads a punch faster than what he expects was she capable of. Her right fist rammed into his face-with herculean power causing her right bicep to bulged. Showing off her deceptively powerful muscles as Carl was sent flying-smashing through four empty stands before landing into a bunch of barrels of hay that was at least thirty feet away from him and the girl was standing at. Her strength was to be awed at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that is how you do it!\" The girl cheered herself on as she rolled her shoulders and stared at where that little weasel landed. Serves him right waking her after she showed off her new powers to everyone-which they weren't quite appreciative of it-but...still. He DID land pretty hard and she didn't want to hurt him THAT bad. So she is a simple common courtesy shouted out to him. \"...HEY, YOU ALRIGHT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it will take...more than that to take...me down you fat ogre of a villain. It would take...much more than that put down the hero of embervillie...<i>Beacon</i>!.\" Carl gasped out as his right cheek was incredibly sore and beginning to swell. With adrenaline and shock running his veins, he was uncharacteristically bold and trying to stand up...and failing to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat ogre...<b><i>huh</i></b>?' The girl's cheeks became red, cannot BELIEVE that she felt bad for this maggot-dick, and which she never did in the first place! She hastily grabbed a good portion of the nearby apples and peaches. Hastily devour the fruit and growing twice her height. Gaining more girth and bulk in the process. Then she ran towards Carl in speeds he could only gawk at. Soon standing over in mere seconds...while returning to her previous height and returning into her usual level of bulkiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>' Just what the hell is your po-'</i> Despite his inner nerd being immediately perplexed over her abilities. He didn't get the chance to form a full coherent sentence in his mind as the girl...sat on his stomach. Knocking some of the wind straight out of his lungs as she mockingly grinds her larger than average ass on his skinny torso. \" Ya' know, this fat ogre needs to take a load off. And you are super comfy, like one of those big overpriced chairs in the furniture store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mockingly said as she begins to bounce on him. Apparently, the ogre comment struck a few cords with her. But as uncomfortable as he is couldn't help but feel.....you know...<i>aroused</i> by this. His second head clung to his left most thigh, it slowly swells as he watches her hefty thighs and calves jiggled with every move she makes. Or the fact that just how full and round her ass was. The sweat dripping off her warm skin. That and the fact she was only slightly younger than he was and was still around his own age group was like gasoline to the fires that were teenage hormones. Him not having much interaction with members of the opposite sex that wasn't his mother or sister did not help him...no it did not. Thank god that his face was fully covered up...he couldn't live with himself if it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, how can I forget? I really do need to wipe my feet off!\" The girl spoke as she placed her feet on his chest, which was in beat-up old sandals akin to flip-flops with dirty brown straps. As she smearing dirt and grass all over his jacket, he took a good look at things that were on her chest. The gumshoes that were currently occupying the sandals just fit her-strong, imposing, and lacking the stereotypical daintiness and fragile feminity. Her feet were wide and chunky, so large that one could call them disproportionate if any other girl had them. The short brawny toes sent faint waves of fishiness and tangy spice, like someone pickling habaneros and jalapenos in white vinegar. With a hint of an unknown earthy sweetness that somehow balances the pungent cocktail, Despite only getting faint whiffs, Carl's nose wrinkled which seems to hint the potency of her feet.   The feet'  rough underskin were dusty and little dry. The sight and the experience of the girl's treatment made him both disgusted and angry yet aroused by it. He wasn't an masochist in any means...just something about this...he couldn't explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the girl herself was happy, finally, she has something she doesn't have to worry about breaking him. Now she can finally cut loose! And this only the <i>beginning</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Carl questioning himself and the unnamed girl about to amped it up. What happens?</span></div></div>",

They were wide, meaty, dirty, dusty, bulky and yet they belonged to a girl ... a girl who's younger than himself which was unbelievable but arousing at the same time! From head to toes (literally) this girl was a tomboy, even her personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you mentioned foot wiping earlier don't tell me ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least your mind seems better than your fighting skills ... yes you guessed it: I'll make you rub them for me ha ha!\" replied the mutant girl with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl didn't protest for two reasons: first of all he didn't want her to beat him again and more important ... he kinda wanted to do that. The young hero couldn't explain it but he felt attracted by this powerful dirty pair of feet. When he finally touched them with his hands he discovered new qualities about them: her soles and toes are warm which is really enjoyable to touch, the dirty part of her feet feel weirdly nice to touch and latest surprise, he really liked to touch the rough underskin of her feet! She seemed to appreciate Carl's foot rub and if he was perfectly honest, Carl felt the same too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels really good! What's your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carl ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan! That's a pretty weird way to know each others right?\" she said while giggling nervously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Dylan? Even her name is quite boyish * smiled Carl. Dylan noticed Carl's smile and asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"why are you smiling? Is it because I have a boyish name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N ... no no ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or perhaps because you have a weird fetish and you love the situation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl had a kind of adrenaline boost and felt like he could trust her: she seemed so frank, Carl felt he could really talk to her, he felt she wouldn't lie to him and he felt shed was not as bad as he thought so he gave her a honest reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact ... if I had to be perfectly honest with you Dylan ... it's because of both your boyish name and ... your feet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha ha ha ha!\" Dylan started to laugh out loud which strangely didn't disturbed Carl's foot rub! After twenty seconds of continuous laughter, Dylan had some tears on her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure have some balls for a rookie hero! Looks like my entire being is boyish, even my name, my look, my attitude, my power ... and even those feet you seem to appreciate! No one ever told something good about those \"big boys\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I hope I didn't sound too weird\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah worry not, I think the fact you like my boyish looking feet is kinda cute to be honest!\" Dylan took a few second to think, thinking of her whole conversation with Carl \"I like that not only because I think foot fetish is cute but also because ... well ... the fact you like my boyish feet is a sign that you accept my nature ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you rejected by others for you to say it like that?\" wondered Carl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda yeah, even when my powers were not activated, when I was in kindergarten other kids were mocking me because of how I looked and acted and at age 6 when I had that super strength everyone around me started to freak out and they Left me alone. From what I heard my mother and my father both had a recessive mutant gene which is how I got my powers. I randomly wandered in the street since several years though I kinda like my life in a way: I'm free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you survive all those years!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I joined an underground fighting league! It's sponsored by a bunch of rich kids/teens: they invite kids/teens with powers to do battles\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's horrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah not really! I like to fight so I appreciated it! and besides they're not bloody or anything! Keep in minds both fighters and sponsors are young! The system worked like that: you win, you get 1 buck, you win again you win 2 bucks, you win again you'll get 4 bucks etc ... You lose once you'll gain half of what you'd have gain. At the end of the fight they asked you to \"defeet\" ... if you know what I mean ... your opponent! I can tell you're not the first one to get under those size 16 feet of mine he he!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"size 16? Wow! ... I mean can you tell me more about that fighting league?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sure! well you can go whenever you want and nobody is kept prisoner! You have several categories of things to do, but almost all of them were fetish related ... feet especially:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Super Brawl: normal battles against either a kid with super powers, a teen with super powers, a weird/big monster etc ... The winner must defeet and humiliate the loser<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Super tag: it's just like the super brawl except it's either 2 vs 2 or 1 vs 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Super defeet: it gives a lots of money but you lose and humiliates yourself on purpose and you play with your opponent's feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Super maze: you alone or with a team of your choice try to go through a maze with guardians (super powers kids/teens or monsters selected by sponsors), traps etc ... that are destined to humiliate you and make you go through fetish situations!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Super sexual maze: same but it does fetish and sexual stuff! Nobody under 13 yo can participate oh and worry not, all contestants give their full consent not only for that but for all other categories<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) Super humiliate a rich kid\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* \"super humiliate a rich kid? That sure is a weird name * thought Carl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"in that 6th kind of battle a rich kid loses on purpose and is humiliated by you and your feet! Anyway yeah that's pretty much as things go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure nobody is forced because that'd be illegal otherwise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm sure of it! And all contestants are 17 or younger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was trying to analyze all what Dylan told him. He was sure she wasn't guilty of any crime, she seemed honest for someone who caused a mess and seemed more like a victim of normal persons' prejudices. While still massaging her dirty feet he asked her one thing to be sure of it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One question though: why did the farmer's market was deserted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's simple: the farmer's daughter was driving a car but she obviously drank too much hooch anyway she didn't see me and the card was almost destroyed when it touched me. People thought I did that or purpose so they freaked out and run away and I stayed here during hours, hours and hours without any famous hero being interested by this \"affair\", guess you're more noble and motivated than them Carl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sounds like it ...\" said Carl with a depressive voice when suddenly he wanted to know something after he analyzed what she told him \"wait a second: you were unaffected by a car driving at you? Just how freaking strong are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmmmmm .... a lot more than you that's for sure he he!\" Said Dylan to Carl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though at least I didn't one shot you so you're not completely hopeless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you ... I guess!\" replied Carl while still massaging her feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's enough with the massage stuff! Thank you Carl and I'm glad to know you liked my size 16 feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pleasure was mine\" replied Carl honestly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I kinda want to hang out with you. I could bring you to the fighting league so you could \"gain xp\" and beat the hell out of crime easily or I could help you to fight crime or if you want you can still play with my feet. I really like that ... If you want I could get them very filthy for you by walking barefoot in a swamp not far from here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"one question: did some opponents there defeated you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my first one was again a fat 12 years old girl! She was stronger than me in my base form so I had to become \"giant\" to overpower her. Though at that moment she decided to go barefoot and she used some kind of weird foot hypno on me and I was completely mind controlled by her fat feet. She had huge size 22 feet and I kinda ... liked to be humiliated and hypnotized by her big feet to be honest .... even if I lost. Though if you're curious I won most of other fights\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl started to think about his next decision ...</span></div></div>",

Anger at the carelessness of the supposed cape crusaders who just let this happen. Fear of some beast just wandering among innocent campers. Unsure of himself to accomplish such a grand task-he have not even truly tested how exactly how strong he is and the limits. But judging by what know he can do...it ain't much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the thought of people being in danger and his borderline obsession with heroic justice soon won over reason and fear as he grabbed his jacket and wore his dad's old football helmet over his head. Grabbing a bat belonging to his jock of an older brother. He carefully snuck out the window-floating safely in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere he flew high into the sky. Going into the direction of the campgrounds. Thanking god that it isn't that far from his house...it is <i>quite</i> close actually.

His hearts felt like it was going to burst as he flew in new speeds he didn't know he was even capable of doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the forest of the camp in a couple of seconds, his body felt exhausted as he floated above the tree-line. There are many downed trees with massive holes shaped remarkably similar to a human's foot in the ground. As he followed the trail, he notices an odd liquid staining the fallen leaves and ground.

He also began to notice a nice floral scent wafting through the forest that seemed to relax him and refresh his exhausted body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found the source of the smell and downed trees about a minute later. It was a green giantess, about 20ft tall slumbering on her back in the middle of multiple fallen trees. Her skin was dark green, moist and plant-like, with some flowers growing on her arms and legs. She had a row of freckles above the bridge of her nose and large tree-like antlers on the side of her head. The only article of clothing she wore was a pair of oversized blue overalls, slightly torn and messy from the battle earlier. Carl continued to observe the giantess, noting the bruises and cuts she had on her body. It was likely that she ran into the forest and then passed out from her injuries soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carl pondered on what to do with the unconscious monster, the flowery scent hit his nostrils yet again even stronger then before.

Carl flew closer to the Giantess\u2019 light green soles, getting the full brunt of their rosy stench. It wasn\u2019t surprising to him that her feet were caked with dirt considering all the running she had done. As the Giantess\u2019 toes wiggled in her slumber, Carl suddenly began to feel aroused wanting to worship this sleeping goddess\u2019 feet from top to bottom.

Then again, he did seem kinda skittish and anxious; even if he was a weirdo, he didn't seem like a bad guy, just a bit too eager to jump the gun. Not to mention that it wasn't every day she got to experience new things, especially concerning humans and their technology\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was lost in thought, she subconsciously scrunched and fanned out her mighty, tired digits, unknowingly heightening her little acquaintance's lust. This time, Carl couldn\u2019t help but stare into the soft, dirtied soles in front of him, getting lost in the gentle gust of sweaty, sickly sweet musk that blew his way. His eyes intimately traced their massive, shapely form, from the firm, smooth heels, to the damp, wrinkled insteps, to the powerful, pronounced balls, and finally resting at the soft whorls of each individual toe. They were almost\u2026hypnotic\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, he HAD to indulge himself, or else he\u2019d go crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully walking up to the giant, sea-green peds, he plants a gentle, open-mouthed kiss on the groove of her big toe\u2019s pad.

His eyes began to glaze over as he stared at the paws. He never felt like this around any man, especially not a fifty-foot tall wolfman, but there was something about the feet that made him feel... strange. Was it the furry, flexing toes tipped with sharp claws? Was it the paw pads on his soles? Was it the musky, manly scent that made him feel subservient?

There was only one word that very clearly came to mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Feet.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a rough, brutish, dumb creature, the werewolf had a secret weapon: intelligence-dampening pheromones that spewed from his feet.

But I must confront whatever this evil is! For the safety of the citizens of Emberville!</i> Building up all his courage, Carl flew into the room at top-speed ready to take down whatever was haunting this abandoned hospital. As soon as he entered the room he got into a generic hero pose as he tried to deepen his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop whatever you\u2019re doing evil-doers! Or you shall face the consequences you...uh...\u201d Carl actually got a good luck at whatever he was facing, noticing that the he was staring down at six goth girls all wearing either black or purple cloaks. They all stood in a circle around a pentagram on the ground which looked to have been made from Red Paint at least it seemed to be. Candles illuminated the dark room and Carl was able to tell that all the girls were strangely barefoot. One of the girls let out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on. Who\u2019d think some dweeby wannabe hero would storm in here like they own the place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow old is this guy? Like five? Isn\u2019t it past your bedtime kid?\u201d Carl scowled, it being quite obvious to anyone that he was way older then five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have time for such petty insults. What are you girls doing here at this time of night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh just summoning a Demon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh I see. Then have a good-WHAT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm? Yeah it\u2019s no biggie. We were just going to summon a powerful Foot Demon that we were going to use to take over all of Emberville. Heck maybe even the entire world! And luckily for you, you came just in time to see the final act!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...aaaah...Huh?\u201d Carl was admittedly, a bit taken aback by what he just heard. Were these girls really about to summon a demon? There was no way right? That was outrageous! As Carl recomposed himself all six girls had taken off their cloaks, revealing the clothing they wore underneath it, all of them wearing different styles of goth clothing. The girl opposite of Carl, who seemed to be the leader, was wearing a standard black Goth Lolita dress with fingerless pink and black striped gloves and matching stockings which left her feet bare. She seemed quite a bit older then the other girls probably around her mid 20s, with a sizable bust as well.

Are you <i>kidding me</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeks of preparation...for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It took days to draw that sigil just right, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of disappointed cries and groans echo throughout the makeshift summoning room. All the goths looked very upset, and one of them was even starting to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-waaahhh...\" she sniffled, \"Instructor Lina, are we really that bad at this? We can't even manage a basic summoning ritual...this was the weakest one in the book...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oldest goth was almost too defeated to try and comfort the poor girl, her own self-esteem taking a hard hit from this failure. Carl, meanwhile, couldn't even get a kick out of this; even on his worst days, he was pretty damn sure he wasn't <i>this</i> pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the leader of the bunch uttered some words of reassurance to the younger goth, \"Don't worry, Shelly, I'm sure we just miscalculated how much powdered mandragora root we needed to use.\" She pats the girl (apparently named Shelly) on the head, gets off her chair, and clears her throat, ready to re-inspire her apprentices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe motions to each of the girls, lining them up for a roll call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelly!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-present, and reporting for duty, ma'am!\" the petite, emotional goth from before responded, raising her right arm up in a fierce army salute\u2014at least, as fierce as it could be, coming from someone of her tiny stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rather plain, average-height goth with not much to discern herself from the others raised one of her hands, the other absentmindedly playing with her skirt. \"Present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlotte!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snarky goth who called Carl a dweeb\u2014how uncouth!\u2014crossed her arms, and muttered 'present' with a hint of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shirley!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe largest of the students sat up from her chair, sulking and generally looking a bit downcast from the failed ritual. She only spoke with a terse 'here', and left it at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last goth remaining said nothing, choosing instead to stay still in her seat. Wait a minute...was she snoring?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PATTY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cringed, nearly jumping out of her seat. \"Okay, jeez, I'm here.\" she mumbled, clearly unenthused with the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls, acquiring the materials again might be a pain, but I'm sure if all six of us work together and do our due diligence\u2014looking at you, Patty\u2014we can get the same ritual up and running in a week's time. The Pododaimones might have failed now, but we can't give up hope just yet. As long as we try, we can always surely do! The world will be beneath our feet in no time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls look back to their teacher, her speech mildly cheering them up. Even Patty looked kinda happy. After that pep talk, they all started to converse with each other again, singing some kind of made-up theme song for their goth group. Carl thought it was somewhat touching, if quite bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him, it didn't take long for one of them to take note of his continued presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that dweeb from before? He's still here!\" Charlotte piped up, drawing him into the center of attention once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie added in, \"Yeah, why'd he have to come and ruin everything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly turned her head to the side and pouted. \"Jerk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny sympathy Carl had for these ineffectual goth chicks vanished. \"H-hey! First of all, I'm not a dweeb, or a jerk for that matter! I'm just very passionate about my duty to society,\" he took a moment to strike a pose, closing his eyes, raising his chin, and holding a fist to his chest. \"Second of all, I didn't do anything; you guys were the ones who screwed up this weird, foot-based ritual thingy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom some nondescript location, an unknown voice whines. <i>Oh, Carl, you're an idiot! That didn't help your situation at all!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls got riled up at our awkward greenhorn of a hero (who has recently added 'intruder' to his embarrassingly long list of self-descriptors), something had changed in the atmosphere of the room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A) The ritual was a success after all! A Foot Demon (potentially stronger than what they expected) was successfully summoned; now Carl has to deal with six troublemakers and a less-than-ideal threat. The loyalty of said demon still doesn't necessarily have to lie with the goths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B) The ritual didn't summon a Foot Demon; instead, it malfunctioned and bestowed those present for the ritual the aspect of Foot Demons. The goths now have various Foot Demon powers, and their scent has become way more potent than before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption C) Instructor Lina decides to force Carl to prostrate at the summoning sigil, thinking that it might cause the ritual to succeed. Even if it doesn't, it's a pretty effective way to raise group morale after this little setback.</span></div></div>",

Causing him an quickly turned to see two young girls both in...strangely lolita styled dresses with hoods over their heads. Over their faces, they wore those iconic drama masks to further obscure their identities. His eyes only widen as he realizes who these two are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Daybreak and Nightfall!\" The mutant squeaked out in surprise at these masked youngsters to be only Eclipse twilight's very own entourage of sidekicks. They and along with their mistress are <i>magical girls</i>, a group of Inhumans developed in Japan to help fight the scores of Yokai and Weird beasts that plague the island nation. They are made, yes made not born, through a combination of the best bio-engineering technology money can buy and various genetic material and old magic and spiritual rituals. Eclipsed Twilight hailed from Japan and set up base somewhere near Emberville four decades ago. She has been one of America's most premier and driven heroes ever since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>' And also one of the most controversial for not only her seriously morally questionable origins and her cold callous behavior. But for the fact she is one of the few modern-day heroes in the whole world who still have '<u>kid wonders</u>' as sidekicks...' </i> Being both a geek and bit of a fanatic on these things so-called by his older sister, Carl was well versed in the culture of heroes, and the various rumors surrounding the hero was not pleasant ...not pleasant at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, This <i>baka-nincompoop</i> does seem sharper than the average thug. Or perhaps we are so well known, that the scum of the earth is starting to fear the mention of moth-I mean lady <i>Twilght</i> and us <i>Fufufufu~</i>\" Daybreak lightly smiled and tried to play off her little slip-up like Carl didn't notice-which he did-, her dress was black as midnight, and it is accented with gold. Putting a velvet-gloved hand over the frowning mouth of her pale red Melpomene mask. While the opposite colored Nightfall only scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart dirt is still <i>dirt</i>. Dirt like this gaijin mongrel is meant to be under our heels.\" Nightfall spat out like venom somehow entered her mouth. The other brat's harsh tone was ironic considering that she was wearing a dark blue Thalia mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I am not scum, I'm-\" Carl was offended, he knew that being Eclipse's proteges must have to lead them to take some of their teacher's master queen bitch traits. Kids are impressionable after all. but this was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Garbage that needs to be <i>taken</i> out.\" Daybreak cut him off as Nightfall pounded her little fist into the palm and stomped towards him only to be stopped by a direct bolt of lightning striking the ground in the middle of where all three stood. Startling Carl like silly while the young girls tensed up but didn't seem afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him alone!\" A small slim girl yelled with arcane sigils floating around her outstretched hand. She was clothed with you would you expect from a goth...expect for her slim and small feet was bare and her most black hair had yellow roots. A strong indicator that it was poorly dyed. Opposed to black, the color of her thin toes was orange, Carl felt his cheeks inflamed and loins reacting-making him quickly look back at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis does not go unnoticed by either of them, but they focus on the topic at hand<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rats protecting rats huh, Typical,\" Nightfall growled as she stared at the girl who dares attack her. Well, you frowned at being forgotten so easily. Some things don't just change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And jerks will be Jerks. Typical\" The goth countered with an elegant raspberry, causing both of the younger girls to gasped with shock with such a vulgar display. But with Carl's better sense of hearing, he heard grumbling from within the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><i>\"The hell is Shelly? She is supposed to be the one sprinkling horn of Lung on the pentagram and lighting the candles!\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><i>\" I don't know, she is probably taking a dump, Linda.\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><i>\" She fuckin' better, That pretty boy, Gallant and his fan club gotta pay and I ain't gotta wait on her!\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><i>\"...I'm going to go check on her.

'</i> Carl sweated as both parties began to stare at each other. Both magical girls and the witch in front of him were immature as hell, can do some serious damage, And judging from the cacophony of soft slapping sounds, the barefoot goth will have reinforcements soon enough. This was bad, sure he was the physically strongest person there. But the two magical girls were pretty effective themselves and had their abilities as well as experience. And there was no telling what this \"Shelly\" chick and her gaggle is capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a fine mess the heroic nerd has gotten himself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>Lore</b>: The world is constantly barraged by many different types of evils. From fearsome giants rampaging cities, once thought to be magical fantasies and myths terrorizing the countryside, to aliens and other horrors that were once thought to be only science fiction was brought to reality! It was sure to be humanity's final hours, but sure enough numerous brave heroes fought these threats and continue to do so even after all these years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut recently in the year 2040, more and more heroes of this generation grew only to more prideful and corrupted by their social importance, slowly becoming just as bad as the numerous threats that they face which is growing stronger by the day! But there is hope in the dusk as in Emberville, Tennessee. A bright-hearted young man of the name: Carl Ruiz gained superpowers in a freak accident in chemistry class. Despite been only armed with low level superhuman abilities, fly barely faster than a car, and odd power to \"level up\". Carl Ruiz is determined make a difference in this world! Or die trying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...not the best thing to say in his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No short chapters! Keep a minimum of two to four paragraphs at a minimum. I will give leniency on some chapters but don't continuously make them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Unlike the rest of other my interactives, Sexual content is more heavily referenced and will mostly happen depending on the things. And actual super \"lewd\" stuff may or not transpire in later chapters. But being constantly naked is which is a no-no.<br>\r\n3.2. Full-blown sex and actual romance will be something will you have to develop a relationship with an another character. None of which will be super young characters. Crushes can be formed quite easily however, and can act as a starting point for it.<br>\r\n3.3, Things like \"hands-on\" teasing, handjobs, and etc are fine though<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No toilet stuff, Major Weight gain, major limb expansion or inflation, super-hardcore femdom, or vore of any kind. That goes for any kink that goes against the flow of the story. But to nature of the stuff and themes of the story , shrinking/growing will be very much allowed, and encouraged! That goes for minor to medium muscle growth and such too!<br>\r\n4.1 I change my mind on transformation! Transformation as long it fits and not that out there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. My eternal rule: Not every foot have to smell like a cheese factory, nor do they smell like a field of daisies. Same goes for the feet's size and texture. Not every person is tall or is short for that matter. Not every girl has watermelon for tits. Or an ass that claps away thunderstorms. Variety is the spice of life, get what I'm saying. All too make feel a little more realistic and \"human\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 Your choices do matter in the long run and shape the main character's personality and also develop the others. And remember while you are free to do whatever you want. But remember, you aren't free from the consequences of said actions.<br>\r\n6.1. The protagonist is a nice but cowardly nerd(and closeted pervert) who has a bit of a hero complex and is kinda of a smart ass.<br>\r\n6.2. His age would...be vague. All I would say that he will be in somewhere in between of being fifteen to eighteen years old. Meaning he is in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Please keep the influx of choice chapters on the relatively low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Keep it, first person or second person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. No sudden abrupt endings and deaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Make all characters act their age and true to their personalities. But interpretations and exploration on them and how they react to things are not only allowed but is ENCOURAGED. Not to mention\u2026it's kinda one of the main themes of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. And while foot fetish is what you called the \"main\" kink of this story and will be encouraged . It doesn't mean that Carl is blind to a characters other \"assets\" *eyebrow wiggle*. But be warned, this isn't pure smut(and it can be kinda close). But playful mocking, outright bullying, and teasing is very much allowed and is encouraged. ;D<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. And while I'm straight. You can play, confront, and interact with both male and female characters. Although I would like more stuff focusing on girls. But no chapters with the character having a lewd interaction being adult and older adult males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. While Carl Ruiz is good deal weaker than most of the things he will face in the story. Doesn't mean that he can't win...but don't be surprised if he doesn't okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. The most important rule\u2026is to have fun, and get creative with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15. Second most important rule; no crossovers! Keep it purely original!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
