Except today, the male fighters have gathered in the men's locker room to plot this year's prank on the females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ook ook ook!\" Diddy Kong uttered first. Given his love for fruit and mischief, his idea seemed to involve banana peels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahahaha!\" Wario chimed in next. \"How about we set up a fake charity or something? The girls would feel so sorry for us, we'd be swimming in coins for days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd best be methodical about our prank...\" Robin spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way ahead of you!\" Shulk smiled, removing a sheet from atop a strange-looking machine. \"Ness and I perfected this beauty last night. With this device, we'll become impossible for the girls to detect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And HOW do you expect this to work, exactly?\" Meta Knight asked. \"Because Kirby's already pressing buttons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe masked swordsman turned out to be correct - the pink puffball, ever curious and clueless, was slamming his hands on the machine's various buttons at random, much to the others' worry. \"Poyo~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShulk paled as Kirby neared a big, red, dangerous-looking button. \"NO! DON'T -- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK! With that catastrophic button pressed, the entire machine glowed an eerie green, firing beams of the same color at everyone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirby, you idiot!!\" King Dedede yelled as the room seemed to gradually grow for him and the other guys...but in mere seconds, they all blacked out. Thankfully, they weren't awake to hear the device explode in a fiery burst. By then, everyone in the room was roughly half an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho wakes up first?</span></div></div>",

Spotting his unconscious brother Luigi nearby, Mario rushed over to try waking him as well. Alas, not even the waters of FLUDD seemed to work. Luigi always was a heavy sleeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey needed help. With his unwavering courage, Mario bolted out of the room in hopes of finding some normal-sized aid. Soon enough, the red-clad hero heard gigantic footsteps approaching his current location...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was coming?</span></div></div>",

His vision faded as he tumbled from the sky- his last view was the edge of the stage as he tumbled out of bounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby awoke a little later. Rubbing his eyes, he glanced around. It looked like he had landed in the Mushroom Kingdom's roofs of all places. Hopping to his feet, he looked upwards into the sky- unsure how he fell to this location. Then again, they didn't fully understand all the rules of the arena's, it wasn't like they were playing an official match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuffing up, Kirby hopped down, bouncing carefully onto a window ledge. Kirby's eyes widened as he saw his fellow combatant, Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach was finishing up on a cake she had made, squirting the icing over it with a little hum. Not noticing Kirby hopping up and down on the windowsill as she spoke,<br>\r\n\"- I hope Mario will return soon!\" Peach smiled, plopping a cherry in as Kirby started to fly over. \"I believe I made enough for everyone!\" She smiled looking proud of her achievement as Kirby drew closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Kirby as about to run out of jumps, a face he didn't notice before popped up. He was so focused on Peach he failed to notice her company. Paniced flailing amounted to nothing as Palutena walked right into him- her face smacking into his body- knocking him down onto her chest.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you have- but surely we could have a little taste-\" Palutena boomed, leaning over the cake while covering her mouth to hide her drool and protect the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby could only barely hold onto the jiggling tits, making small noises to try and get her attention as he watched Palutena's gloved hand reach for a knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot given a chance to react, Kirby was suddenly flung away from the breast as Peach slapped away the goddess's hand.

He hoped to see her eyes lock onto him as she glanced at her friend.<br>\r\n\"Ok! Ready?\" She giggled, the gforces hitting Kirby as Peach positioned him close to her face. Kirby's wiggling went unnoticed- even this close as she lined up the shot. He looked at her face- her eyes just missing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby's stomach lurched as he was rocked back and forth as she counted,<br>\r\n\"Oooone- twwwwwo-\" Peach smiled, while Palutena started to look a little impatient. Neither noticed Kirbies startled face as he looked into Palutena's maw. \"Three!\" Peach started to toss Kirby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny ball paniced as the playful princess moved him towards Palutena's dripping maw, before swerving him around towards her own plump lips. Kirby opened his mouth again to try and make a noise but it was too late, his face was quickly pushed into Peaches playful lips- smearing a small amount of lipstick over him before popping the perceived sweet in with a wet slurp. The princess giggled at Palutena's disappointed face as she rolled the sweet around her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on her tongue, Kirby panicked as the sweet smelling saliva blinded him. Attempting to roll to his feet, suddenly felt a bit of suction before sliding down her throat. He gave a weak yelp before his squishy form was squished down her neck- coated in sticky saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Peach went from playful teasing to minor surprise as she swallowed hard, looking uncomfortable as a small bulge passed her collar bone. <br>\r\n\"Oh my-\" The princess winced, grabbing a pre-poured glass of water while lightly clearing her throat. She took a sip to sooth herself a little. \"I didn't expect it to roll to the back of my throat like that-\" She spoke, confused and rubbing her throat. <br>\r\n\"Serves you right for teasing like that-\" Palutena pouted, as Peach reached into the draws and pulled out a jar of cherries. <br>\r\n\"Apologies, I thought that would be funny- didn't expect to choke though!\" She smiled apologetically, offering the jar of cherries with a practiced smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kirby dropped into Peaches stomach with a small plop. He surfaced- just to have the luke warm water pour over his head. Crawling to the side, Kirby tried his best to stay out of the acid as he tried to think of a way out.</span></div></div>",

This must be part of this year\u2019s prank.\u201d Palutena stomped her foot, startling Kirby. She remembered last year\u2019s prank when all of her dresses had been turned pink. The goddess had been stuck wearing pink for a month which had been embarrassing. Palutena then looked at Kirby and thought for a moment before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this is a prank, then we can probably turn the tables on them.\u201d The goddess stated. Princess Peach looked at her, wondering what she was thinking. Before she could react, Palutena tossed Kirby towards her, causing him to land in between her breasts. Peach blushed, causing her friend to giggle. \u201cThey\u2019re now at our mercy. We can teach them the dangers of pranking a powerful goddess and a beautiful princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Peach pulled Kirby out and smiled. The puffball was really worried. They could do what they want to him, and had a desire for revenge. Although he had never pulled a prank on them personally, their smiles didn\u2019t comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could even kill them if we wanted. After all, they\u2019ll just respawn. Hm, how does <b>angel cake</b> sound?\u201d Peach asked. The two girls giggled at the idea.</span></div></div>",

They were still completely unaware of him which made the star warrior nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet. We\u2019re going to wait for the others first.\u201d Peach said. Palutena\u2019s belly grumbled with disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh very well, but can we at least have something?\u201d The goddess asked. Peach smiled and opened the refrigerator.

My seat feels a little funny.\u201d The woman responded. She shifted in her seat trying to get comfortable. Kirby yelled, all of her moments were pushing him around a bit. He soon found himself in between her butt cheeks. Half of his body was now free which game him some air. He was still stuck and starting to get annoyed at this. \u201cI think that\u2019s better.\u201d Palutena said before grabbing another grape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirby gave a sigh and decided\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: He was going to try and escape again.
