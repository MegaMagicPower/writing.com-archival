As you slowly get your bearings, your skin crawls and your heart begins to pound like mad.  Everything around you is colossal, but it doesn't take long to realize you're the one out of place.  Whatever just happened to you, you're shrunk.  Minuscule.  You can't be more than a few inches tall.  Thankfully, whatever it was, your clothes shrank with you.  You quickly try to survey your surroundings, your memory coming back in a snap.  You're in the back parking lot of the local gas station, from the looks of it behind one of the parking blocks.  And just your luck, this small-ass town doesn't have much of a crowd.  You scramble to your feet, trying not to panic as you look for somebody to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour spirits perk up as you hear the scuffling of shoes on pavement.  But just as quickly, a pit forms in your stomach.  Towering over you like a titan is Dustin.  Once that creep had dropped out during your junior year, you had thought you'd never have to see him again.  Whenever he chose to pay attention to you, it had usually been just to amuse himself at your expense, whether it was grabbing you in a headlock during gym class, cornering you in the back of the bus and sitting on you, or any other of his irritating little games.  But hey...beggars can't be choosers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yell at the top of your lungs, waving your arms.  \"DUSTIN!  DOWN HERE MAN!  HELP ME!\"  You're not sure if he actually heard you or just happened to see you as he was looking down to grab something out of the plastic bag he's carrying, but his smug brown eyes lock onto you, quickly widening with more enthusiasm than you've ever seen in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy...\"  Dustin stops dead in his tracks, looking like he might pinch himself.  Slowly squatting down, his thick thighs stretching his sweatpants, he peers at you.  \"Hey...I know you!  You're that little runner twerp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resist the urge to roll your eyes (of COURSE that's how this idiot would remember you)  and try to give him a smile.  \"Yeah dude!  Can you help me out?  I don't know what happened but I...\"  Your voice trails off.  Something about the look on his face is VERY unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin looks around quickly, making sure no one's there to spot the two of you, as he snatches you up and drops you into his bag.  You land in a pile of chips, candy bars and soda bottles, clearly he was here on a junk food run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...hey what are you doing?!  HEY!!!\"  You yell and thrash, trying to get up as your foundation constantly shifts.  You grunt as Dustin plops the bag down on the passenger seat in his car, slamming his door shut and peeling out of the parking lot, burning rubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour spine feels like ice as your heart leaps into your throat.  This may have just gotten very, VERY bad.</span></div></div>",

Every time you manage to make any progress, he jostles the bag, sending you tumbling to the bottom again, or reaches his giant fingers in, shoving you down as you grimace in disgust at the dirt buried under his nails and ground into his prints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea how much time has passed, or where you've gone, until Dustin grabs the bag and your world sways as he carries you.  You hear keys fumbling in a lock, followed by the swinging and slamming of a door.  You can smell the dingy scent of nicotine and smoke lingering in the new environment, the light faint  and hazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thud onto a coffee table with an \"OOF!\"  Plastic crinkles around you as Dustin clears his purchases to the side, grinning down at you.  You're scared, but on top of that, you're irritated.  A lot.  You shoot an icy blue glare at him, met only by his smug smirk that seems to accentuate his cheeks and double chin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing!?\"  You furiously scramble to your feet, looking for a way down.  Anger is probably the only thing fending off sheer panic at this point.  At your size, there's no way you're getting off this table on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin chuckles, staring down at you.  \"Mouthy, huh?  We'll have to fix that.\"  You can see his big belly shake as he laughs haughtily at you.  \"Don't sweat it though.  By the time I'm done training you, you'll learn to show your owner proper respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that word is like a slap across your face.  Your glare fades into a wide eyed look of worry.  \"Owne...what are you...you can't be serious!\"  Your skin crawls as you realize the true severity of your situation.  \"Dustin, man, please!  Just...just take me home!  I promise you'll get a reward, we'll pay you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat smirk seems almost burned into Dustin's face as he reaches down, running his grubby finger along your side, feeling you.  \"You ARE home, runt.  I  OWN your punk ass now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerk away from the giant slob's touch, recoiling in disgust.  Slowly you scoot back, staring up at him worriedly, the curl in the corner of his lips sending shivers to your core.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dustin shrugs off his hoodie, tossing it onto the corner of the couch with a few other garments that look like they've been there quite a while.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around, taking in the pigsty of your surroundings.  Ashtrays full of cigarette butts are scattered throughout the living room, food wrappers littering the floor.  An overflowing trash can sits unattended in the corner, with lewd posters hanging on the walls and Playboys and Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Editions casually left out in the open.  Dustin had always been a slob in school, but freedom and adulthood (if that word fit this jackass) have clearly taken things to the next level.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin kicks off his shoes and peels his shirt off.  His flesh jiggles as he pulls the fabric over his head and drops it to the floor, not caring where it lands.  He snickers, giving his belly a few slaps, making it bounce and wobble.  \"Get a load o' that, runt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snort in disgust, turning your head and trying to look away as color flushes into your cheeks.  Dustin only leans in closer, jiggling and kneading his ample flabby gut, taking up more and more of your field of vision.  You recalled more than one instance of a classmate winding up with their face crammed  in that ball of blubber while Dustin smothered them.  He'd tried to do it to you several times, but you'd always managed to shake him before he could pull it off.  At this size...you didn't want to think about what he'd do in one of his moods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin's chuckles make your skin crawl as he continues fondling his lard and showing himself off to you.  \"Lucky, LUCKY me.  I always wanted my own personal bitch to rub and lick my big, fat belly.\"  You swear that smirk must be stuck on his face permanently by now.  \"And now I've got an obedient little slaveboy to do it on the daily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerk your head back toward him, almost retching at the thought.  \"That's disgusting!\"  Your fingers curl into fists as you try to show a backbone.  \"There's no way in hell I'm doing that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin shrugs, grabbing a Snickers bar.  Tearing the wrapper off, he holds it next to you, squinting as he figures out the size difference and tears a chunk off of it until it's your equivalent height.  Holding it out to you, he brings the bar to his lips, stuffing it in his mouth.  With a deeply audible GULP, Dustin swallows the chocolate whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a moment to process that through this insanity.  No...he wouldn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think you're gonna see things my way, runt.\"  Dustin's deep booming laughter makes your heart sink, your skin prickling with goosebumps.  \"In fact, you could say I've got a GUT feeling about it.\"  He slaps his belly again, loudly smacking his lips and slurping his tongue around.  His threat is perfectly obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of ending up swallowed by this fat loser fills you with more dread than you've felt in your entire life.  This isn't fair!  You had your whole life ahead of you...you didn't even get to graduate yet!  Any pride you had breaks down as you plead pathetically, just wanting this nightmare to be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, please!  Don't do this to me!\"  Your face is pale, your eyes shimmering as you struggle not to cry at the sheer injustice of it all.  \"I have plans with my friends and family all summer, I'm supposed to start college in the fall!  I worked my ass off to get my scholarship!  I have a LIFE!  You can't just...\"  You choke up.  It's perfectly obvious he's not listening to a word you say as he strips his sweatpants off.  His underwear hugs tightly to his thighs and butt, almost a wonder how they don't rip open at any given moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin gloats, his big body bouncing from the vibrations as he chuckles.  \"Plans change, runt.\"  He runs his fingers against you again, this time across your chest and face, making you thrash and grimace.  He thumbs his waistband, stretching it out, and in, and out tauntingly.  \"You're goin' to Boxers University.\"  He lets his waistband snap shut, sending a ripple through his soft thick torso.  \"Your dorm mate is gonna LOOOOOVE you.\"  He sneers as he grips his bulge, shaking it at you through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to puke, feeling like you might at any second.  You're revolted, repulsed, nauseated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk about a 'full ride,' huh?\"  Dustin cackles, thrusting and shaking his hips at you.  With a THUD, he plops down on the couch, relaxing as he eyes you.  \"Alright runt.  Strip down and let's get to breaking you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dustin was huge! He had just proven he could send you down to his massive gut even easier than a piece of chocolate. he could squash you like a bug with his belly alone. He made your life hell even when you were just a few inches shorter than him. But here you were, telling him no. And yet, you couldn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't make me do whatever you want, you fat asshole!\" Dustin's eyes narrow. The words keep pouring out against your will. \"I'm not touching that oily beach ball you call a stomach and I'm sure as hell not getting anywhere near your disgusting dick!\" This was definitely insane. Dustin's lips had contorted into a scowl just a few words into your tirade. Suddenly, he seemed a thousand times more intimidating. A darkness befalls his gaze as he steps closer to the coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour rage-induced bravado melts away in an instant. Dustin's mountainous belly lloms above you, hanging over his lap enough to crush you if he knelt down. You feel a rush of fear throughout your body. How could you do something so <i>stupid?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so I'm disgusting, huh?\" Dustin's voice drips with anger. You can't see his face, but you know he has to be pissed. What you can see, however, is his bulge. His underwear, straining against his girth, twitches suddenly. Your heart sinks. He's getting off on this. The fat bastard is actually turned on by all of this!? \"Well then, I'll show you just how disgusting I can be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can react, Dustin's meaty paw descends from the heavens and slams against you. You lose every ounce of air in your lungs as his fingers squeeze down tight. </span></div></div>",

His grip all but squeezes the air out of your lungs. You struggle against his hand for those few seconds, but you are truly powerless against him. Dustin has you totally trapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, guess I'll show you how gross I can really be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice washes over you in a sickly sweet wave. You feel a humid mist before you even hear his words. His warm breath smells of mountain dew and chocolate. It's possibly the only relief of this situation. At least his breath isn't rank, but that means little in the face of what is to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou force yourself to open your eyes. Before you are Dustin's lips surrounding a shit-eating grin. You can't even see past his chubby cheeks on either side of you. He has you held so closely up to his mouth that you can feel the heat coming off of his face. Your heart pounds in your chest. \"Du-Dustin, wait, please! I-I didn't mean i--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can finish stammering out your plea for mercy, Dustin does something you really should have expected. His mouth yawns open, tendrils of spittle stretching from roof to tongue. You feel the heat of his breath once again. You can't help but stare in horror at the sight before you. His tongue sits at the bottom of his mouth like a pink beached whale. His cheeks and throat glisten with the little light that makes it into his maw, shifting and waving with the smallest of movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes are drawn to the back of his throat by sudden movement. His esophagus ripples for just a moment before you realize what's about to happen. And you're unable to even close your eyes before it hits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><i><b>BUUUUWWAAAAAARRRRUUUUP</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin's belch roars out of him like a hurricane. You feel your hair pushed backward by the force of the winds escaping his belly. The air itself is as acidic as his stomach. If a summer breeze could be horrible, then this was the worst one you'd ever experienced. If not for Dustin's hand holding you in place, you would have been blown back by the force of his belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like an eternity before the burp ends. You fall limp, utterly defeated by an action as simple as a man burping in your face. You can hardly breathe. The scent lingers in the air like a cloud of fog. You had survived Dustin's belches before, but nothing could have prepared you for a gale-force wind of gas at three inches tall. Immediately after his belch fades, you hear Dustin burst into a fit of laughter. his mirth doesn't help your nausea in the slightest. With every chuckle, his hand bounces you in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bwahahaha! Holy shit, that actually fucked you up?\" Dustin chortles. \"Damn, maybe this is a better idea. What kind of toy can't even handle one of my burps?\" You cough weakly, finally opening your eyes. Your vision is blurry, but the scene has hardly changed. \"Besides, I've always wondered what it'd be like to destroy someone with this huge gut.\" You gaze down just in time to see Dustin heft his stomach with his free hand. He wobbles the fat about, chuckling once more. \"And who knows, you might be the best snack I've had all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't get the chance to protest. Dustin's hand moves forward, shoving you headfirst toward his maw. Immediately, survival instinct takes over. You push and pull at his fingers, kick and scream as much as you can, but there's nothing you can do. You pass between his plump lips and into the humid chamber. Already, the scent and heat are worse than his belch. It's almost as if the cloud of gas lingered in his mouth. A cough escapes your throat the second you try to breathe in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin's grip changes and your torso falls. Without the support of his fist, there's nothing keeping you from falling face first onto his tongue. It makes the most disgusting <i>splat </i>the second you make contact. His tongue conforms to your head, taste buds rubbing against your cheeks. You can't stop the cry of disgust that escapes your mouth. His saliva spreads across your face and chest, soaking your clothes in filth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA demonic hum echoes throughout Dustin's mouth. You realize with a start that he's <i>moaning </i>at your taste. The bastard was enjoying your flavor! You want to scream, but doing so would earn you a mouthful of your bully's tongue. And yet, it's not like much better is on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head enters Dustin's throat, his hand sliding you steadily across his tongue. You feel your skull slide past the slick muscles. They grip down on you like a vice. You keep struggling and pushing, but your strength is nothing against his tongue. You're as helpless as the candy currently stewing away in his guts. You're doomed....</span></div></div>",

You initially landed atop a bag of chips, the air-filled sack only barely breaking your fall. You winced as you slowly picked yourself up. However, that wouldn't last long. As soon as you managed to get to your feet on the uneven, rocky surface of a Lays bag, Dustin tore out of the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, you were thrown to the side. You didn't even have the chance to shout. Your small body plowed into the rough side of his bag with the force of a truck. The squealing from his tires as they surely ripped themselves apart roared in your ears. You slowly fell from the wall, peeling off like an old sticker. You soon landed with a cellophane crinkle upon his other snacks, dazed and winded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even get the chance to stand up before Dustin throws you for a loop once again. The car suddenly shoots to the side, sending his bag along with it. You only managed to sit up before being tossed into the side of a candy bar. Its surface distends a bit beneath its wrapping; clearly it has melted a bit. That's possibly the furthest thing from your mind in the moment though. You just try to focus on staying conscious and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach turn Dustin takes makes you feel like he thinks he's a Nascar driver. He whips around curves like a demon! It's a miracle that he's never been arrested for speeding before. Actually, maybe he has. You were never sure which rumors about him were true, but perhaps this was too boring to make the local gossip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when you were attempting to hold onto a soda bottle that the sliver of light that signaled your only gateway to the real world widened. You managed to force yourself to look upward, your eyes widening at the sight of Dustin's massive hand descending into the bag. <i>Grabbing a snack for the road,</i> you think to yourself. Because of course he is. You couldn't remember many instances where the guy didn't have junk food in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, Justin's massive paw seemed to be on a crash course for you. You realize that his palm is just above you a second too late. His hand slams into your body, squashing you against the floor of cellophane wrappers and plastic. You groan in pain for that single moment, discomfort racing through every nerve. His palm is moist with sweat and radiates heat. It presses against you like a wet blanket. You find your face utterly smashed into his pudgy hand, air constricted even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, his fingers latch on, wrapping around you. Your body is once again trapped within his painful grip as he drags you back out into the light.</span></div></div>",
