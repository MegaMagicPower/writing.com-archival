He'd been dumped for somebody using a stolen identity, then discovered magic was real by being turned 80-years-old. If anyone deserved a vacation, it was him, and it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had already been two weeks, in fact. Dan hadn't left the house much, except to pick up groceries and necessities. He also hadn't exercised much. He'd never had cause to before, with his work being almost solely physical labor. He was definitely muscular across his 6' frame. And though a picture might not have showed a difference, he could feel one. There was padding all over -- he felt softer, and everytime he stuffed himself by ordering too much food, his belly relaxed and he fell asleep happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd put on a total of 10 lbs without trying, or caring.

No. I just came back from the past and -- why would a spell backfiring make me skinny?\"<br>\r\nWyatt eyed Chris suspiciously. \"Where are the creaky steps at the Manor?\"<br>\r\nChris paused. \"Uh, three from the top at the attic, four from the main hallway, and every third one going down into the basement. Wait, unless Dad fixed the one by the attic.\"<br>\r\nWyatt continued eyeing Chris suspiciously, and began slowly circling, which almost involved waddling. \"Okay, so if you're a shapeshifter you're bad at it, but you know the manor.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not a demon,\" Chris protested, \"I'm just from the past. Or, from a different future by way of the past.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait... what?\"<br>\r\n\"I had to go back to stop Gideon from turning you evil.\"<br>\r\nWyatt let down his guard and laughed.<br>\r\n\"I know man, I'm just messing with you.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh thank God. So why glamour yourself fat?\"<br>\r\nWyatt laughed. \"Oh, this isn't a glamour. It's just fun. Now let's get you back to... you.\"<br>\r\nWyatt grabbed his brother's hand and orbed them back to the Manor kitchen, where Chris was rather shocked to see himself sitting at the table, eating ice cream. A 300 lb version of himself.<br>\r\n\"What? How?\"<br>\r\nFat Chris explained. \"Well, Aunt Phoebe told us you'd be coming back soon. And from what she told us about her trip to the future, it sounded like you'd take the place of whatever Chris was already here, in the different future. I didn't want to lose the brother I know, so we changed his identity. That way, when you came back, you came back as yourself.\"<br>\r\n\"That... makes sense, actually.\"<br>\r\nFat Chris smiled and kept eating his ice cream.<br>\r\n\"Nothing else does, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyatt sat down at the table and indicated for skinny Chris to do the same. He then conjured a large plate of brownies and started in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you guys so fat?\"<br>\r\n\"Tactful as ever,\" Fat Chris said.<br>\r\n\"Oh leave you alone. He's just surprised everything's changed so much. Here, this'll help.\"<br>\r\n\"Brother from another time,<br>\r\nLost in his different rhyme,<br>\r\nshow him the ropes of this clime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkinny Chris glowed, and when the light disappated,</span></div></div>",

He finished the bowl off in seconds, and eyed the rest of the kitchen hungrily. The remainder of the burgers and fries from Wyatt's fast food were sitting on the island -- he demolished them in record time. Still feeling strangely starving, but now able to resist for a moment, he managed a question of Wyatt between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... did you... do... to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Chris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyatt looks legitimately sorry, but also vaguely entertained that this is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just meant for you to be caught up on what has changed since you came back. But you know the rules, you'll just have to see it through until the spell completes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the fast food demolished, Chris moved on to the gallon container of ice cream his fat counterpart had left out. Like the bowl, he scooped and then poured into his mouth. He got surprisingly little of the food on himself, given the speed he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't even take a time-lapse camera to see Chris's stomach steadily stretching to fill the food. He grabbed a container of store-bought cookies, opened them, and finished them off in just two minutes. The light came again, and dissapated, and Chris sat down, collapsed rather, into a chair. He groaned; his stomach was overstuffed and stretched. He looked a couple months pregnant with the bloating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWyatt and Fat Chris helped him to the couch to relax. Fat Chris sat along side him on the couch, rubbing his belly. It totally changed the sensation from discomfort to relaxing warmth. Chris started to breathe easier, and was now enjoying the sensations of being full. The world grew fuzzy around him and he focused only on the warmth of his belly. He moaned a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're getting it.\" Wyatt said.<br>\r\n\"It's still weird,\" said skinny Chris, watching his own hands massage his body, \"but I see the appeal.\"<br>\r\n\"So... do you want to catch up?\"</span></div></div>",

Chris feels his midsection grow first, so quickly he falls on the pillow he just stepped on. His shirt gets tighter and rips as he passes 180, 200 lbs, and his jeans pull apart at the side seams, barely held in place by a few threads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he tries to get up, those few threads give way and the jeans fall. Chris doesn't let it get in the way of yelling as his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris moves his jaw again. Even talking feels different with a sudden extra 50 lbs on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tired of you not understanding why I like the fun side... I thought this might help you come around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris debates for a moment whether he should throw the return potion and try to change Wyatt from the past again. But, all things considered, fat is a major step up from evil. Chris decides to give his brother a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me up.\" Chris puts up a hand that Wyatt takes and yanks him up to standing. Chris is surprised by Wyatt's strength -- his body certainly conceals its muscle. Standing at his new weight, Chris feels the girth of it. His uncomfortably tight clothes outline his newly sensitive skin. Everything is rubbing something else, and it all feels a bit... sensual. He stops himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, now change me back.\"<br>\r\n\"You know that's not how this works. The spell will run its course.\"<br>\r\n\"What's the end of this one, then?\"<br>\r\n\"When you understand why I gain weight on purpose.\"<br>\r\n\"You what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Chris, we've been over this. I like the feeling of fullness, and the way my body feels and looks. And I wish you would accept that.\"<br>\r\n\"That-- that is never going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had Chris spoken the words than the light around him reappeared. He felt a flush again, a smaller version of before, and he felt himself get ever so slightly heavier -- 5 lbs, about. Not a huge amount, but enough to push his jeans beyond their limits and drop them to the floor. Chris, now standing there in a tshirt riding up a belly and underwear strained at every elastic seam, glared at Wyatt. Wyatt just laughed, and said \"I'm hungry. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris said no, but the moment he did, his stomach growled and he felt starving. He was going to have to learn to keep his mouth shut if he wanted to make it through this. He followed Wyatt to the kitchen, which looked very different. The kitchen Chris had left had been half potion ingredients, half gourmet ingredients and cooking tools.

He was the single most powerful witch ever, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and decided to do something else to fill his free time. Wandering down, he saw Chris in the living room and plopped down on the couch next to him. The 16-year-old was about 6 inches shorter, but the same weight as Wyatt. This left a little padding, and when he wore his tighter t-shirts, it showed a little paunch.

I thought I would try a spell to get some relaxation time.\"<br>\r\n\"That is like, complete personal gain. What about the backfire?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll reverse it if that happens. It was just an experiment. So... what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n\"My homework for one.\"<br>\r\n\"But I'm booored. And it's Saturday and you can do it tomorrow.\"<br>\r\nChris stopped.

It always made his brother jealous, so he made sure to make it heavily stocked with Chris's favorite snack foods. There were chips and dip, crackers and cheese, and enormous amounts of soda. As soon as it appeared, however, the glow that had passed over them before returned and they were filled with a ravenous hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris dove in first but was only a moment before Wyatt. They ate at superhuman speed, devouring family size bags of chips and pretzels in seconds. It took only minutes before the whole island was covered only in empty wrappers and 2 liter bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys suddently came to their senses. And looked down at each other. It looked odd, and obviously magical, that they suddenly had large and round bellies hanging from their front. They were hard, inflated and barely sagged at all. They were also heavy and unwieldy, and the boys had a difficult time navigating into the living room to sit down, where they quickly fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they awoke, things had changed. The bellies were gone, but it seemed as though every ounce of the food they'd consumed was now an ounce of fat, and they had eaten nearly 20 lbs of food a piece. Chris's shirt now betrayed the beginnings of a real belly, was exceptionally tight at the sleeves. He shifted uncomfortably in his pants, now also mercilessly tight. Wyatt seemed to be less affected, but only perhaps because he had more catching up to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was the first to speak. \"This is your fault, you know. Your spell, your personal gain and your backfire that just had to involve me.\"<br>\r\n\"Come on, Chris. It was your spell last week, and we both got out of it.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you yelled at me then. Plus I have a date tonight and I am not missing it.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n\"Just get to work on the reversal spell.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I would, it's just...</span></div></div>",

He rushes to the Book of Shadows and flips madly looking for a spell that might help. He flips past cadres of demons and summoning spells, and keeps turning, but suddenly the pages start turning on their own. Chris has seen this happen enough to know what to do -- he steps back and waits until the wind settles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it does, the spell awaiting him is one he doesn't remember seeing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sibling's spell for personal gain<br>\r\nWill really only end in pain<br>\r\nAs family though, our burden's shared<br>\r\nEven though judgment's been impaired<br>\r\nRelease him from his foolish deed<br>\r\nBefore he forgets the Wiccan creed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt makes sense to Chris that generations before would have a sibling spell reversal. He doesn't notice the male pronouns in the spell until too late. He and Wyatt are the first boy witches in the Halliwell line. Which means Wyatt must have written the spell, meaning it's probably a trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris finishes the last syllable just as he comes to this realization, but it's too late. The usual lights came up through the attic floor and encircled him. When they dissipated, he could suddenly smell all the food two floors below, and it called to him so urgently he orbed there. The piles of food were already half demolished, and Wyatt is sleeping on the couch in the sitting room. This time the food isn't snacks -- there are burgers and fries, lasagna and pizzas -- whole meals are wafting delicious smells throughout the room, as good as if they'd been prepared by Piper herself. But it doesn't matter to Chris, or his appetite. He eats twice as fast, and twice as much, his belly growing to the size and tightness of a fully inflated beach ball before collapsing onto the couch again, passed out.</span></div></div>",
