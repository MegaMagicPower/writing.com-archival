I've heard so much about you!\" Alice looked at him curiously as she sat down in the booth. \"Good things, I hope!\" She said jokingly. Ryan smiled and handed her a menu. As they peered down at their food selection Ryan noticed that Alice began to cought fiercely. He peered upwards without moving his head and noticed blood trickling down her lip. \"Are you ok?\" He asked her in an alarmed tone. \"Here, let me get you a...\" He was cut off before he could finish. \"NO! I mean....I'm fine.\" She smiled and wiped her lip off with a napkin. Ryan was somewhat frightened by what he had seen. Why was this girl bleeding for no reason? Disease, sickness....vampire? He thought for a second, and then blew off the notion as if it was pure insanity and continued to scan the menu for a suitable and nutritional dish. The waiter arrived shortly after and began to take their orders. \"I'll take the blackened chicken.\" Ryan said confidently.

But before we start I need to ask you something.\" She listens to you, intent to hear you out no matter what you want. \"Once I become the Seed King, do I get to choose a Queen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeleste smiles at you. \"Jess has you all hot and bothered, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I meant you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes go wide and her mouth drops. Somehow she didn't expect this, despite the way you've been staring into her eyes. \"Really? You want me... as your Queen?\" You nod at her and she pulls you closer and kisses you with more passion than you've ever felt in a kiss. You kiss her back, thrusting your tounge into her mouth as she thrusts hers into your mouth. You find the sharp teeth somewhat erotic, but you focus on her tounge writhing around with yours. You hear around a couple hundred female voices all go \"Aaaaaww!\" at the same exact time, all of the Aluranes around you finding this to be sweet and romantic. The two of you break the kiss as she shreds the vines that had been acting as your clothing and you follow suit with her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you begin to make out again and you begin massaging her breasts. They are so beautiful and you love the feel of them in your hands. Celeste thrusts her chest further out to you and moans, grabbing your cock and moving it up to her pussy. It is literally dripping with her natural lubricant and you can feel it seeping out onto your cock. She quickly lines your cock up with her pussy and you thrust forward, impaling her onto your cock. You kiss deeply again and moan into her mouth. Her pussy is so tight that you feel like you are fucking a vice. You begin thrusting slowly at first, letting the two of you enjoy this feeling. You are eight inches long and thicker than average, so you want to make sure that she would stretch out enough to enjoy it. You have a feeling that she is naturally this tight, and you absolutely love it. You thrust back and forth inside of her faster now, making her gasp and whimper slightly. From the look on her face you can tell she was loving this, and you realized that making her cum may not be too difficult if you can keep her this aroused. You break off the ciss and begin lightly biting her green neck, giving her a hickie. You remember a previous girlfriend telling you that the earloges were sensitive and you kiss your way up to her earlobe and nibble on it, getting a lusty moan from her. You take this moment to thrust harder and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you have been going at each other for a long time, and you can't quite remember how long ago you two started. You try to delay your orgasm that's building up inside of you. 'She needs to cum, not me,' you say to yourself. Celeste moans and looks at you, her face full of love and lust. \"I'm gonna cum, Ryan! I'm gonna cum so hard! You close?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So close, Celeste! Your body's driving me crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's cum together, Stud!\" The two of you are oblivious to the fact that every Alurane around you is getting herself off to this. They recognize that this is more than just your coronation as Seed King, it's also the wedding for you and Celeste. They are all able to feel the love and passion that you and Celeste, as soul mates, share. Celeste is very vocal about her impending orgasm, and you are just as loud. Finally Celeste cums, her pussy clamping down on your cock and she starts cumming, which pushes you over the edge. You thrust as deep as you can before cumming inside her, painting her white inside. \"RYAN, MY KING!\" \"CELESTE, MY QUEEN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, every Alurane watching you two came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you slump down on the grass, loving the feel of it after your fun. You look around at the faces of the sexually pleased Aluranes and remember seeing them all pleasing themselves. You look at Celeste, who has sweat coating her body. She still looks so beautiful that you find yourself staying hard rather than getting soft. She notices and chuckles to herself. \"Ready for round two, Love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the two of you tire yourselves out after going three more rounds. You follow Celeste as she leads you by your hand to a very large and beautiful flower, which opens up when you approach. The two of you are still naked as Celeste climbs in the flower and you follow her. She curls up inside of it and you do the same, draping yor arms around her. She turns around to face you. \"Ryan, this is my home, one of the Great Flowers. It will turn you into an Alurane like me, and your coronation will be officially complete. Get some rest and we can explore our kingdom <u>and</u> our sister Aluranes in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at Celeste. \"I will. I love you, Celeste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles right back. \"I love you too, Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>................................</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are dreaming of Celeste, and she is very pregnant. The two of you are running around through a grassy plain, and you are chasing her around, the two of you laughing. You finally catch her and you lift her into the air, kissing her cheek. You put her down and she gets down on her knees and grabs yor cock. She begins to lick at it and then sucks on the head. It feels wonderful and you look her in the eyes as she does it. She begins to deepthroat you and you swear you are in heaven. Soon you feel like you are going to cum, and in that moment you wake up before closing your eyes again while you cum into a woman's mouth and on her face. When you finally stop cumming you see...</span></div></div>",

I had a dream about Celeste and I.\" \"What about me,\" a voice beside you asks, and Jess gets up to go over next to Celeste, wiping your cum from her face and into her mouth.<br>\r\nYou smile at Celeste's beautiful face and kiss her passionately. The two of you break apart and you tell her about the dream. \"We were walking through a field and having fun. You looked about 4 months pregnant.\" Celeste giggles slightly. \"That may happen, my King. As aluranes we usually have to enchant plants to create new aluranes. But there was a seed king before you who impregnated a few aluranes. That's how Jess and I were born. Supposedly only a seed king can impregnate an alurane naturally after he's coronated and become a male alurane himself, like you have.\"<br>\r\nYou look down and notice that your skin is now a light green and that you seem to have more muscles. Your cock also appears to be bigger, now about ten inches long and very thick. Taking your eyes away from your body you look at Celeste's curvy figure. You are still hard from Jess's blowjob and you look up to Celeste's face. \"What happened to the other Seed King?\" Celeste's beautiful face saddens for a moment and you feel bad for asking. \"He was corrupted by his hunger. We want to take our land back, reforest the Earth, you know?\" You nod, not wanting to interrupt. \"But he wanted to kill humans for what they did to the planet. I mean, yeah, aluranes eat humans on occasion, but we try to keep it to a minimum, you know? Eat cattle for the most part, a few birds, maybe a monkey once in a while, but we try to limit our appetite for humans to the really bad ones. People who hurt others, like rapists and murderers. People who are evil are our food of choice. In fact, if an alurane is caught eating a good human and she isn't starving, she is punished severely. So we had to get him to leave. But, let's not dwell on the negative. Jess already got your seed, so now it's my turn!\"<br>\r\nCeleste rolls on top of you and slides down your body. She envelops your rock hard member into her mouth and hums, the sensation going through your manhood and feeling very good. She manages to deepthroat you and you throw your head back. She is way too good at this! She bobs her head up and down and uses her right hand to jerk you while she sucks on the head of your cock. Her left hand is massaging your balls. You look down at her and watch in awe as she takes all of you in her mouth, your cock in her throat. She hums again and winks at you. That was the thing that sent you over the edge as you cum directly into her stomach. She doesn't seem to need to breath, and she keeps you in her throat untill you finally stop. She pulls her mouth off your dick and crawls up next to you. You pull her to you and kiss her passionately again, tasting yourself in her mouth but not caring.</span></div></div>",

You closed your eyes so it wouldn't sting as she blew that stuff on you but when you inhaled you felt a very large desire welling up inside you. As you opened your eyes you saw Ivy like you never did before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hair was brighter, her eyes shined like emeralds, but what seemed to draw you in were her lips. You watched the old cartoon wondering what it was like to be kissed by her, now you wanted to know for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw now that's much better. So want to have a taste of whats to come? Want...a kiss?\", Ivy asked knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lost all the resistance you had to try and fight it anymore. Because the moment you felt how good it feels to be kissed by her along with her lust filled pheromones in your system it's impossible to stop yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cupped her hands on your head drawing you in, her mouth opening for a french kiss, and your moths joining. The rush of euphoria was indescribable. Her lips tasted like the sweetest fruit grown from a tree and her tongue tasted like lime. Your body was reacting to her irresistible mating charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the vines began to unravel your body allowing you to grasp at her figure doing whatever made it better for you.

Meeow!\" Ryan raised an eyebrow at this odd behavior. \"There's a rave in another hour or two. You wanna join?\" She asked enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.... sure. I guess.\" Ryan responded feebly. Truth be told, he didn't even know what a rave was. They ordered their food, and Michelle chowed down, making a few people stare as she gobbled down many different dishes. \"You really have quite the appitite.\" Ryan raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, yup!\" Michelle piped up, giving a tiny burp. \"'scuse me.\" She added. Ryan decided to pay credit, as there was no possible way he could pay for all the food Michelle had with cash from his wallet. \"Sorry about that.\" She said awkwardly as the two walked through town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no big deal.\" said Ryan simply. \"So, uh, where exactly are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna make a quick stop at the park.\" said Michelle. \"there's something I wanna show you.\" It was getting to be really dark, so the park was totally abandoned when they got there. Michelle looked left and right, making sure it was just the two of them, and said, \"Alright. Take a look at this.\" And her slim, slender body was coated with a fine layer of fur, her ears dissapearing, cat-like ones protruding from the top of her head, the pupils in her brown eyes becoming thin slits, and a cat tail swished behind her. Her shirt seemed a little tighter as she became a bit more muscular and her breasts grew slightly. Her transformation complete, she gave a loud, panther-like shriek at the full moon, making Ryan very uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! What the hell are you??!\" He flipped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a werecat. Pretty sweet huh?\" Michelle smiled. \"this is why they call me the night panther.\" She curled her hand in a paw-like shape, and said in a sexy tone \"Meeow.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Michelle then spoke again with, \"I am actually in my heat phase.\" Ryan knew what she meant by that because he read a few books about taking care of animals which mentioned that to him. Michelle was joking about the part where she would eat him but she wouldn't let him know until after the insemination.

Are you worried that my parents will be mad for going out with a girl?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"Just promise me, because I'm about to tell you something that might change your life.\" Jacky said.<br>\r\n\"Okay I promise I won't tell anyone about what I see or hear tonight.

I mean w-werewolves don't exist. They're only in movies.\"<br>\r\n\"No I'm not joking Ryan. I really am a werewolf. I transform at night into a wolfish version of myself. I keep my mind and soul, but my body changes. I do have bloodlust when I transform, but I've been able to restrain myself with years of experience. But I change back during the day looking like what I am right now.\" Jacky explained.<br>\r\n\"I...I don't believe you!\" you said. Your fear of werewolves must have gotten out and she heard about it. Maybe that's why she's joking with you.<br>\r\n\"I'm telling the truth. You can even wait until the sun sets in about 20 minutes and see for yourself. But I have to warn you that we must be at my house when it happens.\" Jacky said beginning to drag you along.<br>\r\n\"This has to be a joke. There's no way werewolves exist. Please stop joking around.\" you said in a shaky voice. You two eventually reach a house that covered up by some oak trees, obscuring the view of the whole property from the neighboring houses and possibly making it extremely difficult to see what happens from the street.<br>\r\n\"Here is where I live Ryan.\" she said. You look at the house. It was a common looking house, that looked exactly like the others. It didn't look like it had a werewolf living in it. Besides the position of the trees, the house didn't look didn't look so suspicious.<br>\r\n\"Nice place, but why are the trees covering the view of the house?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Because when I turn into a werewolf, I don't want people to see. I really don't want the humans to come for me.\"<br>\r\nYou look at the sky. There's about 5 minutes of daylight left. \"She'll probably say something like 'Fooled you! I can't believe you actually fell for that!'\" you thought.<br>\r\n\"Look Ryan, if you don't want to see it, you're free to leave.\"<br>\r\n\"No way. I still think you're bullshitting me.\"<br>\r\nShe sighs,\"You'll see soon enough.\"<br>\r\nThe sun is sinking and you decide to walk over to her and grab her hand.<br>\r\n\"The sunset sure is beautiful.\" you said. Jacky doesn't say a word and has a worried look.\"Don't look so worried. I'm sure your folks will understand.\"<br>\r\n\"Ryan I...rrrugh!\" Jacky falls to the ground and looks like she's having a seizure.<br>\r\n\"Jacky! Are you okay?!\" you jump back as you see one of her arms pump up with muscle that wasn't there before. Then the other arm. Then her legs thicken with more muscle. You watch in terror as you see the girl that was just dating you go from being human to something you have been terrified of all your life. Her body begins to grow fur that shouldn't be there. You catch a glimpse of her eyes and they definitely aren't human as they look like a wolf's. She still has a human-like body surprisingly, and her hands still look human, but you know right away that what you just saw is what you have feared and you realize now that werewolves do exist. But yet... she's different from what you imagined werewolves to be. She seems to have finished changing and starts to stand up. You just stand there, too terrified to move yet. She stands upright and she's about a head taller than what she was earlier, making her the same height as you. Then she turns to you and says,\" Now you see the secret that my family has kept for centuries.\" she said, surprisingly having the same kind and sweet voice from before. <br>\r\n\"Uh... um....\" you shakily stutter. <br>\r\nLooking confused, she asked,\"Do I scare you Ryan? I wouldn't be surprised if I do.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh........ I-I-I a-am scared. B-but not b-because of y-you.\" you finally manage to say stuttering.<br>\r\n\"I don't understand Ryan. If you're not scared of me, then what are you scared of?\" Jacky asked with the confused expression she still had on her face.<br>\r\nYou finally get the courage to walk to her and grab her hand.\"I'm not scared of you. I'm scared because I've lived in fear of werewolves all my life.\"<br>\r\nJacky hearing those words tears up and begins to pull away from you.\"I...I'm sorry Ryan.\"<br>\r\nYou hold on tighter to her and she stops trying to pull away. \"But... you're different. I... I think I can get over my fear of them by being with you. I... I want to stay with you Jacky. Please don't go.\" you said.<br>\r\nShe suddenly breaks down and starts to cry. It's strange to see a werewolf cry, but you still have the courage to put your arms around her and hug her close to you.<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you Ryan for accepting me as I am. I've never been so happy in my life.\" she says as she looks at you.<br>\r\n\"Shh... it's okay. I'm still scared but I think I can get used to you as a wolf-girl.\"<br>\r\nShe laughs,\"Don't I look ugly to you in this form?\"<br>\r\nYou shake your head. \"You're beautiful, no matter what you look like.\"<br>\r\nShe tears up again and says,\" Thank you Ryan. That's the nicest thing anyone has said to me.\"<br>\r\nThe two of you embrace for a long time.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without any warning, a girl made of a dark slime black as night walked through the doors of the restaurant. She was a short and clearly a girl but what was she? Was this some kind of monster girl? The news has been talking about them saying something about coming out of hiding or something. You wished you paid more attention to the girl because she was coming over to your table. Before you even noticed her again she was sitting down and reading from the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Ryan?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You must be my date.\" You said your eyes fixed on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm Sara. Nice to meet you buddy.\" She said as she held out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached out to grab it but as soon as you did her hand started to grow around your fingers and palm. You pulled back and Sara jumped from your sudden retreat from a hand shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. When I get hungry I start to absorb everything I touch. I lost a few boy friends that way you know.\" She smiled as if it was just normal for her to talk about her ex-boyfriends and more importantly how they relationship ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You absorbed them? So you killed them?\" You said sounding nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your joking right?\" Sara said looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Sara started to laugh at you. she was starting to get loud and other people looked over to see what was going on. Even the waiter stayed away from the table while she laughed almost randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was joking! You need to loosen up Ryan.\" She said as settled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, a Slime with a over the top sense of humor. The next time you see your friends you're going to punch them right in the mouth. You wanted to leave right then and end the date, but you couldn't do that to this girl. despite being a bit annoying you didn't want to be rude to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me about your self?\" You asked still waiting for the waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much to tell. I'm a dark element. My entire body is made of dark slime. I like video games and going to the movies. I love comedies and stuff like that. I live alone so feel free to come over anytime so we can make out and stuff.\" Sara said as she continued looking at the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. I like games and movies too. you see that new movie with Jack Black?\" you said getting into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one with the Monkey?\" She said looking back at you just as the waiter arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love that movie.\" You said. Sara might be tomboyish but she can be really fun. Her clothes look good too now that you think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you two be ordering now?\" The waiter asked ready to write down the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have 5 pizzas all large and pepperoni.\" Sara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for you?\" You and the waiter both said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. What about you Ryan?\" Sara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take two slices of meat lovers please.\" You said as you looked at the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. I'll have it out in no time. The 5 pizzas may take some time.\" The waiter said as he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe date went well. Far better than you thought. Sara was very kind and despite her tomboy looks she was very cute. Plus she was easy, she asked you maybe twice while waiting for dinner if you wanted to go to her car and fell her up. Maybe you won't have to punch your friends after all. The waiter came back with you slices and the first of Sara's pizzas. She didn't even take it out of the box. She reached out and her hand wrapped around the box. Soon the entire thing was covered in slime and you could see the box inside under a thin layer of slime. It started to move up her arm and it went into her body where it disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. It's just how I eat.\" She said as you put down your last slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want mine? I'm full.\" You said not wanting to say that she freaked you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate your slice and the other 4 pizzas when they came. Other than her weird eating habits she was a really nice girl. Maybe this can work. It was starting to get late and you had to head home soon. You sat up and Sara did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun. I have to get home in a little more than an hour but I don't want to be late.\" You said as you started to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Want to hang out in my car for a bit before you go?\" Sara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why in your car?\" You asked not knowing what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we have sex or something.\" She said like it was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I mean, this is our first date and I don't want to move fast with you yet.\" You said looking at Sara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we make out or feel each other up?\" Sara said really wanting to get it on with you.....</span></div></div>",

Lets go out to my car.\" Sara said as she took your hand and left the restaurant with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked you out to her car which was not a car at all. It was a van that was white with no windows in the back at all. I looked clean and the front of the van looked very neat from the side window. Sara took you to the back and opened up the back doors. the back was a total mess. On the floor was as bed that was not well made and a bag full of clothes and other things like a cell phone. You started to wonder if Sara was living in her Van or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you live here?\" You asked wanting to know what was going on with Sara's living space or even if she had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for now. I need to find a better place soon. But lets not talk about that now. We have work to do.\" Sara said a she climbed into the back of the van and you climbed in after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to undress and you noticed that she was shadow slime from her head to her feet. One thing you didn't understand about her was her eyes. the rest of her body was black as night but her eyes were bright pink. You had little time to think about this as she removed her shirt and bra. She even took of her pants but left her underwear on. Sara really was a cute girl and a sex fiend at that. You took your slightly shaky hands and reached up for her naked breast. You took hold and noticed her slime was slippery but warm and felt good on your hands. You were so busy felling her up you didn't even notice that her slime was starting to go up your hands and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your slime is so warm and smooth.\" You said not noticing the slime almost up your arms to your shoulders. Your eyes were closed but soon you would wish you watch her more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you were pulled in by her slime and your head was pulled into her chest. Sara was to busy being in some kind of sexual trance to even see you that you are in trouble. Her slime made quick work of your torso and your legs were that last part of you still outside the element girl. But that changed fast as the last of your legs were forced in and a large lump was made in Sara's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness that was good. ready for round two?\" She asked as she looked over to see you were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then did she noticed her massive gut and figure out she 'ate' her latest boy friend. She put her hand on her massive gut with a slightly sad and annoyed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, not again.\" She said as she laid down to take a nap.....</span></div></div>",

But even with you being some kind of snack for your girl friend it was nice inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sara! Are you awake?\" You shouted so she could hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" She said like she was still half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come out?\" You asked talking into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.

Just hold on.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then your world started to move as you were twisted around and soon forced out of Sara.

Speak of then Devil, Just as you though about the shadow element she jumped out from behind you and half absorbed your head. Lucky Jack and Becky were there to save you.

Her hair was black and long, almost to her waist. Her chest was massive, almost falling out from her tight shirt that had a cute cat on it. She was wearing a sexy skirt that was cute like her shirt and matched it like an outfit. Her legs were... She didn't have legs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of legs she had a long tail like that of some kind of snake. Your forget what one but her tail was red, black, and yellow with white strips over it. You might not have known the snake but you remembered the rime. <i>Red touches black friend to Jack, Red touches yellow, kill a fellow.</i> Lucky for you she was Red touches black. You were so fixed on her tail you didn't see that she came over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Ryan?\" She asked in a voice that sounded playful yet cute and childish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" You asked as you looked up into her deep red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Lily. I think I'm your date?\" She asked looking at you as she sat down across from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ndespite her freaky tail, she was really very cute. Her massive breast and great figure. She was thin with cute face and a small fang sticking out her mouth like you see in some animes. She was kind and very sweet and there was just something about her that made you want to hang out with her more. You decided to order a pizza for the table and started to talk with Lily and learn more about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is nice to meet you Lily. Sorry if this sounds rude but why do you have a snake tail?\" You asked trying your best not to sound rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Alright. Everyone asks me that. I am a Lamia. I have the upper body of a human and the lower body of a Milk snake.\" She said pointing out her tail as if you didn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a milk snake. They are cool.\" You said remember int the rime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you said made Lily blush and when you saw that you smiled at her a little red yourself. Just then the pizza arrived and the two of you started to eat. You took a slice and after a bite you watched to see if your date liked the dinner you got her. To your surprise, she grabbed the pizza and rolled it up then opened her mouth wide and swallowed it down. You watched at a lump in her throat moved down and disappeared behind her massive chest. The lump showed up again in her stomach as the pizza feel into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*burp* Sorry. Did you want more? I can get us another one.\" She said  sounding unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, It's OK. I don't eat much.\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lost you appetite after that anyway. After you ate your only slice, the two of you talked and found out you have a lot in common. You both like games and you both love pizza (She liked it far more than you.) She even liked nerdy things just like you. The date went well and you both had a lot of fun. She was awesome and as of the end of the date, your new girl friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fun meeting you Lily. Maybe we can hang out again some time. Here is my number.\" You said handing her some paper with your number on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ryan. Does this mean we are dating?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a kiss on her check and her face went red with joy. She hugged you than ran, or more slithered away into the night. You got you car and drove to your home ready for a nap. It was late but not to late. Your sister was sleeping and you were home before you need to so you wouldn't get in trouble. You changed into some shorts you sleep in and climbed into bed. You dreamed about Lily that night.....</span></div></div>",

As you sat up you looked over at the desk next to your bed, you saw that someone had called you last night. It must have been right after you feel asleep. You picked it up and opened it to find that Lily left a message for you. Right away you played the massage wanting to hear what Lily wanted to talk about so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi Ryan. I had a lot of fun at dinner. Sorry I ate all the pizza again. I was wondering if you wanted to hang out at the Mall tomorrow? We can hang out anytime you want really. Just call me back. You must be sleeping now so good night.\" Lily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but smile thinking of last night. Who wouldn't want to go out with her again... Well maybe a lot because of her tail, but not You. You didn't want to stop dating her when you both had so much in common. You jumped out of your bed and got dressed for the day ready to call Lily when you wanted to hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran to the dinning room only to find your sister eating breakfast and your mom clean up after her. Your sister Beth was a normal 13 year old. She hates her parents and picks on you. If you did anything you would get in trouble so you just let her be. At 13 years old she is cute and dates boys more than you date girls. She was always better at that than you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Ray.\" Beth said in a rude way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said call me Ryan.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said call me Ryan.\" She repeated you like most kids do when they can't think of a good insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ate some cereal and Beth did her best to copy that only to realize she was out of cereal already and left the house to play with her friends all of which are just as rude. Man you hate kids her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can I go to the Mall later? I have a date and...\" But before you said anything else your Mom cut you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A date? With who? Do I know her? Is she cute? It is a girl right?\" She said like she always does. She thinks she is playing and having fun with her kids but she is just being embarrassing. It was still better than Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Lily. She is about my age and cute. You don't know her.\" You said leaving out the half snake thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. just clean your room first.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your breakfast and ran up to your room to clean it up as best you could. Then you called Lily to talk to her about hanging out at the Mall. She answered right away as if she was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Ryan! How is my bf doing?\" She asked in a cute way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good. I was just wondering if you wanted to go to the mall later? I can pick you up when ever.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good now. Let me tell you where I live.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrote down the directions to her house and left to pick her up. You drove for a good ten or twenty minutes and found that Lily lived in a larger house almost a mansion. Lily ran out... or more slithered over to your car. She opened the door and climbed in, it took a while with her long tail but she managed to fit it all into the car and most of the back seats with her upper body upfront with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Lily... How long is your tail?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 35 feet. Now lets go to the Mall. Maybe I can by lunch this time.\" She smiled as she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back and drove off to the Mall. After another twenty minutes you both got to the Mall. It was only now you realized that other people will see her. You did see a few people stare at her last night. You stared at her too the first time you saw her. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.....</span></div></div>",

You hope it will stay that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do you want to go Lily?\" You asked as you took her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. I'm just happy to be with you.\" She smiled as she squeezed your hand back gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you started to walk through the store and ended up going to a store that sells video games, comics, anime, and all things nerdy. The last few girls you dated wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this but Lily was better than the last few. She seemed to only do what you wanted and never fought. But she also had a great personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See anything you like?\" Lily asked as you looked trough the comics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. How about you?\" You said looking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have all of this stuff already so I don't need to buy anymore.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" You asked standing up after you got done looking at the comics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I buy a lot of my stuff online and I have a huge collection of Anime and Manga so I don't need to by any here. Maybe you could come over and watch it?\" She asked as if she wanted some alone time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have never been with a lamia girl before and already she wanted you in her house. But you had to be more sure of what she wanted. She could just be asking to hang out later. You had an old trick ready to see where this was going, and it always worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. What will your parents think if you have a boy over?\" You asked waiting for her to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily leaned in next to your ear and whispered. \"I live alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess I'll see you tonight.\" You smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you left after you bought one comic and Lily didn't buy a thing.

Lily ate all tree of her pizzas just before you got done with your taco. You didn't mind her eating this time because you knew it was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was good.\" Lily smiled as she rubbed her stomach now swollen with Pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I think we should go now. I have to get home and tell my mom how my date went.\" You said getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Can you drop me off at my house? I have to get things ready for tonight.\" She winked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and the two of you left the Mall and you drove Lily back to her house. She climbed out and after getting her tail out, she leaned in and gave you a kiss on you cheek. You looked over at her and watched her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More where that came from if you come over tonight.\" She smiled and left for her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her go inside then you left. You drove back to your home thinking of what you would tell your mom. You weren't going to tell her you were going over to you girl friends house tonight for anime and sex. You haven't even told her she was a Lamia. You thought of a good lie that would work and just in time. You arrived home and Beth was in the yard with her friends. She was trying to be rude but you didn't mind. You were to busy thinking of Lily and tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom I'm home.\"You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your date honey? She asked as she walked into he room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. I meet some of my friends there and we decided to hang out tonight and watch Anime.\" You said as you took off you shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that is fine. Will you be staying the night?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. We plan to watch anime all night. So don't wait up for me.\" You said as you finished your little lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom bought the lie and said it was OK. You planned to leave after dinner and head to Lily's house. Dinner was fine and your mom made spaghetti. You ate it and left ready to have some fun with Lily tonight. You drove fast and made it to Lily's house.

She was so cute how could you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Show the way.\" You smiled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily took your now sweaty hand and lead you inside. her home was nice and she had a lot of cool things in her house. A eighty inched flat screen TV took up a good chunk of her living room and stairs lead to the upper floor of the house. some stairs were going down to what must have been the basement but you weren't going that way. The up stairs was a long hall with many doors on either side. Lily brought you to a door near the end of the hall and opened it. She must sleep in the Master bedroom because it was massive! A bed and giant TV in the room along with shelves covered with games, anime, and comic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Lily! this is some ro.....\" But before you even said room, Lily tackled you onto her bed and was kissing you all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips meet yours and the tongues soon joined in. Lily started to remove her shirt, it was the same one she was wearing on you date earlier. She had on a skirt also but she kept that on, at least for now. You pulled off your shirt as well and throw in on the corner of Lily's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Lily.....\" You said pushing her off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Ryan? am I moving to fast, we can stop if you want.\" She said starting to get nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was one this you always liked about Lily. She was always polite. even when she was trying to sleep with you she only wanted to please you. Even her nervous face was cute. But was it really a good Idea to sleep with her? you brought a condom but.... You've never done it with a Lamia before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Lily, but.... I've never done it with a Lamia before.\" You said sounding more nervous than the adorable girl before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm I your first... Lamia I mean?\" She asked her face turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just that. I mean, are we moving to fast? I really like you and I don't want to ruin what we have.\" You said as your eyes moved from her bra covered chest to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a problem. Because..... I.....

Pushing you on the her body pressed on you and her breast resting on your chest. You wrapped your arms around her and her tail did the same with your legs. things were getting hot fast and the two of you stopped kissing only to remove the last of your clothes. You were smart enough to bring a condom for tonight. You didn't want anything to go wrong with Lily and being safe never hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Lily asked sound both nervous and eager for you to take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. Lets get started.\" You said also nervous. After all this was your first time doing it with a snake women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and her started to kiss just like last time only this time naked flesh pressed together. Her skin was cold for some reason but it felt good. Like a new sensation you never felt before. Your member grow hard and her nipples got hard. You got on top of Lily and began to hump her. As the sex continued Lily seemed to like it more when you used her body. You knew Lily was always willing to do what you wanted but she didn't even as for anything. Even your last girl friends wanted something for them when you had sex. No way Lily was this generous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rammed you rock hard member into the hungry pussy that Lily offered to you. It felt weird at first, but a good weird. Your bodies meet and your hands almost refused to leave her breast alone. she moaned loudly as you made her come and you did the same. her tail wrapped around you and forced you to hump her faster and faster as she almost started to want you to control her during the sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this ended quickly. After ten minutes or so Lily rolled over pinning you under her. Her breast bounced as she humped you and forced your member in and out out her. This was the best sex you have ever had and Lily was clearly liking it too. Her tail wrapped more around you and started to squeeze harder. Her body started to get warm from the sex and the flesh from her pussy pulsed around you member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost twenty minutes of sex, you both came for the last time and Lily passed out from the constant orgasms. She fell on top of you and you were having a hard time breathing. You manged to move around a little and got to breath but you knew you couldn't move Lily. You feel a sleep right there, under your first Lamia.....</span></div></div>",

You head must have been behind her chest or something but this again changed fast as she swallowed once again. Outside things looked far different. Lily had her boy friend inside her mouth eating him alive. She was taking very little time to enjoy her meal as she seemed to be in a hurry. She swallowed again and again until only your legs were sticking out of her mouth. Another few gulps and You were sent down into Lily's stomach.

The sound of her heart and insides made you feel safe too. It was weird you it was nice. But then again it was a little weird.

What would scare people is that she has three horns, two curved horns on the sides of her head, the third jutting out slightly above her eyes, but too close as to puncture somebody on their forehead. With a killer figure and sea-green eyes, she is surprisingly timid, although she HAS been seen stealing food from the local city. Alice also wields a large kanab\u014d, the size of it makes it almost big as her, but due to her tremendous strength, she can wield it as if it was a normal bat.

Sadly, this new ownership was strictly legal. In this bright blue futuristic world, humans are 2nd class citizens worldwide. After the human race lost the War against the Demon army, the new leader of the 'free world' assured the surviving humans that they would be allowed to co-exist peacefully with the demons... provided they play the victors' rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'human=property' status was one of those rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's like you could just run away from new Oni owners. First of all, trying to run away from a demonic lush that wields a big club is suicidal. Second, you didnt have anywhere to go. Your mother died of a heart failure before you even graduated junior high, your dad hasnt returned from the war (and probably never will at this rate), and your sis and bro got sold to dragons and you havent seen them since. You had the house all to yourself until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice 'escorted' you back to your old house to clean out the major stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just clothes and a few odds and ends'll be enough,\" Alice told you as you searched your room.<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" you shrugged. You filled your backpack and a suitcase full of personal stuff and left your house for good. You took one last look at the good and sighed hard.<br>\r\n\"Get moving!\" Alice ordered you. Sure enough, you got plenty of stares by passerbys as you obediently followed your oni master.  It was humiliating enough that you had to dragged around by a big blue booze demon with a really big club who now owns you... but she even had you put on a dirty, sticky black collar around your neck that reeks of strong vodka filling your nostrils! Must be her own special way to mark you as her property! Then again, it's pretty mild compared to the ways most demons mark their property. You dont even wanna know what dragons do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, youre slow,\" you heard Alice mumble, \"I thought you creatures could go up to 70 miles an hour.\"<br>\r\n\"That's cheetahs,\" you correct her, \"humans run an average of 20 miles an hour.\"<br>\r\n\"Pst!!\" your oni master snickered at those numbers, \"no wonder you hairless monkeys lost the war!\" You gritted your teeth, but dared not say anything. As if things couldnt get any MORE humilating, a toad kid ran up to and shouted to his mother, \"MOMMY MOMMY! Can I have a hairless monkey too?!\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not, Kap!\" his mother dragged him away from you, \"those beasts are a lot more trouble than theyre worth! Remember what happened to your father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP STARING AND KEEP MOVING!\" oops! Alice got angry at you again!<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother long blistering walk later, you reached the not-so-abandoned apartment again. Alice knocked on the door and her big bad mama opened the door... with an impatient glare on her face and a drunken blush on her cheeks!<br>\r\n\"What took ya two so long?!\" Alice's mom questioned you before taking another swig of her bottle.<br>\r\n\"The gift you got me aint a fast walker,\" Alice answered for the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that better mean he's a hard worker,\" her mom quipped, \"you get all his crap?\"<br>\r\n\"It's all in here, ma'am,\" you took the backpack off and politely handed it to her. Mama Oni sneered at you, but snatched your backpack and started rummaging through it. There was no such thing as 'invasion of privacy' anymore. Sadly, this was typical for a demon owner. Gotta make sure your little slave doesnt bring something he shouldnt have! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... clothes... clothes... socks,\" she muttered as she chucked your stuffed around after examining it, \"...jacket? No fancy vintage name brand? Tsk, worthless.  Rings? ....Grr... MOOD rings!\" Those moodrings were all gray. The PERFECT color to describe your mood. \"potato chips... V8 cans... gawd, dont tell me we got a vegetarian in our-oh! Oreos! Class ring?\" She examined your old high school class ring, \"Hm. Real gold! Might be worth something. Socks. Family photos. Dvds? Aint got a dvd player. ...Oh!\" The oni mother's eyes widened as she turned her head to you and glared, \"a switchblade?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap! What possessed you bring THAT with you?! ...Oh right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a gift to me from my dad,\" you told her, \"an old family heirloom.\"<br>\r\nAlice's mom squinted her eyes at you... then broke the blade piece right off the switch portion! \"JUST in case!\" she tossed your broken switchblade and continued her rummage, \"A Nintendo DS?! Didnt they discontinue these things?! Does it still work?! I bet this'll sell for a ton of cash if we put it up for auction! What else ya got... eh, a few books. Ya got anything from Agatha Christie? Heard those sell well if you action 'em.\"<br>\r\nYou shook your head, \"Sorry ma'am, I dont.\"<br>\r\nShe grunted, \"Damn! Then that's everything. You can put the rest of your stuff in one of the drawers in Alice's bedroom.\" Oh and of course YOU have to pick everything up. It's not much of a life you have left, but youre forced to accept it. Anyone else would be more strong-willed and tried to fight, but not you. You knew your limits and your flaws. Better to live as an oni's property, then run away and end up getting torn to shreds or eaten by any of the demon rulers of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" you obeyed, \"Alice, which drawer can I put my stuff in?\"<br>\r\n\"I think the very bottom drawer on the pink dresser is empty,\" Alice answered, \"you can use that one.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didnt take much time to put everything that Alice's mom didnt confiscate away. But by this time, it was already late. It was about time you get to bed cuz you tomorrow's gonna be a BIG day. Alice's mom let her drink get the best of her and had already passed out on the couch. You dare not wake her. You'd rather just turn your attention to Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do I sleep?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youre sleeping...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being taller by an inch than most men(5'11)(Yes I actually looked it up.). She looks like a normal human(Save the fact her skin's light blue.) and with her trench-coat covering most of her body, save for her emerald eyes and brown hair, she gives off a similar presence people feel in the dark of night.<br>\r\nExcept for the fact that she's really caring, to the point of walking strangers back to their homes.

A monster lacks reason. To say that she kills is the freaking understatement of the century: She brutally murders those who commit crimes.

She also wears a cape, which allows her to glide to nearby buildings, like a flying squirrel. Finally, her cold voice sounds different from Mary's sweet medley.

This would be his first date in a while, and he was kinda rusty and he knew it. Just as he was about to have a full-blown panic attack, his date walked up to the table. Seemingly paradoxically, whenever a dreaded situation actually occurred, he calmed right down, like the adage about anticipation being worse than the event. His prospective date was wearing a trench coat, like she'd just stepped out of a 40s era detective movie. \"You must be Ryan,\" she says, holding out her hand. \"My name's Mary.\" \"Hi,\" Ryan says, taking the proferred hand. The other thing that struck him about Mary in that moment was the fact that her skin was a light blue in color. She saw him staring at her hand so she explained. \"I was born with it. No one really knows why I'm blue. I've been checked by doctors. Lots and lots of doctors.\" Ryan saw that it was a bit of a sore topic for her and quickly apologized. \"Don't worry, I'm used to it by now, and really shouldn't be surprised at the reaction it draws when people first see it.\" \"Well, now that I'm past the initial surprise, I think it's kinda cool,\" Ryan assures her. \"Really?\" \"Yeah, really. It's very exotic.\" Although Ryan tried, he couldn't help staring at her trench coat either, but given the fact that it covered most of her body, its reason for being worn was self-explanitory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also explained why their table was in the back, in a dimly lit corner. It would allow her to take her coat off hopefully without attracting too much unwanted attention. She removed it, revealing a pretty green dress that complimented her complexion nicely. Their waiter came and took their orders and didn't bat an eye. Apparently the shadows in the corner camouflaged her blue skin admirably. When their food came they were deep in conversation, finding they had many things in common. They both like cats, (Ryan was allergic to dogs but not cats, strangely enough.) They also had similar taste in movies, although, being a woman, Mary did like chick flicks. Just like him, she wanted kids, just not right now. Maybe in a couple of years. Before either of them knew it, their food is gone and paid for. \"I'm really glad I let my friend talk me into coming on this date,\" Mary said. \"I had a wonderful time.\" \"So did I,\" Ryan replies, as he takes a glance at his watch. Sundown in half an hour, he saw. Hopefully enough time for him to take Mary home and get home himself. She noticed the glance and asked, \"Is everything alright?\" \"Yes, I've just got this...condition.\" \"Condition?\" \"I, ah, I'm...scared of the dark,\" he said in a rush. \"It's because when I was a kid, my siblings forced me to watch the bloodiest horror movies imaginable. It scarred me.\" At this revelation, Mary got an incredibly concerned look on her face. \"Then we should go before it gets any later. Actually, that works for me pretty well, since I don't really like being out after dark either.\" \"Why's that?\" \"Well, women tend to draw the freaks after dark, you know. Rapists, serial killers, basically the scum element of society.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Ran replied a little lamely. \"Well then, shall we go?\" he asks, taking her arm.</span></div></div>",

She laughed, guiding your steps twards a small indent in the buildings. She hugged you tightly into her boobs, which were a bit sweaty and just as odd smelling. Pushing her away she laughed.

That usually meant following her wherever she was assigned. The latest assignment was Fort Martin in Kyoto, Japan. You've been there three months, a length of time that would've been VERY unbearable.... if you hadn't met Elexa. It was hard not to notice her, she was a centaur after all.

She was clad only in a red, tight top, a black miniskirt and matching high heels, all of which accentuated her most attractive features, like her long, perfect legs or her sexily swaying hips... Most striking, however, were her huge tits, which were so big and full, that they were in a constant, majestic bouncing and swaying with every move she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow! I would definitely decide for her...</i>, you thought to yourself. And that surely was an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked... or rather <i>floated</i> closer, you breathlessly studied more and more details of her stunning attractiveness. And at the same time you realized, how all the other people around her, men and women alike, were equally falling under her spell. This girl literally radiated sexiness and beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a goddess...\", you muttered totally awestruck and content, though you clearly knew that girls like her were totally out of your league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then... she didn't pass by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead she had frontally approached your burger place and now stood face to face with you, separated only by the glass of the window. Your throat went completely dry, when her eyes directly met yours and she briefly lifted her slender hand to cheerfully wave at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were dumbstruck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually checked, whether some Mr. Perfect was sitting anywhere behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you turned at her again, she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you saw her again. She was moving to the entrance of the burger restaurant now. Actually, she was coming in. And as soon as the girl had entered the place, all the noisy chit-chatting fell silent and every single eye turned at her. Very obviously she wasn't shy at all this attention though. Rather she greeted back with a charming smile and then continued her way into the place... once again aiming for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! She was really coming for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing at her beautiful face and her stunning body again, you silently waited for her, hoping that you just wouldn't wake up from this wonderful dream... But you didn't. This heart-stopping girl floated right to you. Like in slow-motion you rose from your bank to greet her and offer your hand to her. But she just leaned into you, leaving you no other choice than catching her up into a deep embrace, which brought the both of you back down onto your bank. You felt the soft swells of her warm body... you smelled her breathtaking perfume... then you saw her beautiful face again... her sweet lips closing in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve Coburn,\" she softly hissed at you like a cat (or some other animal). \"You are mine now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with this she deeply kissed you. You couldn't believe it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, you would have really expected almost any girl from school to be your date... though most likely one of the more inconspicuous ones... maybe even Lizzie, the 17-year-old sister of your best friend Tom... or some weird chick from the internet (after all \"Jackody\" had made this whole thing up). - But where on earth did this absolute bombshell come from?</span></div></div>",

You still couldn't believe just how good she felt. Her sweet, luscious lips meeting yours. These tickling strands of her ravishing mane of black hair. Those massive expanses of her huge breasts pressing against your chest. Her warmth. Her fragrant perfume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like your understanding of... seizing the day\", you grinned at her, as soon as she was sitting next to you again. \"Just... where have you been all my life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that your first question, Steve?\", she grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... no... I mean...\", you stuttered. \"It's more like No. 35, I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your first question then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I don't know\", you blushed, feeling caught in the field of your poor flirting competences. \"Maybe something like... uhm... <i>Hi there! You look kind of cute tonight...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not a question, Steve\", your beautiful date giggled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I know...\", you stuttered along. \"But maybe... <i>May I buy you a drink?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not really a very creative 1st Question\", she teased you. \"Rather a No. 6 or 7, I'd say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... how about... <i>Sorry, do I know you from somewhere?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve\", she almost frowned at you. \"That's just lame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Did it hurt to fall from the sky?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Is your father a terrorist?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Are those real?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Outrageous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you just smiled at her. Even in her slightly agitated state, she looked incredibly beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\", you smirked. \"I am happy then, that you've kissed me without asking.\" And when she smiled back at you, you quickly added: \"Can we do that again please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, <i>that</i>'s finally a good question\", she grinned and very willingly came in for your bidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once again you felt like in heaven, as you got another taste of her sweet, hot lips and her voluptuous body. She even sat herself onto you, pressing her thigh against your member, which already was more than excited about her. Incredible! Everything about this radiant girl was just so sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... Now I remember some of my original questions\", you smiled at her, as she sat next to you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always at your service\", she returned with an amused licking of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, I need to know your name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Mia\", she warmly smiled at you. \"I already thought, you'd never ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let her name sink into you and connect its simple tone with the beautiful face and the stunning body in front of your eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's perfect\", you finally stated. \"Just as perfect as everything else about you, Mia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", she warmly smiled back at you. \"I am very happy, that you like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LIKE you?\" you almost broke out at this <i>understatement</i>. Though still knowing practically nothing about this girl yet, you'd already and completely fallen under her spell. But then you realized that you needed to keep cool, if you wanted to keep her. So you pulled yourself together and added with a smile: \"Let's say, I could imagine, that the two of us can really hit Question No. 1000.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Question No. 1000?\" Mia blinked at you. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first\", you smiled back at her and you rose from your bank. \"How about Question No. 6? Anything to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like a milk please!\" Mia grinned at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\" you replied to her and stepped to the bar, wondering whether you would really get a pure milk in a burger place like that. At least they had coffee...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were approaching the counter, you suddenly became aware how quite a lot of the people around were still stealing glances at Mia. Some of them were even positively staring at her. You followed their gazes and as you saw Mia sitting there in all her radiating beauty, you suddenly couldn't believe it anymore, that this hot girl really was your date. That you had actually kissed this incredible girl just a few moments ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then her eyes beamed back at you, she briefly lifted her slender hand and cheerfully waved at you... as she had done, when standing in front of the window earlier... Suddenly you felt so painfully lucky, that your eyes were filling with tears. After a very short (but very sweet) moment of letting those emotions flow over you, you very quickly brushed your tears away and turned to the counter to place your order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One diet coke and a glass of milk please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slender, red-haired girl behind the counter shyly confirmed you order. While you watched her prepare your drinks, you were suddenly confronted by a greasy, middle-aged man. \"If I'd liked milk, I'd ask your little girl-friend over there\", he wheezed at you with a very bad breath. \"That bitch should surely have enough of that, if treated right.\"</span></div></div>",

So you thanked the waitress, took your drinks and returned to your hot date, thereby completely ignoring that awkward guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milk makes you stronger!\" you stated smirking, as you placed Mia's glass in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, big boy\", she greeted you back, while you sat down next to her again. \"I've already missed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately you felt, how a new wave of almost painful happiness flushed over you at this sweet comment of hers. But this time you didn't allowed yourself to get too emotional again. Instead you replied with an approving smile: \"Well, allow me to prepone Question No. 36 then... <i>How have you been able to live without me all your earlier life?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe warmly laughed at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she countered: \"I guess, I didn't live at all. I just survived. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mia...\", you sighed at her. - This girl was just so incredible! Beautiful beyond human measures. Sexy like a porn star. Sharp witted and funny... And though you didn't understand why, she acted as if she really wanted to be with you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Just where on earth did \"Jackody\" find you??</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackody??!\", her warm smile suddenly froze down and she looked at you as if you had offended her or something. \"Are you kidding me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't know what to say. Hadn't \"Jackody\" organized your whole date? Or at least told you to be here at \"Five Guys\" at that particular time? - But if they hadn't found Mia... or at least hadn't told her about your date, who had done this instead? Had she been invited at all? Or had she maybe just come by herself? Was an accident like this ever imaginable? - You didn't know. You didn't understand. Was this whole perfect dream falling apart now? Finally revealing itself to be nothing else but a misunderstanding? Or a bad prank?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you... don't like Jack and Kody?\", you carefully tried to bring a bit more light into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\", Mia simply replied. \"They're assholes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't prevent a short chuckle at her categorical judgment about your chaotic friends. And you had to admit, that even in her frozen state she still looked incredibly sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Tom's birthday party these two idiots are actively stalking me\", Mia started to explain. \"Following me everywhere. Constantly getting on my nerves. Asking me out for a date like twice a day, although I've already told those suckers like for a hundred times to piss off and fuck each other...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mia realized, how you were staring at her, she immediately turned pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Steve...\", she giggled shyly. \"I didn't want to speak about them like this... After all, they're your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok\", you chuckled. \"They certainly can be bothersome at times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile your brain was processing all this new information and desperately trying to make sense of this. So if \"Jackody\" hadn't asked out Mia for your date, then maybe your best friend Tom had been engineering this whole plot? Or maybe his girl-friend Alison? But if Mia had even been to his birthday party, why couldn't you remember her from this occasion? She surely wasn't the type of girl to miss or to forget about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But speaking about Tom's birthday...\" you hesitantly resumed your investigation. \"How come we didn't meet at this party already?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... How come?!\", Mia retorted back at you with a playful allegation. \"That would have really saved me a lot of jackodian trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to grin at this. So maybe your chaotic friends after all had played their part in bringing you and Mia together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But as I recall Tom's sister telling me\", Mia concluded, \"you had to leave the party early and baby-sit your little sister Sarah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn true\", you suddenly remembered it all. \"And Tom had even planned for Sarah to sleep at his place with his little sister, but then she had felt sick and puked all over the place, so I had to take her home instead, and there she had continued to puke for like half of the night... Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... What a shame!\" Mia twinkled at you. \"So none of us had a real good time at that night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what would you think about some reparations then?\", you smiled at her, thereby approaching her for a new kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd think, we're definitely entitled to those reparations!\", Mia responded. And with this your lips finally found each other again. And having learned a bit more about the background of your sexy date, these kisses felt all the more real to you. It was only when your lips finally separated again, that the both of you became aware of someone standing just next to you...</span></div></div>",

But then Mia prevented you from doing so. With her sweetest smile she reached for her glass, took a short smell at it and cheerfully shouted out: \"Oh, wow! A snakebite! That's my favorite!\" And without any hesitation she leaned back (thereby thrusting out her immense breasts) and downed the drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the greasy guy seemed just a bit perplexed at this behavior of Mia. But when she then turned to you, asking whether she could have your snakebite as well, the greasy guy very obviously got real worried about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... w-w-wait!\" the guy stammered at Mia. \"You shouldn't drink more than one of those! This stuff is hot... and venomous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like me!\" Mia giggled at that and leaned her warm, sexy body against you to snatch at your snakebite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, being not less worried about her well-being than this bothersome guy, didn't want her to have your drink, either.

Maybe they were really poisoned by some knockout drops or sleeping pills, so that he could have his easy way with Mia... In fact, if you had dealt with this guy your own way, you would never have drunk his shots in the first place. But after Mia having downed her snakebite so quickly, you definitely didn't want her to have your one as well. Especially, since even that greasy guy had worried about her having a second dose of this stuff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you carefully blocked her attempt to get onto your glass with a cheerful \"Hey, that's mine!\" and quickly drank the snakebite yourself. As soon as you had emptied the small glass, however, you immediately felt your whole throat burning. God, this stuff was hot! As you followed the heat (and the pain) of the liquid, flowing down your gullet and spreading through your whole body, you soon realized how your whole body was getting numb and all your sensory organs were quickly dazing away... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've had hard drinks before, but this one clearly was special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast thing you remembered was a quite content smile on the face of the greasy guy and a short hissing from your side, which sounded like: \"Sssstupid hero...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything turned black... and your dream of a date was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you weren't dead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later (you don't remember exactly when) you came to your senses again, and almost immediately cried out in shock at a huge, dreadful face, which was hoovering just inches above yours. With your eyesight slowly returning to normal, however, you soon recognized the turgid features of your mousy friend Jack, who was intensely watching at you in a mixture of scientific interest and amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our hero has finally returned!\" you heard him squeal with glee. And almost instantly a second face shot into view, which very unsurprisingly belonged to Kody (the both of them being rarely seen without the other).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've been dumped by her as well...\", Kody nodded at you with a friendly mixture of compassion and gloating in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we can stay friends then!\" Jack added to this in his unmistakable manner. \"After all, friends are much more valuable than some super busty, super sexy super babes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuh-wuh-wait!\" you exclaimed, while picking yourself up and realizing you were still sitting on that bank at the burger place.<br>\r\n\"But where did she go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I've already tried to tell you, brother\", Kody sympathetically repeated to you. \"She's dumped you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Kody added up again: \"This predatory tit monster snatched your heart and ripped it out of your corpse. And now she's already on the hunt for her next prey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not true\", you objected. \"She didn't run away! We've been drugged... I mean, the both of us... Mia and me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized, how your friends were exchanging glances at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure\", Kody then nodded to you. \"But then there was this nasty guy, who has invited the both of you for a drink, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly...\", you replied to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first, you didn't want to take your drink\", Kody carried on. \"But then you got the impression that you would have to protect your super babe from drinking yours, and so you drank it down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly how things happened...\", you confirmed unbelievingly. \"But how...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, there is no super babe. No nasty guy. And no money, right?\" Kody triumphantly concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! That's not true...\", you protested, while checking for your wallet. But then you were shocked. It was indeed missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to be a man now\", Jack comradely encouraged you. \"At least you've still got your friends to take you home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe this! This whole date with beautiful Mia had been so amazingly perfect and beyond belief, that you more than once had asked yourself, how all this could ever be possible for a guy like you. But then, with every further kiss, you had really started to believe in this dreamgirl's interest for you... Heck! You had even been prepared to protect her... And exactly by this noble attitude you had fallen for her and this greasy guy's trick? What a fool you had been!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take this too hard, brother!\" Kody smiled at you. \"Material things come and go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with attractive guys like us, sexy babes come and go as well\", Jack jokingly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen \"Jockody\" helped you up from the bank (your legs still feeling a bit numb) and, after paying your bill, escorted you out of the place. A few minutes later (and a lot of more jackodian advice richer) you finally reached your home and thanked your friends for their support. Being alone in the house (with your little sister Sarah spending the night with some classmates and your father Scott being on another business-trip), you went straight to your room, threw yourself on your bed and started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jack and Kody were walking back from your house, when Jack suddenly turned to his friend Kody:<br>\r\n\"So, what are we gonna do with his wallet now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'd say, we scrub off our fingerprints and toss it away in that dark, small alley behind the \"Five Guys\", so that somebody will find it there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the money?\" Jack wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, keep it, of course\", Kody answered without any remorse. \"Like every honest finder would do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who needs enemies with friends like us?\" Jack giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving agreed about that, the two boys shortly after that turned into the destined alley, but then froze in their tracks. Instead of the usual darkness and remoteness of this place, the small alley was illuminated by large floodlights and literally bursting with agitated policemen and numerous onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck... has happened here??\" Jack cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gory murder\", one of the bystanders promptly informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another one proudly added: \"Yeah, I've seen the body myself. A real slaughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god\", Kody intuitively retorted to the latter one. \"How did she look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the man just shook his head. \"No, not a girl. A middle-aged man... But believe me, there ain't much left of him.\"</span></div></div>",

But as soon as you had opened the bathroom door, you couldn't believe what you were seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in front of you, in a hot cloud of steam and foam, stood the sexiest, naked girl that you had ever seen (or ever dreamed of seeing).

And the same was true for the rest of her package: Her endlessly long and smooth legs, her firm, knock-out butt, her slender hips, her slender arms... Everything about this wet, naked body seemed like a supernatural embodiment of beauty and sexiness... And all of this perfection was crowned with the beautiful head and face of Mia, who cast a warm, welcoming smile at you, as your eyes were meeting each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my goddess\", was all you could stammer at this sight, being much too absorbed and captivated by Mia's beauty to turn away and respect her privacy. And likewise your brain was hardly able to process the fact, that for some reason the accumulated water in the shower tub was of a deep, red color, which was only slowly clearing and thinning out, as more and more fresh and clean water was running down this incredible body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when she had finished her shower and emerged from the bath that you came to your senses again, offering a towel to her to dry and to wrap her stunning body inside. She thanked you with a deep, warm kiss, and all of your earlier worries were forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you allow me to stay with you tonight?\", she whispered into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you agreed. \"But only on the condition of a few more questions\", you then added with a smile. \"After all, we want to make progress onto our question No. 1000.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Stevo\", she replied with a chuckle. \"But I want to get a few answers, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal\", you smiled at her, and with a bit of timidity led her to your room. \"Welcome to my realm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is your lair!\", she giggled, after a short inspection of your room, which was mostly decorated with posters depicting some fantasy creatures and warriors. \"I like that one!\" she pointing at one picture of a huge snake woman, which was winding her powerful body in numerous embraces around the mighty figure of a strong warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Perseus and Medusa...\" you answered to her. \"Though this picture isn't quite right, because in the legends, Perseus would have turned into stone, if he had looked at her like this... Which is why he used the reflection of his shield to aim his sword at her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think, this snake woman and the warrior could rather feel in love for each other than wanting to fight?\" Mia mused at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\", you answered, having a new look at your old poster. \"Well, maybe... maybe not. She definitely looks kind of dangerous though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just dangerous?\" Mia dug deeper into the matter, which made you a bit surprised and insecure about her interest in the poster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe not just dangerous...\" you stammered...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Actually...\", you offhandedly decided to tell the truth: \"I think, this snake woman is really sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mia's beautiful face brightened up at this, you felt encouraged to carry on: \"I mean... first of all look at her body! That is the <i>human</i> part of her body. She's really, really attractive with this alluring, yet decided face, with this beautiful mass of her gold blonde hair, with her muscular, yet still very feminine arms... and not to mention those big, powerful breasts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia giggled at that. \"So the gentleman prefers blondes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", you replied, \"admittedly there was a time at school, when I had the reputation of loving the blondes... But when I look at you, Mia\", you beamed at her with enthusiasm, \"I really have to say: These reports are all wrong! The raven black rule!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Mia had to laugh. And as you looked at her amused face, you became once more painfully aware of the fact that you were sitting here on your bed with the most beautiful and attractive woman you had ever seen, besides an almost naked woman, apart from the towel she had wrapped her incredible body in. And those incredibly huge breasts of hers were even bigger than those of the sexy snake woman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about the <i>snake</i> part of her body?\" Mia brought you back to the original question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment about the right words. Then you decided to go with the truth again: \"It renders power. She could easily crush or strangle the strongest heroes with a mere embrace. Presumably she could also bite them and poison them, or devour them alive and digest them inside this powerful body of hers, or following the Greek myths, she could petrify her foes with the pure gaze of her beautiful eyes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a monster\", Mia interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes... maybe she is a monster\", you had to admit. \"But then again... there is more about her. Rather than a mere run-of-the-mill monster, she is the embodiment of danger as of beauty and temptation. Pretty much like the biblical snake, which offered her forbidden apples to Adam through sexy Eva... So, yeah, this snake woman may be a monster, but a very tempting and sexy monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Mia smiled at you in astonishment. \"You've really thought a lot about this poster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's been hanging around here for some time\", you blushed at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, honestly\", Mia insisted. \"I really like your thinking and feeling about this snake woman.\"<br>\r\nAnd then she added with a chuckle: \"Especially, since I sometimes can be a monster, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you had to laugh at her. \"Then watch out, my sexy monster! Cause here comes the righteous hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with this you assaulted her for a new kissing attack...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a giggly battle cry you lunged at Mia to kiss her and get her laid onto your bed. But instead of welcoming your attempt, the sexy girl unexpectedly blocked you by a simple move of her left hand. Blithely you tried to dodge and get around her hand, but she easily blocked you again. So you tried to push her outstretched arm aside, but much to your surprise Mia's resistance proved stronger than you would have expected. Even by increasing your pressure and leaning against her arm, you weren't able to move it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" You were impressed. \"You stand your ground firm as a rock...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you tried a tricky throwing technique, which you had once learned from your father and which was supposed to use the strength of an enemy against him. This time, however, Mia left her steadfast stance and in a swift, sideways motion elegantly countered your attack, thereby bringing you down onto your bed, while she kept her position in front of the bed and with her towel still perfectly wrapped around her stunning body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try!\" Mia grinned at you. \"But you have to do better than that, if you want to catch me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up from your bed again, you spontaneously decided to go for Mia's towel now. If you weren't able to get her the direct way, you had to weaken her defenses at first. Or her self assurance. Pretending to aim at her perfect legs, you launched forward. She draw back from you with dexterity, but you pursued her and finally had her cornered in front of your old TV set. You registered how Mia switched into her defensive stance again, and so you didn't even try to attack her, but with a roar went for her towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That's not the righteous style...\" Mia protested, as she realized your intentions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was too late. Quick as a flash you had opened the knot of her towel and stripped the whole thing from her naked body. As soon as you were confronted with the unveiled sight of Mia's incredibly huge and perfect breasts, however, you were instantly mesmerized and captivated by their sheer size and beauty again. Realizing the effect her breasts were having on you, Mia's face turned into an evil smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're completely at my mercy, little hero!\" she laughed at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with this she gave her breasts a playful shake, so that those vast and powerful spheres of her sinful flesh were wobbling and jiggling in front of your eyes and thereby forcing your mind even deeper and deeper under their spell. In fact, you literally lost track of time and space... Until you finally felt Mia's sweet, succulent lips onto yours again and found yourself lying in your bed with her, feeling the heat and the softness of her stunning body against yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, my little hero\", she warmly whispered at you. But before you could ask about the <i>how</i> and <i>why</i>, her lips were engulfing yours again and she rolled on top of you. And with this you suddenly felt the heavy weights of her full, huge breasts pressing down on your chest. <i>Oh my God</i>, you thought to yourself. <i>How can she ever stand up straight with those cannon balls?</i> But despite their heavy masses, the mere touch of her huge, hot breasts felt just incredible, almost magnetic... and almost immediately your manhood got very excited about those breasts as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh... look\", Mia broke her kiss and sexily moaned into your ear. \"Our little hero is growing up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she rose up from her sprawled position on top of you, thereby also lifting her huge and heavy breasts from your chest, which thereupon got into a dangling and hovering position just before your mesmerized eyes. However, before those breasts were able to entrance your excited mind again, you heard Mia's warm voice and found the strength to free your eyes from her wonderful breasts and raise them to Mia's beautiful face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please excuse me, Stevo\", Mia whispered at you in a strangely serious tone. \"As you may have noticed, my body is endued with some special, sexual powers... But since I really like you, and since this night is just our very first night together, I really don't want to rush you into things...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were speechless. Having been so close to Mia's stunning body mere moments ago, had been like your sexiest and most desirable dream. The warmth and the smoothness of her skin, the sweetness and the succulence of her lips, her fragrant perfume, her beautiful face, her soft and silky hair, and those... immense and full and heavenly breasts... Without doubt you had no other wish than getting intimate with this incredible dream girl again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you'd only met Mia this very afternoon and so far you'd learned as much as nothing about her. You knew you were really fond of her... her looks, her charm, her wit... But there really were so much more questions you wanted to ask her, things you wanted to know about her... Mia was right: The both of you had really rushed into things. Instead of getting known to each other first and making yourselves familiar and comfortable with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to be with Mia this night, of that you were sure. But you also wanted to spend more time with her. A lot more time... You wanted to make her a real and significant part of your life, not just a one-nighter. So, yeah... You had felt a deep surge of disappointment at first, when Mia had interrupted your intimacy, but now you were feeling really relieved, that Mia had offered you the chance to take things slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the most beautiful and most desirable girl, Mia\", you whispered at her. \"And right now there is nothing, that I would wish more than spending more time with you. But if taking things slowly tonight means spending even more nights together... and more days... Well, in that case, I'd definitely prefer not to rush into things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Steve\", Mia smiled at you in deep sympathy. \"Thank you for being so... sensible about my feelings.\" And with this she finally lowered herself onto you again (thereby almost smothering you with her glorious breasts again). And then she gave you another long, lustful kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But wait a moment</i>, you thought to yourself. <i>Hadn't Mia originally asked, whether YOU didn't want to be rushed into things?</i> You had to grin at that. So, obviously this question had also been based on her own feelings. And very obviously you had given the right answer for the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to ask some more question...\", Mia whispered at you, after rolling to your side and snuggling against you like your little sister had used to do in her earlier days. \"We've all the time in the world now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mia\", you returned at her. \"I've already had a thousand questions, when I first met you at the burger place this afternoon. But to tell you the truth, in the meantime these questions have more than doubled...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess so\", Mia giggled. \"After all, I've got a complex personality, which never could be described in less than 2000 answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've really got a very complex and fascinating personality\" you agreed to her with amusement. But then you got to the first question, which was really haunting you: \"How did you mean this, Mia, when you said, that your body was endued with special powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", Mia answered with a chuckle, \"you have already been acquainted with my boobies, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehm... yes, on bowing terms\", you retorted and Mia had to laugh at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she added matter-of-factly: \"They're really mesmerizing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't object to that...\", you giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mia insisted: \"No, Steve, I mean it. My boobs are hypnotic. In fact, they're like those \"Epic boobs\", which can turn heterosexual females into lesbians in 0,39 seconds... And likewise no man has ever had a chance to withstand their powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, I really adore those... incredible boobs of you...\", you replied with enthusiasm. \"They really must be like the largest and sexiest natural pair on the whole world... But don't you think this hypnotizing story is a bit over the top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Steve\", Mia cut into your protest, \"you, too, have already been affected by those. Or have you already forgotten about our little sparring earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you hadn't forgotten. \"Which brings me to my next question\", you carried on. \"How come you have been so strong and so skilled in our little fighting game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every girl should be able to defend herself, don't you think?\" Mia grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely\", you agreed with her. \"But you were not just able to defend yourself. You were fucking immovable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright, Steve\", Mia shyly conceded to you. \"Normally, I don't show off like this. But I felt good with you... And I wanted to impress you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which doesn't answer my question... How can you be so strong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's how I already said: My body has certain powers... A certain strength and dexterity are parts of these powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't really believe what you were hearing. <i>Was Mia really telling you that she was some sort of super girl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back at the burger place, before I got drugged and my wallet got stolen, you drank your shot and also wanted to drink mine, despite the high probability that those drinks had been drugged by this greasy, old guy... Can I conclude from this situation, that being immune to such things like knockout drops is another part of your special powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty as charged\", Mia smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what became of this greasy guy, after I'd shot myself to the last frontiers of the universe?\" you dug deeper, while suddenly remembering the red stuff Mia had been washing from her body, when taking a shower at your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt, how Mia winced at your question. \"This guy had meant to harm you, Steve\", she then replied to you with a little shiver in her otherwise melodious voice. \"And he wanted to do me bad, as well...\" And after a short moment of silence she added matter-of-factly: \"So the law of the nature has been executed upon him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean: the law of the nature has been executed?\" you asked her in growing alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... natural selection\", Mia explained hesitantly. \"Survival of the fittest. Or rather pest control, in this case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you really were in shock. \"You are speaking about a human being here, right?\" you sternly retorted at Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Steve, you are right\", Mia admitted to you with an even stronger trembling in her voice. \"Please excuse me. I really didn't mean to call things like this... And you truly have to believe me, that I also didn't want to hurt this guy in the first place. But when he urged me into this dark back alley of that burger place, he was so driven by his perverse lust to rape and to ravish me... that I was only acting in self-defense at first... But then I got carried away. I have to admit that to you. And I feel miserable about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I don't understand\", you interjected. \"How did you get into that back alley with this greasy guy in the first place? And why wouldn't any of the other visitors of the burger place just step up and keep this guy from urging you out of the place. And finally, having shown this great strength and self-defensive skill to me before, why weren't you able to just stop the guy from urging you at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your questions are more than legitimate\", Mia approved, thereby anxiously looking at you with her beautiful eyes. \"And I don't know, why there hasn't been another fine hero like you in this whole burger place... But you hopefully can understand, why I couldn't use my special powers in the public. People tend to fear what they can't understand, Steve. And so I was afraid of having the whole place turning against me, instead of being confronted with only the greasy guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\", you comforted her and gently put your arm around her. \"I guess, being super isn't that easy after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How true!\" Mia deeply sighed at that. \"But it's much more acceptable if being with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", you whispered at that endearing compliment. \"But why? Why would such a perfect and wonderful dream girl like you ever want to be with a simple guy like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know?\" Mia suddenly turned to you, as if you had just asked the stupidest thing on the world.<br>\r\n\"You really don't know???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at another place, not too far away, a strange creature was racing through the brushwood of a forest, hounded and hunted by an invisible group of chasers. Part of the creature resembled the form of a human man, but it was moving on all fours like a dog... or a wolf, and in the light of the moon you could see how thick fur was sprouting from all over its body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a single gunshot echoed through the quietness of the dark night, and with a deep, moanful howling, the fleeing creature abruptly broke down to the ground. Moments later a strong, fine-meshed wire spread itself over the badly injured creature. A second wire followed. And a third one, now completely preventing the creature from any more free movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen three shadows revealed themselves from the darkness of the nightly forest, all of them obviously human in shape, and carefully approaching towards their immobilized prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice shot, Scott!\", a complimenting, female voice could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the man, who had been addressed like that, replied in a calm, sonorous tone: \"Yeah, we've even got the poor thing alive.\"</span></div></div>",

But then you realized that Mia was not joining into your amusement. Had you said something wrong? Or had you missed a point? You thought about her last words again. Had they been a question?

And immediately you found yourself in a strange dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were wandering around a ramified cave-system. It was dark and sticky in there, and your torch had almost burnt down. In addition you were carrying a large, glinting shield and a sword on your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd somehow you had lost your way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What had she meant by saying that the law of the nature had been executed upon the greasy guy?</i> You suddenly asked yourself again. <i>And how had she got carried away?</i> Had she actually harmed that guy in any way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you stopped. Had there been a sound? You strained your ears and with a pounding heart you listened into the darkness of the cave. Then you were sure. Someone (or something) was breathing nearby. You tightened the grip on your torch and drew nearer. But then you froze. Suddenly you had become aware of two reddish eyes, which were glowing back at you, reflecting the fire of your torch. And judging from their position high above your own head, the bearer of those eyes either had to be much taller than you, or he was sitting on some ledge above, ready to lunge down at you at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he did. With a beastly roar a monstrous creature, half man, half wolf, jumped at you, with his claws and fangs twinkling in the light of your torch. But as he hadn't taken you by surprise, you were quick-witted enough to raise your shield and effectively block the attack. Your aggressive opponent, however, was getting into a real rage now and furiously aiming for you again and again. But you were your father's son, and therefore had learned to defend yourself. After loosing your shield to another attack of the wolf-creature, you drew your sword and were finally able to inflict a heavy wound upon your foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a feeble whimper, the wolf-creature finally fled from your fight. And even if you maybe better had killed that beast, you knew that in his injured state he would not pose any more danger for now. So you plugged your sword back into the scabbard and picked up your shield to carry on with your way for as long as your torch was still burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There has to be a natural explanation of her so-called powers</i>, you thought to yourself again. <i>Maybe she really had found a way to utilize her great breasts as a kind of inducing tool. Hypnosis was a real life procedure after all. And for this strength and agility of hers, though really remarkable, those just had to be the natural outcome of a hard training, right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you had reached a subterranean lake. Your dying torch had revealed the water's edge just in time to you. Otherwise you would have fallen inside the lake. But then your torch finally died down and you were left in complete darkness. You strained your ears again and you heard a soft gurgling in the water. Did this mean that the waters of the lake were moving? Or was there something moving inside the waters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you realized that this gurgling sounds were approaching, you drew your sword again. Whatever new creature was closing in on you, it surely would be eager to get a little bit of fresh flesh. And then, suddenly, you saw the creature. In a very mild, phosphorating light coming from its very heart, you saw a huge kraken, slowly spreading out numerous tentacles towards you. Carefully you took a step back from the edge of the water, and another step, hoping that maybe you could still avoid a fight with this beast. But then, all the pale, phosphorating light of the kraken suddenly went out and you immediately knew, that the monster would use the darkness to attack you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it did. You just wanted to turn around and run, when you felt the powerful blow of a tentacle sweeping you off your feet. And once you had hit the ground, several more tentacles were on you, beating on you and winding around your legs and arms, forcing you to let go of your shield and sword, until you were completely immobilized in their adamant embraces. Next, you were helplessly dragged back to the water's edge and then pushed underwater. And it was only then, that the kraken light up again, making itself once more visible to you in all its powerful and frightening size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe this would be a good point to wake up</i>, you desperately thought to yourself, while you were getting short of air - and time, as the tentacles of the kraken now were dragging you towards its over-sized mouth, which was lined with thousands of sharp teeth, waiting to bite and crush you to pieces. <i>Wake up!</i> you thought to yourself again. <i>Wake up! Wake up! It's just a bad dream... And there is no other natural way to get out of this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting more and more panic, however, you suddenly felt how something strange was happening to your body. At first, there was just a little tickling and tingling. But as you were getting closer and closer to the abyss of the kraken's deadly muzzle, your body started to shiver and to shake... to quiver and to quake... not only with agony though, but also with a sudden surge of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So that's what they call to run on adrenalin</i>, you thought to yourself. But then you realized, that your whole body was glaring and crackling with energy now. There were actually flashes of lightning and sparks running over and through your body. And as it seemed, this energy was also hitting the tentacles of the kraken and seemingly afflicting great pain to this creature, for the tentacles, which were wind around you, started to burn and to loosen their grip on you. As quick as this kraken had emerged from the subterranean lake, it now fled back into the deepest darkness, leaving you alone in the pulsating, flashy light, which was now encasing your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot yet truly understanding, what had just happened, you swam back (or actually floated) to the water's edge and picked up your shield and sword again. With the bright light of your new-found energy still around, you now at least didn't need a torch anymore. <i>But what on earth had given this energetic power to you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head. For a moment you had really fallen for this supernatural things. <i>But then this was just a dream, right? And why shouldn't you be endued with lightning powers inside your dream?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, your new-found power paved your way onward and you soon found the center of the cave-system. What you did find here, however, posed even another challenge to your understanding. In the middle of a circle of very artful, life-sized stone statues, on an abundant accumulation of gold and treasures, you saw the stunning body of a huge, sleeping snake woman. At first sight, you thought you would see the beautiful snake woman from your poster. But then you realized that the hair of this snake woman in front of you was black instead of gold blonde, and that her breasts were much larger and fuller than those of the original. Also the snaky lower part of her body was by far longer and much more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly it took you a while, but then you realized that you were marveling at a snake woman version of Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as you had come to this realization, Mia suddenly woke up. But for some reason you didn't dare to look into her eyes yet. Somehow you felt like an invader, caught in her most intimate lair. So you turn away from her shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetingsss, my littttle hero\", you heard her voice in an alluring, yet unfamiliarly hissing tone. \"What hasss zzzou brought to zzze Queen of 'Biya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, you didn't know what to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isss it wealzzz, you desssire? Or wisssdom? Or ssstrengzzz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still didn't dare to look at her, but, as it happened, were looking at one of the statues instead. What an amazing work of art! Just incredible, how even the startled look on the face of the statue had been molded. Then it suddenly struck you: Maybe, these were no statues at all, but earlier visitors turned into stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, you raised your glinting shield and looked at its reflecting surface (like a mirror), to get a glance at the snake woman. What a stunningly attractive body she had! But then you were perplexed. In this beautiful face, which had so much resembled Mia while asleep, there were NO EYES...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the possible danger, you finally turned to the snake woman, to see this with your own eyes. Still the fact remained. She had eyelids, with a most beautiful swing, but between those eyelids was no iris, no pupil, no scelra... just blank skin, as if there never had been any eyes before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness, what void eyes you have...\", you intuitively stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zzze better to sssee the sssoozzz\", the snake woman answered. \"But asss it ssseemsss, zzzou have brought a mossst tasssty gift for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain you didn't know, what to say and shyly looked around the cave to see, what gift she meant. You froze in terror, when you suddenly became aware of your little 8-year-old sister Sarah, standing next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Stephan\", she smiled at you. \"Do you think your girlfriend will like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo\", you roared like a wolf at that. \"She'll never get to eat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you wanted to draw your sword. But somehow you didn't had a sword anymore, but claws instead. And all the statues around had suddenly transformed into versions of Jackody. And as you looked back at the snake woman, she was replaced with the greasy guy, but with numerous tentacles instead of arms. And all the gold at your feet had turned into living coal. And a powerful earthquake was shocking the cave. And then you saw those beautiful, blank eyes again, but they were shedding tears of blood. And then you had to realize, that those were the eyes of Alison, the girlfriend of your best friend Tom. And then your sister Sarah was sick again, but she was puking up bones. And then there was a huge spider, which was eating a ton of burgers. But those burgers were filled with fingers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you finally woke up from this most disturbing nightmare... And Mia was gone.</span></div></div>",

You sat on to a nearby tree but felt something wrap around your legs.You saw it to be a snake's tail, but found out as you were taken inside the tree to be part of Mia's own body. Her legs were replaced by a snake's long tail stretching who knows how far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered why she looked like this but before you cloud say anything she came up to you and starred into your eyes. Her beautiful green eyes were something to behold but then they changed into spirals of yellow then blue then back to green again. You felt what seemed to be her hypnotizing you but were fully aware of it. You weren't under but instead felt a rushing feeling of love for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my love...let us become one.\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got on top of you and the both of you made sweet love inside her own snake coils. Nearly everything felt so real and you had a new-found love for Mia. You wanted to have her but still you had to be patient but it would be worth it. Soon enough you awoke to see Mia in bed next to you resting on your body feeling your heartbeat. You caressed her hair and face gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to have laid herself on you the whole night and you noticed she wrapped her legs around your own. It was sexy but she didn't advance on you yet which gave you a sigh of relief. All tat concerned you was that in your dream why was she half snake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was because of the picture you two mentioned last night and pictured her as the snake-woman. She began to wake up and stared grabbing your face and pulling herself to kiss you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...Good morning...pleasant dreams?\", Mia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Pleasant to say the least.\", you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you enjoy my hypnotic eyes?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was weird. She knew about that part of your dream? \"How did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was there Steve. I gave you that dream, I wanted you to see me as myself.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As what?\", you asked perplexed at her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a lamia Steve. You know what I look like whenever I am not human. You saw how much I love you. So do you think that I'm a monster?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Of course not! How can I ever think that? But how-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I are meant for each other! I can go into your mind and I've you any fantasy you want! I've been searching for the one for me and here you are!\", she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean lamia's have people who are destined to be together and they share a unique bond? So when we first met...you knew I was that special one for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I kissed you right on the spot because when I was on my way to meet you I could sense my soul mate. And you were there waiting for me. I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....don't know what to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't say anything. Just do what you feel is right.\"</span></div></div>",

That my dear is the wonderful power of hypnosis. A trait common among my soecies, it works wonders. The experience in the dream is NOTHING compared to reality. You feel like a new man. But in my hands, you'll feel all sorts of things, even things you won't even realize. If you want me to?\", she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to try it.\", you accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good but let's make it fun. Get out of here and try to hide then let me do the rest. But make it at least a challenge for me if you can.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you sprinted off trying to hide from Mia. You hid in your closet in the living room. You heard her looking around but she couldn't find you until she transformed into her lamia half before your eyes. She used her nature tracking skills to find you and see you hiding in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssssaaaaayyyyy now. What have we here? Awww it's a human. A hot and sexy human.\", Mia pretended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey get off me and leave me alone!\", you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are a fisty little one. Perhaps you would prefer to get to know me.\", she insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your gonna eat me! Let me go so I can just get some sleep!\", you pleaded as her tail was tying a knot around your wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia had just the method to llet you experience her power. She came near your face and spirals engulfed her eyes and your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesssss pleeaaaassssss go to sleeeeeep. Pleasssssss go to sleeeeeeeep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point your attention was directly focused on Mia spirals, yet you were still consious. As the sprials came down on your vision your pupils shrunk. Mia had almost got you to slip out of consiousness but she blinked causing your eyes to grow back. Your senses were now very dull that you have no idea what is exactly happening. Ounce Mia had focused you became drawn again but now your jaw was slack. Then your pupils were starting to shrink again but only for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssslllleeep little steven ressst in peaaaccccceeeee\", she drew out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia began to move her hed side to side in order to make you dizzier. You were recieving far too much stimulus for your current state of mind and your eyes dialated awkwardly. But soon as you became more relaxed and accustomed to her hypnosis it became rather pleasurable. But now your comprehension of your surrondings was now reduced teromendously. Mia had her tail start to wrap you up and coil your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was now in near sync with Mia movements and your pupils were now completly gone. Ounce that happened you were focused 100% on the spirals that now you were in perfect sync. Your eye lids began to lwer but your desire for the spirals made you want to keep them open. Mia was aware of this and came in closer as her tail fully cocooned your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep my love and feel the greatest pleasures I give to you.\", she said as she kissed you hard with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were taken aback by it but you still felt awesome. Your mind was now in pure and total bliss that now you were Mia's puppet. The spirals were wildly forming in your eyes as a result and you smiled from the kiss. \"Excellent. Now steve you are going to have dreams of me whenever you go to sleep. You will have feelings of love, lust, desire within them. But they will not influence you. They will only make you want to get to know everything about me.\", she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded inresponse now having your eyes closed. \"From now onn when you are like this, you will slowly begin to get aroused more and more each time your in this state I give you. So that when we have sex one day you will be more than ready.\", she commanded. Your mind aknowlaged the commands but then she wanted one more thing before releasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lastly, you will not remember brining up my hypnosis nor this experience. However when I say you can remeber them, your feelings of pleasure will be even greater than they are now ounce you remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOunce you acknowleged her command she said, \"Wake up.\", and you were back to your old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa what happened? Why did you wrap me up?\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to feel your skin on my coils. You felt so comftorable you fell alseep. But for now let us have the rest of the day to ourselves in a more normal manner shall we?\", Mia suggested.</span></div></div>",

She had red hair but that wasn't the part that surprised you. The part that did was that she had a huge pair of breasts and quite the big butt to boot. She sat down in front of you and said, \"Hey there, my name's Monica. What's yours?\" You said your name to her and she said, \"Nice name. I noticed you were staring at my breasts. I get that a lot because when you have breasts of this size you are going to get a lot of stares.\" You were surprised to hear she was okay with that. She then said, \"I know what you're thinking, did I have those injections to make my breasts this large? The answer is no silly, I ate the right foods to make them grow this size.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked her what she wanted to eat and she mentioned her order and you said that is a lot considering the way she looks. Monica chuckled and said, \"I have a pretty darn good metabolism so it doesn't matter.\" Monica said to you, \"Would you follow me into the bathroom sweetie?\" You were surprised to hear that but couldn't resist not to. The five guys you were in was rather large so it had a special restroom designed for a family. It had a futon inside there that was designed for a pair of pregnant woman to rest on. Monica then locked the door behind you when you entered behind her. Monica then said, \"Thanks for the meal and also for being my date, you don't know how big a catch you caught fufufu.\" You were surprised to hear that and was stunned to see Monica transform into a sort of demoness. Monica said, \"I am a Succubus. One of the last of my kind. The reason why my kind is endangered is that people learned how to ensure we weren't in their dreams and also learned how to kill us in the process. The few that remained were forced to take a physical form in the real world. We didn't realize that we took our efforts too far until it was nearly too late.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked to hear that and felt sorry for that. Monica then said, \"My kind usually waits to release an egg until they feel the time is right but due to how small our numbers are we have to do anything we can to ensure we don't go extinct. So please Steve! Mate with me!\" You went and promptly took the offer. Monica said, \"Thanks sweetie I know it is so sudden but I knew deep down you were the right man for the job.\" Both you and Monica went completely naked before you had sex in an effort to bring Monica's kind back from the brink. Monica had 10 eggs inside her waiting to be fertilized by your semen and the eggs rushed out of the ovaries to accept the incoming sperm. When you finished mating with Monica she said, \"Phew that was fun! I know with that much inside I am going to be pregnant with a good amount of children. Also I learned from mating with you where you lived and who you are and I must say you must have had a hard life with your mother dead your father having to work all the time and dropping out to take care of your sibling that is a hard life. How about we continue mating at your home?\" You agree and Monica snaps her fingers and both of you are suddenly in your bedroom and Monica ensured that your car was in the garage as well. Monica then said, \"I should mention that what we are about to do is when a Succubus gets married. We will have to have one entire day of non stop sex and don't worry sweetie I'll ensure you don't get tired out during this time with my power.\" You were amazed to hear that out of nowhere. Once an entire day has passed from that Monica said with her hand on her stomach since she is pregnant with 10 children even though she hasn't starting showing, \"So what do you want to do now with how not only we are married but also expecting a lot of children as well my love?\" You reply with...</span></div></div>",

Suddenly I am shoved into them and I heard a soothing voice say to me, \"Hush my love, we are going somewhere safe.\" When whoever abducted me finally landed I looked behind me to see I was at a small cave overlooking a beach and when I looked down I saw somehow I was Stark naked. When I looked up I finally saw who captured me. It was a rather beautiful looking woman with a pair of breasts that looked like they were T cup size. She was naked alright but when I looked closer she had what looked like a set of giant moth wings and the fact she had fur on her only made her look even more beautiful. She then said, \"Welcome to my home I am sorry it isn't the best of places but it works.\" I resides in a tropical area and I saw the moon having its light flowing into the cave. I looked around and saw she had what looked like long term camping gear including a large air bed that I was apparently sitting on at the time. She continued with, \"My name is Sveta and I am a mothgirl.\" She then sat on my dick and I felt a overwhelming sensation brew throughout my body. I must have felt rather entranced by her because she had smelled like the best smelling flowers out there. She then shoved one of her nipples into my mouth and I felt nectar flowing out of it. It made me go into a state that was clearly unlike anything I ever felt before.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It'd been a tough day. Heck, a tough week honestly. Day before yesterday he had to bury Freddy in the back yard. A more loyal and unswerving hamster there has never been! He ran that wheel like he owned it! He sniffed, then rolled his eyes as he remembered what his boss, miss Langford, shouted at him today. He didn't do well with people in general, girls in particular, and not at all with being shouted at. He'd basically just timidly nodded and shuffled out still nod quite understanding what she was going on about. Apparently he wasn't working as efficiently, but... he'd done the numbers, and he was putting more than others on shelves, and way more organized. He kept notes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly kicking a stone from the walkway as he headed to his car he pondered what he could do. Kenny might figure out what she wanted, but Kenny was a little busy. The guy always found work there kinda tough, which Martin never understood. It's just organisation, bit of spatial awareness, bit of planning and reading schedules. Hardly tough. Still, he'd ask tomorrow if he knew why miss Langford was mad at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother stone was flicked into the bushes with his shoe, but this time there was an odd squeaking hiss noise and he stopped. Crouching down he looked into the dark underbrush under the bush and saw a hole in the fence, but not a lot else. Huh, wonder what...? Then a shadow moved slightly. Was that? He blinked, and without thinking reached forwards with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he did it he realized, if this really was a snake as the shadow looked like, then that was a rather bad idea. He couldn't see any warning signs in that low light. Could be poisonous or... A small snake head did move forwards and... a forked tongue lapped at his extended finger, it looking up at him expectantly and... blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" He frowned, peering down at the cream, dark, and light brown head. Snakes didn't have eyelids, they couldn't blink. But this one did. Weird. \"Well who are you then?\" He added, and curiously it reared up slowly and rested it's head on his hand gently. \"Aw, you're cute!\" he said with grin. \"Heh, don't suppose you want to come home with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled at the thought, then blinked as the snake slithered up onto his hand, then over his arm, wrapping gently around it. The thing was not tiny, but hardly large either, being maybe at most a foot long, maybe a hair more. It's head was small, maybe only an inch long, though a little blocky, reminding him of an Anaconda in some ways. He cautiously raised his arm and the snake remained perched there, seemingly perfectly happy with being lifted that far off the ground by a stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weirder and weirder.\" He muttered. \"Snakes usually aren't this... social. Especially with other critters. Though I'm sure not complaining!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grin and a bit of a spring in his step he headed to his car once more, smiling down at his new companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got home and closed the door, carefully sliding the snake onto the kitchen table. His house was actually a fairly good, double wide trailer, a 'gift' from his dad that he was VERY glad of given his low income, though it was about all he got from him. Of course it wasn't free, but dad had helped him with the mortgage and done half of it. He and dad didn't get on that well, at least not in the last few years, but well enough. He still got the impression dad wanted to buy more attention from him, which rankled quite a bit with him. But for this he'd put up with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning over the table he grinned down at his new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. Eyelids huh? Interesting. And your color scheme I don't recognize either. Cream, light and dark brown. Kinda like a cornsnake, but that pattern, sort of a stripe with cross bands rather than blotches. Hmmm....\" He was hardly a snake expert, but he thought he should recognize it if it was a common type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked up at him, blinking occasionally as he talked, seemingly interested in him. He wondered if it heard better as well. Curiously he peered in, trying to see the side of it's head, and sure enough there were little indentations behind and below the eyes. Ears. A snake with ears? Well, not visible outside ears, and probably not well developed, but that looked like an aperture for an ear canal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if anyone else knows about you?\" He said, thinking if he might even tell some scientist or something, though likely wouldn't really help him, and then the snake would be taken away. That'd be bad. He sighed and continued to examine it, and the snake seemed to like the attention somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smooth scales.\" He said, tracing a finger gently across it's body. \"Fairly slim body for the head style, nice.. huh, that's odd. The cloaca's not usually that far up the body.\" He said, tracing a finger over the indentation of the cloaca, almost halfway up the body. Usually it was closer to the tail. He gently probed it as he'd seen on videos online, but the snake didn't respond, other than a slight shiver. \"Female then. And very calm one too. Nice.\" As he went to wash his hands he didn't catch the snake shiver a little more, and it's jaw shift into a passable smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to clean out Freddy's cage (it was already mostly done from yesterday) and get it set up as snake terrarium. Thankfully Freddy's 'cage' was transparent plastic walled, not a cage in the typical sense, so that would work. Though the feeding hole was easily small enough for... oh. Naming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" He said, turning back to the kitchen table where the snake was still laying, almost looking like it was preening itself or something, tracing it's body down with it's muzzle. Odd, he'd never heard of that behavior before. \"How about... Penny? Yeah, Penny sounds cool.\" The snake looked up at that for a moment blinking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he got the cage set up he gently transferred Penny in, and she seemed to take well to the environment. Though that feeding hole would have to be managed. As is she could easily slide out through it. For the moment he just put a book up against it to block the hole. Air holes thankfully were small enough to not be a risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Penny. See you tomorrow morning.\" He said, tapping the plastic gently, then turned to go to bed.</span></div></div>",

Jennifer.\" He muttered, flicking his head side to side, in the throws of some pretty hot dream. \"Jenni.... OOooh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly he blinked away, wonderful surges of pleasure still flowing through him from the dream... uh... though they were still going... uh... He blinked, gasping, feeling the passion get extreme. With a pant he managed to grab the sheet and yanked, flicking it off his body... and gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was curled between his legs, her jaws dislocated, his cock stretching her upper body tight for nearly half her length, her jaws mostly down to his groin. Mostly, as they were moving up and down, audible gulps sounding as she sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooooooly shiiiioooohhh!\" He grunted, and came, feeling Penny's gulps get tighter and more intense as he squirted. Instinctively he reached down, gripping her and pushing, her jaws parting against his groin hard as he shuddered into her. When his passion relaxed he gasped, letting go abruptly. \"Oh, god. Penny! Er, did I hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake seemed perfectly happy to just suck (delightfully!) on him down there, as he slowly shrank. He just stared, dumbstruck as the snake finished up her magnificent blowjob. When he was down to normal size once more she gently pulled back, reared her head up and stared into his eyes, licking her lips with her forked tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... you're welcome.\" He said, looking a little panicky. \"Wow. I mean.... wow.\" She seemed to like that, and just curled back down, wrapping a couple of coils around his flaccid cock gently, then rested her head against his groin and closed her eyes. He glanced at the clock, seeing it was near midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was... utterly unbelievable. Someone had trained a snake to give blowjobs? How? Why? Er, scratch that. The latter was obvious, but still how in hell would you do that? In some ways he was nervous, having a snake on his groin like that, but... given what she'd just done. Well.... he laid back on the pillow and pulled his covers back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Probably need a good nights sleep.\" He muttered, his eyes still going to where Penny was under the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently she was still thirsty, as he was woken up at five AM by another orgasm, Penny stuffing herself with his manhood once more. How she fit something half as long as her entire body inside her was beyond him, but she did. Seemingly effortlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooo boy! That was, fantastic!\" He murmured, sliding the covers off her once more and stroking her, even as she continued to suck on his member as it started to shrink. \"I can't believe I'm this lucky!\" Penny seemed to almost preen at that comment, and he could swear her jaws twisted into a slight smile around him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Martin carefully extracted himself from Penny, moaning at the sensations, and headed to the bathroom to freshen up. For some reason he thought it was Saturday and would have to ring Kenny later (he slept in on the weekend he knew, unlike Martin), but soon realized it was Friday. With a sigh he got dressed and got set up for work. Penny he put back in the cage, finding the book knocked over. She'd just gone through the feeding hole and knocked it over apparently. He wrapped some string around to hold it in place and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Penny, I'll let you out tonight. Just wait till I get home, huh?\" He said, tapping on the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he headed out early to his pet store first, getting some frozen mice for Penny to eat, then heading back home. He defrosted them and left them in the cage, and She wasted no time wolfing them down. He'd seen snakes eat on youtube before, but... she ate a mouse in about two seconds, sucking it down like it was candy. He knew from... ahem.... personal experience she didn't use teeth to do that, so somehow must have really well developed mouth and throat muscles to work them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Penny, I'm heading to work. Be good and I'll see you when I get home tonight.\" He said and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny waited. And waited. And waited. The tall friend said he was going to be coming back soon. But how long was 'soon?' She was hungry. Those mice hadn't lasted. She needed something bigger! With a sigh she reached up, now the easy opening was blocked, and slipped her tail into the crack of the lid on top. She got the impression her big friend had blocked it to protect her. Well she didn't really need protection, but the thought was nice. The lid only lifted a tiny bit as she pried in, holding on the fastener outside, but it was enough to reach that clip and flick it, releasing the lid. With a smile she slipped up and out of her new home and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could taste food from the room nearby, but nothing too appealing to her. Human food probably. However faint tastes of prey came from outside her big friend's home. Circling around the table leg she slid down, then crossed to the door. Unfortunately she was too big to fit under the tiny crack under the door itself. She wrapped herself around the leg of a kitchen chair, then wobbled it back and forth, only moving it a quarter inch with each wobble, but after maybe twenty minutes she got it to the door and climbed up it. Carefully she reached over and around the handle, as her big friend had done when he left, and twisted, and nearly fell off as the door opened! Shaking her head at her stupidity she slid down once more and headed outside. She could taste food definitely, and across the street she saw a big animal, maybe half her big friend's size. No, she didn't think she could eat that yet. Maybe later after she grew a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking around this home she was carefully quiet, and tried to stay upwind. A small critter ran down a tree and she carefully stayed hidden as it got close to her. With a careful timing she coiled and sprung out, snapping the chittering furry thing. She didn't know what it was, but it tasted good. It's claws scraped on her scales ineffectually. She was way tougher than that! Heh, her big friend had been worried about squeezing too hard, and given the size difference he might have, but as hard as he squeezed was just fun for her. It'd take a lot more than that, or these claws, to hurt her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle she wolfed the squirrel (though she still didn't know it's name herself) down in about three seconds, feeling a little satisfied at least. She kept looking as she felt it still wriggle inside her, hissing a giggle as she moved on at the sensations. Then another prey came up, this one she remembered. A cat, a really big one! Looked fluffy, but not all that was fur she knew. Her mom ate plenty of cats. She liked them, and Penny remembered the taste from her. She hoped they'd taste the same for her. Everyone is different after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she snuck in, winding slowly, downwind, and pounced. This was a little trickier. The cat was way bigger than she was, and she could only just wrap around it once. It bounded across the grass as she got in place, twisting, then she got her head wrapped around it's front leg, tripping it up. It tumbled to the ground with a squeal of panic, and she quickly went for the head. One gulp the massive furry bulge slid into her mouth fully, her jaws on it's neck. This limited her, and the cat almost got up, but she got her tail around it's front two legs (just, she wasn't that long yet) and pulled, stopping it from much more than scrabbling. Again it's claws raked over her scales, and she felt it bite her inside a little, which tickled, but she managed to hold it in place as she swallowed, getting over it's shoulder and front legs before legging go, pinning the cat in place, deep anguished 'meooows' coming from inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat was was nearly a foot and half long and chunky, half again as long as her and way WAY heavier than her slender build. It didn't stop her. Her jaws widened impossibly, stretching around the bulk of the cat and it vanished down her gullet pleasantly. Technically she could likely have finished it off in ten or twenty seconds, but she was happy, resting on the grass and went slowly, savoring the meal. It was a couple of minutes later when the tail slid from view, but she then had difficulty moving. Rippling her scales, and making the cat howl even harder as her internal muscles kneaded it, managed to get her to shift slowly across the lawn. She'd gone a fair bit from the door however and it took over an hour to get back. Slowly she pushed the door shut, then went up the table... and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way she was getting back up to her new home this heavy! So instead she curled around the table leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin got home only a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin had been a little peeved. It seemed that he'd missed that miss Langford had been hitting on him. At least that was what Kenny thought. Now she was pissed at him and taking it out on him. That was totally unfair, and... he'd never had a girl hit on him like that! Jenny had taken a fair bit to agree to a date, and he was not that good at it. Now his boss was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped at his door as he realized when he put the key in... it was already unlocked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh shit.\" He muttered, but didn't see any damage to the door. It hadn't been broken into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he opened the door and... blinked. What was...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes goggled as he caught Penny's tiny head poke up over the huge cream and brown bulge by the table. She'd... got out and.... what? Eaten...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny's body shifted, clear indentations of a paw bulging out for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp!\" came from Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" He said, dropping his keys and kneeling down by the incredible snake. It... was a cat? Still alive? He could see the snake's bulging body shifting and squirming. \"How in heck did you eat a cat? It must have been ten times your weight! Bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could swear Penny had a very self satisfied look on her face. Her body was very stretched, now far longer than it had been (and how come her spine survived that!), though he still saw a few inches of her tail sticking out beyond the bulge. Gently he stroked that massive bulge, provoking another slight burp from Penny, and her tummy tightened up, slight bulges of cat becoming more evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as he knew that would be impossible for any snake he'd ever heard of. Eating something THAT much bigger than itself. Well, maybe an Anaconda or an egg snake. They did eat pretty... No, even that wasn't this big of a difference! Gently he picked the much heavier and bulging snake up and opened the cage and placed her inside. Then wondered how she'd got out. The book was still in place by the feeding hole. Well, she wouldn't get out through that hole! Though, the whole cage was likely going to be too small for her already! Well, for tonight she'd have to put up with it. Maybe he could sort something bigger out tomorrow. At least it was a day off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made himself dinner, watched a bit of TV, and all the while kept gazing over to Penny. Every time she was staring back at him. It was, kind of creepy and... also weirdly erotic. Mainly him just thinking of last night when he looked at her. Finally after a shower when he went to bed he was almost sad. She was way too big to manage what she'd done last night. She could barely move!</span></div></div>",

Well, yeah, there was no way she'd sneak out and reach his bed tonight... though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he'd really thought it through he went over and opened the lid of the cage and hefted her out. He could swear she was smiling up at him, though maybe that was his imagination. He definitely smiled back as he carried her to the bedroom, finally removing the towel from around his waist before slipping under the covers, Penny once more between his legs, though at her current size his legs were forced apart by the huge bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, good night Penny.\" She said. \"Hope you have a... Ooooh!\" He gasped, then lifted the cover to just catch her as she began sucking his already half erect shaft down her gullet. \"Ooooh yes!\" He moaned, and fell back on the pillow, letting her do what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat throat felt utterly incredible as it rippled and sucked on him, sliding slickly back and forth tightly. Oh damn! So this was what it was like? Mmmm! Two nights in a row! He still wished Jenny had wanted to, but that was water WAY under the bridge. Though he still dreamed about her sometimes. He gently stroked Penny's head as she sucked and a short time later when he came (violently) he shuddered, his thighs squeezing tightly on the bulging snake, his hands squeezing her down to the base of his cock. Again though, she seemed not to be perturbed by this at all, even to smile slightly around his shaft and he experimentally squeezed his thighs on her again and she wiggled but definitely didn't do anything to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh *pant* Guess you like being squeezed huh?\" He managed letting the sheet fall back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly disgorged her current meal (no where close the size of the cat!) and nodded under the covers, unseen by Martin. Contentedly she wrapped as much of her remaining neck (which wasn't much) around his cock and settled in for the night.</span></div></div>",

Mmmmm.\" He moaned, and shortly afterwards jerked through a spasm, his thighs squeezing her tightly... but then realized the bulge was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... \" He started, then lifted the sheet to see a two and a half foot version of Penny staring back up at him, her larger head still sucking contentedly on him.

Her mouth picked up in speed, squeezing tightly and this time was fast in coming! After that he felt exhausted, but... at least it was a Saturday. No rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, feeling Penny resting her head warmly against the base of his cock while he lay there, he finally lifted the sheets and stared in amazement at the incredible snake.

Naw, must be coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Penny. Damn. Best friend I have!\" He said, grinning from ear to ear. This time her return smile was very evident and he blinked.

Made a change from Mom's first human. He'd been... well, not too nice in the long run. Penny was happy she had a nice one!

Just not enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human petted her a few times, his eyes so entrancing, and headed out to put on those coverings they liked.

She was still small, so maybe she could get him to help with that? But, she couldn't speak yet, and she wouldn't be hungry for a day or two. It was a toss up. Wait till she could explain things herself, but then she'd be too big to easily squeeze. Maybe she could do something now instead? She couldn't think what. She knew mom had never managed it with her guy, but then he'd been a little weird and hadn't helped much after he realized she wasn't a snake. This one? This one was a keeper!

It looked cool... but she realized he was making the same mistake she had. She had loved her home he'd given her, and was happy with it, till she realized she outgrew it with one feeding! This one she'd outgrow too. And he was working so hard on it!

Seemed he was taking a nap after all that work. Hmm, maybe she should tend to him now? He loved it when she squeezed on him with her throat... Her throat. She blinked, a weird idea coming to her. He liked it when she squeezed his rod with her throat, so what if he squeezed her body with his throat? Wouldn't that be so good? She grinned. It sounded perfect! And he had nice looking lips, and she was still pretty small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she slithered up his body in that soft chair and slid up to his lips. She hissed an attempt to say 'bottoms up' and prodded at those lips. Took a few goes before she managed to wiggle inside, but she managed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to get squeezed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin woke slowly, feeling pressure, a tickle in his throat, and short of breath. In fact.... he realized he couldn't breath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping (or trying to) he opened his eyes and saw Penny's long tail slowly slithering purposely into his mouth. There was only a foot left, and less by the moment! He could feel her curling up in his stomach somehow. He reached up and grabbed her tail, and for a moment got what he thought was a happy squirm from her. As soon as he started to pull her out though, she wriggled, and pulled back. IN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy god, he'd got a suicidal snake! And she wanted to be eaten!?! He struggled, but she was too slick and his fingers lost their grip. He could swear he heard a giggle as he inadvertently gulped, the pressure squeezing her down. Panic stricken he watched as her tail tip slipped into his mouth and felt it slide tightly down his throat. His stomach felt like he'd eaten a horse! Tight wouldn't describe it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny? What? How, why? Oh my god you'll suffocate!\" At that he felt her movements inside him abruptly stop, her shaking a little a few moments later. \"OK, hang on.\" He quickly gulped down, hoping air would settle in to help her breath, but then had no idea how to get her out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was an idiot. Why didn't she think this through? Of course there wouldn't be air down here? Oh, but it was so cozy! And the trip down had been divine! Soooo tight! But even now she could tell the air tasted stale a little, used like... a rippling gurgling sound came from above her and the stomach entrance opened, a bubble of air plopping in, fresher air! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He likes me!' Was her first thought, though that was silly. She already knew that from before. But he actually was getting air down for her, helping her. He really cared! And cared enough to help her fight off her stupidity! The stomach itself wasn't an issue. She felt the juices round her as a little warm, but weren't affecting her. But air? Yeah, that would be an issue! In fact... how was she going to get out? That opening was really small. It would be tricky to force her way back in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to get out now, while she could still breath!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin still was staring at his stomach in shock. Why had Penny done that? It made no sense! Survival instincts alone should have kept her away from anything like a mouth. Though she seemed to not treat him like a threat at all in other ways, why wouldn't this be any different?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Penny? Why did... Urk!\" He held his belly as something felt... tight. Then there was a stab of pain and he curled over. \"What...? Oooh.\" The pain ebbed, but tightness continued, like something feeling way over stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sensation squeezed in, deeper, and he could swear his stomach felt lighter, less full. Then his belly gurgled loudly. He clutched at it wondering what was gong on, even as a twisting sensation began down there, as his stomach eased further. Whatever it was it was speeding up, and was pretty sure he felt movements of Penny in among all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing Penny?\" He managed, still feeling weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later he got his answer when he felt the need to poop and dashed to the bathroom. But when he sat on the toilet with his pants and underwear around his ankles, he felt that wriggling sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PenneeeEEEE!\" he gasped, as the little snake plopped her way free of his butt and took a shuddering breath of fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped at the weird and not unpleasant sensations as she wriggled her way out much slower, her long body squirming out inch by inch as she curled up around his leg. When he looked down she refused to meet his eyes and he could swear she looked sheepish. As she poured out of his ass he moaned, finding the sensations far better than he might have imagined, and he caught that Penny seemed a little surprised at this as well, and then abruptly began to pump her tail in and out of his ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy... Gnnn!\" He gasped, then her jaw fastened over his cock and she swallowed, catching it in time as he came. After that she looked far happier, gazing up at him. However he still felt her expression had an apologetic look to it. \"Oh. trust me. That was nice. I was just worried for you!\" He gasped, then wondered why he was talking to a snake? It wasn't like she could really understand him. He was just imagining it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Martin felt a little too out of it to finish the new wooden enclosure on Saturday. He just sat and watched TV in the afternoon. Surprisingly Penny stayed on his lap and seemed fascinated with the TV too. She must have much better eyes than most snakes to be able to make it out... or maybe she just liked the pretty flashing lights. Who knew?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout four thirty he was flicking channels randomly. He accidentally hit a soap opera thing, where a guy and girl were shouting at each other... then soon after fell into each other's arms and began to kiss... and just as he was about to change channel he felt Penny's tail slip into his pants. He glanced down, seeing her gaze fastened on the screen, just as her tail wrapped gently around his cock as it began to swell. He raised his eyebrows, then sighed as she began to pump. How could he get so lucky? Maybe he was better with snakes than with girls? Heh! He wasn't complaining!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left the channel on, panting and sighing as she tended to him, and half way through he opened his eyes to see Penny's face right in front of him, staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You... er... want something Penny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile faltered as she nodded clearly, her motion in his pants slowing to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he lost that chain of thought as she lowered her head down, nudging her muzzle against his lips. He pulled back a little, worry on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you want to be eaten again?\" And amazingly she nodded, and that was definitely a smile! A rather embarrassed, aroused smile if wasn't mistaken. \"Really? But. You need to breath!\" Then he gaped as she opened her mouth and began to breath deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was preparing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked. This was impossible, it was like she was... a person! She understood what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" He managed, and she stopped deep breathing and looked at him quizzically. \"I mean. You understand me don't you?\" She smiled again and nodded. \"How?\" She just tilted her head, still staring deeply into his eyes. That look really reminded him of that one time Jenny got drunk and started talking about how his eyes looked like limpet pools or something. \"Penny? Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just tipped her head the other way, if that was an answer, then nudged her head down again to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you really like being eaten.\" She nodded emphatically, her grin even wider. Then he remembered how she responded when full of cat and he'd squeezed her with his thighs. \"It's the squeezing isn't it?\" Her eyes opened wider and she gave a rapid nod, grinning more, then her muzzle nudged again to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, this was weird in so many ways. A snake that could think, seemed to really like him, give him blow jobs, and... wanted to be eaten. Yeah, weird. But... he clenched his butt experimentally. Yeah, that had actually been fun. Weirdly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... OK. Just be careful, alright?\" She nodded again and he just stared in amazement. Then she started deep breathing again, making him smile softly. He traced a finger gently down her head and she closed her eyes and leaned in to it contentedly. \"God I'm so lucky.\" She opened her eyes and smiled, slowly shaking her head, then her tail came up and pointed at her neck emphatically. \"You're lucky?\" She nodded. \"Heh... wow. How come I didn't find you earlier?\" He said, gently stroking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later she was done deep breathing and ducked down. With a puzzled sigh he slowly opened his mouth, then took a few gulps of air first too, to a hissy chuckle coming from Penny. Then she edged into his open maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was very weird. He felt her wiggle gently to the back of his throat, filling his mouth. For a moment he worried over hurting her, but he'd clutched pretty tightly to her last night with his thighs. Plus he must have gulped hard before when she slid in before, right? He felt her there, just resting on his tongue, then he took a gentle gulp. Her head plopped down his throat awkwardly, and a little tightly, but she slid in, giggling by the sound of it, and he watched her body slowly slick up and into his mouth, inch by inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thin, but long. Two and a half foot of snake was a lot, but he'd managed it before. He felt her head wriggle down his gullet, then plop into his belly. Slowly he slurped and gulped her down, surprised at her taste. He'd been too panicked to notice last time. Not sweet, but nice. Like a musky tart flavor. Weird, but nice. Given he'd prepared this time he wasn't out of breath by the time her tail flicked into his mouth and then slid nicely down his throat. Curiously this time his stomach didn't feel over full. Maybe he was stretching?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh. So, Penny? Happy?\" A muffled hissy giggle was the only response and he smiled. This was certainly a weird relationship... if that was what this was? He didn't feel right calling her a pet any more... then his eyes fastened on the enclosure he was building. Yeah. Locking her up felt so wrong now. He felt that tightness inside briefly (though no pain this time) as she exited the stomach, heading down, and he smiled, getting up and starting to pull the unfinished enclosure apart while he was waiting for her to reach the exit. He had to stop part way through the dismantling to head to the bathroom at the familiar pressure, but sat relaxed on the toilet, then sighed as she popped clear, taking a deep breath of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, enjoy yourself girl?\" He said, peering down as her head popped up into view between his legs, nodding enthusiastically. \"Heh, glad you... OOooh!\" she smiled up at him as she wriggled in and out of his butt, then slowly unhinged her jaws (though at her size that was less necessary now) and sucked his cock up gently. \"Dang, you are way too good to me!\" He muttered leaning back on the john.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny disagreed with that. He'd been way nicer to her than she'd expected. She was just sorry this was the only way she could express this to him.</span></div></div>",

When they met humans they sort of took them under their wing and... sort of educated them. Helped them. But at the same time put loads of rules down about what they shouldn't do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny shook her head as she watched the tall human on the screen with the pointy ears. This was very weird, but looked nice. She didn't understand all that 'Martin,' as her human called himself, was telling her, but it was obviously important to him so she tried to pay attention. She could see it seemed complex. Maybe when she understood things better when she was bigger she'd get it? She hoped so. Politics seemed to not make sense to her, people ordering others around, then quarreling with each other. Maybe. Maybe it was more than that? But she liked this Captain guy, and the... engineer was it? He looked cute with that girl. They looked nice together, though she never seemed to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda nice to chat like this. A lot of my online friends say Enterprise sucks. I say it's the best of them! It's a real shame they didn't finish it properly. The last episode really sucked, as rushed as they were making it. Real shame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may not understand it that well, but she could see it was nice. His friends were obviously stupid! She snuggled into his arm contentedly as the Captain got frustrated at the... Falcon was it? No Vulcan. Yeah Vulcan. She could see why, they were so.. like Martin said; Stuck up. She smiled. She felt Martin's eyes on her and looked up, just catching that perfect gaze of his, She could just fall into those loving eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're amazing. You even like Trek. Heh.\" she smiled up at him and snuggled closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched another of the 'Enterprise' shows then something called 'Discovery' which Martin was less interested in it seemed. He said it was fun, but not really trek. Just didn't feel the same. She thought she saw what he meant. It was all flashy, shiny stuff, and felt different somehow. She couldn't feel that same friendship the Enterprise crew had together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that he carried her with him to the shower and he helped her get clean (though he'd done that earlier after she'd gone through him) and she tried to help him get clean in return. He seemed to like that. After some toweling down (which she only had vague, fuzzy memories from mom on) he carried her back to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made sure he had a fun night. Not that she didn't enjoy it too. He tasted delicious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin woke up slowly, a contented smile on his face, and opened his eyes to Penny's face smiling down at him. She winked at him as she saw that loving look spread over his face. Wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Penny.\" He said, then reached up and pulled her in to kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnake lips were, despite her's being more flexible, not the best to kiss. She could see the slight disappointment, but she just smiled. She knew she'd have girl lips soon enough. Just needed another meal or two, though they'd have to be big ones. Maybe she could handle that big animal across the street now? Probably, though it'd be a bit tight still. Way tighter than the cat. That might be enough on it's own. Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do this morning Penny?\" He smiled, then gasped as she answered him with a gentle tug on his manhood with her tail. \"Oh, you really are a nympho aren't you?\" He said, though the smile obviously meant it was good thing. She just smiled back, not really understanding the word. \"Heh. You don't have to ask permission Penny. I love you doing that! All of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and slid down his body, under the covers, and over his groin. She felt Martin groan in pleasure as she licked across the tip, then more as she sucked it into her maw, reveling in the flavor. Mmmmm! Oh this was so much fun! Though soon she'd be developed enough for PROPER sex! She couldn't wait! She remembered Mom's first time vividly, though Ben had been... awkward later. Still the memory of that first time had stayed with her, despite his idiocy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm, god he tasted so good! She wondered if she tasted as good? She didn't remember mom getting tasted, even slightly, so she had no clue from her inherited memories. Though she swore Martin tasted better to her than any of Mom's boyfriends! Even Penny's dad. Of course she could be biased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt his shudder and his hands clasped tightly on her body and head, pressing her down. She smiled, feeling him squeezing her throat down on his shaft as she pulses, and she squeezed to help, loving it as he held her. She just 'Mmmmed' softly as he jerked into her, her drinking it all delightfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dang. Penny, I gotta do something to repay you for this. Damn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny rolled her eyes. Martin was silly sometimes. This was her giving him back all the love he gave her. Didn't he get that? She sighed as his thighs closed on her body and she wriggled contentedly, just letting him shrink in her mouth, still sucking on him gently, hearing him moan from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the life!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunday morning Penny watched Martin get up and dressed, seeing him glance at her as she traced his naked body across the room with a smile. He stopped with a shirt half on, head poking through the hole staring at her, then shaking his head weirdly. What did he expect? He was cute! Still he headed out for his morning ablutions and she sighed, then started looking around his room. It was full of things that meant a lot to him so she wanted to know more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a few things that looked either 'Enterprise' or something related to that kind of thing there, including a couple of posters on the wall. Mom had posters from her childhood with the Beatles so she knew about that kind of thing.  Ben had hated that somehow, maybe jealous? She didn't know. She never understood that kind of thing. Er, mom never understood. She shook her head. She was still getting sorted out what was her and her mom, but she was getting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid up to his... clothes thing. Um. Dresser, that was what it was called. Slipping up it (and knocking an errant sock off the top, hoping he hadn't left it there on purpose for something) she looked around. There were a couple of little models, looking like... aircraft? She couldn't tell. Maybe spaceships? But they didn't look like those on Enterprise. She shrugged and looked on, and saw a framed photo. Was that a pop star? She didn't think so. Looked too personal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny jerked around at the noise, seeing Martin looking at the photo she'd noticed sadly. She smiled sheepishly, though actually wasn't sure why. Maybe she shouldn't have been looking at this stuff? He didn't seem mad at her though, just sad, though that look at the photo was... longing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at her, then back at the photo as she frowned at him. He shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, that was... a little while ago. Don't worry about it.\" He said and went rummaging for shoes. Penny didn't think it was unimportant, and she DID worry about it. It was obvious he had feelings for the girl. What had happened? Did the girl have to move away or something? She didn't like the thought of him not being with someone he cared for. Maybe she could help? Though at her size... yeah, there wasn't a lot she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he got finished putting shoes on he came up, scooped her gently off the dresser and saw down on the bed, smiling down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So girl, what did you want to do today? You understand I've got to go to work tomorrow, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. Yeah, lots of mom's friends had to go away for most of the time, though when she was young she'd snuck with Ben to his work. While she was still small enough, which was only a couple of times. She smiled, maybe she could do that with Martin tomorrow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tummy gurgled. Maybe not she thought, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hungry huh?\" She looked up as Martin said that, shaking his head. She looked a little abashed, but nodded her head. \"Well... ah, I think another cat might be... awkward.\" For some reason he had an odd expression, slightly worried. She wondered if she'd done something wrong? \"Huh. Well, uh... let me think on that. There must be something we can do. Maybe find somewhere with a rabbit problem or something and you can go nuts.\" He chuckled at that. Rabbits. That didn't mean anything to her. Were they big?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carefully picked her up and carried her over to a desk like thing and sat down there, putting her on the side. He then flicked on a TV screen... oh, no it was a computer. Mom had used those a few times, she thought. Mom's recent memories were a little fuzzy for her though so mostly she remembered stuff from a few decades ago. It was the main reason she didn't really remember anything of Grandma or earlier. Grandma had had kids early, and pretty much all that memory beyond basic stuff like talking was lost on mom. And hence her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin used the computer, and Penny recognized maps, and maybe some other charts, and struggled to make sense of words. She was a little small, and she knew mom had difficulty with written stuff till she got bigger. Something to do with the brain her dad had said once.  She was able to get it though, she just had to re-read stuff a few times. Maybe she was better at it than mom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, how about a petting zoo? Mmmm, maybe not. They'd notice animals going missing. I can't really afford to buy a pet for your every meal... Uh... how about fish? Do you like fish?\" Penny scrunched her muzzle up. Icky things! Slimy and icky. \"Ah, take that as a no. Shame. OK, um... well push comes to shove I could go into the country and find a farm. Uh, bit risky. Maybe we can try something small?\" She didn't want small, though she guessed everything was relative. Depends what he meant. \"Or, we could try some of the roofs in the city. A fair few birds there, though catching them might be another matter.\" She licked her lips. Birds she liked. Not very big though. Maybe a few of them. \"I think that's about all I can think of.\" So girl, anything strike your fancy?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she pondered Martin put up pictures of the possibilities. She knew what a pigeon looked like, lambs... OK, that wasn't what she was thinking of... actually... though she knew the name no image sprang to mind. Blurred memory she guessed. Rabbits she had no clue, but they looked interesting. A bit fluffy for her taste, kinda like that cat, though if they squirmed on the way down she'd be happy. Yeah, rabbits sounded cool, though difficult to tell how large they were from the pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin watched as she lifted up and tapped her muzzle against the screen where the rabbit was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, rabbits it is. Actually that will be a fair bit safer... at least than the petting zoo. I admit I don't think that would be a good idea. Well, lets get you something to eat hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe certainly seemed happy about it. Penny was glad he was helping her out. Ben really hadn't much. Admittedly at first he'd been friendly to mom, but he'd never been good with helping her get food. When you're young you really depend on others like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin got a large bag, cut some holes in the side, saying 'air holes.' She didn't get what he meant at first, then realized it was like a portable home. He'd carry her in it. That was nice of him. He left the top undone but said probably not be a good idea to stick her head out too much. Many people didn't like snakes. She knew from her mom that some didn't, but many? That was a bit depressing! But at least Martin liked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the top a bit more to let her in she became fascinated by the way it sealed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a zipper. Never seen one before?\" Martin said when he noticed her interest. She started shaking her head, but suspected her mom had. She just didn't know. In the end she lifted two coils up to give a kind of shrug. He got the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an interlocking link,\" He said, \"with this curved double track here pushing them together. See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved the 'zipper' back and forth and she saw it locking together. Weird. He spent a few minutes telling her how the two shapes knitted together, and how the zipper parted them by twisting. It was certainly different, and amazing that something so simple looking was actually so complicated. He was watching her though, and as soon as she pulled away he smiled and went back to making the bottom of the bag comfy for her. At least he didn't keep yammering on like Barney had, mom's second boyfriend. That guy had been nice, but... he never got the message when mom wasn't interested in something. Which was difficult as she could speak when she met him! He didn't last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying her to the car carefully she watched as he drove out. Mom had driven, but Penny didn't remember much of it. She knew mom had difficulty with the pedals at first, and she could see why. Not much room to put coils down there. Though Martin seemed to drive with just one foot. Didn't mom drive using two pedals? She didn't quite remember. Have to ask Martin about that when she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went past lots of buildings in the area where he lived, then out into the country, trees sliding by and green hills. It was rather pretty. He soon came to a stop then leaned over the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'm gonna ask if they have a rabbit problem. Be aware there might be dogs around here and...\" He blinked. \"...uh. Don't eat anything other than rabbits Penny. And be careful of the dogs. They could hurt you. And don't eat them either. I think these people would be really annoyed if you ate one of their farm animals or pets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, though sighed. As they'd come in to park she'd seen a big 'dog' on a hill nearby, way bigger than the one across the street from Martin's home. She'd have enjoyed that. Pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately this 'farm' didn't work out. Martin came back a few minutes later and said that yes, they had a rabbit problem, but no, they absolutely refused to have a snake catch their rabbits! Apparently they REALLY didn't like snakes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next four houses were similar, either not having any rabbits or not wanting snakes, no matter how well house trained (Penny did kinda feel annoyed at that, but knew Martin just didn't want to admit she was intelligent), and they kept on moving. However at the next house Martin came back to the car with a smile and Penny knew she was going to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Apparently the father is not personally too keen, but not averse to snakes, but the son really likes them. You don't mind if he pets you do you?\" She shook her head with a smile. \"Try not to over-react if he gets a little heavy handed, but also try not to provoke him.\" She raised an eyebrow and tapped her side, hard, with her tail. \"OK, I know you seem tough, but you're still small. Be careful, OK?\" He had a point, and she nodded sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was taken into the house and set on a table. The house was wooden built and looked a bit old. Nice though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, a snake!\" Penny's eyes got real big as a little boy ran up to her and fumbled clumsily with her head sticking out of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micheal! Be careful lad!\" Came from the boy's father by the door. Penny wasn't good at ages, but the kid must be pretty young. Less than ten, which for humans was very young. He seemed eager, and she was careful (she didn't want the kid to poke her in the eye or anything) but preened into his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK Mr Cartright. She's well trained, but please Micheal, be gentle, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, mister.\" Michael said, though it didn't look like he was really listening. He didn't seem too rough though, so Penny let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny actually liked the attention, licking the boys fingers a few times. Yup, he was tasty. But the father stopped the petting fairly soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, now run along Micheal, the snake has work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, dinner time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately it was not immediately dinner time. The farmer didn't know where the rabbits were, or he would have dealt with them. Thus she had to hunt. But, as she slithered after one she found they were pretty dumb critters and didn't find it too hard to follow one of the fuzzy things then find the burrow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She checked out several entrances to the burrow, just to be sure, then watched carefully. Unfortunately the openings were too far apart for her to stretch between two, let alone more. But she readied herself to go to a nearby entrance, while poised with a rock near another one. She quickly rolled the rock into the entrance, then shot over to the first one she she'd found. At least two rabbits shot out other holes and vanished into the bushes, but she caught one trying to get out of the one she headed for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, yummy, despite the fluffiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit was small, and she gulped it down in literally a second, then dove into the hole. It was a mad dash through tunnels, and a few rabbits got out. Unfortunately, even with as few that got away she finished up with only a handful, maybe six more at most, from the burrow, and rabbits weren't as big as she'd hoped. A hair smaller than that cat. With all of them it was a nice meal, but not what she was hoping for. There was no way this would get her an adult body. But she would grow a lot. That was something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cartrights were appreciative, and offered Martin to join them for lunch. Especially as he didn't charge them for the service, claiming Penny got a meal out of it and that was enough. The meal was just the farmer and his son and Penny wondered what happened to the child's mom. They didn't mention it. Micheal did have fun petting her through the meal, though the father did look a tad nervously at her throughout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done Martin brought her back in the car and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, didn't know there were people that nice any more. So many wouldn't offer that to a stranger, no matter how we'd helped! Too much worry over serial killers and the like these days.\" She wasn't sure she knew what that meant, and from the sound of it probably didn't want to know. \"Anyway, you look full.\" He said, gently patting one of the rabbit bulges. Full? Hardly. Not even close, but it was a nice meal. It'd take at least three or four like that to get her to her full size she thought. Hopefully she could just find a bigger meal next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin seemed happy as he drove home and she snuggled up against him, feeling the rabbits squirm inside her nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Martin locked the door behind him and carried a much heavier Penny to the kitchen table. Dang that snake liked to eat! He wasn't sure why he was so happy helping her feed like this. But she definitely seemed appreciative. As he put the bag down he noticed something on the floor. Reaching down he picked up a short little translucent string of... oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yours Penny?\" He said with a smile, holding up the snake skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny rose up out of the bag, saw the shed skin and chuckled. Yeah. As he looked it was hard to image that yesterday she'd fit in this skin. It was barely a foot long, and now she was over two and a half foot long... and bulging with rabbit now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, guess you'll be shedding again as you grow if this is any indication.\" She nodded. \"Hmm.. how do you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny pondered, but couldn't think of a way to explain about her mom's memories just yet. So she shrugged. With a chuckle he lifted her out of the bag then put it away in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter them both being out and about (and her squirming all over the dirt) they shared a shower, much to both's enjoyment. Though he didn't taste as good down there when that clean oddly. She didn't mind, it was fun and he was definitely playful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the afternoon he went on the computer and was looking at things Penny didn't really understand. Mostly due to them being mainly words. She still had difficulty with words. She could feel herself tiring as her body started dealing with her meal, but wanted to be around Martin so mentally put it off a bit, feeling her body begin to speed back up again, it's meal delayed. She slid up and curled in his lap once she felt awake enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello Penny? I'm sorry, I thought you'd want some time to yourself after a meal like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response she just snuggled up against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. Guess not huh. Fair enough. Hang on a sec.\" He used the 'mouse' and played around with things on the screen until he was satisfied, then switched off the monitor and turned back, looking down at her affectionately, gently tracing a hand down her head. \"There, all done. So, what did you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny rolled her eyes, then slid her head down into his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooookay! Oh dang!\" He muttered, undoing his trousers to give her more room. \"Gnnn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuggled in, slurping him up gently, tasting him to the fullest. Definitely tastier than in the shower. She felt him jerk rather quickly this time, and gulped it down. Heh, he was eager today. Nice. He let her snuggle in his pants for a few minutes then drew her out gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang. I don't know what I did to deserve someone like you, but I'm glad you want to be here. Thank you Penny.\" He brought her up and nuzzled her muzzle with his nose. Heh, that was cute. \"I just wish I could return the favor.\" Penny sighed, then waggled her eyebrows and lifted her tail tip up to his lips. \"Oh right. You really get off on that don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took several deep breaths, then slowly sucked on her tail and she sighed as he began to gently gulp. It seemed way easier now, her sliding down quite easily and... She felt a bump, looked up and saw Martin had a panicked look on his face, this throat muscles contracting and spasming awkwardly. Was he choking on her her? Then her eyes fell on why she'd felt a bump. The lump of a rabbit in her tummy bumping against Martin's lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoops!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin hadn't thought of it either, but now... Penny knew he couldn't swallow that! That was way too.... And he gulped. Automatically it seemed from his expression. Her eyes rolled up as his throat gripped her delightfully. His hands scrabbled at her body, but didn't grip tight, seemingly worried about hurting her. His throat didn't seem to be complying with him and Penny felt herself slide in deeper, his jaws opening around the still struggling bulge of the bunny! Oh Martin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw him wince, strain, then slowly, oh so slowly, the bulge went in. Wait, he was managing it? She felt the incredible tightness as his throat worked, his teeth scraping over her bulging scales and she leaned in, gently patting him on the head with a coil, staring into his eyes, giving him encouragement. From the look he seemed to appreciate it, though he was still panicking a bit. Then another gulp and the lump shot down! Hah! He'd done it! She felt the lump of rabbit slide tightly into his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the next lump hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh this was going to be a challenge wasn't it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Oh god! Martin struggled, holding on mostly by the endearing look of affection and support from Penny. She patted him on the back of his head, and he could see her attempting to ignore the sensations his throat were giving her (she REALLY liked that he knew), and focused on helping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second bulge was easier, though he tried to throw up. Somehow he just couldn't. Every attempt he made to hurk her up he either felt his throat clench awkwardly, or he thought he caught a wince from Penny and stopped. He couldn't hurt her! Honestly, he might be imagining the latter, as she seemed very tough. Heck, his teeth had bit pretty hard on that first bulge, and she hadn't even flinched! Still, he tried to go as easy as he could on her, but was worried what this was doing to his jaws and throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he felt the smaller second bulge slide tightly down into his throat and he relaxed a bit, though the next one hit pretty quick. And was bigger! Quite a bit bigger! Penny nudged his head up, and got him staring back into her eyes rather than on the meal, then she looped  that coil from behind his head down over the bulge before his lips and squeezed as tightly as she could, smooshing it down. He actually saw the lump struggle inside her, the rabbit actually still alive! That caught him, but she managed to squeeze and reposition it inside her enough to slide in a little easier, still wriggling inside her weirdly. It was a struggle to fit in all the same and he felt his jaw muscles or tendons, or whatever, complaining loudly. This was painful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two bulges were smaller, and with her squeezing they actually slid in easily. No pain at all. His eyes still watering he managed a weak smile, but then as she slid in further she was running out of spare coils to squeeze with, and he had to manage on his own. He tried to push them together with his hands, but he just didn't have her strength to do much. Number six was smallish, and with some straining he managed to get it down, but his stomach was already complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the last one, number seven came on. This was bigger, about the same size as the third one, but this time Penny couldn't squeeze to help! He struggled, heaving, but it didn't help, and he felt something tearing in his jaw. Eye's watering he struggled not to show it, but he could see the look of anquish on Penny's face as she slipped ever deeper. As that massive bulge forced it's way in, his head getting dizzy from lack of air, she reached up, nudging muzzle with his nose as she he done earlier, and staring into his eyes. Her eyes were pretty, and this close he could tell they weren't cat's eyes. More like snake eyes but more rounded. More human like. He could even see some white around the outside. Snakes didn't have that did they? He actually managed to smile around her as that huge wriggling rabbit finally entered his throat. Painful as it was he managed to not show it, just staring into her eyes, then she nodded slowly, dipped her head back gracefully, and her head slid into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clutched his stomach awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh 'eck!\" he managed, his belly feeling like it was going to burst! \" 'Oo O'a i' 'ere 'Enny?\" He managed, massaging his jaw and trying not to move it too much. Yeah, something was definitely torn. Damn that hurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tap from his tummy made him look down, wincing slightly at the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'u... 'on 'ap 'or 'es... 'wo 'or 'o?\" he said, then realized how unintelligible he was right now. One for yes, two for now... then she tapped again. He checked by tapping once... then twice on his belly, and got a single tap back. Yeah, he was pretty sure that was what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully he moved to his bed, undid his trousers fully (they were WAY too tight right now and just painful), and pulled his shirt off, laying down carefully with some wincing. He tasted blood in his mouth, and for a moment feared it was Penny's but soon found it was from the inside of his jaw. Yeah. He'd really hurt himself. He'd have to go to the hospital... what would he say? This was stupid! Oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared down at his belly, still squirming slightly with Penny and rabbits. Yeah, she'd have to come out first. There was no way he was letting a doctor mess with her! He'd never see Penny again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting he attempted to just let his stomach expand and relax, though that didn't seem to work well. It was just too tight, too full. Then Penny found the exit. She left the stomach slowly, but that didn't hurt. It actually felt a relief as the tightness relaxed. The bulges going out did pinch a tiny bit, but surprisingly not as much as he'd thought, and soon she was wriggling through his intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his stomach felt stable again he slowly got to his feet and headed for the bathroom. Getting her out was... not as bad as her going in, but not nice. Think the most massive constipation you've ever had. Yeah. Though at least she helped and was gentle. Afterwards they showered, and hugged, and Martin said he was sorry. He didn't mean to do that. She just shaking her head emphatically and pointing to herself. Yeah, like she was to blame! He should have realized. He was the one planning that rabbit meal for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really winced every time he tried to speak, his voice really bad obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'ook. 'Enny, I' 'onna 'ake 'ome 'ain'illers.\" He managed. \" 'o 'a 'ly 'eep 'e e 'e 'ing. a'ay\" He gently stroked the side of her head. \" 'on't 'ame' our' 'ef. 'Ot 'our 'ault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe said, seeing wetness in her eyes. Snakes could cry? He shook his head, sniffing himself. Why hadn't he thought of the rabbits when she tried to go in his mouth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes. Yes it is!' she thought to herself as she watched him slip into bed, still in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could she do that to him? And he wouldn't even blame her for what she'd done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurling at the foot of his bed, sniffing to herself sadly, she looked up as he got comfortable. She had to do something to make up for this. But what could she do? Her eyes gazed around the room, searching for something to help with. Maybe she could make a meal for him? She was still small, but she remembered Mom making some human food before. She wasn't great at it, but good enough. It'd have to be soft with his jaws hurt like that, but maybe that would help? Um, maybe she could just make him happier, to take his mind off the pain? Would he want sex right now? She wasn't sure. But she could try?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked up on the dresser, to that picture that Martin had looked so longingly at before. Maybe she could help get this 'Jenny' back again for him?</span></div></div>",

She found that picture again and looked at it. The girl was pretty, long black hair, sweet looking eyes. No wonder Martin liked her. She felt her stomach trying to kick in again. She couldn't put this off much longer. But what should she do? She reached up and pulled the picture frame to her. It took a little fiddling but she managed to slide the picture out of the frame with her tail jaws and tongue. She hoped her spit wouldn't matter on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the back, just like with some of Mom's photos, there was a name; Jennifer Hadley, and an address. She could go there! Maybe persuade.. *Yaawn* her to come back to him? Oh dang she was tired. Too much food, put off for too long. Maybe just a little nap?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny woke up much later, morning light streaming in the window. She looked down at the small picture in her coils, thankfully that hadn't crushed it in her sleep, and sighed. Well, she was bigger now. Nearly five foot long, though still light weight compared to what she'd be as an adult. If she was anything like mom she'd be over twelve foot long, 'standing' about as tall as a human when she lifted her body up. When she got a proper body that was. Right now she was still a snake, though when she looked in the dresser mirror she was happy to see her eyes now looked fully human. That was nice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to show Martin... and realized he was still asleep. He'd slept all evening, night, and now morning! Should she wake him? Didn't he have work today? He moaned in his sleep. Best let him sleep and heal. Hopefully he'd be better when he woke up later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny looked down at herself. She was big enough now, though still she couldn't talk and still she hadn't developed her adult form yet. There was no way she could persuade Jenny to come here without talking. Maybe bring her and ask permission later? Didn't mom say it was always better to do that? She vaguely thought so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still morning, just daybreak so... this time of year probably six O'clock. She had no idea when Martin should go to work, but she hoped he wouldn't be in trouble. Didn't work give time off for being sick? Well he definitely was! Holding the picture gently she went down the dresser leg and headed to a bookshelf. She wanted to find a map, but had difficulty. Mom's house always had a big map book. Um. What was it called? Some big word. Anyway, if she could compare the name on the picture she could see where Jenny lived. She seemed a little better at reading than last night, but didn't want to risk trying to memorize the address. She wasn't that good yet. No big map book could be found though, but she did find a little road map book and that at least helped. She found a match to the address for Jenny and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she had to find where she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end she, a bit nervously, picked out Martin's wallet and brought his driver's license out. That had his address on it and she traced the path on the mini map book. It was a bit less than a mile away. A long way to slither, but she could manage, besides it was still early. Maybe she could make good time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny made sure to put the map away, then go up to the dresser and carefully put the photo back in the frame. That was trickier. Her tail and tongue were larger this morning! Eventually though she was done and she went over to stroke Martin's forehead. He was hot! Oh she hoped he was alright!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's OK. I'm gonna bring someone to help you.' she thought at him. Not that he could have heard her even if he'd been awake, but it was the thought that counted, right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Penny might have overestimated her memory. She really should have brought that little map with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlithering along the roadside, in the brush to make sure she was out of sight, she kept going. Every now and then she found a road sign. It was still a struggle, but at least she could make the words out a little better now. Took her a minute to grasp each roadsign, but her memory of which road was which was still good enough. It'd been half an hour so far but she wasn't lost. Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept on going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearly an hour later that she arrived. She normally could have managed it in way under half that time, but awkward twists and turns, stopping to read roadsigns, it all slowed her down. At least she thought she could get back quickly. She knew the way now. She double checked the letterbox and it said 'Hadley residence' so this was the place. Sneaking through the fence she headed carefully inside the yard, wary if the place had any dogs. Martin seemed to think they were a risk to her, and she wasn't certain they wouldn't be. However nothing showed up and she slid up to the wall. Carefully she peeked up over the window sill and looked in on a dining room, empty. Huh, that was no good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to the left and tried again, finding a kitchen with a woman working at a sink. Probably Jennifer's mom. Penny tried three other windows but nothing else showed any other people. What she did find was an open window. There was a screen on it, but she managed to push the area where the latch was on the other side on the left, then on the right, enough to push the screen out and slither inside. It was tight, she was getting too big for this kind of thing. That made her remember what she'd done to Martin and wince. Oh she really had to make that up to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the screen back and locked it in place first, then slowly slithered behind a sofa towards the sounds of the kitchen, just to be sure the mother wasn't coming this direction. She wasn't, still working at the sink by the looks of it. Also some bubbling on the stove indicated she was cooking too. Likely busy for a while then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, having seen in on all the downstairs rooms through windows already she carefully went to the stairs, trying to avoid the kitchen. Navigating the stairs at least wasn't hard at her current size, and when up there were three doors. One proved to be an empty bedroom, probably the mothers. The second was a bathroom, and the third.. before she opened the door Penny heard faint breathing. Sounded like Jenny was asleep. Penny glanced out a window at the sun rising in the sky. Well, it was before eight AM, maybe a little early, but didn't Jenny have work or school to go to? University probably as Penny thought she would likely be too old for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging mentally she gently opened the door with her mouth and tail, and slid inside. Thankfully the door didn't squeak. She found the room white walls and ceiling and almost everything else pink. The furniture, the drapes even the bed. Under the pink comforter she could make out Jenny's sleeping face. Definitely the right place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now what? She'd aimed to just haul her back and ask questions later, but though Penny was larger, she wasn't that much larger. This girl was almost as tall as she was long! She didn't think she could wrap her up in her coils and snakehandle her all the way home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Penny pondered. She could risk trying to get Jennifer's attention. She even saw a scrabble board in the corner, but Martin had been worried over how people would react to snakes. She wanted to bring Jennifer to him, not have her scream and try to stomp on her or something! She worried, her mind going back and forth, now beginning to worry if he was alright back there alone. Maybe she should just bring Jennifer back to help him? But... oh, if she didn't believe Penny would be in trouble AND Martin would still be sick! All she wanted was to make things better for him, maybe get Jenny and Martin back together again. He'd like that wouldn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up. There was no way she could carry this girl back home. True she was under five foot, but Penny just didn't have enough coils to hold her. Not even close! The only way she could HOPE to carry her was... She smiled. In her tummy! Ooh, naughty. She blinked. Er, would Martin approve? She wouldn't hurt the girl, but... yeah probably she would be scared... if she was awake... Well, she'd just have to be sure she didn't wake up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfied smile Penny carefully slid up to the pink bed and reared up, slithering under covers towards the foot of the bed, happy to discover Jenny slept in the nude. Clothes didn't taste good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny slowly roused from a weird dream about some exotic holiday, her swimming in hot ocean, then kneaded by masseuse. She smiled, still mostly asleep as a wet pressure rose across her midriff, just cresting her breasts, which were slightly squeezed by something shifting around her. Whatever it was gently nudged her in, and that wetness spread over them tightly. In fact she felt really tight everywhere. Blearily she blinked, not really fully awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhmm?\" She muttered, looking up at the inside of her covers. She'd slipped down in the bed? Huh that didn't happen often...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she found she couldn't move her arms, pressed warmly to her sides. What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pondered that something slid wetly under the back of her head, and something else dark slipped over her face. She twisted to one side, a pang of worry starting, but then the darkness enveloped her, the soft surface pressing down on her face. Turning with a gasp she got a breath to the side in a gap in... whatever it was..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What's going on?\" She said, starting to really worry. She couldn't move her entire body at all! Then the tightness rippled over her, from her shoulders all the way to her toes, sending a shiver of emotion through her, which she had already in abundance from the exotic, and somewhat erotic, dream she'd had. The crack her face was out of moved up and something squeezed over her face with a squelch again. She gasped, tipping her head back, and saw a small opening above her to the dim light coming through the covers, which then closed abruptly before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOO!\" She yelled, but it sounded muffled around her, and there was only a small gap in front of her face as she tipped back. Everywhere else was kneaded and squeezed by warm wet.... Flesh? Her eyes went wide. She'd been eaten! She screamed again, and the pressure around her lessened, the rippling (as nice as it was, despite the horror of her situation), slowing and stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay there in the dark, feeling soft yielding pressure all around her, her pulse hammering in her ears rapidly. A slight cool breeze came down from above. The... mouth that had eaten her? This wasn't possible! Was this flesh, or was her mind playing tricks on her? She was gasping for breath, but the gap above opened briefly and more cool air flooded in. She gasped, but it closed once more, and then she felt things shift. Her whole body twisted from side to side, the moist prison squirming around her as it moved. It was an undulating motion left to right in ripples like... like a snake! Oh god, she'd been eaten by a snake! But... why was she so aroused? Her mind span in circles, terror and arousal fighting in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five or ten minutes she managed to get her breathing under control (sort of) though she was shaking still and that.... feeling rose over her every time this thing's innards squished over her! She blushed fiercely as her body betrayed her, but she couldn't... no. This was... impossible! The thing twisted and turned, reared up a couple of times, bent down, moved all over the place and kept on going. But after maybe ten more minutes her panic started to die down. She somehow was still breathing, cool air coming from above somehow, and it wasn't squeezing her to death. This didn't exactly thrill her though, as it just meant she'd.... oh god. She was going to be digested alive! Shivering inside, the aroused thoughts lost to the terror she shivered.</span></div></div>",

She had no idea whether she could help Martin or not, but the girl's reaction to her eating her had been sheer terror. It had started so well, and from the taste and few moans it had looked like Jennifer was enjoying being swallowed. Then when she awoke... yeah, not good. Martin would never forgive her for this! She just knew it! But he needed help! If... if he never spoke to her again... she'd... *sniff* accept it. If only Jennifer could help him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl did stop screaming after a while. Early on Penny considered taking her back and throwing her up, but then... Martin wouldn't get help and Penny'd just be locked up! No, better get this over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally slithering up to Martin's door she checked nobody was looking and opened it and slid in, her body hugely stretched with the massive bulk of the woman inside her. She headed to his bedroom, but stopped and got a scrabble board out. Penny might not be able to talk, but that scrabble board at Jennifer's had given her an idea on how to communicate. Might need two to get enough letters though. Thankfully Martin had two such games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer was currently just sobbing, wondering why she wasn't dead yet. She wasn't crushed. She was still breathing. And the stomach was still... not burning. She didn't want to think too hard on the alternative. She didn't understand it, but then felt motions stop a few times, only minor motions from her... she shivered... predator. Then those ripples started again, in reverse! She blinked as she rose a few inches slowly, squeezed upwards, the heat rising from the weird sensations once more. She tried to ignore that, but it was hard. Slowly she felt herself rise, then coolness hit her in the face as the mouth widened before her. Tears of joy coming to her eyes. She was going to live, she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out of the jaws of the creature that had eaten her she saw the floor of a room. On the floor were scrabble letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Martin needs help hes hurting please help jennifer'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular contractions pleasantly raising her had stopped so she just stared at the words. Then a snake tail curled into view and pointed at the letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" she gasped, this whole thing so strange she just couldn't wrap her mind around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the squeezing started again and she moaned as she was kneaded upwards and outwards. Shuddering she tried to ignore it as she was disgorged awkwardly onto the floor. This was far too erotic for her terror and relief flooded mind to grasp, but she panted through the weird sensations and finally landed with a moist thud on the floor, cold, wet and... recognizing the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith shivering muscles she lifted herself on her elbows, then slowly turned around. Behind her was an impossibly small snake that... looked apologetic. She gaped at it. That little thing had eaten her? No... it couldn't be! It wouldn't meet her gaze, but the little she saw it's eyes looked... very un-snake-like. Almost human! It definitely looked embarrassed or maybe ashamed would be a better description. How did a snake have expressions like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin liked snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought rose in her mind abruptly. It was one of the things she'd hated about him, that and his obsession about all that space stuff. Yup, this was Martin's room. His bedroom and... She heard a pained moan. Slowly she got to her knees, still shaking, and peered into the bed. Martin was there asleep, a pained expression on his face. Automatically she put her hand to his head, and felt him hot to the touch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Martin! I gotta get help!\" She heard a sigh of relief and turned to give an amazed look at the source of the sound; the snake. \"You... brought me here to help him?\" It nodded and her eyes got larger. \"You... you ATE ME!\" She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnngh!\" Martin moaned and slowly opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M.. Martin? Are you OK?\" She said, still staring at the snake out of the corner of her eye. It seemed thoroughly ashamed of itself, sort of sunken in on itself, it's head pointing to the floor dejectedly. What was that thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J... Jenny?\" He said, blinking and coughing, staring up her, then down, and his eyes suddenly became really big. \"Y... you're... naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jenny went bright red. She'd never let him see her like this before, and she covered her breasts, shivering, then turned glaring daggers at the snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Your snake brought me here!\" She said acidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P.. Penny? How, she's tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny blinked. Penny? The snake was a girl? She realized part of what she'd been just mad at was that the thing had got off on tasting her naked body, but if it was a girl snake.... wait, what was she thinking? It was a snake! It wasn't interested in people! She glared at it again anyway. It HAD eaten her! She blinked. It had eaten her then carried her back to Martin's place. What, it used it's stomach to carry people or something? What kind of freak snake was this? Then she recognized the look on Martin's face when he looked over to the female snake. It was... like he used to look at her. Somehow she found she was blinking back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's... not so tiny.\" She said, looking at the snake that was longer than she was, though still so think she couldn't believe it had eaten her. And now maybe it was... her replacement! What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungh. Last night's meal. She grew. I... I... Gnnnn.\" He groaned, and at his pained sounds she leaned over him, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Martin! Let me call the hospital!\" She said, the weird snake/girlfriend forgotten for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and dashed to the phone, not noticing both Penny's and Martin's eyes trace her naked bottom avidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"911? Yes, I have an emergency a... friend of mine is sick. Very sick. I need help. He's burning up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her Penny settled down, both sad and glad. She'd got help for Martin, but she suspected her time with him was over. She was so hoping not to have to go find another boyfriend like Mom had to. And.. he was so right for her! She sniffed sadly. As long as he was going to be OK.</span></div></div>",

Penny blinked, Jenny just looking somewhat confused at the moment. The girl liked being swallowed. She might not even consciously realize it right now, but Penny was sure of it. She glanced at the scrabble letters. Probably not a good idea to bring that up though. Given her reaction to it earlier she might... well, over-react now. Besides there were more important matters.

Jenny stared back with a grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny raised an eyebrow surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because Martin cares about it and he cares for you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He kept your photo and still misses you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny glanced briefly up at the Dresser. It seems she'd already seen the photo, but she still bit her lip and stared at it for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I'm blaming you for the lost hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Forty five minutes but fine.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, you're pedantic like him too!\" She said, but got off the floor and headed to the living room. Penny followed, but brought the Scrabble letters in a bag. She might need to explain some things. She kept the remote control handy and made sure to pick an episode focusing on Trip and T'pol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the credits rolled Jenny sat back with a grumpy expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, no. Still don't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But you admit it is like those show about relationships.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I guess, but still it's just too weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You at least understand why he likes it the complexity and emotion.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are really weird you know.\" She said staring down at Penny on the Sofa beside her. \"I don't know anyone else that has tried to make me think scifi is a soap opera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny didn't know what a soap opera was, but assumed it was another relationship based thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Im a Slithala of course im weird.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were a snake?\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We look like snakes when young half snake half girl when older.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm not quite there yet.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's eyes got really wide at that, staring oddly at Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Martin know this yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I couldnt tell him as i only learned to use letters after I grew last.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was just after this whole problem with his throat.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the first you've spoken to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny looked oddly at the scrabble letters, thinking 'spoken' is probably the wrong term, but she didn't think Jenny would appreciate being corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes you are I want to talk to Martin and he knows I can think.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But I couldnt figure out a way to talk before'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Letters didnt make sense then.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny squinted at Penny, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger brain huh?\" She said. Probably right Penny thought, and she nodded after a half shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bigger everything otherwise I couldnt have eaten you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was kinda using it to gauge Jenny's response, and wasn't disappointed. She shivered, but Penny could swear she looked slightly aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't remind me! Surely you could have found another way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny rolled her eyes yet again. She was doing that a lot with Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh right you would have been fine with a snake barging in and pushing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Scrabble letters around wouldnt you not going to stomp me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'before reading oh no never think of it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to be sarcastic!\" Jenny retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The only other thing I could think of was to wrap you in my coils.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And carry you back but I just wasnt big enough.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would have been almost as scary!\" Jenny said, glaring at Penny. \"Couldn't you have put a note under the door before I saw you or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I didnt consider that but it wouldnt work I cant write.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sliding scrabble letters under the door would not work.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... So you say.\" Jenny said, then sighed. \"Look, I get it, you like him and you wanted to get help, but there had to be a better way than eating me alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Penny could swear Jenny looked a little flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If there was I couldnt see it sorry.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny glanced up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck, you could have sent me an email or chat or something. Can't you work a keyboard?\" Jenny said, waving at Martin's computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny blinked, groaned and slapped herself in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I didnt think of it I had seen him write messages I might be able to.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered, then shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'sorry but would have been message from Martin.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Would you have answered.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... possibly.\" Jenny said, then sighed. \"OK, probably not quickly.\" She sighed again, but more sadly. \"I hope he's OK. Despite me not being his girlfriend, no matter what you think, I still don't want him to be in pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny smiled and rested her tail on Jenny's shoulder, patting her gently. The girl looked askew at her, but didn't object at least. That was an improvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough if Jenny wasn't Martin's girlfriend then when he kicked Penny out for what she'd done he'd have nobody! She didn't want him to be lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like she could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin's phone, Jennifer speaking. Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny grinned and covered the phone with her hand, nodding at the phone as she looked at Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin!\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, Penny figured that out. She kept her expression calm at least. Martin carried on while Jenny messed with the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing there? Wait, you mean that wasn't a dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny suddenly blushed remembering what Martin had seen after Penny coughed her up naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you were pretty out of it. I'm sure you might not remember everything right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny rolled her eyes. Why Jenny was so embarrassed about her body she hadn't a clue. Martin must have seen it when they were together, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Jenny. I... Honestly I'm not sure.\" Yeah, he seemed a little out of it.\"I was actually ringing.... Oh god I'm an idiot. She couldn't answer the phone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny frowned, then glared at Penny. She held the phone out melodramatically, mouthing 'It's for you.' Penny stuck her tongue out at her in reply. With similar retort Jenny switched the phone to speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well not yet apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny sighed and started to get the scrabble set out. Jenny shook her head and reached over, turning on Martin's monitor, brought up notepad and pointed at the keyboard. With a smile Penny slid up and tested the keyboard out. She had to do it one letter at a time but it was quicker than scrabble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she can hear you now anyway. You're on speaker.\" She peered at the screen. \"And she says she hopes you are well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin's voice back was irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't joke Jenny, she's important to me OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not joking. She's typing... slowly... on your computer. God, even I can type faster than that!\" Penny stuck her tongue out again, and Jenny responded with the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny can type?\" Martin sounded pretty shocked, and Penny could understand why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She says 'Grew bigger, now can understand words more. Couldn't before.' Yeah, well she certainly is big, she had to be to e.... er... well, she's big.\" Yeah, the girl wasn't mentioning the fact that she ate Jenny. Penny was glad, but he'd have to know sooner or later. She couldn't go on pretending. Better get it over with now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying that!\" Jenny squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Martin said on the phone. Jenny glared at Penny, who just looked sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She... says she's sorry she ate me. And she isn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere it came. He'd be dumping her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She ate me, what about that don't you understand Martin. She's a snake... well, Slithy thingy. Whatever.\" Penny typed her species out properly. \"Er, Slithala Penny says. If that's how you pronounce that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not a snake?\" Martin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, and you being the expert huh?\" Jenny said, then glared at Penny as she tapped desk, typing 'Don't insult him!' \"Yeah, she said she's a girl snake thingy. Or will be when she grows up. Heh, sounds like your girlfriend is underage.\" Then she gaped as Penny typed 'Three'. \"Three? You're three years old?\" Penny typed more. \"Three DAYS old? Oh my god! Talk about robbing the cradle!\" Penny just looked cross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three days? Damn, she must have just been born when I found her.\" Martin said, and Penny chuckled as he didn't seem to react as Jenny expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... well... She says she's nearly adult. How the heck does that work? Three days old an adult?\" She paused while Penny typed. \"OK, I know you said nearly. Don't be so picky!\" More typing. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin interrupted at the odd pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, she says she has her mom's memories.\" She said in an odd tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, is she a hive mind or is it like Goa'uld genetic memories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny blinked, and slowly smiled. Martin understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She says... the latter she thinks. Sort of. But not recent memories. God can't you just text him? I hate being this translator for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck, I'm gonna be in here a while so you'll have to look after her for me.\" Martin said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell no! I'm not babysitting a snake for you! This is you getting back at me for the ponies isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I kinda came around on that. You got me interested in them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say what? You're watching MLP now?\" Penny wondered what they were talking about, but focused on the main issue to her at least, typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He can text me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he can text you.\" Then turning back to the phone. \"And no I'm not looking after her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny typed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It'll only be a few days till I grow. If I get a big meal maybe just one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what, you'll turn into a pumpkin?\" She giggled..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny sighed, then typed the OTHER main thing on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Uh Penny wants to know what the doctors said. Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. That's kinda weird. I'm on observation to see if anything else is wrong, probably for a week at least, and I've got bloodwork going, but my jaw is fine. Better than new apparently. I know I was bleeding but somehow it all healed before I got to hospital. They say it looks like I have a nasty infection, but they'll know more when the bloodwork comes back. I'm on antibiotics right now. And other stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not baby sitting your snake for a week Martin! You can't make me!\" Jenny said, her tone rising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then bring her to me. I miss her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny blinked. He did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jenny said, catching Penny's lost look. \"Oh, love sick idiot. Of course he wants you! He's a horny guy! I heard what you said Penny. Er, read. Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Martin said shocked. \"She told you about the blowjobs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's eyes suddenly got really wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god you're a pervert! She's a freaking snake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Slithala.' Penny typed almost automatically, a silly smile on her face. Martin still wanted her!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Martin unfortunately had to wait a little while. It had been awkward on Monday apparently, so they caught visiting hours on Tuesday afternoon instead. When the door finally opened (and this time wasn't a nurse or doctor) he smiled to see his ex girlfriend carrying a heavy looking bag. Well, wheeling it. It was a travel bag with one of those extendable handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you just have to be on the third floor?\" She said with a glare, but her gaze softened. She left the bag by the door and leaned over the bed, hugging him. He was not surprised she didn't kiss him. \"How're you doing Martin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, surprisingly OK actually. The medications they've got me under seem to be hitting me pretty hard, but the infection so far seems not to be too bad for whatever reason.\" He caught Penny's head, larger than he remembered sure enough, poking out of the bag cautiously, then nudging the door shut so she could come out unseen. \"I'm glad the two of you could make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny glanced over her shoulder and sighed, shaking her head at the snake.... Slithali, or whatever Penny was. This was all so awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two start making mad passionate love I'm leaving, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a soft beep and he saw his phone held up by Penny who had apparently been using it to type as she slithered up onto Martin's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sure? You can join in if you like? I'm sure he'd like that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin bit his tongue, but thankfully Jenny fixed her glare solely on Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to say this one more time. NO. Not now, not ever. I am not going to be part of some little harem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How about a big one?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin snorted at that, unable to help himself. He shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know she's just trolling you Jenny? Give it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sighed and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now you have a snake prankster to make my life hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is it working?' Penny typed, only half understanding what they were saying, but it sounded fun. And she was fairly sure Martin had meant that Penny was not serious. She had been. She didn't see why Jenny couldn't enjoy being with Martin too. He obviously liked her so why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...\" Martin said suppressing a smirk, \"... as I said I appear to be healthy. Sort of. Whatever this infection is the doctors are worried about, but so far hasn't been affecting me... unless the symptoms only showed up after the docs started their treatment. I kinda assumed it was all from the drugs but... meh, could be wrong I guess.\" He frowned. \"Um... Penny? This may sound silly, but are your species magic in any way, or have any weird abilities? Say something that might have healed my mouth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... or like eating unsuspecting people alive?\" Jenny said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My mom didn't know of any, or at least directly, and nothing that might have helped your mouth. She did however meet someone who was a scientist who claimed that the rate our young grow at should be impossible normally. It's almost like when we're young we absorb all our food and turn it into our bodies, which this guy said was unprecedented. I'm not sure if that classifies as 'magic' but that's all I know.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you know more about your own species?\" Jenny said with a snort. \"I mean didn't your mom tell you anything about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny seemed to pull back in herself slowly before answering, typing with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I never met her. I hatched shortly before Martin found me. My mom didn't know her mother either, though her mom had her young and not a lot of memories carried over as recent ones don't carry to young. I'm not sure if that was usual or not. Perhaps we just lost a load of our culture.' She stopped, tail paused over the phone for a few seconds, staring through the device, miles away. Finally she looked up at Martin. 'Honestly, I have wondered about that, and so did mom a bit when she was younger. I have no idea why mom didn't stick around for my hatching, or her mother for her's either. Maybe it was different reasons? Maybe it's something inherent in us? Maybe it's why Martin found my egg in the middle of nowhere. What that means I don't know.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin leaned up and gently stroked the side of Penny's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Penny. I didn't even think of that. I hope your mom's OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you Martin. Maybe I'll find her someday?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Well if you ever have kids I hope we can raise them together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny peered at the two lovebirds as they stared into each other's eyes, and found that watching them wasn't as cringing as she had expected. And that there was also some pangs of jealousy in her too. She'd dumped him ages ago, but still.... No. She'd got rid of him for a reason. Now at least he had someone... or something, to take care of him. As much as she didn't want to stay with him she still felt something for him and certainly didn't want him to be unhappy. Probably. She was a snake after all! That was just weird!</span></div></div>",

She was far more worried about Martin, even if he seemed to be OK right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How bad was it before?' she typed nervously, having to nod to the phone to drag Martin's attention from her eyes. 'Before you got to the hospital? Was it just bleeding? Did you feel dizzy, or headaches or anything?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry about me.\" He said, then saw her frown and just tap the phone with her tail. \"Well, yeah was feeling kinda out of it. fuzzy headed, and yes some headache. But that's all gone now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But the medicine is affecting you? Maybe I could help? You asked if I maybe caused your throat to heal. Maybe I did.

I.. have no idea.\" But Martin was smiling. Penny smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god you two are hopeless!\" Jenny muttered. \"No matter what perverted satisfaction you'd get from that it's a terrible idea. This is a hospital. I think they'd notice if a snake invaded his stomach. Sorry, Slithali!\" She added at the look Penny gave her, though she didn't look sorry. \"I doubt they'll make the distinction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I go through him pretty quick. I doubt they'll notice.' She typed, and had the satisfaction of Jenny's eyes going very big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go through?.... oh you are disgusting!\" She said, though Penny saw her blushing. Heh, she liked it. Bet she wished she could slide through Martin too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, please be nice to Penny.\" He said pleadingly. Then he turned back to the Slithali... still getting used to her not being a snake it looked like from his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny wondered what he'd think once she got herself her adult body? Jenny had said he was really into snakes. He would still like her, right? It wasn't just because he was obsessed with her current form? No, he'd have to like a more human like girl body more, wouldn't he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, right now my body isn't too much thicker than I was the last time. If you can swallow my head I should slide in OK. This may be the last chance though. I'm going to not only get bigger but... shapelier soon.' She typed with a grin and had the satisfaction of Martin smiling back at her after he'd read it. 'and I won't have to rely on typing any more!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye men!\" He chuckled and leaned in, gently resting his forehead against hers, eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny still seemed... a bit distracted through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have no idea how you could swallow th.... her.\" She said, interrupting the moment. \"I mean, her head is huge. How in heck can you swallow that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I'm not sure. But she's not huge Jenny. I admit as she is now it does look impossible, but she's right. Her head isn't [i]that[/i] much larger than the last time I swallowed her, and...\" he sighed with a wince, '... apart from the lumps, that was still easy. It'll likely not be quite as straightforward as all that, but so far my mouth has seemed to be the limiting factor entirely. If I can't swallow her head then we'll have to just stop there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really considering this aren't you? Are you nuts? What if a nurse comes in and sees you gulping a snake.\" And before Penny could reflexively start typing 'Slithali' she turned and butted in. \"Yes, I know. Slithali. But the nurse won't know that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it won't take long. Could you guard the door Jenny? Please?\" Martin said, attempting to imitate puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so lucky I still like you.\" She said with a glare and then went over to lean against the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you Martin.' Penny typed, Jenny at least unable to read it from where she was. 'This is the last time I guess, and I'm going to miss it. The tightness. The closeness. Being inside you. Thank you so much for still caring.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Any time.\" He said, and she raised an eyebrow. She guessed he was more referring to his caring than the swallowing, but maybe he really didn't appreciate how bigger she'd get. Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they prepared Penny noticed that Jenny was still looking at them. She smiled. Maybe she could understand why she liked this? She hoped so. Maybe it would put off what she'd been through when Penny had eaten her.</span></div></div>",

He glanced down briefly, it was a bit annoying to have to glance at the phone every time she 'spoke' to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really? 'Fraid you're stuck with these now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes were almost golden, maybe a hint of the old yellow green and black, but now looking very human like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess I'll live with it.\" He said, and leaned in to kiss her again. This time at least he didn't react poorly to the snake-kiss, though she still knew her current ability was lacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just wait till I have proper lips. I'm not gonna let you get any breathing room.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin just smiled and kissed her again. Then she flicked her tongue inside his mouth, before gently wriggling her muzzle in too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bon appetite.' She wrote even as she closed her eyes and slid inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she'd been young her head was relatively bulky compared to her body size. Now it seemed she was more even proportionally. However she was five foot long and her head, though still snake like and tapered, was also large. Thus she was surprised as she felt her jaws ooze into his mouth, then her muzzle plop into his throat seemingly effortlessly. She felt a slight 'pock!' sound around her, and frowned. Did his jaws just dislocate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently he swallowed and she moaned, feeling his muscles knead and draw her in. She dropped the phone, any plans of talking while being eaten lost to the wondrous sensations of being squeezed inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny meanwhile was struggling to avoid gaping as Martin, closed eyed, ate Penny like an anaconda! As she leaned against the door she gulped, watching his jaws part, stretching wider than any human's jaws had any right to, with seemingly no discomfort, and sucking in Penny's slender neck, and beginning to widen across her larger body. True, Penny had said he seemed to be able to manage her before, but this easily? After she was a little big wider? Maybe she had done something to him when he ate her before? She couldn't take her eyes away as Penny gleefully slid down her lover's throat, Martin's mouth stretching almost impossibly at the middle, Penny's largest diameter about five inches across. How did he do that without such a calm expression?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining tail did not take that long, waving in the air till he sucked it up like a wet noodle, a contented smile on his face, and his stomach bulging out his hospital gown, as filled with snake as it was. Martin, still with a satisfied grin, opened his eyes and caught Jenny staring at him. She quickly flicked her gaze away, blushing. Why was she blushing? Well, obviously that whole thing was damn sexual to those two. She just felt awkward being a witness. She considered saying just that, but it felt like a rationalization. Instead she just opened the door a crack and checked outside to see if any Nurses were coming. They weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C... coast still clear.\" She whispered, not willing to turn to meet Martin's eyes. Suddenly she was feeling a little warm.</span></div></div>",

Just... well I worry about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was glaring at him the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Worry about the snake?\" She shook her head minutely. \"You are hopeless! Martin, she can eat a full grown person, and she's not even full size yet! She does NOT need me to take care of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Martin shook his head. Yeah Jenny obviously wasn't thinking it through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, she can't possibly be in any danger can she? Not like some scientist or the government would capture her and want to study her... Really? As far as we know there are few of her people left. That's... well, I think she really would be in danger. Please help her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Jenny didn't let up that intense stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just want to see her with boobs.\" She said, and Martin's eyes went wide. \"You're a guy, seriously, no matter how much you like her now, the thought of her with tits, it's driving you insane isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he frowned at her, fixing her eyes with his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were together for about four months Jenny.\" He said after a few moments silence. \"You really think I'm that obsessed? Did I ever try to feel you up? Did I ever push? I wanted you to like me Jenny. I wanted us to be a couple, for you to stay. Yeah. I admit the thought of Penny like that is very cool, but more I want to ensure she's safe. She's happy. And above all that the two girls I like don't end up hating each other. Is that too hard to understand?\"</span></div></div>",

When he enthused over some spacey website. When he starting spouting off about what NASA was doing... she just turned off. But... they had had some fun together. That time on the beach. That one time she persuaded him to go to a dance party... though she really wasn't sure he'd enjoyed that. But he hadn't complained. A few movies had been fun together, and when she pushed him to dress up he was quite presentable. That one time when she'd gone to town on him and they'd gone shopping together on Main street. That had been fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny blinked. For some weird reason a vivid image of Martin's lips around her feet flashed into her mind and she fought a blush starting. What was she thinking? That snake had tried to... HAD eaten her. Why would she... want.... Martin... Now an image of his lips around her shoulders flashed into her head, his tongue tasting her breasts. She shook her head abruptly. What was wrong with her? Besides, that was impossible anyway. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked back he seemed a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you OK Jenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm fine.\" She pouted, trying to focus, looking down to his belly where the Snake was. Inside him. God this was weird. \"I guess I can do that. But if she tries to eat me again!\" She glared at him again, trying to push it as much as she could. Mostly trying to avoid thinking about why she was thinking about Martin... nope, not going there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't.\" He said. How did he know for sure huh? Probably thinking with his dick again. Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll feed the 'Slithali' and keep it safe till you get back, but you take over when she's done growing Martin! I'm not a maid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and she remembered how it used to be when they were together. Yeah. Well, if he could stop talking technostuff anyway.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Penny was back in the bag. Yes, she'd been washed first. EWWW! Jenny made sure she left the room for that! Seriously, why did Martin do that with her? Glancing down at the bag where Penny was she shook her head. Weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer car was just around the corner. Why was the Hospital parking lot so damned full all the time? Maybe the place grew in number of patients and outgrew the lot? Who knew? Maybe just bad management. Far more likely! Now she had to walk three whole blocks to get to her car, and this wasn't a nice neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brr.\" She shivered. Yeah, was less cold than... well, she stared up at the torn posters on the walls, the peeling paint, the steel ladders falling apart. One was laying on the ground. She was surprised no-one had stolen it. \"Not a nice place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small snake head poked out of the bag and took a quick glance, looked up and nodded in agreement before pulling back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact... the street up ahead did not look nice at all. Mostly the rough looking guys messing around over there. Jenny stopped, turned and headed into an alleyway. Yeah, so not getting near a gang posturing. Sure, didn't hear any guns, but who knew. Nope, not doing that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alleyway, though empty of people, looked worse. Trashcans were scattered everywhere, an old van was here, it's windows long since reduced to frames, it's wheels vanished. The rusted shell looked very sad but also very in place in the surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRRRRRRR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny spun around and gave a yelp, dropping Penny's bag in fright. OK, that was a big, mean looking dog. Looked bigger than a rottweiler, at least ones she'd seen before... from a distance. She was not a fan of dogs. One had bitten her once.... and this one looked like it wanted to too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... n... nice doggy. Stay back!\" She glanced around, then realized she'd dropped the bag. Martin would never forgive her if she left Penny here! \"Easy... easy boy.... er.....\" Reaching down slowly to the bag she stopped when the dog growled again, loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it leaped at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AARRGGH!!\" She gasped, falling over backwards, but a blur of brown and cream flashed in front of her and the dog yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting she scrambled up on her elbows and looked down, seeing Penny's small frame partially wrapped around the dog, but... oh those were cuts. Looked like the dog had bitten her before she could get onto him. Scared she shuffled back on the ground, trying to get away from the two as they scrambled on the ground. The dog got a bite on Penny's tail. Ouch! That looked nasty. Then a coil wrapped around it's neck and pulled it away. Not that she had much to wrap around. She was only five foot long. The dog looked at least three foot long, if not bigger. It's paws scrabbled back and forth over Penny's scales and Jenny winced again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny! Be careful!\" She gasped, looking for something to help with. She didn't have mace, or a knife or anything... not that she wanted to get close enough to that dog with a knife! Then she heard a yelp and turned in time to see Penny's jaw finally latch onto the dog's muzzle and gulp. \"Yeah! Get him Penny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Penny had a good grip it went surprisingly quickly. The thing tried to swipe at her with it's paws, but a few more gulps pressed it's forelimbs against it's body and in it went. The huge mass of the animal stretched Penny a lot, and... Oh, she was gonna have to carry this home! Jenny glanced at the bag. Yeah, that was not gonna cut it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was barely two minutes later when the dog vanished completely, Penny's jaws closing past the thrashing tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, are you OK Penny?\" The snake... Slithali, looked tired and Jenny could still see she was bleeding from quite a few cuts and bite marks. \"I... think I have some bandaids in the car. It's only a block from here. Do... you think you can get there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny glanced tiredly back at her bloated body and experimentally shifted. The dog twisted a bit in her, but she managed to move. Then Penny nodded to the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't gonna fit Penny. Besides I can't carry... oh, the phone. Sorry!\" Jenny reached in the bag and got Martin's phone back and put it down on the ground next to Penny. She had to use her muzzle as she could see past the bulk of the dog to watch her tail and the phone at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can get there, but slowly. Are you OK?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... yeah. Thanks.\" She said. Penny had... saved her. \"Hang on. Get close to the alley exit and I'll move the car closer. Er, maybe hide behind those trashcans.\" She said pointing to the rusted and bent cans to the right of the alley. Then she stopped and leaned over, resting a hand on Penny's head. \"Thank you Penny. I... don't know what I'd have done if you hadn't helped me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelped her? Heck, the snake had done everything! But Penny smiled back at her and nodded, sliding around till she could pick up the phone with her tail and began to slowly make her way to the trash cans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny rushed off and brought the car around, thankfully there were no gang members or anyone there, and she glanced furtively before opening the door and motioning Penny in. It was painfully slow, and she saw the snake wince as she pulled her huge, dog bloated body into the back of Jenny's car. Belatedly Jenny realized she was gonna get snake blood on the back seats! Oh to hell with it. She'd get it cleaned later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing in the back seat with Penny she got out her first aid kit and wiped with alcohol pads, sprayed antiseptic, gingerly spread antibiotic cream, and carefully applied bandaids. Yeah, Penny had got pretty beat up, but it had been short. The dog was still struggling in there, making it a little difficult, and she saw Penny wince as she bumped the snake's injuries a couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Looks like that doggy aint gonna make it.\" Jenny said with a chuckle. \"Poor doggy.\" Penny glanced up questioningly. \"Uh. I never did like dogs. Had some back experiences. Martin's more a dog person than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny glanced down at her bulging body, the movements finally slowing, and looked a little nervous, pulling the phone up where her muzzle could reach it once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is Martin going to be angry with me for this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heck no! You saved me, I just mean he likes some dogs. I'm sure he won't be mad at you for stopping a dog attack me! Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jenny realized how close she was to this snake... This snake that had eaten her. She had a brief shiver as she remembered that whole experience. Still.... she seemed, sort of OK. And Penny <i>had</i> saved her life. With a slightly nervous smile she again stroked Penny's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess I'd better get you home.\" She glanced at the massive bulge, now unmoving. \"Guess you are gonna need a while to deal with your meal. I have a garage so no-one will see you get out of the car. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you Jenny. I'm glad you weren't hurt.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the blood stained snake body Jenny did feel bad that Penny had taken that for her... though at least the snake had got a meal out of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well, I'll drive us back. I'll leave my phone open while driving. If you need something text me.\" Penny nodded then settled down tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, this was so confusing. This snake had eaten her alive... and also saved her life... and was Martin's girlfriend. Her life was getting so weird!</span></div></div>",

Er... what will a car cleaning service think of that? I mean, it doesn't look like a lot of stain admittedly, but very red. Yeah, not gonna be anything but blood. Still, animals bleed, she could say she had a snake that bled in there. That'd be the truth after all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, just relax.\" Jenny said, letting Penny inside the house. Thankfully she wasn't bleeding any more. The few cuts she hadn't been able to bandaid had stopped bleeding. \"Here's the spare room. Just relax here. Er... do you want the door closed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It would feel safer. Silly I know, but like this I feel very vulnerable.' Penny typed. 'I'm feeling very sleepy. I think I'll see you tomorrow.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's OK. Sleep tight Penny. Uh...\" She looked at the bed in the spare room. \"Do you want something on the ground? Some towels or sheets or something? I'd rather you not sleep on the bed, if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny chuckled, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's OK, I'm comfy here. I appreciate the help Jenny.' then she stopped and stared up at her. 'Are you OK?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Yeah, it didn't touch me.\" She said, staring down at Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No. Not that. From when I...' she paused and looked away sheepishly. '...ate you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny blinked, not knowing what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Yeah. Fine. Just.... you get some sleep OK?\" Jenny said, suddenly feeling a little hot she headed out, deciding to go to a bar. Yeah, she definitely needed a drink! But... she turned back. \"I'm heading out. If you need anything text me, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I will. I'm sorry. I really didn't think you'd mind. It was just to carry you. I thought you'd like it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny stared at her for a few moments, then, without saying anything, just turned around and headed out, remembering to close the door to the spare room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo needed that drink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvening's drinking was light... but did tend to run on a bit. Jenny heard last call and was really surprised. Staggering home at 2AM in the morning was... not fun. But at least she had walked. She didn't think it would have been good to drive. And at least the neighborhood around her house was far nicer than that around the hospital!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeellloooo.\" Jenny said, teetering a bit as she managed to finally lock the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe staggered out of her shoes and headed back. For a moment she wondered who she had been saying hello to. Then remembered Penny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh. Snakey saved me!\" She said, a little blurrily, and weaved to the spare room. \"Helloooo Penny. Oh. My gosh you got big!\" She said, seeing a couple of really large coils of snake around by the bed on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her eyes got wide as a sleepy moan and yawn happened, and slowly a body rose up from behind the coils. A pink body. A pink female body. A very naked female body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny?\" She said, blinking. \"You got boobs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ka... Ah...\" Penny said, coughing a little. \"... orry.\" She gulped a couple of times, shook her head. She brought the phone to her face with her arms and used her nose on the screen for a few seconds before closing her eyes and smacking it into her forehead. \"... illy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fumblingly used her fingers on the screen for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Voice still not quite there yet. But yes, I have breasts. Do you like them?' she typed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny stared, and Penny seemed to not care that much. They were... big. Jenny frowned, then pulled her own top out, peering down inside the neckline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeey! No fair. They's bigger than mine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You still look very pretty Jenny. I know from mom that guys like breasts, but they really aren't everything. You have a very pretty face.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, thank you!\" Jenny said, suddenly tearing up and staggering forward, wrapping a surprised Penny in a hug. \"You say the nicest things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny coughed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Elcome.\" she managed, patting Jenny on the back as they hugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny really wasn't that bad. Jenny didn't know what she was so worked up about that whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are snuggly Penny.\" She said, squeezing her. \"Anyone ever tell you you were snuggly? Cos you are. Heh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... ack... no didn't.\" She said, then raised an eyebrow as Jenny's hand slid down to her rear, where she shifted from human body to snake. \"Jenny? You... like girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny pulled back from the hug and frowned at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Course I like girls. Some of my best friends are girls!\" She squinted at her. \"In fact.... You ARE my friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rilly?\" Penny said smiling. \"I...ack... wasn't 'ure. I... I mean I did eat you.\" She frowned, glancing down at her feet... er... tail... something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, don't worry! Didn't hurt.\" Jenny glanced back and forth and leaned in, putting a hand over her mouth conspiratorially. \"Fact... don't tell anyone, but I liked it! Scary... but... nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really.... 'idn't 'ink about that. 'orry I 'cared you.\" Penny said, then smiled. \"But... glad you 'joyed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... you snuggly inside AND out! Hah!\" Jenny laughed at her joke. Very funny! Then she frowned. \"Huh, but you not a snake any more huh? No gobbling me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I could. I 'till 'trech.\" She said, and her jaw unhinged before Jenny's surprised eyes for a few seconds. \"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Damn, but if you could eat me when you were ittle bittlie, now you could eat a horse! Maybe a cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I'm d... Ack...\" Penny coughed, then brought the phone out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm done growing now, mostly. Really don't want to eat that much again. I wouldn't be able to move for weeks!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny closed one eye theatrically and glanced up and down Penny's naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really cute... but small. Like... like teenager with boobs.... and a tail.\" Jenny said with a lopsided grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, mom wasn't much bigger than I am now I think, so I'm pretty sure I won't grow much more.' She glanced up nervously at Jenny. 'Are you really not mad at me for eating you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny waved a hand, dismissing the whole idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh silly! Nawwww. Heck, back in the hospital I kinda imagined Martin eating me! Whoah... did I really? Yeah... Heh... weird. But, nope. He can't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, he ate me, maybe with some stretching he could eat you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I... dunno. Wouldn't he be all 'Arrgh! My ex wants me to eat her!' and shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny smiled kindly at her and rested a hand on Jenny's shoulder, putting the phone down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He likes you. Lot....\" She licked her lips, probably just cos her mouth was all dry and shit. Wasn't cos Penny wanted to eat her was it? Naw, prolly not. \"If you want it. He'd do it for you. We just have to be careful. Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be all embarrassed.\" Jenny said. \"He'd have his tongue on my...\" she frowned. \"Heck, EVERYWHERE!. My everything. Hah! He's never seen me naked... oh... yes... yes he has. Oh my god. Martin's seen my boobies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny laughed, but not maliciously, she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He likes you Jenny. Don't worry. Ack.... And your breasts are beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rilly? You're too kind to me!\" Jenny said and hugged the snake girl thing person... whatever, tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything went black.</span></div></div>",

In the dim light she saw a small cavity ahead of her, with red ribbed top, faint white... Then it moved, the... mouth opened slightly, letting blinding light in a sec before the teeth clicked back together, the very human like tongue writhing barely an inch from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been eaten! Again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight squishing sensation rippled down her body, that flesh squeezing against her body. Tensing she pushed the panic down. She wasn't in danger. She was NOT in danger... Oh Penny was in SOOO much trouble! What the hell was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it came back to her. She'd admitted to liking being eaten! To Penny! Oh god she had been so wasted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat mouth opened again and cool air washed in on her face once more as Penny licked her lips, then snored. Oh god the snake was asleep? Oh, she wasn't a snake any more was she? That mouth looked way too human and... yeah, she remembered her body. Damn! Oh Martin was going to go NUTS over this! Her... She meant Penny's body. She blushed as Penny's esophagus squeezed her again... and Jenny realized she wasn't wearing any clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny!\" She muttered. \"So help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried shifting her right arm, but the flesh around her was so tight against her she could barely move. Well, tight wasn't exactly the right word. She wasn't uncomfortable... er... well she was but not from pressure. Oh this was so confusing! She could feel herself getting aroused as that hot flesh squeezed against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered the dog. And that Penny had digested the dog overnight! A brief panic went through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OmygodI'mlunch!\" she gasped, then fought it down. She was fine, nothing hurt, she wasn't... wasn't digestion all... acidy or something? She didn't feel anything. Experimentally she flexed her legs, wriggling her toes, and then the whole shebang around her oooooozed! \"Ooooohshit!\" She gasped as her breasts were kneaded, the ripple squeezing down, across her thighs then legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, oh... huh?\" The whole world shifted as Penny sat up... or coiled up? Whatever snakes did. \"Penny? Wait, what? I don't remember eating you? A... are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh? No... she'd been pretty drunk... but no that wasn't possible? Could Penny have gone to sleep beside her and... she stripped and crawled in? No.... she... vaguely remembered getting into a nice warm sleeping bag! Oh shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... please don't be mad Jenny! I... I'll let you out.\" At least Penny's voice was a bit more normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Penny heaved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEeeeey!\" Jenny gasped as flesh shifted, squeezing her tightly and pushing her up. Teeth scraped lightly over both her forehead and chin, then spread around her. \"Oooh. Er... easy. EeaaAAASY!\" Jenny gasped \"Ah... er, go slow *gasp* Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion and ripples of muscles slowed, then Penny's new hands took gentle hold of her shoulders and helped support her as she slowly coughed her up. The girl... snake... snakegirl, was surprisingly gentle, but the sensations were too much. She struggled to not cry out, blushing intensely. Somehow she managed not to scream as she was slowly extruded, that tight mouth squeezing down her thighs, then calves, finally  plopping off her feet, leaving her laying panting on the bed. Penny sniffed behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god! You must hate me! Oh I'm so sorry Jenny!\" Penny said, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, uh... er... P.. Penny? I.. it's not your fault.\" She said, but couldn't look the girl in the eyes, keeping her blushed face against the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my...? I ate you! I can't believe I did that! How could I have done that to you a second time!\" She said, and then started bawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god! She... she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... wasn't you.\" Jenny gritted her teeth. \"I was drunk and... crawled in. I thought you were sleeping bag! I think. It's a little blurry.\" Jenny looked over her shoulder at Penny and tried to smile to make her feel a little at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... what?\" Penny said, still sniffling. \"But why would you...\" Penny's eyes got wide as Jenny blushed intensely. \"Oh... Yeah, you did say you liked it. *Sniff* I'm... sorry. That must still have been scary to wake up like that inside me! A... are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy! Yeah, scary and incredibly arousing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I'm fine. really.\" She sighed and rolled over and sat up... and then realized she was naked and blushed even harder. \"Oh god. Where are my clothes?\" She said, drawing her knees up to cover her groin and putting her hands over her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, they're here I think.\" Penny said, curling to the floor and picking them up. \"But... you're all wet. Let me get a towel for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny turned and slithered out of the room surprisingly quietly, her tail looking at least another six foot long apart from her body. Her body looked maybe four foot tall at most, though that included the curl of her snake body on the floor. That tail though tapered down pretty quick so likely she didn't weigh much. Jenny shook her head as she watched the naked snake girl leave, totally unconcerned about her own nakedness. Yeah, Martin was going to LOVE that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down Jenny traced a finger across her belly. Yeah. Spit everywhere! She carefully got out of bed, trying to get as little on the sheets as possible. Oh this was a mess. Definitely needed to wash the bedsheets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" Penny's voice came from behind her abruptly, and Jenny's eyes went wide as a towel wrapped around her and Penny started drying her down! Her blush got extreme as the girl calmly dried everything from breasts to groin and everything in between, totally unconcerned. Somehow Jenny couldn't find her voice to object, though did squeak slightly as fingers pressed the towel between her legs. \"I'm so sorry you had to go through that. But, you enjoyed it at least? I mean, you weren't too scared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny had to struggle to find her voice as Penny continued toweling down her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah. I mean, no. Not too scared. Er. Thanks..\" Penny finished her rather thorough drying and came around from the side, then frowned seeing Jenny's very flushed face. \"Yeah. Uh... Penny? Just so you know, that...\" She motioned down her body, then to the towel. \"... pretty much everyone would freak out at that. Humans don't generally go toweling each other down like that unless we're VERY close friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Damn! That's sexual isn't it? I'm sorry. Still getting used to this.\" She blushed herself, and smiled. \"I'm glad you don't mind. I was surprised when you said you were into girls. Is it boys and girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh? Had she really said that last night? Wait, Penny thinks she's gay? She glanced over at Penny... and her eyes strayed down the girl's body. OK, Jenny... never really considered... that directly, but... she'd always liked how girls looked. Not that she'd seen any naked. Even in the showers back at school she'd usually tried to not peek at others. Mainly as she thought it was rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rebuttal died in her throat and Penny gave a slight smirk as she saw Jenny's eyes fastened onto her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... not just guys like breasts? Mom never really knew many girls, and none that liked her.\" She pondered. \"Actually I think she only knew one girl. That I knew of anyway. She didn't get out much, rather scared of going out of the house. Not surprising really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Yeah.\" Jenny said, managing to tear her eyes away from Penny's chest. \"I imagine it's kinda scary worrying what other people would think of you like that. How did she manage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had three boyfriends before my dad, and I don't really remember much about him. Too recent a memory to be passed on I think. I know she snuck out of Ben's place. Had to hide till she found somewhere to stay. Her other boyfriends were nicer and helped her out, even after they... became distant. Sometimes guys just don't feel right around us I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny saw her gaze get sad, Penny looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't you go thinking Martin is going to give up on you!\" She said strictly. \"He loved you as a snake. He's going to absolutely adore you now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny blushed, glancing up at her with a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... really think so? I... hope he likes me, but I'm so different now. Before I just assumed he'd like me better when I was more girl shaped, but... I was... well... dumber then.\" She smiled and tapped the side of her head. \"Bigger brain now. He he.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go getting cocky, but he definitely is into big brains.\" She said, a sad look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Bad memories Jenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sighed and sat down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... had a little rough relationship. Well, I know a lot was me. I liked him, just... well our interests really didn't mesh. He tried, but I could tell he really wanted me to like all that science stuff. I am no geek!\" She said, that last rather emphatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of science?\" Penny said, coiling a little lower to keep her eyes level with Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I don't know. He's into space stuff. Physics, NASA. that kind of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like other science stuff? Like, nature shows, or chemistry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I watch National Geographic sometimes. When it isn't gory. Way too much now where they show the predators tearing into things. Ick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that. So maybe he'd like to watch things like that with you? Did you ever try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny peered at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you trying to hook me up with Martin again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cos he likes you. Duh!\" She said with a giggle, as if that explained everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny shook her head. Penny was really weird... and surprisingly nice to be around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day was... interesting. Apart from the hangover (which thankfully was mild) Jenny tried to help Penny settle into her new body. She hadn't noticed at first, but the rapid growth spurt and change to her half human form had healed Penny of all the cuts she'd received during the fight with the dog. Jenny still attempted to make up for putting her through that. Unfortunately, though Penny tried a few things that Jenny cooked for her it didn't turn out well. Penny insisted it wasn't the cooking per se, but she was still Slithali and thus not really into human food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did seemed rather hesitant about clothes in general, but did eventually manage to accept one of Jenny's older shirts which wasn't too large for her. She also did at least accept to sleeping on the bed which she found rather comfortable now she'd changed. Then there was the matter of the next visit to the hospital which took a little planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin had been half sleeping when the door opened again, not really considering much other than the nurse coming in again. Far too many needles recently. So when Jenny came in he was pleasantly surprised, smiling as he pulled himself up in the bed... then blinked as he realized she was pushing a little girl in a wheelchair in front of her. Did Jenny have a little sister? If so she seemed a little... busty for her apparent age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Martin!\" Came the musical voice from the grinning girl, her short brown hair clipped up in a hairband. \"How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh....\" Martin said, frowning. \"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny shook her head, and the girl looked perplexed. Jenny had to shut the door first, then leaned down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're surprised he doesn't recognize you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl raised her eyebrows, then burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm such a silly! Duh!\" Then she threw off the towel over her knees and... slithered out of the chair! \"It's me, Penny! I grew up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin gaped as the 'girl' shifted out of the chair, her long snake like tail propelling her quickly alongside the bed and then arms wrapped around him in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P... Penny? Wow! You're beautiful!\" He stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly Jenny smiled behind them, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told you.\" Was all she said, leaning on the door once more to guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y.. you really think so? I was so worried. I mean, you liked me before, but I just kind of assumed you'd prefer me like this. I... really didn't think much about it back then.\" She said, pulling back from the hug and staring into his eyes. It looked like she was tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Definitely yes.\" He said, and reached up stroking her hair. She smiled, closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm. That does feel nice. And hugs are nice. Real hugs! Unless you feel like... a little sucking?\" She said, blushing as Martin saw a tail tip lift up before his face. \"I know you can't eat me, but... well, it just felt so good. He he. Just... a little maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny coughed, getting both of there attentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny. He's still in hospital, and you do remember the reason he's here?\" She did smile however. \"Look, just hold off on that for a bit hmm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... right. Sorry.\" Penny said, looking sheepish as she pulled back a little, \"But I'm glad to see you Martin.... though you really do look smaller. He he.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow I don't think I shrank Penny.\" Martin said with a grin. \"And I really do like your new look... And hugs.\" He said, and quickly leaned in to hug her tightly again, hearing her sigh as he pulled her to him, the warmth of her body very inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin caught Jenny looking at the two of them, a slightly quirked expression on her face. Then she noticed him and and turned to check the door, listening... and abruptly turned back, waving sharply to the wheelchair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny! Company!\" Martin said. Abruptly Penny gasped and leaped from the bed, making Martin gasp as she deftly wriggled back into the chair, tucking her tail under the seat and throwing a towel over it. Jenny strained at the door, listening. For several seconds she strained, then sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next door. Probably be in here next. Slight reprieve.\" She said, keeping her ear to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny looked at the door anxiously, then decided to wheel the chair up to the bed instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets not risk it for now.\" She said, and lifted a hand up to Martins face in almost a mirror of his gesture earlier. \"Besides, you'll be home soon. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin's face fell slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. Since yesterday they've been a little... anxious. They haven't said anything, but I'm guessing the bloodwork wasn't good. I also had an MRI today. They haven't said anything about that either. Yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny looked back, some anxiousness in her expression too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they probably haven't got the results back yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't specifically know about MRI, but I'm fairly sure it's all local. The system generating a full compilation of magnetic resonance slices and assembling into some readable file as it happens. They should have the details immediately, or at least after the doc's had a chance to go through it. I... admit it's kinda worrying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Martin!\" she said, her deep green eyes staring into his. \"They'll take good care of you. I... don't want to think of you ill because of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin smiled weakly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I admit I'm a little worried it might be... outside their expertise. Er... well, I'm not sure they know of this yet...\" He sighed, pulled back and then reached up to his lips and... pulled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny's eyes got big and she smiled slowly as Martin stretched his mouth, his jaw audibly popping as it dislocated, then opened far wider than any human's should have been able to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! That looks so inviting! Oh, right.... guys can't do that normally? Oh Martin, I'm sure you're OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin wriggled his jaw, seemingly only partly able to close it without his hands helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more worried that they'll think there is more problematic than there is. I mean, probably this has something to do with... well, eating you. The Docs though have no knowledge of Slithali, nothing about that rapid growth. I'm pretty sure they'll assume this is all... well bad. In fact we aren't sure it isn't bad. Like you said, guys can't do this normally. Just because we think we know what started it doesn't mean it's going to be without problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... I might have hurt you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin saw Penny's eyes tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I was the one doing the swallowing Penny. Don't blame yourself! Besides, like I said we just don't know yet. Give it time... and I hope the doctors don't go overboard just as they don't know what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nurse.\" Jenny said, and pulled away from the door just as it opened. Penny made sure the towel was covering her and turned to watch at the nurse came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how are doing this afternoon?\" She said. \"Enjoying some company?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very much.\" Martin said, and the Nurse gave a knowing look seeing him gazing at Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm afraid we need to take some blood and do a few more tests. The doctor will be in in a few minutes. I'm afraid your friends will have to leave for the moment. They can come back later this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you are taking good care of him.\" Penny said, managing to tear her eyes from him. \"He... is doing OK, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have things well in hand miss. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny smiled at the Nurse, then turned back to Martin and leaned across the bed and surprised him with a kiss. A deep kiss. Leaning into it he wrapped his arms around her, loosing himself for a few seconds... or years. Kinda difficult to tell. Finally she broke the kiss, reluctantly, and pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You take care Martin. I'll see you later.\" She said, then nodded to Jenny who then carefully wheeled Penny out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin sighed, the memory of Penny's lips still on his mind. Then the nurse got the needle out. Oh, this wasn't going to be fun!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenny's place was not particularly big, and the guest room was small. Penny hardly seemed to mind. One morning Jenny had actually found her curled up, asleep, in the closet. Curled vertically with her head on the floor, her coils as a pillow. Lord knew how she squeezed herself in there, but she managed it somehow. She just closed the door and let her snooze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was weird, but actually sort of fun to be around. Admittedly she couldn't take her out to the movies or a meal (not that she'd be interested in such) but she found they shared some TV shows in common, and she was eager to hear about who was doing what in town... Maybe just because she didn't know anyone there. But still it was fun to talk, and.... well, she was worried about Martin. Penny was too of course, but Jenny couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she was very surprised when a couple of days later the hospital said he seemed past the worst of it and his body was recovering from the infection. They never actually named what the infection was, and for some reason there were no details of the MRI or any of the other exams they'd had, but it looked like the last day or so they'd become less tense around him and both she and Penny finally began to relax. Even so it was the rest of the week before they'd let him go, and he headed home on Saturday night. Penny was positively giddy as they picked him up in Jenny's car and headed to Martin's place, Penny in the back seat with him, unfurled finally (though Jenny had said she should wait till they actually got home! Penny didn't listen of course), and the two kissed and cuddled the whole way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And home sweet home.\" Martin said as he pulled the garage door shut (he didn't have a remote for it since that bust a few months ago) and then helped Penny out of the car. It was a little packed in the garage with both his bike and Jenny's car. He'd had to sell his car a while back. He'd never been a car person anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Martin. Heh, never saw in here before.\" She said, looking around as she curled out of the car. \"Looks nice. Cosy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny leaned in with conspiratorial smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair warning, she likes tight places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, believe me I know.\" Martin said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's face dropped and she groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, MEN!\" And she huffed as she headed into the house not noticing Martin and Penny fall into each other's arms for a nice long kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later she poked her head back through the garage door. And the two were still hugging there, barely moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I bring you two a pillow or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm?\" Penny said, resting her head on Martin's shoulder as they hugged. \"That'd be nice.\" Then a few moments later she gasped as a pillow was thrown at her face! \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's Jenny's subtle way of saying she's being ignored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry Penny, you want a kiss too?\" She said smiling warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin struggled to avoid laughing as Jenny went bright red and stormed back in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it something I said?\" Penny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She isn't even into me any more, I seriously don't think she wants to kiss you Penny.\" He then leaned in and bopped her nose with his. \"Though I can't imagine why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny chuckled, then grew thoughtful for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martin? When you named me, was it after Jenny? I mean, Penny sounds like Jenny. An awful lot like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin looked into her eyes, guileless open eyes, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess so.\" He whispered. \"I really did love her. Still do I guess. I... suppose I just wasn't enough for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you're plenty enough! I'm sure she'd like you. I think you're delicious!\" Martin almost choked at that, shaking his head. Penny bit her lip. \"Oh, right. She can't eat you can she? Well, not all of you. Oh.. oh OH!\" She suddenly got excited. \"It's been nearly a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what?\" Martin said, then jerked a little as Penny slid from his arms and went down, quickly unfastening his trousers. \"PenneeeeEEE!\" He gasped as she sucked him in, making very pleasant 'Mmmmm!'ing noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind the door Jenny peeked in, then rolling her eyes at the overly blatant 'action' Penny was doing as Martin gasped, but... She had kind of expected it. Penny was extremely open about that kind of thing. The last few days the girl had not really held back one iota about what she intended to do with Martin when she got him back in her arms. No, that wasn't what had hit Jenny. Instead what had her attention was what she'd heard Martin whispering. Naming Penny after her, and... him still in love with Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny had thought herself over Martin some time ago. True, he was cute and a nice guy, but he had just been too... geeky. Maybe she'd been more worried over what others saw. Her hanging out with a Nerd! But... They'd had some good times, and having Penny over had involved an awful lot of the girl gushing about Martin. Penny was obviously hopelessly smitten with him... and was constantly pushing Jenny to make up with Martin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just couldn't understand that girl... snake... whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she caught the obvious sounds of Martin stifling a gasp of pleasure and blushed herself. Damn that girl could suck! Well, they definitely deserved each other! She gently headed to the kitchen to get something to eat, feeling a little flushed herself.</span></div></div>",

She'd done her bit, helped the snake girl back to Martin's place, now the two of them could make tons of little snake babies together. However here she was sitting in the kitchen while Martin and Penny were in his room. From the sounds of it it wasn't anything more than checking out wardrobe items. Made a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cupped the mug of coffee tightly, savoring the warmth. Why was she still here? This was... awkward. She'd been here too many times in the past for Martin, and now... She glanced to the wall separating the kitchen from Martin's bedroom. She'd been in there a few times too. Nothing... explicit, but they'd had some nice times. He definitely could kiss. Yeah....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny!\" Jenny jerked at the sudden voice, looking to see Penny smiling at her. \"Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to startle you. I just wanted to give this back to you.\" She said, and took off her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny went bright red as the thoroughly naked girl handed the blouse back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... thanks.\" She managed, then saw Penny shake her head, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so shy Jenny. What, did you want a hug? After all you've done for me you deserve it.\" She said and slithered up to her. Before Jenny could muster up a denial she was being hugged by a four foot (or ten, depending on how you measured her) naked snake girl. Jenny's hands hovered, halfway to hugging back, gulping as she felt nipples poke through her shirt. \"Oh Jenny. You don't know how much what you did means to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh.... you're welcome?\" She managed \"Besides... it was just a stay. You... can visit. If you want to.\" She managed sticking her foot even more in her mouth she felt. Though it seems Penny didn't think that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... Not that. Not that I don't appreciate you taking care of me.\" She said, pulling back and staring into Jenny's eyes. The girl was on the verge of tears it seemed. \"You... you saved Martin when I couldn't. Even after all I... did to you. I can never thank you enough Jenny. Ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled back, resting her hands on Penny's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome Penny. And I'd never want to hurt Martin, no matter what our relationship is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our? *Sniff* \" Penny said, then grinned. \"Oh Jenny! I'd love to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny didn't get more than a confused expression before Penny pulled her in and lip locked with her... and STUCK HER TONGUE INTO HER MOUTH! Surprise caught her. Then shock. Then... passion. What? How? Why.... why.... ohhhh god!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny wrapped her arms around the girl, kissing back deeply, not certain she knew what was happening, and not really caring. It had been a long time since she'd kissed, since Martin in fact, and Penny was way better it seemed! It was so inviting, so deep and warm. sooo.. FINGERS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes snapped open as a hand slid into her knickers deftly, sliding down to her groin, even as those lips continued to caress hers. Gentle tickling across her mons, over her slit... then... OH GOD! A hand clasped onto her butt, one wriggling against her slit, teasing around her clit, then down gently into the folds! SHIT SHIT SHIT OH FUCK THAT FELT GOOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny felt Penny's lips part, pressing her's apart too, and air forced into her lungs from Penny's. A warm flood of passion flowed into her, her head feeling dizzy as the two girls breathed into each other, tasting each other's breath as Jenny's arms twitched, hugging the girl tightly. She found herself practically grinding her groin against that hand, that oh so dexterous hand! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long, but Penny just literally breathed in Jenny's scream of pleasure as she twitched, shuddering in the snake girl's grip, fingers sliding into her depths as the muscles down there clutched tightly. She felt herself fading, just oozing into a shadow of pleasure, resting against Penny's warmth, feeling those hands caress her.... oh god!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gave  few more spasmodic twitches Penny's lips finally separated from her with an audible smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! Oh that was a keeper! Oh I'm so glad I could help you. You really needed it I guess!\" She said, panting and hugging Jenny tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny blinked. She'd just been... raped? Fucked? She hadn't a clue.... and frankly didn't care. That had been so much better than she'd ever hoped than... her first time with a girl? With a... snake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled back, still twitching and stared at Penny, confused. Penny just beamed back, still tearing up it seemed, but with joy. Penny was just so.... lovable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T...thank you....\" Jenny stammered, still feeling her heart pounding in her chest. \"I... never knew... thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny raised an eyebrow quizzically, then gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait, that was your first? I thought you'd had sex before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N... no.... Martin and... Well we.... didn't. OK, I didn't.\" She stopped, feeling confused. \"Let me start over. Yes, that was my first time, and though I wondered about Martin we never did. I.... didn't feel it back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny smiled and leaned in for a quick kiss on Jenny's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never too late.\" She said, still softly smiling. \"He's just next door you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny paused, staring at Penny. Penny who casually just offered up her boyfriend to her as a sex toy. OK, maybe that was uncalled for, but it felt like it. But as she stared into those guileless deep green eyes Jenny couldn't put any blame on her. Penny just wanted to be friends with both her and Martin. Friends with benefits. Jenny giggled at the thought. With a shake of the head Penny giggled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you'd like it. He's very fun to be around. And who knows, you might even get him to eat you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny blinked, a very erotic image of Martin's lips sucking on her thighs blazing in her mind. Oh that was so wrong!</span></div></div>",

Second time.... she wasn't becoming.... weird was she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny?\" Penny said from her right. \"Come on, it'll be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA coil slipped around, cuddling her from her left while Penny nuzzled in from the right, her head resting on Jenny's shoulder, her hair tickling the side of her face. This was... incredibly weird. Erotic, emotional, and... why was she being cuddled by a naked girl? OK, friend (sort of) but.... She shivered, remembering that rather sudden orgasm earlier. It was too similar to her own 'play' to really feel like sex in a way... but... It really had been. She'd been with another person and it had been with a girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.... I need to go.\" She said, her voice slightly cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.... Sorry. I... \" She staggered to her feet, straightening her clothes, feeling her blush spread everywhere, Penny's coil sliding free as she staggered uncertainly to the door. \"I... Tell Martin I'll be back. Soon.... I...\" She gave one brief confused look at Penny, gulped, then turned and almost dashed for the door, managing to at least avoid running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it something I said?\" Penny said to the empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and then she just jumped up and ran off.\" Penny said, looking sadly at her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Penny. You really are way too open.\" Martin said, gently taking her face in his hands, lifting her gaze back up to his. \"That was her first time with someone, and I'm pretty sure that she had never thought of other girls like that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... she said she did. At least I think she did. I'm trying to remember exactly what she said... but... she liked it. She REEEEAALLY liked it.\" Penny said with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad. But, look Penny sex is really tied in with emotions, relationships and a whole load of stuff. Stuff I have... pretty much no familiarity. But if TV has taught me anything is that people can act weird with this kind of thing. Likely she doesn't know what to think or feel right now. Give her time, she'll figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get that from Trip and T'Pol?\" Penny said, and only the serious look on her face avoided Martin bursting out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... not exactly. That's kind of a family show so they don't go into sex. They kind of skirt around it as much as they can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how do young people learn? You don't have memories from your parents. My mom was a bit surprised at that. Sort of. I guess she got something from her mom, just no clear memories. Heh, otherwise I wouldn't know our species name! But I know she didn't really get the difference between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And let me guess. She did know something, but when it actually came up she was still surprised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'dya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of things can be learned, but sometimes you need to actually experience stuff, or sometimes just see how things actually work to actually make sense of things. I had a brief stint in a science lab after school, and seeing things practically made stuff make a whole lot of sense, but there was a bit of a shock in some ways. Things that were taught, didn't really apply in the real world. And sometimes the other way around. Things they don't teach are important. Life is like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny grinned, a look of glee in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a scientist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er.... for about three weeks. Assistant. Turns out my skill set didn't match.\" He said sheepishly. \"Yeah. Might slightly derail my little speech there. But seriously. Sometimes things are just different than you expect. I think Jenny just hit something like that and has to completely reassess what she knows. What she feels. Give her time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Penny wrapped her arms around Martin, gazing up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so smart. How did you get to be so smart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, really not. You've been alive for a week. I've been around for over twenty years.... Life helps. As silly as that sounds.\" He said, shrugging, as if that was an explanation. And she guessed it was. Sort of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense. I guess. But there is one thing I don't get.\" She said, looking up at him seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you said to begin with. You know. You weren't familiar with relationships?\" She blinked, a slow smile spreading across her face. \"Soooooo I'm the first girl you've had sex with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.... yeah. Well. I mean we haven't exactly....All the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA finger placed itself firmly on his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not.... Yet.\" Penny said with a grin. \"Jenny's loss. She'll catch you later. I have you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin gulped. Yeah, that was way more than he'd hoped for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was very surprised to learn that Snakes sweat. Or at least Slithali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartin rested his cheek on Penny's breast, feeling the thump of her heart, hearing it as he shifted till his ear pressed to her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm.\" She murmured, a finger tracing across his shoulder... and a tail tip stroking up his thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK...  that was.... amazing.\" Martin said softly, feeling his heart start to slow a little... and her sex... cloaca?... grip him as he slowly deflated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooooh yes.\" Penny murmured again, as he glanced up at her face it looked like her eyes were still half lidded. \"Wow.... way better than mom's.\" and he gulped as she hugged his head into her chest tightly. \"Mmmmmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer coils weren't that long, only one part wound around him, squeezing him lightly as they cuddled, him curled around her torso, her twisted so they still... coupled, while they stayed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Penny. For... everything. I mean, everything you've done, every...\" He blinked as she winced. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... kinda caused your stay in hospital Martin. I put you through a lot of pain.\" She sighed. \"I mean, I didn't know, I didn't mean it, but it still was me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached up and bent her face down to look at him, her arms still holding him to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask me if I care? Seriously? I love you Penny.\" He stroked her cheek gently. \"We're together now, that's all that matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked, tears coming to her eyes, then she wriggled his body up straight, using coils and arms, till they were face to face once more. She sniffed and stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Martin.\" she said and leaned in to kiss him once more, a very deep one. Then she blinked, drew her tongue back and pulled back, glancing down slightly with a smile. \"And it seems you're ready for round two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a little break first Penny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Count of three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah. Interesting night.</span></div></div>",

Did she dare risk trying to get Jenny's attention directly? She couldn't talk, but with some preparation Penny thought she could spell words out. She spotted a game of scrabble in the corner. Convenient! She had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething gently nudged Jennifer. Then nudged again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, five more minutes ma.\" She murmured. Another nudge came. \"Oh Ma, I don't... wa....\" She gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snake was barely two feet from her face, but before she even registered that it's head turned and pointed down at the floor and jabbed with it's muzzle emphatically. Almost instinctively, while storing a scream, she looked where it pointed and.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please Martin needs help Please Hurry'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrabble letters were placed neatly on the floor and the scream burbled in her throat. The snake pointed at the words again, nodding to her. She just sat there gaping at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it rolled it's eyes and shook it's head. It's rather human looking eyes. Jennifer squinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" It shook it's head then pointed at the letters once more. \"Martin. Needs help?\" It nodded. She felt herself starting to shake. This was... frightening, weird and generally... way outside what she could understand. How could a snake use scrabble letters? Was she dreaming?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she'd acknowledged the words the snake went down to the floor and slithered to the door, then looked back expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked, still nervous, and shaking under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... you're a snake.\" She said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt visibly sighed and tipped it's head at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't look at me like that!\" She said and rose up from the covers indignantly. The snake's eyes widened a bit and stared down at her naked breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this being 'just a snake' she suddenly got rather embarrassed and pulled the covers back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... let me dress.\" it just shook it's head, made what sounded like a hissy laugh, and slid out the door, closing it with a click behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snake had just asked for help, then closed a door. Could snakes do that? She didn't think so. She glanced down at the scrabble letters, and they were laid out rather neatly... and with spit on them it looked like. Eeeewww! Hurriedly she put some clothes on and headed outside, to almost scream again when she saw the snake waiting outside her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't DO that!\" She whispered loudly. Again it rolled it's eyes at her. She was getting annoyed now, and that over-rode her nervousness. \"Hey, don't get hissy with me Mr Snake!\" It raised it's eyebrows at her and shook it's head. \"What? What did I say now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny dear, are you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yeah mom. I... I'm going out to....\" Follow a snake to my ex.... yeah, that would go well. \"... to... go to the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, I'm making breakfast. Fresh broth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Jennifer's turn to roll her eyes. Mom loved soup and forced it on her every chance she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine mom. See you later.\" Then realized she hadn't gone down stairs to go past her mom yet. Oh, she was really out of sorts. Snakes, why did it have to be snakes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You OK sweetie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh spare me.\" She muttered to herself. \"Uh, yeah mom.\" She said, sidestepping past the snake and heading downstairs. \"I'll just be gone a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully her mother didn't get more involved than that, but from the glance she got from the kitchen it seemed she wanted to. She worried over her way too much!</span></div></div>",

I turn around and keep walking, then I hear footsteps behind me. I turn around again, and see the empty street again. I continue down the street again, this time to foot steps get even closer. I turn around to see nothing behind me again. I continue walking, now the foot steps slow down, but they sound very close to me now. I quickly turn around and still see nothing. This is getting scary, I need to catch and figure out who is following me. I ready myself as I continue walking down the street. I hear the footsteps again, but then I feel a tap on my shoulder. I quickly turn around and grab the hand. Next thing I hear is a scream. \"EEK! I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear the voice, but there's no one in front of me. I feel like I've grabbed someone's hand, but there's nothing in it. This is too freaky, so I yell out \"Who's there? Show yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, my name is Alexandra. We go to the same university. I saw you in orientation a-and I wanted to...we talked to each other and... well I just thought you... um- I wanted to talk to you I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, did this disembodied voice just have a crush on me? Also, she did sound familiar \"Um...Wait, were you the girl with bandages wrapped on her face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you remember me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, the group leader tried to make a big deal about how we were both called Alex and such, how could I forget? I thought those bandages were because you had a skin condition\" I let go of her finally as she clearly wasn't posing any threat anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not far off. My skin is what makes me invisible. I just wear the bandages to help people see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, does that mean you're completely naked right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes. It's the only way for me to be completely invisible. I wanted to get your...um.... I wanted to get to know you better. But I get really nervous when trying to talk to you, so I thought I might try coming out like this, so I could talk to you without you looking at me directly. Does that make sense?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I think I heard about something similar to that, where you just talk to the air rather than to the face. So you just wanted to ask me out on a date?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause I would love to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you seem really nice, and you stripped down naked just for me\" I joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uhh\" from the sound of her voice, she was probably blushing \"Yeah! It's a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. I'll meet you tomorrow. Let me give you my phone number and you can text me your address so I can pick you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sounds great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day </span></div></div>",

The girl I was going to see was very shy, we had met on a website where we wrote stories. We began to talk and now we are going to meet. She seemed really nice, and I kinda liked her... even though I've never met her. I check my phone and look at the time. 7:57. A bit early... I walk in and look around. A nice place, the colors were mostly blue and red. A nice combination. I walk up and talk to the waiter. \"Table for two please.\" He looked at me for a second before sayIng, \"Right this way sir.\" He leads me to a small table close to the window. I look out and see the moon shining brightly. A waxing cresant, beautiful. I stare at it a minute and return to life. I wait for her to arrive. At 7:59, she walks over. She was white with jet black hair. Her eyes were almost yellow, strange. I dismissed the thought and examined her further. She wore a blue and black dress that flowed with grace. Her fingernails were blue and had sparkles, they shined like metal on a sunny day. She sat down and smiled before saying, \"Hello, Shadowstar, is it?\" \"Yes, but please call me Roy. Ragingthunder?\" \"Millisa.\" She said smiling. The waiter walks over and says, \"Are you ready to order?\" We both quickly skim our menus and Millisa says, \"I'll have the stake, rare please.\" \"And you sir?\" \"May I have the clam and shrimp soup?\" \"Most certainly. And to drink? \"Just water for me.\" I say, \"As well as me.\" Millisa responds.</span></div></div>",

At first it does work. But eventually, it causes Langstrom to violently transform into the Man-Bat, an intimidating human-bat monster. Fortunately, Batman was able to change Langstrom back via antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that this history lesson is over with, it's time to choose who our lucky victi- I mean volunteer will be, hmm?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nSitting at the table, playing nervously with your cutlery while you waited for your mystery date to arrive, you couldn't help but wonder why you had agreed to this in the first place; not having a great deal of experience with women in the past and being kind of nervous around new people. You supposed your friends were just looking out for you, seeing as you were the only one in your small group currently single (and had been for quite some time)...well, either that or they were playing some really elaborate prank; having never actually seen this new girl before and half expecting some truly repulsive creature to waddle her way through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, they wouldn't do that to me,\" you said to yourself, trying to shake the thought out of your head, figuring that even your best friend Mike, who was something of a joker, wouldn't go so far as to actually book you a table in a restaurant just for a prank (though admittedly it wasn't really much of a restaurant, more like a fancy burger joint).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding then to think positively, picturing your date as some incredibly sexy, sweet and funny girl (and praying to God that you were right), currently knowing virtually nothing about her, other than the fact that her name was Emily, she was a year younger than you, and that her family had just moved to town two or three weeks ago from somewhere out in the sticks. Not that you were alone in this though, your friends knowing very little either, and the only reason you were actually sitting here was due to Clara (Mike's girlfriend, who was a year below you) sat next to one of Emily's recently made friend's in History and the two of them had decided to pair you up. Emily it seemed, according to her friend, currently being in a similar dating situation to you, only with far less of a social circle to choose from (kind of suggesting that she was forced into this thing too). According to Clara she was nice though. \"Cute\" being the word she'd banded about a lot to describe her, assuring you that the two of you would get on like a house on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell you certainly hoped this was the case, even if she wasn't 'girlfriend material', having not really spent much alone time with a girl (other than your mom and your sister that is) and kind of needing to get back out there and start playing the field; it having been a long while since your brief dalliance with Michelle back in the 9th grade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this was going through your mind, with your attention still focused on the knife and fork that you were sliding back and forth across the table top, you hadn't noticed the door to the diner open and a figure hurry in, getting somewhat of a fright when you suddenly heard a voice from above you say, \"Uhm, Hi there. Are you...are you Ryan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolting back a little in surprise, you looked up to see an equally nervous looking young girl, clutching a satchel tightly in her hands, dressed in a cute little pink 'Hello Kitty' top (that was currently hanging off one shoulder), a short pleated grey skirt, long, thigh high stripy pink and white socks, and a pair of plain white sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, I am...that's me,\" you replied, feeling a little embarrassed for getting such a shock, \"You must be Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Sorry if I'm late. I was doing some studying and I kind of lost track of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. That's okay. No problem,\" you told her, beckoning for her to join you in the booth, \"Please, have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she awkwardly smiled, pulling the satchel strap over her shoulder and shuffling onto the seat opposite you, getting herself comfortable as you began to mentally assess your date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelatively speaking she wasn't too bad, perhaps not being as stunningly beautiful as you'd been imagining, or even quite in the same league as Clara (who was a real looker), but she was definitely, as Clara had put it, \"cute\", having a very soft and pretty face with a few freckles dotted around her nose. Her hair was cut short, brown, with long bangs that hung down well past her eyes (and since introducing herself, had brushed them out of the way at least three of four time). And while she was quite short, she wasn't overly so, looking to be about 5' 3\", at least 7 or 8 inches shorter than you, possessing rather a skinny, athletic sort of figure with smallish breasts that really didn't make much of a dent in her top. Not that you were complaining though, not exactly having a queue of tall, blond, busty babes waiting for you outside as back up or anything, and actually finding Emily rather attractive, hoping that her personality matched her looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was settled, and once the two of you had got over some initial, rather sheepish small talk, discovering in the process that Emily's friend, Caitlin had dropped her off (the friend that Clara had arranged this with), and that it had been an extracurricular Chemistry project that she'd been working on that had caused her to be late, a waiter appeared and handed the two of you menus, which you both then began to peruse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ordering and receiving your drinks, you discovered two more important things about your date. One being that she appeared slightly clumsy at times, almost spilling her coke over herself and half the table on at least two separate occasions, and two, that after her initial perky introduction she didn't really seem like she was all that interested in actually being here with you, her attention wandering from time to time out the window or to other couples sitting at other tables. \"<i>Shit!</i>\" you thought to yourself, realizing this date was quickly going down hill, Emily giving you the distinct impression that she'd much rather be somewhere else, \"<i>I'm really out of practice. Gotta try and be more interesting!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with this in mind, grasping at straws, you then interrupted your rather long and drawn out story about the last time you'd eaten here and instead said, pointing towards her shirt, \"That's uh, that's a cute top you've got on there. D'you like all those Japanese cartoons and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a half giggle, Emily thankfully responded, \"Thanks. And yeah, kinda. I like some anime stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly following this up, not wanting to lose her again and for your date to return to dullsville, you decided to take a chance and reveal something (perhaps) a little on the embarrassing side, telling her that, \"Cool. I like some of it too. My sister even had this Hello Kitty game that was actually pretty fun...\" adding with a nervous chuckle, \"Just don't tell my friend's that or I'll never hear the end of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis provoked yet another giggle from Emily, having appeared to have finally broken the ice, as she replied (slightly more enthusiastically than she had done before), \"I' think I've got that game! The one where you have to collect apples while avoiding those really funny crows with the little hats on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's the one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's such a fun game,\" she smiled, opening up a little more herself, \"I haven't played it in a while though. I sort of got sucked into the whole Mass Effect craze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this made your ears instantly prick up, and you yelped excitedly, \"You play Mass Effect?! <i>Me too!</i>\", discovering that this cute and slightly quirky girl was into the same video games as you being both a major break through and as awesome as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing this as a new jumping off point, things took a much better turn, with Emily revealing much more of her inner geek as well as actually laughing at some of your jokes, as you both enthusiastically chatted away. First about games, then about movies, then cartoons, then just about everything else, finding the you really did have a lot in common and that Emily was indeed a very friendly, very smart and very cool girl. Also, far from appearing bored or disinterested, as she had done before, now she really did seem like she was enjoying spending time with you on this date, just as you were with her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the date continued on in pretty much the same vein, the two of you finding now that you had quite a lot to talk about as you both chowed down on your burgers, there of course being the odd occasional pause here or there, but no more than was to be expected on a first date. The more you chatted with Emily, the more things you discovered; owning up about her apparent clumsiness after tripping up and nearly falling over a chair on her way back from the bathroom, as well as revealing just how smart and studious she was - having not only been top of her class at her old school, but having also already joined quite a few after school clubs at this new one (History, Biology and English being her particular favorite subjects). Though you could hardly compete with this, doing okay at school but not exactly setting the boards alight with your test scores, you couldn't help but admire her enthusiasm, getting a real nerdy and innocent joy over something so banal as reading text books and studying. Perhaps she wasn't quite the girl you'd been hoping for when you'd been waiting for her to arrive, but that really didn't matter anymore, finding her incredibly attractive and fun to be around, no matter if beneath her cute and giggly girl-next-door exterior, she was really a massive geek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, after the two of you had finished your meal (which you had happily obliged to pay for), things turned a little bit more awkward outside as the two of you stood there, not being quite sure exactly how to part. Truthfully you didn't want the night to end so soon, having only spent a couple of hours together inside the burger bar and there being so much more you still wanted to know and find out about her. But then again, this was just a first date, not to mention the first time the two of you had actually met, and asking her to do anything else now would be kind of pushing things a little too soon. So instead, you offered to walk her home, figuring that this was a far more innocent and gentlemanly gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the offer but my friend Caitlin said she'd pick me up,\" Emily replied, dashing your hopes for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" you quickly told her, attempting to hide your disappointment, \"Just wanted to make sure you got home safely is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing a little at this, she then asked you, \"What about you? Did you drive or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. no, I wish!\" you laughed, feeling slightly embarrassed, hoping this didn't take you down a notch in her estimation as you revealed that, \"I don't have enough cash for a car of my own yet,\" before getting back to the original question. \"No I uh, I walked. My house isn't far from here so I'll be cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the date now clearly coming to an end, realizing that if you didn't say something now then it was going to be too late, you bit the bullet and told her truthfully, \"It was nice hanging out with you though. I had a really great time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too,\" she smiled, blushing a little again, the streak of red across her freckle dotted cheeks making her look all the cuter, causing you to nervously grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding then to take things a step further and ask her what had clearly been playing on your mind ever since you'd left the restaurant, you went completely for broke and said, after a brief pause, \"...Maybe we can do it again some time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately her initial reaction to this was not quite what you'd hoped for, practically biting at her tongue as she stared at you with an look of unease painted across her still slightly blushing face, as if wrestling with something inside her head. \"<i>Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! SHIT!</i>\" you chanted to yourself, realizing that you must have read the signals wrong, feeling your heart sink a little in your chest as it became quite apparent that this cute and funny girl was about to say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't however and instead after about ten or fifteen seconds, said, \"<i>Yes!</i>\" the word leaping out of her mouth with such enthusiasm and candor that it almost felt like it had been imprisoned there and was making a desperate bid to be free. \"Yes I would. I really would like that,\" she continued, smiling from ear to ear now and looking a little embarrassed herself as she quickly pulled a scrap of paper and a pen out of her satchel and began scribbling something down. \"That's my number if you want to give me a call,\" she told you as she passed you it, before turning and quickly scampering off, calling out behind her, \"See you later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a little taken aback by what had just happened, as well as the suddenness of it all, you watched as she disappeared down the street to wherever her friend was picking her up and called out, \"Night!\", before turning your attention to the piece of paper and seeing a cell phone number, as well as a few little kisses written on it. This of course, brought home to you what had happened, you sense of dread that she was going to reject you (as had happened a few times in the past) suddenly giving way to a intense feeling of joy, as you pumped a fist in the air in celebration and silently mouthed; \"<i>Yes!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things are looking up now,\" you said to yourself with a smile as you placed the number into your pocked and began making your way home, glad after all that your friends had convinced you to go out on this date, and even more glad that it was with Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning home, around twenty or so minutes later, and after a good grilling from your sister over how your night had gone (as well as a call from Mike who was also anxious to find out), you lay there on your bed just staring at the number Emily had given you, wondering if you should give her a call now or not, realizing that it might seem a bit kind of desperate and instead deciding to simply send her a text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAD GR8T TIME TONIGHT. CAN'T W8T TO MEET UP AGAIN. YOU FREE ANYTIME SOON?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a minute later, you received a reply that read; \"ME 2. WAS A LOT OF FUN. HOW DOES TOMORROW LUNCH SOUND? :)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SOUNDS GR8T! :D,\" you quickly replied, not for one minute thinking that it would be so soon, but happy that she wanted to actually meet up again at school, \"MEET YOU BY FRONT ENTRANCE @ AROUND 12?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOKIN FORWARD 2 IT. XXX\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading that, you instantly fell back again onto your bed, grinning away to yourself like a mad man, hoping that things would continue to go as well tomorrow as they seemingly had tonight, not being able to wait to find out more about this truly awesome and exciting girl.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning you awoke with a spring in your step and quickly got dressed and ate breakfast, anxious for the first time in a long while to actually get to school, ignoring the less than subtle teasing that was being dished out by your elder sister as you headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at school, you received more of the same from your friends as Mike and Clara cornered you in the hallway almost as soon as they'd spotted you, wanting to know more about your date and about Emily, who Mike was now a lot more interesting in actually meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I suppose she's kind of geeky,\" you told them, after Clara had brought up how studious she was and how she'd heard she'd previously been top of her class, \"But not like full on Math club-geeky. More kind of cute-geeky; y'know, like being into anime and video games and stuff. I mean she plays Mass Effect for God sake! <i>How cool is that?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is pretty cool,\" Mike agreed, adding jokingly \"But if it turns out she is a total nerd, then you realize we're going to have to destroy her right?\" putting on a fake English accent as he proclaimed, \"<i>The nerds must not be allowed to thrive!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving her boyfriend a sharp jab to the chest with her elbow, used to these kind of ridiculous outbursts, Clara told him to, \"Shut up you idiot,\" before turning her attention back to you again. \"Just ignore him Ryan. She sounds really nice, I'm glad it went well for you last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too,\" you agreed, smiling away to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just joking, dude, good on ya!\" Mike then said, having recovered from Clara's elbow and giving you a playful little slap on the back. \"Just tell me when our first double date is gonna be and I'll be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Might be a little too soon to start thinking about that,\" you chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mike. Give the boy a chance to get to know her first will you!\" Clara said, admonishing Mike yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, I just can't win here can I?\" he laughed, feigning injured pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently not,\" came Clara's response. \"So you gonna see her again anytime soon, Ryan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today actually. She wants to meet up for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking suitably impressed by this, your best friend grinned, \"Hot dang - A second date already. Way to go bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReceiving a few further congratulatory slaps on the back from Mike as you tried to tell him that it wasn't really a date, the three of you then headed off to class, with Clara giving you a few little tips on what to say and what not to say, adding that she'd put in a good word for you with Emily during History, before you all then went your separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the morning went by pretty quickly and after one or two more run ins with Mike and Clara, and after receiving a smiley face text message from Emily, eventually lunch time rolled around, and feeling your excitement rising again, you stuffed your books and your bag into your locker and headed off towards the front entrance to find her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you made it!\" she smiled, as you made your way over to where she was stood, at the bottom of the steps, waiting patiently for you, dressed again in a cute but quirky little outfit, complete with long stripey socks, but with her hair this time pinned back slightly with a yellow butterfly shaped clasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, where else would I be?\" you replied, spotting a large blue book clutched tightly beneath one arm and indicating towards it jokingly, \"Just doing a bit of light reading there were you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this? Heh-heh. No,\" Emily giggled, looking down at the book, giving you a little glimpse of the cover which had some sort of large green reptile on it, \"This is just uh, just something I'm working on for Biology. Wanted to get it out of the library first before anyone else had the same idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, smart thinking. So, you wanna go grab something to eat then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the two of you headed off to get some lunch, picking up exactly where you'd left off the previous night, losing none of the rapport you'd established as you laughed and giggled with one another all the way to the nearest fast food joint, learning a lot more about each other in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that things progressed pretty well between the two of you, meeting up with Emily again the next day and the next one after that, before finally working up the courage to ask her out again, this time to the cinema which she gladly accepted. Though the movie was pretty bad, the two of you had a great time, and although neither of you had yet made any kind of moves or made any reference to actually being boyfriend and girlfriend, you began to get the distinct impression that this was where things were heading, and were pretty darn happy about it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a week later, and after one or two more 'half dates' with Emily, Mike and Clara informed you that they were going to be having a party at Mike's house while his parents were away and suggested you ask her along which you then promptly did. Agreeing to it after an little bit of persuasion Emily seemed to get on well with your friends and they seemed to like her too, finding her quirkiness kind of amusing, especially after she accidentally knocked an entire keg of beer into the pool (which had thankfully been unopened). With everything else going relatively smoothly and Emily having a good time (although avoiding the booze that everyone else was partaking in you noticed), you thought now might be the time to take things to the next level, spotting pretty much every other couple making out or dancing provocatively with one another, and decided to try and get in one some of that action, leading her onto the 'dance floor' (Mike's living room) where you began busting some of your, admittedly, rather lame movies. Cracking up at these at first, eventually she started to join in a little herself, her dance moves being ironically enough, almost as bad as yours, only in a rather more adorable sort of way, and feeling bold now (having had a few drinks yourself), you then placed your hands onto her hips in an effort to achieve some actual physical contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily however, quickly pulled away, causing your hands to fall back, and fearing that you'd offended her you immediately went to apologize, finding to your surprise that she continued on happily dancing as nothing had even happened. \"<i>Okay, that was kind of weird</i>,\" you thought to yourself, glad that you hadn't totally blown it but being slightly perplexed by what had just took place, wondering to yourself if perhaps she was one of those girls that didn't like physical contact or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaying what had happened the next day to Clara, wondering if you had indeed done something wrong, she reassuringly informed you, \"Nah, it was probably just nothing Ryan, don't sweat it. She probably just wants to take things a little slower, and didn't feel like having your drunk hands pawing all over her, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, dude. I mean she didn't scream at you or storm off or anything, that's got to be a good sign,\" Mike added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so,\" you replied, not entirely sure you actually believed it though. \"It's just I've got absolutely no idea what it is she's thinking. I mean we get on really well and stuff, but are we actually going out or does she just want to be friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Ryan, you need to stop over thinking things so much,\" Clara sighed, shaking her head and grabbing yours firmly between her hands, telling you in no uncertain terms, \"Cause trust me when I say; <i>she's totally into you</i>. It's obvious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know so,\" she said, letting go of your face again, \"So stop worrying so much and just go with the flow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this coming from Clara, an actual girl with actual experience of dating (even if it was with Mike) made you feel a whole lot better about what had happened, and deciding to take her advice to not worry so much, you did just that, meeting up with Emily again for lunch soon after and continuing on as if everything was normal.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a moment you'd even considered leaning over and giving her a quick peck on the cheek while she was eating her fries, but you thought better of it, figuring that just this was enough for now, and perhaps you could maybe risk that later when you were alone together at her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday arrived a few days later and after arranging to meet Emily at the mall in the morning, wanting you both to be out of the way while her parents set off to avoid the hundreds of questions she was certain they'd ask, the two of you did a bit of shopping to pass the time, mostly looking for video games and music, but Emily making a brief detour into a couple of clothing stores as well, seemingly in desperate need of new clothes (having had some some sort of washing machine accident a few days ago that had ruined a whole load of hers). Then, after grabbing a quick bite to eat, you and Emily finally made your way over to her house, where much to her frustration, she discovered her parents outside, still loading up the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, sweetie, who's your friend?\" her mother asked, giving you a quick once over as you both approached (looking very much like an older version of Emily, albeit with a few extra pounds, lighter hair and a great deal more wrinkles).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! I thought you guys were supposed to be away already,\" Emily groaned, ignoring the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we were, but you know your father; it's always one thing after another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReceiving another inquisitive glance from her mom while her father fumbled about in the background with various bags, dropping half of them onto the floor (clearly possessing the same clumsiness gene as his daughter), you thought you'd probably best introduce yourself, not wanting to appear rude, and giving them both a wave, you said, \"Hi, I'm Ryan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course led to, just as Emily had predicted, a great deal more follow up questions, some of which made Emily groan even further and at times turn a little red (and in truth, you as well on occasion). Thankfully though, her parents seemed like really nice people and they appeared to take to you well, her mother in particular commenting on \"what a nice young man\" you were after offering her husband a hand getting the bags into the car, as well as inviting you over for dinner when they returned. Much to Emily's relief, they then finally took off, though not because she was embarrassed of them (at least that was what you'd gleamed from how they all interacted with one another; Emily seemingly having quite a good relationship with her parents), but more so because she was embarrassed by what they might say or ask <i>you</i>, getting the distinct impression that you were probably the first boy she had ever brought home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading inside, you then got your first peek at Emily's bedroom. It being like her; a mixture of cuteness, geekiness and downright nerdiness. The entire room was decorated in a bright pink color with fluffy teddies all over the place, as well as various little anime and video game statues and a huge big picture of Albert Einstein taking up most of one wall. Although weirdly enough there were a few large tears through Albert's face, which had been taped back up, as well as it seemed quite a deep scratches and scuff marks decorating most of the walls, something that you couldn't help but point out. \"You don't have a real one of those things hiding under your bed do you?\" you asked, indicating to one of her teddy bears, then placing a finger on one of the scratches next to the poster, \"One who has something against old Albert here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. No,\" Emily giggled, looking slightly nervous for a second, before explaining, \"That's just from me being clumsy. I'm always falling over and wrecking stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccepting this and thinking nothing more of it, the two of you then got down to listening to some of the purchases you'd made at the mall, before playing some of Emily's video games, starting off with Mass Effect (which she was actually pretty fantastic at) and eventually moving on to, as somewhat of a joke, Hello Kitty - The game that had gotten the two of you together in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few games of that, the two of you then decided to watch a movie, Emily choosing Men in Black, which was a favorite of yours, serving up a big bowl of popcorn to complement the movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow seated next to one another in the living room, on her parent's comfy leather couch with Emily snuggled up against your right shoulder, you found it somewhat difficult to keep your attention exclusively on the movie. Seeing Emily sitting there, with the bowl of popcorn nestled snugly between her legs, laughing away and looking amazingly cute and beautiful while she did, you couldn't stop yourself from just wanting to lean over and kiss her right there and then on those perky little lips; having wanted to do it practically all day...scratch that; <i> all week!</i> Even though you were aware of the whole 'taking things slow' approach she obviously wanted to take (having not actually come out and said it, but still getting the hint), today had been a lot different from any other day. You were in her house, her inner sanctum. You'd sat on her bed and watched her dancing away in front of you while listening to music. You held hands on more than one occasion. She'd even brushed fluff out of your hair hitting you with a pillow. And now this. Now she was pressed up against you on the couch, practically resting her head against your chest and looking as comfortable with you now as you'd ever seen her. Surely if there was a time to make a move then this was it, no matter what Clara had advised. And surely Emily wouldn't take offense to something as small and innocent as a little kiss? Not after all you'd done together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's now or never</i>,\" you thought, running your tongue along the edge of your lips and staring down at Emily's still smiling face, having finally decided to make your move, leaning your head forward a little towards hers. Noticing the movement above her, Emily looked up, and staring into her big, inquisitive green eyes, you flashed her a reassuring smile of your own and quickly brought your lips towards hers...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However she didn't, and instead pulled her head back, leaving you hanging there about to kiss thin air, feeling incredibly embarrassed, not to mention confused. \"Uh, eh..so-sorry,\" you rather awkwardly mumbled, turning a little red, watching as she did the same, \"I uh, I was just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's, it's...cool,\" she replied, avoiding your gaze and trying to make light of what had just happened, before suddenly standing up and saying, \"I've just...I've just got to get something from my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly hurrying out the door, she left you alone to plant your face in your hands and let out a frustrated groan, your impulse having spectacularly backfired, though not being entirely sure what it was you'd done wrong. All the signals were there...Heck, you'd been almost convinced by the look on her face that she'd actually wanted to <i>kiss you too!</i> So why the hell did she suddenly turn cold and run away like some frightened little mouse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Shit, I've got to find out what's going on</i>,\" you told yourself, getting up off the couch, \"<i>I've got to find out whether she actually likes me in that way or not!</i>\" So, psyching yourself up, you quickly headed after Emily towards her room, determined to find out what the hell was going on; why she was all loved-up one second and giving you the cold shoulder the next. It almost seeming like she was actually scared of getting too close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her bedroom, you found her pacing back and forth, muttering to herself, as if she was trying to, in some strange way, calm herself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily,\" you said, stepping into the room, your voice causing her to stop mid step and look round, \"I'm sorry but I've got to ask; what's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What uh, what do you mean?\" she replied, obviously being a little startled by your presence (as well as seemingly having caught her doing whatever it was she was doing).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean <i>with us</i>. Back there. I only wanted to give you a little kiss to show you that I'm crazy about you. Why did you freak out like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I didn't freak out,\" she told you, stammering nervously now, but still trying to put on a brave face, \"I just had to get something that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you weren't able to see right through it; Emily not exactly being the best liar you'd ever seen. \"Come on, Emily, don't lie. Don't you like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Of course I like you,\" was her immediate response, seeming almost offended that you had to ask. \"You're like the coolest, funniest, handsomest guy I've ever met!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why won't you let me kiss you? Or like put my hands on your hips when we were dancing at that party? Or even admit that we're boyfriend and girlfriend? We've been seeing each other for like three weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will...I..I mean, <i>I want to</i>. It's just that...I'm...I'm...I'm not really sure how to explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were of course frustrated and upset, you could see from the look on her face and the sincerity in her voice (mixed with the difficulty she was clearly having) that there was definitely something she wasn't telling you, or perhaps something she couldn't. \"Is it something that happened in the past with another guy?\" you asked, realizing that you might be opening a can of worms here, but figuring that perhaps it might be the reason she was acting this way, not wanting to be a total insensitive jerk. \"Something bad? Is that why you can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, it's nothing like that,\" she told you, adamantly shaking her head, \"And it's not that I can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's just that you don't want to, <i>with me</i>.\" Pretty sure that that was where she was going, and feeling like you'd just had a sharp knife thrust through your chest, you shook your head at her, and said, \"You know what? Fine! If you're not interested in me then that's cool. I just wish you hadn't strung me along all this time.\" Having had enough of her games, and wanting to get as far away from her as possible right now, you then turned towards the door and told her, \"Guess I'll see you arou- -\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could get the last syllable out however, you suddenly felt Emily's hand on your shoulder, pulling you back as she rather aggressively pounced at you, pressing her lips hard against yours and wrapping both arms around your neck, finally and rather unexpectedly, giving you the kiss you'd long desired. \"<i>Holy shit!</i>\" you thought to yourself, standing there slightly stunned as Emily's cherry flavored lips attacked your own, her tongue pushing it's way into your mouth and kissing you in a way you hadn't been kissed in a very long time. Eventually though, getting over the abruptness of it and realizing that this was happening; that <i>you were actually making out with her</i>, you too wrapped your arms around Emily's small frame and enthusiastically kissed back, enjoying the sensation of her mouth on yours and the closeness of your bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must have stood there making out with each another for a good two or three minutes, feeling like soon you were going to have to come up for air, before Emily finally broke the kiss and dropped back down again, releasing her arms from around your neck. \"<i>Wow...</i>\" you said, completely knocked for six as you looked upon her incredibly flushed, freckled little face, wearing just about the biggest smile you'd ever seen as she giggled rather coyly and began biting at her upper lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know how long I've wanted to do that,\" she told you, almost echoing your thoughts exactly, though still leaving you somewhat confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you had done it earlier,\" you replied, gasping a little for air and feeling bad about a lot of the things you'd said previously, \"<i>A lot earlier!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily seemed to ignore this however, and instead looked up at you again, her eyes practically glowing with desire. \"In fact, I think I will do it again!\" she grinned, licking at her lips and slowly bringing her arms up around your neck again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, yeah. Sure,\" you went to reply, having absolutely no reservations about kissing her again (as well as being slightly taken aback by this side of Emily that you'd certainly never seen before). Before you could though, Emily was once again upon you, pulling herself up and pushing your mouths together, this time with even more passion than she had done the previous time. The suddenness of this attack on your lips nearly caused you to topple over, just managing to find your footing as Emily's tongue forced it's was into your mouth again, and you felt her hands grappling at the back of your head, squashing your lips harder against hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Holy crap, Emily's pretty aggressive!</i>\" you thought to yourself as tried to keep up with her kissing, finding it becoming increasingly more difficult, almost as if she were possessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, hang on a sec here Emily, slow down!\" you tried to tell her, managing to pull your mouth away just long enough to get the words outs, before she was back on you again, leaping up with her full weight this time and wrapping her legs around you. The force of this was too much for you on this occasion, physically knocking you back and causing your knees to buckle against the edge of her bed, resulting in the both of you falling backwards onto it's surface, with Emily still clinging tightly on top. If that wasn't enough, during your short fall onto the bed, Emily lips had remained locked onto yours; still kissing you with a furious gusto that defied explanation, her tongue, weirdly enough, seeming almost as if it was actually reaching all the way down your throat, which you knew was impossible, but still somehow managing to make you feel like you were going to gag.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Emuhluh, stlop!\" you shouted, your mouth muffled by hers, finding that although you enjoyed kissing, this was way too much. Not only was Emily sucking on half your face, but her hands were now running all over your face and chest, while beneath you could feel her lower half grinding rhythmically against yours, practically dry humping you right there and then on the bed, acting more like some sort of wild animal than the sweet girl you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to take much more, feeling like you were being slightly violated now rather than enjoying fully what was going on, you yelled, \"<i>Emuhluh...PLEASE!</i>\", forcing her off you with your hands, finally managing to gasp for air. \"Jesus, what the hell is wrong with you?\" you said, coughing and spluttering slightly, as a hand clutched for your throat, glad to have got rid of what ever phantom obstruction was blocking your windpipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing iss wrong with me,\" came Emily's almost crazed sounding reply, as you looked up at her through slightly bleary eyes, \"I just want you so freaking bad!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second you thought you were seeing things as your eyes focused on her face, finding that her own eyes no longer appeared to be the large, soft green ones you'd seen before, but instead looked far more like those of a reptile; the whites having completely disappeared, replaced instead by a yellowy/green color with two thin slits where the pupils should be. \"<i>What the hell...</i>\" was your first reaction, pretty certain that those weren't contact lenses she was wearing, the iris's seeming to shrink and expand as Emily's eyes locked onto yours, her face full of lust and her tongue hanging out of her mouth as she leaned down again to continue her attack. This was when you shifted your attention away from her eyes and over to her tongue, suddenly noticing that it was far thinner and paler than you'd ever noticed before, not to mention longer; stretching out at a good 9 or 10 inches and seemingly growing, with two little pointy forks at the end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...my...God...Emily what the fuck has happened to your tongue?!\" you suddenly blurted, finding the sight as disturbing as hell, as it appeared to be somehow snaking it's way towards you, turning greener and greener as it did. You'd never seen anything like this before in your life, and added to the weird, reptilian looking eyes that she was now wearing, you had to admit you were suitably freaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping you from trying to get up, placing her hands on your shoulders and pushing you back down, Emily's face continued towards you, looking you directly in the eye as she purred (while that freaky looking lizard tongue moved ever nearer), \"Nothing. It just wantss to come out and play.\" Shooting directly out at you, defying all reason and logic, it began lapping at your face, smearing a cold and slimy, saliva like substance all over your skin. Before you could even scream out in horror at what ever the hell was happening, the serpent like tongue then lept down your throat, gagging you as Emily mouth closed round yours, passionately kissing you again, all the while miraculously managing to keep you pinned down, even though you were like almost twice her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of having something long and slippery slithering it's way down your throat was beyond anything you'd ever experienced before, and all you could do was struggle and try to push Emily off, having gone well beyond confusion and disgust and being into sheer terror now; unable to understand what the hell was going on or why Emily was doing this. Your efforts proved fruitless however, finding that for some strange unknown reason, you were being overpowered by this 5' 3\", 90 pound girl. A 90 pound girl that was actually beginning to feel a whole lot heavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing your mouth once more and feeling that long tongue slip out from your throat, Emily squealed, \"God, you don't know how long I've waited for thisss!\" her voice sounding much more throaty and wild, like she was completely losing control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were obviously still in shock at what had just happened, your flight instinct was still very much there, your brain telling you to 'run' and get the hell out of there as fast as you could. You still couldn't move though, not with your legs beneath Emily's and her hands still pressing down on your shoulders, so instead you started to plead. \"Please, Emily....oh God, please let me up...I don't know what the fuck is going on here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was no longer listening to you, her face scrunching up in a sort of ecstasy, as she closed her eyes and began huffing and puffing, letting out long, loud groans. \"<i>Oh God....oh God, oh God...</i>\" she squealed, her body heaving in and out, and pulling her head right back, she finally screamed, \"I CAN'T HOLD IT ANY LONGER!!\" and you watched as the most impossible, surreal and downright terrifying transformation you'd ever witnessed in your life began to take place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with her chest, the strappy blue shirt with the little rainbow on it that Emily had been wearing tightening dramatically around her small breasts...breasts that you realized were actually growing bigger, much, <i>much</i> bigger; inflating from her chest like two fleshy water balloons, displaying a dramatic cleavage that you'd never imagined ever seeing on her small frame, stretching the material of the top to it's limits and causing the B cup bra that once held them to actually snap. Her breasts however, weren't the only thing that was inflating, as not too soon after, you realized that her entire body was also, that feeling off excess weight you'd noticed earlier dramatically increasing now as Emily shot up several inches one way and expanded several the other; her thin arms and legs gaining extra mass and transforming into bulging, tightening muscle. In only a matter of seconds, you watched as her clothes began to rip, starting with her long stripy socks, the seams splitting up and down their length as her legs grew longer and thicker, her new calve and thigh muscles swelling right out of the stretchy material, causing it to tear. The same thing soon began to happen to her top, though it was doing it's utmost to cling on for dear life, even with her now watermelon sized breasts bulging out of it, pulling it taut and revealing hardening abdominal muscles beneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was going on so too were other changes; Emily's soft, pink complexion turning a sickly sort of pale green, her once youthful girlish flesh appearing to thicken as little blotches and bumps began forming beneath it's surface, pushing out into dark green lizard-like scales that completely covered almost two thirds of her body (leaving only the fleshy middle parts, such as the center of her face, chest, belly, inner arms and inner thighs clear). Not only that, but her face and head was changing too; her short brown hair growing progressively darker, becoming a sort of greenish black that began retracting back into her head, while below her ears and once cute little button nose soon followed suit, leaving only two large slits where her nostrils had once been. Her eyes that had remained tightly closed during this bizarre transformation began to grow too, as did the teeth inside her now wide open mouth, becoming much sharper and longer, her eyeteeth becoming a very obvious, very dangerous looking set of fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShooting up further and further, placing more and more weight on top of your legs, you spotted a long green tale slithering it's way out from beneath her pleated grey skirt, expanding quickly in size and lashing around behind as Emily continued to moan, seemingly overcome with some sort of intense feeling of orgasmic bliss as she became less and less human and more like some sort of freakish humanoid lizard creature. After one final heave or her now, ridiculously huge, porn star sized chest, her top finally gave way and exploded as two of the biggest, roundest pair of pale green breasts bounded out and jiggled around before you, each one clearly much bigger than your own head and adorned by two huge, thick green swollen nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a huge roaring hiss that practically shook the entire bedroom, the nightmarish transformation finally came to an end, and the creature that had once been the girl of your dreams stretched out before you; it's bald, scaly head now pressing up against the ceiling and it's well over 6 foot long tail thrashing about wildly behind, knocking things off of various tables and shelves, as a huge reptilian hand grabbed at it's chest and began squeezing and kneading one it's gigantic mounds, pulling at the distended nipple, while the other reached down towards it's now incredibly overstretched skirt (that by some miracle had managed to hang on for dear life) and tore it off with ease, exposing it's bare, sopping wet, fleshy green vagina, slipping a long clawed finger between it's folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what to do as you lay there, gripped by absolute terror, feeling your body trembling uncontrollably as sweet and quirky little Emily had been replaced by an 8 foot tall lizard monster with a rippling muscular physique, far beyond that of any bodybuilder. A sight which was undoubtedly the most horrifying, heart stopping and panic inducing thing you'd ever seen in your short life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ceasing it's groping for a moment and pulling a now soaking wet finger from between it's legs, a sort of slimy, translucent green substance oozing off it and dripping down onto your chest, the reptilian creature gazed down at you with the same look of unquenchable lust painted on it's strange, half human face that had previously been on Emily's (the face still carrying a startling similarity to her own) and began snarling and hissing uncontrollably, slithering it's long, forked tongue back and forth from it's mouth and displaying fully it's incredibly sharp and intimidating teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh sweet Jesus</i>,\" you heard yourself say inside your head, but no sound escaped your lips, gripped by too much fear to even move or speak, feeling like you were suddenly reliving one of those recurring nightmares you used to have in your youth, ever since your elder siblings had forced you to watch those creepy werewolf movies that used to terrify you. Back then you'd tried to convince yourself that such things simply weren't real and not to worry about them, which had worked for a time. Now though you'd just found out that those things were <i>indeed real</i>, that monsters really did <i>exist</i>, and that one of them was seemingly about to tear you to pieces and you were utterly powerless to stop it, feeling once again like that frightened young boy...only this time, about a million times worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than ripping your throat out there and then, the lizard creature instead began lapping and slavering all over your face with it's tongue, causing you to let out a small whimper (of both relief and disgust), before removing it's clawed hand from it's ginormous green bosom and grabbing at both your shirt and your jeans, ripping them clean off your body with a growl, leaving you in nothing but your underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't really understand what was happening; why the hell this thing had stripped you of your clothes. Was it simply toying with you, playing with it's prey before it killed it? Or was it perhaps because, far more worryingly, it wasn't planning on simply killing you...it was planning on <i>eating you</i> and didn't want bits of your clothing sticking in it's teeth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer to that question appeared to be yes, as you watched it's eyes shift downwards now towards your boxers, it's tongue slithering away from your face and making it's way down your body, across your chest and belly towards them. \"<i>Oh God. Oh God. Oh God, Oh God, Oh God...</i>\" you chanted to yourself as you watched it slide under the waistband. Instead of pulling them off though, as it had the rest of your clothes, you suddenly felt the slippery protuberance wrap it's self around your member, causing your eyes to widen in panic and your body to jolt as it then yanked the whole thing clean out of your underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reptilian creature let out a raspy groan as this happened and drool began to drip from it's mouth, looking very much now like it was about to devour your penis first as you finally managed to let out a tiny little squeak. \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>Oh please God, no!</i></font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for the second time in as many minutes did you feel a huge sigh of relief, as the monster thankfully refrained from biting your penis off (at least for the moment), and began roughly massaging it with it's tongue, pulling and squeezing at it as if the thing was trying to masturbate you. This not only confused you greatly, but left rather a conflicted feeling; being obviously terrified for you life and petrified to the bone, but at the same time unable to do anything about the feeling of pleasure that was now occurring within your crotch. Your penis doing what was only natural, starting to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What the fuck is happening?!</i>\" you wanted to scream as the creature's tongue clamped down tighter, tugging and pulling harder and harder until your cock was standing up straight and dripping with saliva. What it was doing to you making absolutely no sense. Though admittedly as did pretty much everything else that had occurred since Emily had kissed you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your penis now fully erect, the lizard beast let out another stomach churning roar and reared itself back up fully again, causing paint from the ceiling to flake off like little patches of snow and the bed beneath you to loudly creak. You weren't sure what was going to happen now, the slimy tongue having ceased its massaging but still clinging tightly on as you watched the creature slide it's huge muscular legs up your body, seemingly position itself so that it's drooling lizard vagina was now hovering directly above your penis. \"<i>Oh my fucking God!</i>\" you started to squeal, realizing what the monster was going to do, but at the same time not quite actually believing it as you saw it's tongue holding your erection straight while it began lowering itself down, feeling it's cold juices dripping onto your skin and going almost paralytic as it did. This thing, this monster, <i>was about to have sex with you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a long, high pitched groan that was quickly drowned out by an almost glass shattering, animalistic howl, you felt the slimy, ooze covered flaps of it's reptilian vagina press against your penis and quickly engulfing it, experiencing the strangest yet most incredible sensation ever, as you were then released from the tightness of the tongue's grasp, and plunged into something far tighter, wetter and slippier; the coldness of it's fleshy tunnel causing a shiver to run up and down the entire length of your spine as it's muscles clamped down around it, squeezing it for all it was worth. Before you could properly even process what was happening, or the fact that your dick was now tightly stuffed inside a monstrous lizard creature's vagina (the first vagina you'd not only ever touched, but ever seen too) and that it was painfully clear that this thing was indeed about to rape you, the giant green beast lowered itself down fully so that it's crotch was now resting against yours and let out yet another loud roar as it began thrusting it's body against you, pounding it's massive weight on top of your fragile human frame and forcing your erection in and out of it's sucking wet hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming at the top of your lungs, \"OH GOD! OH JESUS!\", feeling the most intense mixture of both pain and delight, as the creature's heavy body slammed into yours, it's vice like vaginal muscles pulling and squeezing at your penis, sending shock waves of pleasure through your crotch and into the rest of your body, causing what should be the most mind-numbingly frightening and traumatic experience of your life to be also unbelievably arousing in a manner you couldn't even begin to describe. Here you were, a semi popular, slightly geeky and a bit shy, 18 year old boy with ridiculously little in the way of sexual experience, finding yourself having your virginity forcefully taken by a giant lizard, whom you were certain was going to kill you. If that didn't make for conflicting feelings you didn't know what would. Not that the insane pleasure you were deriving from it's drooling sex (the thick juices that it was producing now running down onto your crotch and thighs) was doing anything to offset the terrifying nature of all this of course. Still having a giant, ravenous, 8 foot humanoid reptile with sharp fangs and claws straddling you on the bed, bouncing up and down with it's full weight and causing the frame to buckle beneath you, as well as various pictures and things to start falling from the walls as the creature violently hissed and moaned, the horrific noise being unable to drown out the loud squelching sounds coming from your crotches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, you were surprised you were still conscious, having assumed the shock of it all would have made you pass out a long time ago, but for some reason you hadn't. You didn't know if it was the adrenalin or perhaps even the endorphins created by this freakish sex that was keeping you going, either way you kind of wished they weren't, being simply unsure how much more your heart could take, having heard enough stories of people dying of heart attacks due to prolonged and intense terror, which this certainly was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature didn't seem to care however, not about you or what effect it was having, appearing to be interested in one thing and one thing only, and that was it's satisfying it's own carnal desires; the howls and groans sounding violent sure, but being quite obviously cries of pleasure as it pounded itself furiously against you, craving some kind of release. And once it got it...well, you could only assume it was lights out for you. If this wild and aggressive sex didn't kill you, then the monster certainly would!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though only minutes had past since this horrendous beast had plunged you deep inside it; maybe five, possibly ten...to you it seemed like an eternity, feeling like a piece of meat being battered and bruised by every powerful thrust. Though you were literally doing nothing but laying there, unable to move and no longer having the energy to scream or shout, you felt you body being sapped, both emotionally and physically as the creature continued pounding away, feeling the occasional claw scratching painfully at your skin as it pressed it's massive hands against your chest for a brief moment, making it extremely difficult to breath, before once more returning them to it's own body and those two massive jiggling breasts that it seemed to enjoy groping so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough for all the pain and anguish happening outside, on the inside, in the slimy, cold reptilian embrace of the monster's pussy, your cock was receiving the workout of a lifetime; experiencing the kind of pleasure that even your greatest masturbatory session could not equal. The tightness of it, combined with the pulsating, elastic walls of the monster's vaginal canal creating the most intense, sexually exciting sensation you had ever known. Sliding in and out of the dripping wet slit for the last however many minutes, a build up of pressure had steadily been growing within both your penis and your balls, a build up that finally could last no longer, your loins feeling like a volcano now that was about ready to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>OHHHHHHHHHHH GOD</i>!\" you squealed, letting out a short serious of grunts as unable to hold on any longer (and not really wanting to either) you felt yourself orgasm and your penis explode within the depths of the monster, spurting out semen into it's already gushing wet tunnel and feeling an almost euphoric wave hit you as your body began to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it lasted for long, as although you were finished, having both blown your load and said goodbye to your virginity (albeit in the least ideal way), the lizard creature wasn't done yet and was still thrashing about on top of you, pushing down harder and harder now, as if racing your slowly softening cock, causing an intense crushing sensation in your groin and causing your body to tense right back up again, now no longer having the pleasure to counterbalance the horror of your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster thankfully didn't last too much longer either, as after only a few more frantic, powerful thrusts, one of which caused the bed frame to finally snap, the entire thing collapsing beneath you, and the force of the sudden drop seemingly managing to finish the creature off. Landing with a loud thud and releasing the longest, loudest, most headache inducing moan yet, almost putting it's head straight though the roof in the process, the creature went rigid for a moment and squeezed at it's large green breasts so tight that you thought they were going to explode, shaking and spasming violently on top of you as the force of it's own orgasm appeared to rip through it's gigantic body and a flood of thick slimy mucus poured out from it's vagina onto your body. Though it was clearly feeling an intense, almost paralytic feeling of pleasure, the sight of the lizard thing shuddering around on top of you, with it's jaws stretched wide, it's tongue thrashing wildly, it's long scaly tale stretched out behind, shaking back and forth like a rattlesnake, and it's sharp claws digging into it's own flesh, the sight of it all looked horrifyingly painful and rather disturbing to watch (more so than anything you'd seen thus far), wanting desperately to close your eyes and look away, but finding that you were unable to, being very much like the proverbial rabbit caught in the headlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew though that after this, after it had come down from whatever orgasmic high it was now experiencing, that then was the end for you. You had survived this long with the monster, trapped alone in the girly pink bedroom, out of pure luck that whatever this thing was had more than one appetite it needed to satisfy, but now your time was up. This thing was going to rip you to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith whatever time you had left, you began to pray to God and started to think about all the things you were leaving behind (not being particularly religious or anything, but now seeming like a good time to start), preparing yourself for when the inevitable finally came. You didn't get far however, as less than fifteen seconds after it had begun to spasm wildly, it's motion began to slow and it's body started to relax, clearly now coming down from the pleasurable high you, in your final moments, had inadvertently managed to give it, having used you as a sort of toy for it's own sexual gratification. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill moaning away, though slightly quieter and more stilted now as it ground it's pelvis into yours, you suddenly noticed something that you hadn't before, and that was that it's very clearly animalistic and reptilian cries were actually beginning to sound a lot more human, certain that you could almost pick up a word in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour theory was soon proved correct, as less than a second or two later, that long, drawn out growl, very clearly transformed before your own ears into the word; \"<i>YESSSSSSSSS!</i>\" followed soon after by, \"<i>OH GOD YESSSSSSSSS!</i>\", the tone of the voice, though slightly lower and a tad warped, being instantly recognizable as Emily's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's voice wasn't the only thing transforming either, as soon after, the large reptilian creature began to shrink; it's huge, muscular frame growing smaller and smaller, while those giant fleshy mounds bulging proudly out from it's chest started to deflate. Still with your softening, battered and bruised penis inside this things gripping wet, slippery tunnel, you watched as it's body seemed to melt away around you, changing just as it had done before; it's thick, dark green scaly hide sinking back into it's skin as it's complexion once again lightened. It's claws retracted into it's finger's, as did it's sharp, menacing teeth. The long tale that had been thrashing wildly around behind it thinned and shortened, as if being pulling back into it's spine. Hair also began to appear again out of it's bald scalp, dark and green, while it's eyes reverted to normal size and the large nostril slits gave way again to a nose, pushing it's way back out of it's face, with ears soon following, causing the creature to take on a much more human appearance again. In a mere matter of seconds the once 8 foot tall beast had shrunk down to 7 feet, then 6, the scales having all but vanished now and it's green skin becoming a creamier pink. It's body was no longer a hulking great mass, having shed nearly all of it's immense weight, taking a great deal of pressure off of your legs and groin as it slimmed; those once bountiful, jiggling green breasts now nothing more than two small lumps of flesh with cute little pink nipples perched on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the creatures face as it dropped another several inches, you could see it's slimy tongue retracting back into it's still moaning mouth, changing color as well and losing it's forked end. The hair on it's head had also rapidly grown and was lightening, becoming brown as it fell now just below the ears, several large bangs falling across it's face, as those horrible greenish/yellow reptilian eyes faded into a perfectly ordinary green pair, until the thing now perched on top of you, rocking gently back and forth and letting out little mewing noises of pleasure, was Emily once more; her body drenched in sweat and her cute little (human) vagina still impaled on your penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...that...that was...\" she began to pant, looking absolutely exhausted and clearly still in the grip of some sort of post orgasmic haze as she struggled to get the words out. Finally managing to breathly declare, \"...That was <i>incredible!</i>\", before her small naked body, expended of all energy, collapsed onto yours, causing your slime coated genitals to separate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously you were slightly stunned and hugely confused, having just survived the most frightening, most traumatic experience ever, watching your (wanna be) girlfriend's body being taken over by some horrific beast and then forcibly raping you, only to discover that she hadn't been taken over by it at all; <i>she was the beast!</i> That thing, that vicious, terrifying, lizard monster <i>was</i> Emily, and it had all but nearly killed you!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Whimpering again at this revelation, more freaked out and confused than ever before, your sore and exhausted body quickly sprung into action, pushing Emily off of you, aware that this was your opportunity to escape and get away from...from....<i>whatever the hell she was! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately things didn't go quite as planned, as during your manic scramble to get out from underneath her and off the now flattened bed, you slid awkwardly off the end of the mattress (due in no small part to the slimy juices coating most of your lower half), whacking your head against the carpeted floor and letting out a loud, painful yelp. This seemed to rouse her from her seemingly half conscious state, as she slowly lifted her head, looking more than a little dazed and locked eyes with you lying there on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God...<i>Ryan!</i>\" she gasped, looking rather stunned and horrified herself, her half shut eyes having now widened dramatically as she quickly gazed around at the carnage she had caused, then immediately back over at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay the hell away from me!\" you squealed as she began to pull herself up, scrabbling quickly backwards, till you felt your body press up against the bedroom wall and you had nowhere else to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, wait!\" she said, pushing herself up onto her knees. Then, as if suddenly noticing that she was naked, she let out an embarrassed little squeak, \"Oh God!\" and quickly grabbed her small tits with her hands, covering them from view, before turning her attention back to you, stammering frantically, \"I'm so sorry. You've guh-got to believe me, I...I didn't mean for this to happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching as she then sat up onto her knees and shuffled slightly closer towards where you now cowered, you forced yourself even harder against the wall and shouted,  \"I SAID STAY BACK!!\" hoping to keep enough distance between you and her in case the creature reemerged.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Please, Ryan, just let me explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Explain what?</i> That you're some kind of fucking monster?!\" you nervously replied, not entirely sure where you'd gotten the courage from (the adrenaline pumping through your veins obviously working overtime). Looking hurt by this, Emily slid herself closer to the edge of the mattress, her soft eyes practically pleading with you as she started to reply, \"Ryan, I'm not...\", before you abruptly cut her off, yelling manically, \"DON'T COME ANY FUCKING CLOSER!\", stopping her immediately in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she did, your mind quickly began racing, scanning the room for the best possible route of escape, hoping that your weak, beat up legs would be able to carry you, very much aware now that the more time you remained here, the more time she had to transform again and finish what she'd begun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you did this, Emily continued trying to explain, sounding almost believable as her soft voice began to crack. \"I'm not gonna hurt you. Please, believe me...I'm just the same old Emily,\" she told you, sounding adamant now that you did. \"That thing; that creature that you saw; that's just some other part of me, some other part that sometimes I can't control. I never wanted you to find out about it. That's why I wouldn't kiss you, or get too close, cause I knew that if I did, if I let my emotions run too wild then it'd get out... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you were about to leave, and I knew I couldn't let you...,\" she then admitted, her eyes dropping shamefully, as did her hands, seemingly no longer concerned with her bashfulness in front of you as she tried to get everything all out into the open. \"I've wanted to kiss you so badly, from the very first night we met and, well, I just...I couldn't help myself. I really, <i>really</i> like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said nothing to this, only half paying attention as you began pushing yourself onto your feet, still clinging tightly to the wall, figuring that it was all just part of some weird, twisted game; as if she was toying with her food before she ate it, being far more concerned right now with making a break for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, believe me please!\" she yelled, trying to get you to respond, her face welling up as she did and a couple of tears running down her cheeks. \"I know this is all crazy and a huge shock, but I'm not a monster! <i>I'm Emily</i>. I'm still the same girl you've known for the last three weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally seeing a opportunity for escape, now that she was apparently distracted and crying, you pushed yourself off the wall and shouted, \"<i>You're a fucking freak, that's what you are!</i>\", barging your way past and knocking her over with your elbow in the process, before sprinting as fast as your injured legs could carry you out of the room, not looking back for even a second in case that grotesque lizard creature was suddenly hot on your trail. Thankfully, instead of loud, angry roars and hisses, all that followed you as you shot down the hallway towards the front door was the feint sound of sobbing as Emily's pleading voice called after you; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan! Please, I'm so sorry. I never wanted to be this way. It's not my fault! Please don't go. I've never met anyone like you before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were barely listening though as you shot out the door and sprinted off down the street, wanting to get as far away from whatever the hell she was as fast as humanly possible. Though you had managed to tuck your penis back into your boxers, you weren't even thinking about the fact that you were now running down the street in nothing but your underwear; your own embarrassment taking second priority to remaining alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou must have ran for about a mile straight before you even began to slow down, having gotten various strange looks and glances from passers by and tooting car horns in the process as you hobbled up the street, still with that horrible translucent green ooze clinging to your body. Eventually though, more out of fear of Emily, or of that creature chasing after you, than embarrassment, you decided to cut across a few back gardens, scrabbling over various fences and managing to snag a purple dressing gown off a washing line in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about another half mile of aimlessly running in somewhat of a blind panic (your legs doing more of the work than your brain), you realized that you had no idea where it was you should actually go or what you should actually do. Should you go home? Or to the police station? Or heck, even to a church to go find an exorcist or something? After all, you'd just discovered that monsters freaking exist and that Emily is one of them! What the hell do you do with information like that? With no clear answer to this, and very much not wanting to have to stop to think about it, you simply continued on in the direction your legs were taking you, finding to your relief that they were heading for home.On finally arriving there, you discovered that the house was empty (your parents having gone to a barbecue at your Auntie's, and your big sister having already returned to college), and perhaps out of some naive child-like instinct, or perhaps because you really had no idea what else to do, you immediately ran up to you room, closed the door behind you and buried yourself beneath your duvet covers, just like you did all those years ago after your brother and sister had forced you watch those horror movies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't entirely sure how long you lay there for, trying to block out the visions of what you'd just seen, breathing heavily and feeling like any minute you were going to pass out, surely being in shock from such a traumatic experience. Eventually you did though, experiencing rather nightmarish visions of that grotesque lizard monster's huge jaws bearing down on you, which in the end, resulted in waking you right back up again, shivering now in a cold sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, sweetheart...what on earth's the matter?\" you heard your mother's voice ask, and looking up you saw her standing in the doorway, having obviously returned from the barbeque in the intervening time. \"You look terrible, and you're sweating! What happened to you? Are you sick?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking up at your mother as she rushed over to you on the bed, feeling your forehead with her hand to check for a temperature, you knew this was your opportunity to reveal what had happened to you, what Emily as that creature had done...but for some reason <i>you didn't</i>. For some reason <i>you couldn't</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuh-yeah...must buh-be...\" you stuttered, feeling your throat turn suddenly dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my poor baby, you're all clammy. You must have caught something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your mom then began fussing over you, fluffing your pillow and heading downstairs to get you a hot drink and some medicine, you lay there reflecting on what you'd just done. You'd just lied to your mother. You'd just lied about being raped by a monster from God knows where, and why? To protect Emily? To protect the very girl who <i>was</i> that monster? No, surely not. That couldn't be it, could it? She had almost killed you. She could kill somebody else (if she hadn't done already). So why would you protect her? She was evil wasn't she? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly seemed that way. All the evidence pointing to her being a hideous monster like the ones in all those crazy horror movies; an abomination of nature that didn't deserve to live. After all, what she'd done to you had been barbaric and vile and horrible beyond words, so you had every right to hate her and want her captured or killed, and to see that evil creature get what it deserved. However, you didn't. <i>You didn't want that at all</i>. Even after all she'd done to you, now, after having had time to clear your head, you realized that whatever that thing was, it was still also Emily, the girl that you were crazy about and couldn't get out of your head. The sweet, innocent, quirky little girl who, in your mind, wouldn't hurt a fly. That was <i>still her</i>, and you couldn't bring yourself to harm or bring harm to her, no matter how terrified of that beast you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough at the time your only thoughts were of your own survival, now you could somewhat recall what she had said to you, the look on her face and the tone of her voice as she'd pleaded with you to make you understand. She'd told you that she never meant to hurt you and that the creature was a just some part of her that she couldn't control. Though you didn't really understand it, what you did understand was what else she'd said; having expressed her deep feelings, telling you that she really, really liked you. This was the thing that stuck with you now, recognizing the sincerity, having felt the exact same way about her, and realizing that perhaps that what had happened <i>had been out of her control</i>, and that she hadn't been lying when she'd said she never wanted to hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, and even if you were right, you didn't know what to do with that information, being confused as hell and more than a little terrified of the very girl you wanted to be with more than anything. This was without a doubt the weirdest, most messed up thing that had ever happened to you...that had probably ever happened to anyone. The girl you desperately wanted to be your girlfriend was also a giant 8 foot lizard monster! <i>What the hell were you supposed to do about that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet again, left with no answer, you decided to do nothing, spending the rest of the weekend pretty much in bed, trying not to think too much about any of it (which was nigh on near impossible, especially while having to wash off that slimy goop the creature had left all over your body), prolonging this imagined sickness for as long as possible and even ignoring calls and texts from Mike and Clara, not even sure what you were supposed to say to them either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, after succeeding in getting an entire week off, playing up your pretend illness to the best of your abilities, it had finally run it's course, your mom growing somewhat  wise to your faking, and you realized that you were going to have to return to school. In that time you hadn't heard a single peep from Emily and you weren't sure if that was a good thing or a bad, part of you hoping that she had done the smart thing and left town immediately after what had happened, and the other part hoping that she had stayed and that she might even still be at school (though being entirely unsure what you'd do if she was, not knowing if you'd actually be able to face her or immediately head straight for the hills, fearing that she might become that thing again and try to eat you). It was very strange when you tried to think about it, tried to think about Emily as that monster and what had happened, recalling the abject terror you'd felt with that hideous thing thrashing around on top of you, while at the same time recalling the conflicting feeling of pleasure from what it was doing to you. <i>You'd had sex</i>. You'd lost your virginity to that thing. And although the experience should have been entirely horrible and traumatic beyond belief, it wasn't. It had also felt rather amazing as well (though the thought of your penis being up inside that cold slimy, reptilian pussy did admittedly cause a shiver to run it's way up and down your spine).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried not to focus too much on this though the following morning as you got ready for school, and instead tried to simply pull yourself together enough to get through the day, still being entirely unsure whether you did actually want to see Emily again, being pulled in two very conflicting directions over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, dude! Where the hell have you been this last week?\" Mike greeted you in the hallway as you nervously slunk your way into school, \"Didn't you get any of my texts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, no. Sorry, man. I was, uh...I was kind of sick,\" you told him, still not ready to share your secret just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously being a little perturbed by your 'being ill' as well as your break in communication, Mike soon began questioning you about it and you did your best to fob him off as best you could, all the while glancing around the hallway for any sign of Emily, feeling somewhat paranoid about being so out in the open again in a place where she may well be. Soon Clara also located the two of you, and after going over the exact same ground again for her benefit, the conversation then turned to Emily and <i>that</i> weekend you'd spent over at her place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We never did find out what happened,\" Clara said, quickly followed soon after by Mike, who giving you an enthusiastic little nudge with his elbow, asked, \"Yeah, tell us, dude. How did it go? Did you...y'know, <i>score?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, I...\" you nervously began to stutter, not really having prepared yourself for this line of questioning, having of course been very excited about being invited over to Emily's the previous week and having shared that excitement with your friends. Now though, thinking about that Saturday only brought up images of Emily transforming into that terrifying monster, and the things she'd done to you after... \"I uh, I didn't end up going,\" you quickly blurted, deciding it best to avoid the whole thing all together, \"Saturday was uh, was when I got sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, bummer, dude,\" came Mike's response, \"You were really looking forward to that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't reply to this, wanting instead to move the conversation on, but your friend's were persistent, Clara then asking, \"Have you spoken to her recently? Cause she was asking about you a couple of days ago. Seemed kind of flustered, but she wouldn't tell me what it was about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, confirmation that Emily hadn't left and was very much still here in school, caused a rather unsettled feeling within your stomach, as you started to zone out from what Clara was saying, instead focusing on what this would mean. Should you just keep your distance? Should you expose her for what she is? Or should you actually man up and confront her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts were soon interrupted however, when your heard your friend suddenly say, \"Oh speak of the devil...<i>Look, there she is now!</i>\" and turning round, you instantly froze on the spot as you saw none other than Emily shuffling her way down the corridor, books clutched in hand and a look of nervous determination in her eyes...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, both Mike and Clara were unaware of the situation between the two of you and paying you no mind, they said they're goodbyes and headed off down the corridor, leaving the two of you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan...\" Emily began, stepping forward, causing you to instinctively jolt back, pressing your body up against the locker, as if half expecting her to transform right there in front of you, feeling entirely on edge. Sighing and looking a little saddened by this, much like she had back in her bedroom before you'd escaped, she then told you, \"Ryan, I'm so sorry about what happened, but I promise you I'm not gonna hurt you. I just want to explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...and what makes you think I want to hear it?\" you quickly asked, going on the defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, it's been over a week since it happened and nobody's come knocking at my door with pitchforks or wooden stakes looking for a...for <i>a monster</i>,\" she said, lowering her voice and looking over her shoulder to see if anyone had heard, before turning back and asking, \"You kept it to yourself, what happened at my house, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded at this, seeing no real reason to lie, sensing on some level that she was perhaps telling the truth, even if you weren't yet ready to accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" she smiled, looking rather relieved as she moved a little closer, \"You have no idea how much that means to me. If word got out, they'd...they'd probably hunt me down and kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma-maybe they should,\" you told her, somewhat unconvincingly, feeling a little cornered once more as you backed further into the lockers, \"If...if you really are a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know I'm not, Ryan. You know I'm me; <i>I'm Emily</i>,\" she replied, reiterating what she'd told you before, staring at you with those big beautiful green eyes of hers (almost as if she was staring into your very soul), her cheeks turning slightly red, \"Otherwise you wouldn't have kept my secret. You still feel the same way about me as I feel about you, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a harder to question for you to answer, having gone over it in your head for days. Aware that you should hate this person and be frightened for your life around her (and rightly so), but no matter how hard you tried, you found you just couldn't. That being said, although you did have feelings for her, strong feelings, after what had happened and knowing what she was, it was very hard to see her as just the Emily you knew. Her whole person having been tainted by the horrible beast she could become at any minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I dunno what I feel,\" you finally told her, after a second or two. This being the God's honest truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let me explain and I'll <i>prove</i> that I'm still the same person. I'll explain everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then...go for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over her shoulder again nervously, Emily replied, \"No, not here. There's too many people around. Lets go somewhere a little more private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, so you can turn into that thing and rip me to shreds?! No thank you. Here is just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, you know I'm not going to do that,\" she said, sighing, clearly upset that she had to keep repeating this, \"I told you I would never hurt you and I mean it. What happened in my room was...was an accident. I lost control. But that won't happen now, and you know it won't. Now please, just come with me. Just outside where it's quieter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were of course still somewhat wary of this, the niggling sense of fear and doubt having yet to leave you, you eventually agreed after a bit more persuading and followed Emily down the hallway and out the main doors. Descending the steps and looking quickly around, seeing a few people milling around a little further away but not so close as they could hear what you were saying (which suited you fine, getting some comfort from the fact that there were other people around just in case Emily did transform), she then turned to you and said, \"Now the first thing I want to say is that I really am truly sorry for what happened. I never wanted you to find out like that....In fact I never wanted you to find out at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly did I find out?\" you asked, wanting to get to the truth quickly, not really liking all this hanging about one bit, \"What are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a...well this is gonna sound kind of silly, but I'm a were-lizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A were-lizard?\" you repeated, thinking that it did indeed sound silly, having strangely enough expected a better name than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You know, like a werewolf, but instead of the wolf part, a lizard,\" Emily explained in her usual cute and quirky manner, clearly aware how lame that sounded, but doing her best anyway, as she admitted, \"I'll be honest with you, I don't know the technical term, in fact I'm not sure there even is one. I've looked up hundreds and thousands of books on the subject and even scoured the entirety of the internet, but so far I've come up with zip. All I know is that I am one, I have been since I was 11 years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>11 years old?</i>\" you again repeated, shocked by this, having expected to her to have either been born this way, or for it to have been a recent affliction, \"What? How? Were you like bitten or scratched or something, like in the werewolf movies?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'd played there hundreds of times before so I didn't think anything of it. But then it started to get dark, so we headed for home. Next thing I know Sparky starts barking and I hear this weird hissing noise coming from the trees. Then I see this big pair of yellow eyes staring at me, and you can probably imagine what happened next.\" This you could indeed, recalling Emily's eyes when she'd transformed into that thing, as she continued on anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This huge green lizard thing jumped out at me and sunk it's teeth right into my leg,\" she said, moving her hand down to one of her stripy socks and rolling it towards her ankle, \"It's one of the reasons I wear these big socks all the time, to cover the scar.\" There right enough, at the back of her left calve was a long, almost semi circular scar that did indeed look like several large teeth marks, about 5 inches across, a scar which you had of course never noticed before. \"My parents found me about an hour later,\" she continued, rolling the sock back up, \"I was delirious. Talking about monsters, which they of course didn't believe, and Sparky was gone, presumably eaten by that thing that attacked me. Everyone just figured that Sparky must have bitten me and ran off, and that was the end of that, things went right back to normal. Except for me. Things never went back to normal for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first time it happened, I think it might actually have been a full moon. Though it doesn't exactly work like with werewolves. I couldn't control it in the beginning and I was terrified. It's tricky enough being an 11 year old girl going through puberty without having the added worry of transforming into a giant lizard every night and running amok in the swamps and in the woods. Sometimes I'd even wake up, butt naked, in the middle of nowhere, covered in mud and dirt. It was horrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Jesus...</i>\" was all you could think to say after hearing this story, it being not quite what you'd expected, sounding incredibly tragic and painful for a young girl to have to go through. Especially Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she nodded, agreeing with your sentiment, looking almost wistful as she conjured up the memory. \"I didn't know what was happening to me or why, but I did sort of learn how to live with it, even control it to a point. So much so that I could change when I wanted to change and not when I didn't...\" adding rather awkwardly as she looked as you, the guilt evident on her face, \"apart from some occasions of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Otherwise you wouldn't have done that to me...\" you mumbled, finishing the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, I know and I wish I could have been able to control it!\" Emily regretfully gushed, her sorrow over what she'd done being more than evident in her face and voice, as she looked away in shame, \"It's just sometimes, when my emotions get too high, like anger or...or <i>lust</i>, it just happens. I can't stop it. That was why I wouldn't kiss you, or get too close. Even though I so desperately wanted to.\" This sort of made sense you supposed, Emily having been all standoffish for weeks before suddenly jumping all over you. \"I think in the end that might have been what finally triggered it, all that repressed emotion I felt towards you,\" she told you, her eyes returning to yours again as she said sincerely, \"I really, really like you, Ryan. More than any guy I've ever known. And I know you might not believe me or think I'm some sort of freak or something, but I promise you I'm not. I just a girl. A girl who was given some crazy curse she never asked for, sure, but a girl none the less.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could almost feel a lump in your throat forming as she said this, her big green eyes almost tearing up as she gently placed a hand atop yours and softly spoke. \"And I hope you can forgive me for what happened, and that perhaps one day we might be able to start all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...I don't know if we can,\" you replied, moving your hand away, not yet sure what to make of all of this. It being a huge upheaval in your relationship and a heck of a lot to get to grips with. Your girlfriend (or rather wanna be girlfriend) was a strange were-lizard beast thing, how on earth were things supposed to go back to normal after learning that? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that this wasn't neither the time nor the place to come to any decisions just yet, you then asked her, \"Who else knows about you...about the lizard part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody,\" was her response, \"You're the only person I've ever told. I was too frightened of what might happen if anyone else knew. <i>Even my parents.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause in the conversation after she'd said this, her story appearing to get sadder and more lonelier by the minute, as you imagined Emily having to deal with this whole thing all by herself since she was 11. It was madness! That being said, and although you still clearly felt a lot of affection towards this girl (and now a great deal of sympathy as well), the whole thing was just too big and too weird. Monsters existed and she was one of them. You really needed some space to process all of this, and so told her as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all so fucking crazy! I need some time to think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Take all the time you need,\" Emily said, a flash of hope evident in her voice as she realized you hadn't ruled out anything quite yet. \"Just please, don't tell anyone, and don't think any less of me. I never wanted any of this to happen.\" And with that she gave you one last little smile and then turned and walked away, off to class as the bell for first period began to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her go, left alone now with your thoughts, you mulled over everything she'd told you for a moment, before then too heading off towards your own class, thinking as you went about all this stuff you were going to have to come to terms with, as well as the decision you were going to have to make.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day went rather slowly after your conversation with Emily and you found yourself being unable to concentrate in class, your mind being elsewhere as your teachers droned on and on about whatever lesson it was they were teaching. Even during recess and lunch, sitting with your friends, you found yourself unable to focus on what they were saying, still very much thinking of Emily and what it was she'd told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, dude, you got to tell us. What was that all about between you and Emily this morning?\" Mike asked, as you him and Clara sat in the cafeteria eating your lunch, still trying desperately to squeeze some info out of you as you stared off into space, \"You can't hold out on us here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what?\" you asked, being briefly pulled from your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike laughed at this and waved a hand in front of your face jokingly. \"Wow, talk about spaced out...You still in there, Ryan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry guys. I'm just distracted is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can see that,\" Clara said, letting out a chuckle, \"The question is; <i>why?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, have you and Emily hit a rough patch or something?\" Mike asked, following on from his girlfriend's comment, nothing seemingly getting past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough 'rough patch' wasn't how you'd best describe what had happened, you figured it was close enough and replied, \"You could say that,\" not really wanting to give away too many details, but needing to give your friends something to get them to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch,\" Mike then grimaced, as if feeling your pain, asking tentatively, \" She doesn't want to be \"just friends\" does she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing like that,\" you said, shaking your head, your problem being the exact opposite, \"I get the feeling she wants to be a lot more than friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's awesome news, dude! That's exactly what you wanted,\" Mike enthusiastically grinned as he took a bite from his burger, little realizing that there was a lot more too it than that. His girlfriend however was a little more perceptive, agreeing with Mike's sentiment, \"Yeah, it is,\" before adding much more inquisitively, \"So why are you acting all spaced out then? Don't you like her anymore or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was slightly harder to explain (especially without giving away the whole 'Emily is a were-lizard who basically raped you' thing), and so doing your best, you somewhat awkwardly stuttered, \"No, it's not that...not really. It's...well it's <i>complicated</i>,\" hoping that perhaps this would suffice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike was quick to jump in again, telling you with his mouth half full, \"Doesn't seem complicated to me, Ryan. You like her and she likes you. It's perfect. You guys are totally meant for each other,\" adding, as a somewhat running joke he'd constantly been making for the last few weeks, \"So quit moping and lets get arranging that double date already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara seemed to concur with this, telling you, \"I've got to admit, as much as I hate agreeing with my idiot boyfriend, Mike is right. You guys are great together. So what it is that's stopping you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of hard to say. It's just something that happened recently. I kind of got a glimpse of her in a...a <i>different light</i>, and I'm not really sure I liked what I saw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Why? What did she do?\" Mike asked, his interest peeking, clearly expecting a bit of juicy gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" you quickly replied, realizing what Mike was after but not wanting to give it to him (even though what had actually happened was way more freaky than anything he could possibly imagine). Receiving a disbelieving glance from Clara, very much aware that this wasn't exactly the truth, you then told them, picking your words very carefully, \"I mean, yeah it was something. But it wasn't something she meant, or wanted to do...it was just something that kind of happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cryptic much?\" came Mike's response, looking rather lost, his girlfriend wearing a similar expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, I'll be honest, I don't have a clue what you're talking about,\" she began, looking you straight in the eyes and using that 'Clara knows best' kind of voice that she always had when giving you advice, \"But it sounds to me like you're getting all hung up over one tiny little insignificant thing that wasn't even her fault.\" Though the 'not being her fault' part was certainty true, you had to draw the line at the whole 'insignificant' part; turning into an 8 foot lizard hardly being what you'd consider insignificant (though you supposed Clara had no way of knowing that). \"I mean if you like each other, does that really matter?\" she continued, speaking some truth, \"Does what she did or didn't do really make all that much difference if you guys have fun together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about this, you could definitely see some logic, having really strong feelings for Emily that went way beyond what she looked like, or even what she'd done. The whole lizard monster thing not being able to change that. \"Hm, no. I guess not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Mike butted in, giving you his two cents worth, in his usual less than subtle way, \"You and Em are an awesome couple. Nearly as awesome as me and Clara here. You really need to stop over thinking things dude and just do what feels right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Why'd you think I wound up with him instead of a <i>normal</i> boyfriend?\" Clara laughed, giving her boyfriend a prod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm normal!\" he laughed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Barely.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" you said, realizing that what they were telling you was true; that your feelings for Emily hadn't really changed at all. You still though of her as the most amazing, awesome, cute and funny girl you'd ever met, even if she did transform into a horrible beast, she was still that very same girl you were crazy about, just as she'd been telling you over and over. You couldn't just throw that away, could you? Not when there was even the slightest chance that the two of you could make a go of it. Certainly you knew it wouldn't just happen over night, and deep down you were still somewhat terrified of that giant monster that lived inside. But if you had to, you could get past it. You did lose your virginity to her after all, and that, as well as being unbelievably terrifying, was also kind of...special. Wasn't it?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that it was, and that you weren't quite ready to give up on you and Emily's relationship just yet, you put down your knife and fork and told your friends, \"You know what, <i>you guys are right!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we are,\" Mike grinned, taking another bite from his burger, as you then stood up, said goodbye to the both of them and went off to find Emily, feeling that there was no time like the present, desperately wanting to share with her what you'd just this minute realized.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not spotting her anywhere in the cafeteria and recalling that she either always went out for lunch or brought something with her and sat outside to eat it (the two of you having done that on quite a few occasions these last few weeks), you headed out the door and down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the main entrance, you went outside, stopping briefly to ask a few juniors if they'd seen Emily about the place, and finding much to your surprise that they didn't actually know who she was (clearly not having made as big an impression on her classmates as she had on you). Heading then around the back of the building towards the art department, where there was a few tables and chairs, expecting perhaps that Emily might sit out there, you turned the corner and too your surprise suddenly came face to face with the very person you were after, almost running into her in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he-hey,\" she said, clearly a little shocked to see you soon, but flashing you a smile as she looked up from the book she was reading and (rather adorably) pushed her long bangs out of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling back, no longer quite so on edge around her  as you had been, you replied, \"Hi, I uh, I was hoping to bump into you...\", taking a deep breath, to compose yourself, not wanting everything that was now running through your head to all splurge out at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. You almost did...<i>bump into me</i>, that is,\" Emily, nervously giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling a little awkwardly yourself, you then told her, \"Listen, Emily. I've been doing some thinking and, I, uh, I think we should...um,\" scratching nervously at the back of your neck as you noticed all the other students around, \"...maybe go somewhere a bit more private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Yeah. Of course,\" Emily agreed, happy by the mere fact you were talking with her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading off towards a quieter, less public spot by the football bleachers, neither of you really saying a word until you got there, you then turned to Emily and told her, letting you feeling gush out, \"Okay, so I know we only spoke this morning, but I haven't been able to stop thinking about what you said and...and <i>about us</i>, and I know I told you that I don't know how I feel about your anymore, but that...that's not really true.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you said this, Emily's eyes widened and you could almost hear a little gasp of joyous anticipation escape her lips. This didn't stop you from continuing on however, needing to get this all out in the open as quickly as you could, telling her, \"It's taken me some time to realize it after all the crazy stuff that happened, but I like you too Emily. I really do. I don't think I've ever felt this way about anyone before. I know it's all pretty messed up and stuff, and I'd be lying if I tried to tell you that I wasn't totally freaked out by what happened, y'know...back in your room. But I believe you when you say it wasn't your fault and you didn't mean for it to happen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing then for breath, having finally gotten to the part you'd been hurriedly racing to get to, before your nerves took you, you looked  Emily directly in the eyes and said, \"So I was wondering if maybe we could try and give things another go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Really?</i>\" she beamed, looking like she was about to jump for joy, her mouth widening into a smile as she replied, \"Yes! Of course!\" adding immediately after, \"I mean, if you're sure that is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. I mean, I'm still a little uneasy about the whole were-lizard thing, but I like you too much to let that get in the way,\" you explained, flashing her a smile and holding out your hand towards hers, \"So it might, y'know, take a little while for me to get used to that whole aspect, but I do want to make you and me work. I want you to be my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your hand and wrapping her small, delicate fingers around it, Emily reiterated this thought, happily telling you, \"And I want you to be my boyfriend,\" before suddenly throwing her arms around you and hugging you tight, dropping her book in the process. \"Oh, Ryan, you don't know how glad I am!\" she said, breaking from the embrace, \"And don't worry, I don't expect you to just get used to it just like that. And if you have any questions or anything, things you want to know or find out, then I'll tell you. I'll let you know everything. I don't want to keep anymore secrets from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to hear this (as well as briefly feeling Emily's small body against yours again), you told her, \"Okay, good. Cause I think that might be the best place to start; finding out everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. What do you want to know?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe we shouldn't talk about it here. There's too many people around, and I imagine it'd probably be best if I was sitting down for some of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. After school then? We can go somewhere. Back to your house, or mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking more like <i>now</i>,\" you interrupted, feeling like you really couldn't wait that long, having so many questions and things to ask, \"You know, just skip the rest of class. I kind of feel this whole thing is more important right now anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked a little unsure for a moment, no doubt worrying about actually skipping school (being such a responsible and studious person after all), before deciding 'to hell with it' and replying, \"Okay. Let's do it. Let's skip school,\" adding with a giggle, \"I've never actually done that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this now decided and Emily on board, all you had to do was work out where exactly you should head to once you did; your house or hers?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Crap! My mom's not working today, so we won't be able to go back to my house,\" you said, remembering what she'd told you this morning about \"finally being able to get some cleaning down in that pit of a room of yours\", what with you no longer playing sick and locking yourself in all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could always go back to mine. My parents are always out during the day,\" Emily replied warily, clearly concerned for your feelings as she did, \"...if, I mean, if that wouldn't be, you know, too weird for you or anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly she was right to be, her place; her bedroom to be precise, being where you first saw the monster...that other part of Emily. After what had happened there, after what it...what she had done to you, you realized you probably had every right to be wary of going back to her house; it being the site of a very, terrifying and traumatic experience for you. That being said, it was just a house, and it was just a bedroom. If you could forgive Emily for what she'd done to you and leap over that great hurdle, then surely returning to the scene of the crime couldn't be all that scary (not when said crime scene had pink walls and cute little teddy bears everywhere).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay,\" you assured her, \"Let's go to yours then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. If you're sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's fine. Totally fine. Now c'mon! We'd better get out of here before the bell goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, sticking out your hand, Emily gladly took it, flashing you a smile which you returned, indicating finally after all the many strange and horrifying things that occurred, that the two of you were now boyfriend and girlfriend. Heading quickly through the school gates, feeling a rush of excitement as you did (having of course bunked school once or twice before with Mike, but never like this, never hand in hand with a girl), the two of you headed off down the street towards Emily's home, avoiding as best you could any talk about her condition or what had happened, wanting to leave all those questions until you actually got there, and instead chatting a little awkwardly about some of your classes and the day at school so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you did reach Emily's house, you did indeed feel a strange sort of chill as you entered, almost subconsciously recalling every detail from that Saturday afternoon when you'd ran out the door in a panic, and noticing this, Emily asked, \"Ryan? Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fine. Everything's cool,\" you replied, snapping out of your daze, aware that if you and Emily were going to work, you were going to have to be able to walk into her house without turning into a blubbering mess, reminding yourself that you were with her now, not the monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading then into Emily's cute, girly bedroom, you again felt the same sensation (especially when you spotted the scratches and scuff marks on the walls - realizing now what exactly had made them), but quickly shook it out, instead focusing on the fact that Emily's flattened bed had been replaced by a new one. Mentioning this to her, she explained that her dad had bought her a new one after she'd convinced him that it had collapsed from her jumping around on top of it, looking exceptionally guilty as she did. It appeared that these sort of things happened quite a lot; her bed being destroyed, her clothes torn to pieces, large chunks being taken out of the walls when she transformed and her inherent clumsiness went a long way to explaining a lot of it (the fact that her parents would never believe in a million years that their sweet, studious daughter was also a 8 foot rampaging lizard beast going the rest of the way).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on bed while Emily pulled out the chair from under her desk and turned it around to face you, you looked at each other for a few seconds before deciding to get down to business and ask the literally hundreds of questions that had been filling up your head ever since you had first discovered that Emily was a were-lizard, and after what she had told you this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So what do...</i>\" you both started to say, causing the two of you to let out an awkward giggle, before Emily graciously let you go first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Thanks,\" you smiled, thinking over what would be the best question to actually ask, your head being filled with so many. Coming quickly to a decision, you then said, \"I guess the first thing I want to know is are you still like, y'know...you, when you change? When you become a were-lizard? Or is it like a separate being or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's still me. It's all still me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But last week, in here...what happened...\" you replied, somewhat confused by this answer. The thing that had forced you to have sex with it certainly not appearing in any way like the Emily you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...that was still me,\" Emily told you, dipping her head again in shame. \"Only I wasn't really in control of my actions.\" She'd mentioned this not being in control thing before, and although you hadn't really known what it had meant, you had of course assumed that the monster part of her was kind of like another entity living inside her, and that with practice she  had learnt to repress, so what she told you next, as she raised her head and looked back up at you again came as quite a surprise. \"It happens when I don't initiate the transformation and when a strong emotion takes hold,\" she explained, blushing a little again and confessing, \"I just really wanted to kiss you so bad, and I'd been repressing it for so long, that when it finally happened...things got a little out of control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see I've never actually had a boyfriend before, because I've always feared that if I did, if any boy actually liked me enough to go out with me, then well, <i>what happened</i> would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all took a moment to process, mouthing, \"<i>Jesus</i>,\" at both the revelation that the 'control' she had mentioned seemed to refer to an ability to transform at will, as well as the fact that she had known fine well that dating you would end up with her turning all lizard (the not having had a boyfriend before bit being something you had already guessed, though not for this reason of course). \"But then why did you even agree to go out on that date with me in the first place, if you thought that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in all honesty, that wasn't exactly my idea. My friend Caitlin, she kind of pushed me into it,\" Emily said, very much confirming the thought you'd had sitting at that table, waiting for her to arrive on that initial date. \"She pointed you out one day in school when you and Clara and her boyfriend were in the cafeteria and she asked if I thought you were cute, and well...eh...I guess you know what my answer was. I never actually imagined she'd ever set us up on a date. But she did; her and Clara did. I told her I didn't want to go and tried to get out of it, but she wouldn't let me. She even came over to my house just to drive me to the restaurant to make sure I went. I think she must have felt sorry for me, seeing as I didn't really have any other friends but her. As well as rather foolishly admitting that I'd never had a boyfriend before either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of funny. My friend's pushed me into it too,\" you told her, finding this ironic, \"Though I didn't even know what you looked like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Or what you were letting yourself in for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's why you were so quiet and standoffish at the start,\" you then added, figuring that made sense now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I just wanted to get it over and done with so I could tell Caitlin I went and it didn't work out,\" Emily admitted, looking a little uncomfortable as she explained this, her face every so often breaking into a nervous smile, \"I so wanted to not like you, but well...I did.<i> I really did</i>. I probably shouldn't have given you my number, but I'd never felt that way about anyone before, I was too wrapped up on how cool and funny and great company you were that I wasn't really thinking about what might happen. Then as things progressed, I convinced myself I could hide my 'condition', repress it so that you'd never know. Just so long as I didn't let my emotions get the better of me. Which they of course eventually did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that must have been tough...\" you began to say, stopping yourself and letting out an awkward chuckle (not wanting to appear big headed), \"Heh. That is, I mean, not tough cause I'm <i>so irresistible</i> or anything, tough because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also made Emily giggle. \"Hee-hee. It's okay, I get what you mean. And yeah, sometimes it was. But I felt like you were worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you only transform then when that happens, when you get emotional or whatnot?\" you then asked, getting back to what she had mentioned before about 'initiating' transformations, curious to know if it meant what you thought it had, asking delicately, \"Or do you change other times as well...y'know, like when you want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, when I want to,\" she told you, flat out answering that question. \"Usually the big emotional transformation don't happen all that often. I've gotten rather good at avoiding situations like...well like <i>this</i>. Though I do usually to transform three or four times a month when big ol' Lizardy Emily gets hungry. Sometimes I need to feed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Feed?</i>\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hearing this made you turn slightly white, having feared for your life when Emily had transformed on top of you, on this very same bed last Saturday, your first thought having been that she was going to eat you, and now from what she was saying, it seemed she may well could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know, like any other kind of animal,\" Emily told you, ignoring the shocked look on your face for a moment as she proceeded to answer your question. \"That's also when I'm not always 100% in control, so I usually choose to initiate the transformation myself and go out hunting. That way I get to decide whats on the menu and don't end up hurting anyone by mistake.\" This thankfully helped to return some of the color to your face, realizing that she hadn't meant 'feed on humans', though aware that it still might be a possibility, if she was indeed not in control all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have...have you ever?\" you nervously asked, needing to be sure. Having accepted that your girlfriend was a giant lizard monster, but not being quite sure you could accept her being a murderer and cannibal as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer initial response didn't exactly fill you with much confidence however as she pondered, \"I'm not really sure. Not that I know of. Though back when it first began, I wasn't in control at all and I sometimes had no clue what was happening when I changed. Anything could have happened then I suppose.\" Then seeing the look of worry on your face, realizing that her answer probably wasn't the most comforting, she quickly added to ease your mind, \"But if I did, then I certainly never heard about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that this was probably the best you could hope for, Emily at least not consciously eating people (and you hoped not unconsciously either), you then moved the discussion on, not really wanting to dwell on such an unpleasant thought. \"Then uh, what does, what does a were-lizard eat?\" you asked her, this whole feeding and hunting thing suggesting she didn't simply raid the fridge or head out to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, you know...fish, mice, birds, raccoons, deer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>eat</i> deer and raccoons!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably sounds pretty gross huh?\" Emily asked, looking slightly embarrassed. \"I guess it is. But when I'm in were-lizard form I don't really notice so much. I just eat whatever I can find,\" adding with an awkward little giggle, \"Better than eating a person right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess it is,\" you replied, finding this all rather uncomfortable. The more you heard about Emily's life the weirder it all seemed to get (though to be honest, what else were you really expecting?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing this on your face, Emily suddenly appeared rather distressed, throwing a hand over her mouth as she squeaked, \"Oh God, this all must seem really horrible. Are you totally freaked out right now? I bet you are. <i>I must sound disgusting!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, you don't. Honestly,\" you told her, shaking your head, \"You're not disgusting,\" realizing that as weird as all this was, the last thing you wanted was to make Emily feel bad, trying your best to comfort her, \"It's just...just a lot to take in is all. A lot to get my head around. But its okay. I'm not freaked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute or two more for you to convince Emily of this, but eventually she relaxed and said, \"Okay, if you're sure. But if you are weirded out and wanted to leave, don't worry, I won't judge you. I guess I am kind of a freak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, Emily, I'm not going to leave. And you're not a freak. You're awesome!\" you assured the seemingly fragile little girl sitting before you, placing your hand on top of hers and staring into her soft green eyes, more than ever reminded of her incredible beauty, compassion and humanity, three of the traits that very much drew you to her. She may have the ability to turn into a giant 8 foot, super strong reptile, but underneath she was just the same as everyone else, and you weren't going to let her think for one moment that she was any less because of it. \"You've just been dealt a rough hand in life and you're making the best of it,\" you continued, giving her hand a gentle squeeze, admitting, \"Hell, if I was in your shoes I'm not sure I'd be able to cope so well. In fact I know I wouldn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she smiled, your words seeming to have done the trick, as her worry quickly vanished and she gave your hand a squeeze in return. Parting again, and letting out an embarrassed little giggle for thinking that you might want to abandon her, she then sat up again in her chair and asked, \"Is there anything else you wanna know about my condition?\" getting back to the reason you were sitting here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou of course had more questions than you could shake a stick at, and while you had started off with a lot of the logistical aspects, such as how she changed and why etc., what you really wanted to know now was, \"What does it feel like when you transform. When you change into that thing...I mean, into a were-lizard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to worry, Ryan, you can call me a 'thing' if you want to,\" Emily chuckled, referencing your little slip up, thankfully letting it fly, \"And to answer your question, I'm not really sure how exactly to describe it. It kind of starts like with this like sort of warm, pulsating feeling beneath your skin that gradually grows stronger and stronger inside, until you can actually feel yourself start to stretching and your body getting bigger, with every single inch of muscle, skin and bone tightening and expanding at exactly the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not painful though,\" she said, noticing your look of discomfort at the thought of having your body parts stretched in such a way, telling you, rather shyly as her face once again began to turn red, \"in fact it's...well, this is kind of embarrassing, but it sort of feels like having a really amazing, y'know, orgasm. It's like every single part of you feels on fire with pleasure. It really is quite the experience. That's uh...that's actually one of the reasons I sometimes change when I don't really need to. For the feeling.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis you certainly hadn't been expecting to hear, even with the performance she had given when you'd watched her transform before (not really dwelling much how she was changing and more on the fact that she <i>was actually</i> changing), and you weren't sure you'd ever seen Emily blush quite so much as she said it. \"<i>Wow....</i>\" was all you could really reply, a little lost for words, not only at the thought of Emily having an orgasm when transforming, but of Emily having an orgasm full stop; finding that you yourself were starting to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about when you have changed. What's that like?\" you then decided to ask, wondering if that felt in any way the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of had to describe too,\" Emily told you, glad to be moving on, her answer indicating that it wasn't quite. \"All I can say is, it makes you feel more 'alive' in a way, if that makes sense. And powerful, much, much more powerful. And not just because I'm 8 foot tall and ripped either,\" she added, letting out an enthusiastic giggle, \"But because it feels really sort of liberating being someone...<i>something</i> else. Something that doesn't have to play by societies rules, that can do whatever it wants and truly let its animalistic part run free!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Though I'm not gonna lie to you and say that having a tail isn't cool too,\" she then smiled, wiggling her bottom in her seat, causing you to laugh at her adorable cuteness. \"I can make it do anything. It's basically like having an extra arm or something,\" she explained, becoming rather excited as she spoke, \"Oh and my senses! My senses are way more attuned too. I can like see ridiculously well, and I can sort of zoom in and out of things, like a telescope as well as being able to see in the dark, it's pretty amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to agree there, having telescopic vision and being able to see in the dark did sound pretty handy. \"What about, like, your hearing and sense of smell?\" you asked, becoming all the more curious. \"What about your taste and touch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about this for a moment as if trying to recall, Emily told you, \"Well hearing isn't much different to be honest, in fact it's probably slightly worse, what with my ears all but disappearing when I'm transformed (causing you to recall the small little ear holes that were embedded in the side of her reptilian skull). Smell is kind of the same, touch too. Although I can use my claws to grip onto walls and surfaces and stuff and climb things, but taste is probably my strongest sense. That big freaky tongue isn't just for slobbering. It's hard to explain, but it can like sense and track things, almost like a radar, by the different tastes in the air.\" Though this sounded rather odd to you, having no real knowledge of lizards or how their biology differs from human biology, you figured that no matter how it worked, much like the vision thing, having your own radar sense was as cool as hell and almost like something a superhero might have. \"I've found animals and stuff to eat that were like 2 miles away just by using my tongue,\" Emily continued, clearly rather proud of this fact, as he face broke into a very happy and satisfied grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fuck me!</i>\" you exclaimed, rather impressed by this, \"I didn't realize that it would have so many benefits. It almost sounds like you've got superpowers when you're transformed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I guess it kind of does. And I guess that's why I've come to accept it and even appreciate it some times, once I'd gotten over the initial shock and learnt to control the changes. It really is quite an amazing experience being a were-lizard. It's just in situations like <i>this</i>; finding love and opening up to people that it becomes a bit of a problem. Plus, with the move to the city, finding things to eat has become a little more tricky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I guess there isn't so many deer running wild in the suburbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not really. Plus, it's harder to move about unseen when I transform. There's not so many swamps or marshlands or woods nearby that I can hide in. It's why I haven't really transformed so much since I moved up here; only three times so far. One was the last time you were here,\" she told you, referring of course to that rather traumatic afternoon that had started all this, \"The one before that I found a park about half a mile away to run around in, because well, the first time I transformed after we moved I thought I could just wait it out in my bedroom. Hence all the scratches on the walls and the clothes I had to replace. I got kind of hungry and accidentally trashed my room trying to get out. Thank God my folks weren't in. Who knows what they would have thought if they'd seen a giant lizard thrashing around inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" you agreed, not really knowing what else to add after that, the conversation seeming to have run it's natural course and come to an end as you both sat there staring at each other for a minute (having depleted all the questions that were forefront on your mind).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing all about Emily's life as a were-lizard and how it felt to be one, you had to admit that, even though you were justifiably still somewhat terrified of seeing her like that again, there was another part of you, a far more brave and curious part that kind of wanted to, that wanted to watch her transform. It was after all, an extremely unusual occurrence that you'd never see anywhere else, and while watching the transformation process the last time had been deeply disturbing, there was something also rather fascinating about it. Perhaps if you watched it happen and got used to it, you also wouldn't be so freaked out when she did change (just like your brother and sister had tried to convince you with those werewolf movies). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with this in mind, you decided to broach the idea, asking rather nervously, \"Uhm, Emily. Would it...would it be, y'know, alright to...to see it? To see you actually change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question clearly surprised Emily, having presumably not expected you to ask that after how you'd reacted before, as well as the fact that you kept accidentally referring to her were-lizard form as a 'thing'. \"You...you <i>want</i> to see me change?\" she replied, \"But I thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot allowing her to finish, well aware of what she was going to say (and being right about it as well), you then told her, \"I know. I know. But I think it might help if I see it again. You know, help me face my fears and all that, as well as get used to what you are. I'm not really sure we can continue a relationship if I can't accept every part of your life. And I really think I need to see you <i>like that</i> again to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about this for a moment, thankfully seeing where it was you were coming from, she responded, \"Well then, of course,\" adding a stipulation however, \"But only if you're absolutely sure. I know how distressing it must be for you, after what happened. I don't want to scare you away again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't,\" you told her, hoping this would very much be the case, asking then to clarify (just to be on the safe side), \"Cause it'll be you this time won't it? You that's in control? It won't be the same as what happened before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it'll be me. It'll be my choice to transform, so you don't have to worry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved at this and letting out a sigh (worrying for a moment that you'd gotten it wrong), you smiled, \"Okay. That's good. <i>You</i> I can handle. The <i>other you</i>, not so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at this herself, Emily then said, \"Okay, if you're sure then,\" wanting to be 100% certain that this was your choice and that she wasn't about to do something she'd later regret. Nodding your head in affirmation, you then watched as Emily got up off her chair and moved back slightly to where there was a little more space. She stood there for a couple of seconds while you waited, suddenly looking rather nervous as she glanced around the room and fiddled slightly with the hem of her top, her face turning a little redder as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm, is everything okay?\" you asked, not sure what was up, Emily definitely looking worried about something, \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" she said, looking back over at you on the bed, her voice becoming a little softer, \"It's uh, just that...well it's just that I've never really transformed in front of anyone before. Apart from that last time when it wasn't really me,\" adding with an obvious nervous embarrassment, \"And uh, well, usually I have to take my clothes off to stop them getting ripped...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this, you suddenly felt rather embarrassed yourself, basically having just told her to strip in front of you while you sat there and watched. \"Oh. Oh, God. I'm sorry. I didn't realize,\" you told her, quickly pointing towards the door and asking, \"Do...do you want me to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No, it's okay. It's not like you've didn't see it all before the last time. I guess I'm just a little bashful is all. But it'll be fine. I mean you'll be seeing the 'other me' naked as well, so I suppose there's no difference really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? You don't have to if you're not comfortable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. No, it's fine,\" she assured you, flashing you a jokey grin and reminding you that, \"We are boyfriend and girlfriend now after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you watched as she began to strip, going rather slowly and nervously to start with as she pulled the top up over her head, revealing a pretty little pink and black spotted bra, with a Hello Kitty logo printed on it. This caused you both to giggle as you saw it, Emily commenting that, \"Yeah, I know...it's kind of dorky,\" but you thinking anything but, finding it rather cute, as well as of course feeling the natural rush that came of actually seeing a girl in her underwear (Emily's breasts being small perhaps, but still looking very nice nestled snugly in their bra). Following quickly on from this, Emily then pushed down her pleated skirt, displaying a pair of plain white panties, before rolling down her long stripy socks, kicking off her shoes and taking the butterfly clasp out of her hair. As she stood there now, clad only in her bra and panties, you could see her face growing more red, her eyes avoiding your gaze, and after taking a deep breath she quickly pushed the panties down, keeping her legs tightly together, yet still managing to reveal a small strip of brown hair (the sight of which caused your penis to inadvertently twitch), before moving one hand round to unclasp her bra, letting it fall to the ground as she crossed both arms over her small breasts, keeping them hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up at you as you tried to disguise your arousal (her slim skinny body, although covered, looking truly beautiful), she then asked, \"You ready?\", causing you to pause for a moment as you contemplated your answer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking a moment to compose yourself, forgetting about Emily standing there in front of you naked and instead focusing on the fact that she was about to transform into that giant lizard creature that had terrorized your dreams, and who's snarling face and creepy reptilian eyes had been seared into your brain, you took a deep breath and told her (certain that this was the right action to take, yet still being extremely uneasy about it all), \"Okay. I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember,\" Emily said, flashing you a reassuring smile, \"It's still me. It's still Emily. You don't have anything to be afraid of.\" which you very much appreciated. Then, closing her eyes, still with her arms wrapped tightly around her body, you watched as she took another deep breath and a look of extreme concentration suddenly fell over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching this, waiting for the inevitable, feeling your hands beginning to shake slightly as an uncomfortable little shiver moved up your spine, you heard a small gasp escape Emily's lips and the transformation once again began to occur...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like before, it started first in her chest, as you watched her hands being pushed outwards, those small breasts that she had cupped in her palms quickly expanding, growing larger and larger and harder to contain. Next, you watched as she began to inch quickly upwards as the rest of her body began inflating; the small, almost indiscernible muscles on her arms and legs tightening and getting increasingly bigger, her scrawny physique soon transforming into that of a very toned fitness model, and her flat stomach growing an impressive set of abs. Although this initial stage was rather bizarre to watch, it was also quite amazing, watching as this thin, small chested 5' 3\" girl metamorphosed in front of you into some kind of buff and busty amazonian woman, her boobs now overflowing in her palms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that this amazement lasted long though, as her pink skin began to change, turning that very familiar pale green and thickening all over, the dark little blotches that would soon become scales forming on it's surface, causing you to recoil a little and your heart to start beating even faster. Emily on the other hand, you could hear softly mewing, the process clearly being as pleasurable as she indeed described as her quickly growing hands began sort of kneading at the now giant breasts they were clinging onto and her legs parted, giving you a flash of her now green, fleshy vagina. The strip of brown hair above which was quickly darkening and retracting into the skin. This too happened with the rest of her hair, being pulled into her scalp as her face too began to change, her ears and nose shrinking back into her skull, while her tightly closed eyelids widened and a set of fangs began pushing their way out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were positively freaking out now as you witnessed this, having tried to remain calm but the sight of Emily becoming this creature again being just too horrifying, bringing back all those feelings and emotions from a week ago and causing you inwardly panic. \"<i>Oh God...Oh shit...Oh God...</i>\" you chanted over and over in your head, clambering backwards on the bed as Emily continued to change, becoming less and less human and more like a beast. Soon the dark green scales had completely covered around 2/3rds of her body and a long tail had begun thrashing it's way out from her spine, wiping around uncontrollably as Emily's moans grew louder and fiercer; her soft, cute little voice becoming raspier and more like an animal. In less than 10 or 15 seconds the girl you knew and had just been talking to for the last half hour was gone, replaced by a giant, balding, muscular, over 7 foot reptilian humanoid creature that was still growing, getting larger and larger with every second pushing it's way up towards the ceiling and towering over you as you looked on petrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing one final loud roar, causing each individual, large rippling muscle to shake and spasm on it's gigantic body as it finally hit full height and scraped it's head again the roof  (crouching slightly to prevent it going straight through the plaster), it's eyes suddenly sprung open; yellowy/green in color with a long black slit in the center, while it's long, forked tongue slithered out, lapping at the air. You almost thought you were about to wet yourself looking at this monster again, it's massive frame barely able to even fit inside the small pink bedroom, but fortunately you didn't, and instead just stared up at it, frozen, unable to move or even blink as the creature released it's massive breasts from it's clawed grasp, exposing those big, thick, almost thumb sized nipples, as it's own gaze fell onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second you though it was going to come at you and rip you to shreds with those razor sharp teeth, those horrible eyes looking down at you like you were some tasty little morsel for devouring. It didn't however, and instead, a look of both concern and compassion suddenly appeared across it's face as it spoke. \"<i>Ryan? It'sss okay...it'sss me, Emily, remember?</i>\" the creature said, it's voice a deep sort of hiss, but at the same time instantly recognizable as Emily's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you almost do a double take, so caught up in the fear of having this thing reappear in front of you that you'd all but forgotten who she'd been just moments before and what you'd been talking about. This monster...this lizard beast...it was Emily. It wasn't here to rape or kill you. It was Emily, the girl you cared for deeply, the girl who was now your girlfriend, and looking up at it's face, it's bald, green, scaly face, you could now see fractions of her inside it, fractions of that same cute and funny girl who you knew would never do anything to hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em-Emily...?\" you stuttered, letting out a small squeak as you tried to reconcile this fact, seeing more and more of her in the creatures face as you stared at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yeah, itsss me,</i>\" she said with a smile, those yellowy/green eyes no longer looking quite so evil or creepy, but actually now rather warm and innocent, \"<i>You don't have to be ssscared. I'm not going to hurt you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you believed her, it was still rather difficult to come to terms with what it was you were seeing, still having lingering emotions from your last run in with this creature, and still finding it somewhat difficult to actually accept that this was your girlfriend now standing over you, all naked and green, rippling with muscle, and you couldn't help but feel a little overwhelmed as you breathlessly whimpered to yourself, \"Oh Jesus...this is...this is so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Are you okay? Do you want me to change back?</i>\" Emily asked, crouching a little to get a better look at your face, obviously worried that this was all a bit too soon for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No, it's alright. I'll be alright,\" you told her, grappling at your chest with your hand to try to calm your pounding heart, needing to get through this initial feeling of shock and fear, \"I just...I just need a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sssure, okay. Take all the time you need.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing just that, taking a minute or two just to calm yourself while Emily waited patiently, all 8 foot plus of her, you felt both your breathing and your heart beat slowing as you told yourself that there was nothing to be afraid of, trying to block out the memories from your previous encounter. Eventually, feeling a little calmer now (at least comparatively so), you looked back up at the creature Emily now was and said, still somewhat stunned by what you were seeing, \"God, I can't...I can't believe that's you. It's so...so...<i>surreal!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Welcome to my life,</i>\" she chuckled, in response, the resulting image being rather bizarre to see and thankfully causing her were-lizard form to not look quite so terrifying, at least for a moment. Then, holding out her hand towards you, a hand that was about double the size of your own, she asked, \"<i>Wanna take a clossser look?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...oh-okay,\" you replied, working up some courage before nervously sticking out your hand towards hers, and very gingerly wrapping it around one of her large, clawed fingers (recalling the sort of dry, cool, scaly texture from your last encounter). Pulling you up from your cowering position on the bed with an ease that defied description, you then found yourself being lifted to your feet at the very foot of the bed, now standing directly in front of her, your eye line level with those huge, beach ball sized breasts; breasts, that now you were up close, you could honestly say, had to be at least twice the size of your own head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at you, from above the massive mounds, Emily said a little bashfully as she rather unsuccessfully tried to cover them a little with her hands, before giving up, \"<i>Uhm, sssorry about these thingsss being on display. I don't uh, I don't really have a bra or anything that'll fit them.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thu-that's...that's okay,\" you stammered, letting out a small gulp as you looked upon those two giant fleshy beacons, breasts still of course being breasts to you, and although these were pale green and ginormous, they did look rather impressive indeed, especially with those two thick nipples pointing out directly towards you from within their bumpy, saucer sized areola.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was too bizarre for words! What's more, and what was even more confusing was, that standing there, staring at those two huge, gravity defying breasts, with their fat, chewy, very suckable looking nipples, beneath which, as your eyes lowering past Emily's impressive rock hard abs, you could now see where her plump and very inviting looking vagina sat between her legs, you began to feel yourself, in a strange way becoming sort of turned on by this giant naked creature, recalling the sensation in your head of your penis slamming in and out of that tight, wet, slippery hole, creating a feeling of bliss within you you'd never known before or since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was definitely weird, and feeling instantly uncomfortable about this, about the twitching that was now going on in your pants as Emily patiently put herself on show in an effort try and make you feel the exact opposite about her body, you quickly backed away and told her, \"Uhm, okay. I think I've maybe seen enough for now. Maybe, uh...maybe you should change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sssure. Of courssse,</i>\" Emily replied, watching as you turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than five seconds later, you heard a familiar, low groan, accompanied by the sound of Emily's body shifting and shrinking once more, gazing around just in time to see her pale skin turn pink again and her massive muscular, lizard frame return to the much more familiar skinny, human one, as her hands quickly covered her extremities once more. \"<i>Sssorry, I ssshould have turned</i> back sooner,\" she told you, loosing the raspy hiss as the transformation completed, presuming that she had done something wrong, \"I don't know what I was thinking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's cool,\" you told her, aware that she wasn't really to blame (though admittedly being very glad that she was 'normal' Emily again), \"I need to get used to seeing you like that. It's uh just...it's just a lot to take in at once, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she replied, smiling reassuringly as she clutched at her naked body, clearly being more comfortable naked as a lizard than as herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot entirely sure where it came from, or where you found the boldness(especially after what had just happened), you found your mouth almost moving by itself as you stared at Emily's body, mumbling rather awkwardly, \"Besides, I uh...I think I much prefer seeing you like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Emily to blush even further, her adorable face and the look in her big green eyes as she did almost completely removing the memory of the monster she'd just been; looking unbelievable beautiful and sexy standing there before you, wearing nothing but an embarrassed little smile. She didn't say anything but it was clear what she was thinking, and even though you'd just witnessed something so incredibly bizarre and freaky as what had just happened, you were now kind of thinking the exact same thing yourself, and that was that you really wanted to kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first kiss had started off fairly nice of course (even though it hadn't been quite what you were expecting and soon turned a heck of a lot worse), but since then, since agreeing to give your relationship a go and officially become boyfriend and girlfriend, you hadn't really sealed the deal so to speak. Now, looking at her, looking at those soft, pink lips, you desperately wanted to press yours against hers. You wanted to feel her beautiful naked body against you and kiss her more than anything else in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, slowly heading towards one another as if this was the first time you'd ever done anything of this sort; your first kiss, having sex with Emily as a lizard monster, her being completely naked in front of you not really mattering right now, the two of you just being two awkward, fumbling teens who weren't exactly sure what to do with themselves as you finally came together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. This is kind of funny isn't it?\" she said, giggling nervously, \"Well not funny ha ha, but more funny weird. What with everything that happened between us, we've never properly, you know...\" trailing off at the end as her cheeks turned even more red..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...maybe we, uh, should, y'know...finish where we left off last Saturday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking into a large grin, she then replied, \"I guess we could do that,\" before suddenly looking back down again at her naked body and bashfully saying, \"But uh...maybe...maybe I should put on some clothes first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's okay, Emily,\" you told her, placing a hand on her cheek as she moved to turn away, looking deeply into her eyes and assuring her, \"You look beautiful just as you are.\" And with that, you brought your lips down towards hers and planted a soft little kiss on her mouth, tasting that same cherry flavor you remembered from before. Returning the kiss, this time being as soft and as gentle as you were to her, Emily wrapped her arms around you, pressing her nude body against yours, her small breasts and hard nipples pushing into your chest as you both happily made out, without a monster in sight. This particular moment for you had been a long time coming, and now that it was finally here, it was every bit as wonderful as you could have hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking out for a good five minutes or so, your mouths then parted, the two of you grinning like idiots as you joked, \"I guess this means you don't really like me, huh? Seeing as you haven't 'Lizarded-out'\", recalling what she'd told you about her emotions getting the better of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, stupid!\" she giggled, \"It doesn't mean that at all. It just means that I'm in control. That I know what I want,\" and with that she took your hand in hers and led it down to her small, perfectly proportioned breast and placed it on top, giving you her permission to explore her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd explore it you did, getting your first ever proper experience of the female form as you gently caressed her breasts and stroked and tweaked at her thick little pink gumdrop nipples, growing ever bolder as your penis began straining within your pants and actually wrapping your lips around one and taking it into your mouth, causing Emily to let out a soft little moan of pleasure. The next thing you knew you were both now on the bed, kissing and fondling as you pulled your shirt over your head and Emily helped you unbuckle your pants; this day taking a very different turn from what you had initially envisioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you had done it before, you were both novices when it came to sex and there was a lot of fumbling and nervous giggling after you'd got undressed. Recalling the Sex Ed class you'd had a few months back, when the teacher had handed out condoms to everyone, you rifled through your pocket and discovered one inside your wallet where you had planted it 'just in case'. Emily however, stopped you before you'd even gotten it open, telling you that \"you won't need that, trust me,\" explaining that her biology was a lot different from other girls and assuring you that she wouldn't get pregnant. Though you weren't entirely sure what she meant by that, having assumed that as regular Emily she was just the same as every other girl, you trusted her enough to know what she was talking about, and discarding the condom onto the floor, you then positioned yourself on top of her, getting your first proper view of her non green, non reptilian vagina. Assisting you as you stared at it's perfectly formed beauty, you then plunged your penis inside, feeling a familiar, yet at the same time decidedly different sensation as you did. Where as her lizard vagina had been both cold, Emily's was warm and not quite so tight, tight enough certainly that as her wet, silky smooth muscles clamped down around your penis it felt absolutely awesome, but not so much as you thought your penis might actually snap of (as had been the case the last time).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow inside Emily, you both passionately kissed again as you slowly started thrusting yourself in and out of her, gradually getting a little faster as you grew more confident, causing Emily to moan out in pleasure. This was an altogether different experience from your first time making love, the two of you both being willing parties and getting as much enjoyment out of it as the other, and although it didn't last all that long (being inexperienced after all), every single second of it was literally the greatest experience you'd ever had in your life.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After finally orgasming and feeling yourself grow soft inside Emily, you rolled off her and the two of you both lay there on top of her bed, panting heavily and giggling softly to one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...that was incredible!\" you told her, looking over at your girlfriend's flushed face, Emily looking every bit as beautiful even in her post coital state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it really was,\" she agreed, leaning her head towards you and giving you a light peck on the mouth, \"I'm glad you were my first...again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing at this, Emily's reference to your previous love making session no longer seeming like such a big deal now that you had accepted who she was, and had more than made up for the horrifying nature of that experience by what the two of you had just done. \"I'm glad too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuffling her small body against yours and resting her head against your chest while you both recovered, you found yourself then gliding your hand over her beautifully soft, feminine curves, squeezing a little at her breast and flicking at her swollen nipples; Emily's body now being yours to explore, and yours hers. After about five or so minutes of this, feeling more safe and secure now than you'd done these past two weeks (ironically enough in the very arms of the person you had been most afraid of), you found yourself admitting to Emily something you hadn't yet been able to admit even to yourself, telling her that, \"You know before, when you were transformed, and I told you to change back because I was a little too freaked out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it wasn't your lizard form the freaked me out exactly. I mean it was, but <i>it wasn't</i>, if you get what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling a little at your lack of eloquence, Emily replied, \"Not exactly, no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. But I don't want you to think I'm weird or anything, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late for that,\" she smiled, giggling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her cute laugh was somewhat infectious, you tried not to get derailed from what you were trying to tell her, needing now to get this thing off your chest. \"Seriously though, when you first transformed and, you know, had sex with me like <i>that</i>, I was obviously pretty damn confused and scared. But I'm not gonna lie to you, the actual act itself, did feel, well, kind of amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis appeared to come as somewhat of a surprise to her, as she ceased her giggling and looked up at you with wide eyes. \"It did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it did,\" you said, stumbling a little as you felt your face turn red, \"I mean it...oh God, <i>this is embarrassing!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's okay. I turn into a giant lizard. I've got the monopoly on embarrassing here,\" Emily informed you with a warm smile, \"You can tell me anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was of course true, and you really doubted there was much that could surprise her, so spurred on by this, putting your embarrassment to one side for a moment, you sat up on the bed a little and continued, telling Emily, \"Okay, well even though it did feel nice, thinking that you were some horrible beast from hell or whatever did kind of taint that a little. But then when you explained that it was still you and you spoke to me...like that, I really began to see you instead of the monster. I mean, obviously you were still a big lizard, but I recognized you in it. And well...I kind of, I kind of began appreciating other aspects of your were-lizard form...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like my giant boobs you mean?\" Emily asked, predicting where you were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, those...those were definitely nice,\" you replied, your eyes lingering for a moment on her pert little bosom as you did, before getting back to what you were saying, \"But not just that. I don't know, you just suddenly seemed a lot sexier or something, and it made me remember what sex was like that first time. I didn't want you to change back because I was scared, I wanted you to change back cause I was confused and embarrassed. Seeing you like that, in your lizard form started to turn me on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, really? You found me attractive like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yuh-yeah. I suppose I did,\" you told her, worrying for a second that she might think less of you because of it. \"Does that make me weird? I'm only telling you this cause I don't want there to be any secrets between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Emily's response was the exact opposite. \"No. No, that doesn't make you weird. Not at all,\" she told you, as a bashful little grin suddenly made it's way onto her face, \"In fact, I'm really happy to hear you say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she said, fiddling now with her hair, the tables having suddenly turned, with her being the one who now looked nervous as she explained, \"I didn't want to say earlier, cause it was difficult enough explaining everything to you as it was, and I didn't know what you'd think of me either, but I find my were-lizard form kind of sexy too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You do?</i>\" you said, being both stunned and amazed by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. That's one of the reasons I grew so comfortable being like that, and why I liked to transform so often,\" she continued, becoming quite animated now, \"There's just something about being so big and muscular and curvy that feels so good. I mean normally I'm just small and skinny and my boobs aren't really all that impressive...\" As she said this, her hands moved towards her chest and gently cupped each small mound for a moment, before looking back up at you again with an enthused and excited grin, \"But when I transform, I feel like some sort of...<i>Goddess</i>; with those giant, boobs and thick nipples that are oh so sensitive, not to mention my vagina too. Even as a lizard, with green skin and a tail, I just feel somehow more beautiful and confident...\" adding with another little giggle, \"and I find it hard to keep my hands off myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I had no idea,\" you said, finding what she was saying to be actually kind of arousing, her excitement clearly rubbing off on you to, \"That's...that's <i>awesome!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly pulling herself onto her knees, having clearly had an idea, Emily then looked you square in the face and asked, \"Do...do you want me to change? Do you want to experience everything we just did, but with an 8 foot green giantess? Cause I promise you, it'll be a whole lot more incredible for both of us!\" Reigning her enthusiasm in for a moment, realizing how ahead of herself she was getting and that you might not actually be up for going quite that far (seeing how the last time didn't exactly turn out so well), she paused and said, sounding a lot less sure of herself, \"That's uh, that's if...you know, you really meant what you said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had meant it however, and even though there was still some unease in the back of your mind towards the creature, listening to Emily and hearing what she had to say about her lizard form made you realize just how turned on by it you really were; the thought of actually making love to a giant, reptilian, musclebound Emily sounding now like one of the most amazing experience you could ever have. \"I did, and I would,\" you then told her, feeling your recently depleted penis already starting to grow, \"I think I'd like that a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's practically started to squeal with joy as you said this, her beautiful naked body squirming excitedly above you, causing you to laugh. \"Oh thank you, thank you, thank you!\" she said, leaping on top of you and wrapping her arms around your neck, assaulting you then with a tirade of kisses, \"This is gonna be so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it must <i>really</i> feel good,\" you chuckled, having never seen Emily so enthused before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't what she was excited about however (although it indeed did), explaining that it was more the fact that you actually liked were-Emily too, having never imagined for one minute that anyone other than herself possibly ever could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say?\" you playfully shrugged, \"I'm a freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which Emily then replied, \"You and me both,\" before hopping backwards off the bed and asking, \"So you ready? You ready for your sexy lizard monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You bet!</i>\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting back on the bed, gripped by a strange mixture of both fear and nervous excitement, you then watched as for the second time today, Emily once again began to transform; letting out a small, but very satisfied sounding little moan as her fragile little body began to quickly grow larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, witnessing it was not quite as terrifying as before, having suitably prepared yourself, and as Emily's body grew bigger and stronger, and muscles began to bulge out from beneath her skin, transforming her into a hulking, green behemoth, you actually began to feel your penis twitch (especially when those giant breasts ballooned out from her body). Emily too seemed to be enjoying the experience even more this time; her moans of pleasure being far louder and orgasmic, as her now yellowy/green reptilian eyes gazed upon you with a look of pure lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, her pale skin had turned thick and green and those familiar dark scales had covered her body, while her long, lizard tail began growing out of her lower back and whipping around excitedly behind her. In less than a minute she was over 7 feet tall, shooting up to 8 feet, as beautiful, cute and cuddly Emily was replaced by a no longer quite so scary (yet no less intimidating) looking powerful and ginormous reptilian goddess, who released a throaty roar as her large bald head scrapped against the ceiling, causing little flakes of paint to fall to the floor around it. \"<i>Mmmm, yeah. That'sss much better!</i>\" she grinned, flashing those large fangs and flicking her long, fork like tongue out and back in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meanwhile, just sat there staring up at the massive creature in complete and utter awe, acting no less frightened or nervous now that you knew for definite that she meant you no harm. These feelings actually making the fact that there was now a huge naked monster towering above you, for some strange reason, all the more arousing, and it took all you had sitting there not to wet yourself and spontaneously ejaculate both at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ssso, what do you think? Do I look even sssexier like thisss?</i>\" Emily hissed, playfully sticking one massive clawed hand on her hip and the other on the back of her scaly head, thrusting a leg out in a pose reminiscent of a model or beautiful women in films.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh-duh-definitely!\" you whimpered, once again frozen on the spot as your eyes traversed your girlfriend's strange, reptilian body; taking in the unnatural splendor of her thick, sickly green hide and those massive beach ball sized breasts that hung from each. Breasts, that would no doubt make every single surgically enhanced porn star jealous beyond belief, being not only ridiculously huge, but also perfectly shaped too, as if almost entirely unaffected by gravity as they pushed out from her body about two feet in length. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well then, what are you waiting for? Get over here and come sssee what your sssexy lizard girlfriend hasss got for you.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to keep her waiting, you pushed yourself up onto your knees and slowly began crawling across the bed towards her, feeling your body trembling as you did, while your penis pushed out, fully erect and throbbing. Though it was the third time you'd seen Emily like this, it wasn't any less of an overwhelming sight, and your heart was once beating rapidly in your chest - though thankfully this time, not so much that you thought you were going to have a heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, you look so...so <i>amazing</i> like that!\" you told her as you reached the edge of the bed and stared up at her incredibly strange, monster like beauty, overwhelmed by her massive, muscular frame; her arms alone being almost as big as your entire body, and the taut rippling tissue beneath no doubt able to rip you in two with an ease that defied description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your eyes locked to her bulging biceps, Emily let out a proud little giggle and moved an arm towards you, asking, \"<i>Wanna feel?</i>\" flexing as she did, causing the already large muscle to bulge out even further from within her thick, scaly hide. Very much wanting to, curious to see just how it felt (having never felt anyone's bicep outwith your own - which admittedly now looked like a twig in comparison), you slowly reached out and gently placed your fingers atop the rock hard mound and gently ran your fingers over both the scaly bumps and the thick veins popping out from beneath the flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's...it's huge!\" you told her, very much stating the obvious, but having no other words really to describe it, watching as Emily's reptilian face continued to once again chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It'sss not the only thing that'sss huge either</i>,\" she smiled, nodding down towards her humongous chest that was now only a couple of feet away, moving her arm away and lowering herself down to her knees, so that your face was once again level with it. \"<i>I know boysss love boobsss; big boobsss</i>,\" she told you, cupping each gigantic, fleshy breast with her clawed hands and pushing them out towards you, grinning as she did, \"<i>Well I don't think you'll find anyone elssse in the world with onesss asss big asss thessse!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Someone I don't think I will...\" you replied, almost hypnotically, having difficulty taking both of them in at the same time, the pale green fleshy taking up pretty much all of your vision, and those hard, puckered nipples pointing out directly towards you. If there was one thing you most certainly were, it was a breast man, and you could recall your slight disappointment back when you'd first met Emily that her boobs were only a B cup (it not lasting long of course, she was a girl after all). Now though, her tits were positively off the chart and you seriously doubted that there was a bra in existence that could contain those things; being like two miracles of nature that only a girl as positively ripped and ginormous as Emily could possibly be able to support them on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping you from your awe-struck and captivated stare, Emily laughed, \"<i>Well go on then. What are you waiting for?</i>\" thrusting them out even closer to your face, till they were only mere inches away, very obviously wanting you to play with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou of course were more than eager to, yet were still obviously getting over the utter surrealness of all of this, so once again moved your hands rather slowly towards one of Emily's giant globes and lightly pressed it against her flesh. The sensation was not at all what you were expecting, having assumed it would have felt somewhat like her arm; tough, dry and rather hard to the touch. Instead it was rather soft, and smooth and spongy, not at all unlike Emily's breast as a human (only of course much, much bigger), the parts of her hide uncovered by scales presumably being the fleshy, sensitive parts, that didn't quite need so much protection. This was indeed good news for you, as you gently caressed the huge boob, enjoying its smoothness and watching as your hands sunk slightly into it like jello, completely amazed by how tiny and insignificant your hands looked in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>They feel nice, don't they?</i>\" Emily said, looking down at you as you busily amused yourself with your hands, telling you with a chuckle to, \"<i>Try lifting it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlashing her an enthused grin and taking up the challenge, assuming by the look on her face that it was going to be quite heavy, you slid both hands down to the underside of the massive orb and lifted it upwards as best you could. \"<i>Jesus!</i>\" you exclaimed, having to put your back into it and really push your muscles, her boob weighing about the same as a large sack of potatoes or something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling again at this, she teased, \"<i>I know. Pretty heavy, right?</i>\", before reaching beneath each breast with her own much larger hands, hefting them both up and down a few times in quick succession, putting you completely to shame. \"<i>Good thing I have thessse big ssstrong musclesss. Otherwissse I would be able to do...THISSS!</i>\" Suddenly, and without warning, Emily then brought both breasts together around your head, imprisoning you within her cleavage, and forcing the sides of your face into each soft, squishy mound, pushing and squeezing them against you. Though it did come as somewhat of a shock and you initially found yourself almost suffocating on the ridiculous amount of boob flesh, you had to admit that it felt amazing being trapped within Emily's soft and strangely cool cleavage (being a reptile and all, she didn't seem to have a great deal of body heat) and you began rubbing your face just as enthusiastically against it as she was against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing you from your imprisonment, and laughing a little as you gasped for air, Emily then asked, \"<i>Hee hee. How'd you like that? Being trapped by my big boobiesss?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was awesome!\" you quickly replied, amazed by how confident and completely in charge she now was.. It was almost a complete 180 from how she'd previously been, and you had to say, even though she was now a hulking monster who could no doubt crush you like a bug if you didn't do what she said, being played with and ordered around like this was really kind of exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Good. I'm glad you liked it, cause now I've got two more big thingsss for you to play with</i>,\" she then teased, pinching at her thick green nipples, \"<i>And I'm betting they'll feel a whole lot better with your mouth around them..</i>.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you could even manage a reply Emily then grabbed the back of your head with her giant hand and thrust your face into her massive bosom, forcing the thick, rubbery protrusion into your mouth, almost causing you to gag due to it's size. \"<i>Mmm, Yeah! That'sss it, Ryan, sssuck me! Sssuck my big boobiesss!</i>\" she enthusiastically moaned after you'd gotten over the initial shock of having her jello like mound once again engulfing your face and began pulling and teasing at the fat nipple with your lips, finding that the whole thing pretty much took up the entirety of your mouth. Not that that made much difference to you, enjoying the taste and texture just as much as you had sucking on Emily's much smaller human nipples (possibly even more so), as you soon began attacking it with far more gusto, while your free hand located the other nipple and began pulling and twisting at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was clearly enjoying this, as was made obvious by her increasingly loud moans and the fact that she seemed to be continually trying to suffocate you with her breast, pressing you into it's cushiony softness as hard as she could, forcing as much of the nipple and breast flesh into your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though she released you and you practically fell backwards onto the bed, leaving a trail of saliva as you went and feeling somewhat worn out already. Truly she was a different beast in lizard form, being far wilder, aggressive and just downright domineering than she had been moments before as the two of you had softly and gently caressed one another's bodies. Now she really was a wild animal and you were very much at her mercy; which had to be said, for you was real <i>turn on!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh God, that felt ssso much better having sssome else do that for a change!</i>\" she grinned, flashing her fangs and looking rather satisfied over your performance. This of course made you all the more turned on, realizing that it meant that Emily must suck on her own breasts when she was masturbated, which of course gave you yet another insight into what an incredibly sexual being she truly was (moving ever farther and farther away from the cute and innocent type she had originally appeared). Not content with just a little nipple play though, she then gave each boob a gentle squeeze before running her hands down past her impressive abs, towards the space between her legs and the soft green flesh between them. \"<i>Now letsss sssee if it feelsss any better down here,</i>\" she said, looking down at you and throwing you a suggestive little wink, rubbing at her vagina as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching from the bed, Emily then sat down on the floor as best she could (her huge frame taking up most of the space between the bed and the wall) and spread her legs wide, giving you your best view yet of her sopping wet vagina. Although it was green and far larger than any ordinary human's, in every other respect it was a normal vagina; right down to  folds of her labia and the little hooded nub that was poking out from within, this clearly being her clitoris. \"<i>Well...what are you jussst sssitting there for?</i>\" she smiled, as you remained there on the bed, staring at the fleshy object between her legs with a sort of stunned reverence; having never before seen a view like this outside of a porn site (and even then it was never <i>like this!</i>), \"<i>Come get a clossser look.</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeckoning you then with one clawed finger, while the other hand carefully parted her wet sex, revealing the soft green flesh inside, you slowly began to crawl your way towards her, taking in the powerful aroma that was emanating from within, a scent that you remembered well from that first fateful experience with Emily in Lizard form. It was the smell of her sex, and although it was strange and powerful, filling your every orifice as you reached the end of the bed (finding your head now practically even with Emily's crotch), it was also utterly intoxicating to your senses and you found yourself breathing it in deeply as you finally came face to face with her highly aroused, reptilian vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in somewhat of a trance now as you gazed inside her, watching the little droplets of moisture leaking out of her tunnel and falling onto the carpet below, Emily had to give you some encouragement to get you moving, whispering softly, \"<i>You can tassste me if you like.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wuh-wuh-what?\" you squeaked, snapping briefly out of your drunken haze and staring back up at her soft yellowy/green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I sssaid you can tassste me,</i>\" she repeated, \"<i>You know, with your mouth.</i>\" this time causing you to gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a virgin until just recently, you'd never actually done anything like that before, and so naturally felt slightly apprehensive about whether or not you'd actually be any good at it. Add to the fact that you'd be basically plunging your mouth into the depths of a giant lizard creature, recalling that thick green ooze that you had ended up covered in last time, and you weren't so sure you were quite ready for such a step. Unfortunately for you it seemed that Emily was more than ready as you felt her hand then grab at the back of your head and lead you towards her large, drooling opening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even object or try to come up with some sort of excuse, your entire face was suddenly pressed against the slippery wet flesh and you found yourself not only tasting her, but breathing her in as well; your every sense having been taking over by Emily's vagina. The first thing that hit you was a strange, sharp tangy flavor, quite unlike anything you'd ever experienced before, and for a moment you thought you might gag as you tried desperately to breath, inhaling even more of into your nose and mouth. Meanwhile, above you could hear Emily's voice quietly encouraging you, telling you to \"<i>Lick me, Ryan! Put your tongue inssside me!</i>\" as she continued to hold your head firmly in place. With few options left to you, having no way really to express your discomfort, nor compete against her supernatural strength (as well as genuinely wanting to make her feel good), you rather gingerly stuck out your tongue and pushed it inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ohhh...ohhhh GOD!</i>\" she moaned as you licked away, trying to acclimatize yourself to the unusual taste, finding soon enough that the more you did it, the more used to it you got, until you were finally lapping at her pussy with erotic abandon, spurred on by the sound of her reptilian groans. \"<i>Ohhhh God, that feelsss ssso good!</i>\" Glad that she appeared to be enjoying it, you continued your assault, pressing your face further into her pussy and working your probing tongue all over her dripping wet slot as she rewarded you with further moans of pleasure, squeezing her large muscular legs around your head, locking you in a vice like grip. \"<i>Ohhhh God...that'sss incredible Ryan! Keep doing that....keep doing THAT!</i>\" she squealed, as you started to rub your nose against her clit while simultaneously lapping at her tunnel, feeling her juices start to gush. What was clear was that this was a first for her as well, and while you weren't exactly sure if she was getting so much pleasure out of it because you were doing a good job, or if it was more to do with her being extra sensitive in lizard form (or both), all you knew was that she was enjoying it and so to now were you as you continued eating her out, trying not to choke as her thick juices began filling up your mouth and dribbling its way down your chin; the taste of which you now couldn't get enough of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of this, feeling kind of woozy from having your face pressed tightly against your monstrous girlfriend's vagina for so long, with little else to breath but her own sexually aroused scent, you suddenly felt Emily's legs squeeze your head harder (so much so that you feared it might actually pop) as her massive body began bucking and squirming in ecstasy beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>OHHHHHH YESSS! YESSSS! YEEESSSS</i>!\" she suddenly screamed as the most mind-blowing orgasm ripped through her giant, muscular body, pushing your head so far into her cunt that you actually thought for a moment it was going to disappear inside. After almost a minute with next to no air and your head positively drowning now with her juices, she finally released her grip on you and you sprung back, coughing and spluttering as you went, glad that you hadn't actually passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ryan! Oh my God, I'm ssso sssorry!</i>\" you heard her say after coming down from her amazing high, having presumably noticed you there on the bed, with your face completely covered in her thick green ooze, looking absolutely exhausted and trying your best to breathe, \"<i>Are you okay?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think I'll live...\" you told her, feeling a large hand suddenly rubbing at your back as you coughed up the last of her juices and found your vision slowly coming back into focus, \"Just maybe next time, let me breathe a little at the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApologizing profusely for nearly suffocating you, having been unaware at the time that she'd even done it (one of the disadvantages of your small human stature compared to her large were-lizard one), Emily helped you to wipe some of her residue from your face and then gave you a big hug, promising not to be quite so rough next time. You of course forgave her immediately, well aware that she hadn't meant of it (having been way too caught up in the bliss of the orgasm that <i>you'd given her</i>) and the two of you sat there for a few minutes getting your breath back, while at the same time giggling jokingly about what it was you'd just done; it surely being a first as far as either of you knew. What other guy in history had actually given oral sex to a giant eight foot lizard beast?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<i>Okay, now it'sss your turn!</i>\" Emily said, after you had both sufficiently recovered, not entirely sure what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at her giant green form, which was half propped up on the bed, half sitting on the floor, you saw a familiar little sparkle in her eyes and a big grin appear on her face. Before you even had a chance to ask her what exactly 'your turn' meant, you watched a clawed hand slowly work it's way between your legs, towards (your surprisingly) still semi hard cock. \"Oh...<i>my</i> turn...\" you gulped, the penny suddenly dropping as you watched her grin get even wider and her long green tongue lick it's way across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a second later you suddenly felt two large fingers grip you down below, the sudden unexpected contact causing you to let out a couple of short sharp breathes, having certainly not expected this. Though it was clear that in her were-lizard form Emily was incredibly sexual and you had just finished eating her out, you never imagined you yourself would be getting a blow job, on what you supposed was technically your first date together as boyfriend and girlfriend. It was happening though, and as you watched Emily's face move ever closer to your crotch, you couldn't help worrying for a moment that with those large fangs there was a great risk of her possibly biting it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Emily, wuh-wait!\" you squeaked just as she began to open her mouth, stopping her completely in her tracks. Looking up at you questioningly, wondering what was wrong, you let out a nervous yet relieved little breath and asked her, \"Are uh, are you sure this is a good idea? What with the sharp teeth and all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer response to this wasn't quite the one you were after however as she began giggling at the thought. \"<i>Don't worry, I know what I'm doing</i>,\" she told you, sounding a lot more confident than you were, before giving you a sexy little wink and continuing her attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you knew, Emily's mouth had completely engulfed your cock, and rather than the feeling of sharp, jagged teeth scraping against delicate flesh that you had expected, you instead felt the rather more pleasant sensation of her soft lips gently sucking at your shaft. It took you a moment or two to get used to the sensation (as well as get over your fear), but once you had you could honestly say you'd never experienced anything quite like it; the feeling of Emily's cool, cold blooded mouth sucking away on your penis almost as if it were a lollypop being absolutely incredible! Giving fully into it as you quickly grew to full length inside her mouth, no longer worrying about what might or might not happen, just allowing the pleasure to overtake you, you soon began moaning and groaning away to yourself just like Emily had done before you, utterly captivated by the sight of her bald, green scaly head moving backwards and forward below. Just as you were really getting into it though, you suddenly felt something wet and slippery wrapping its way around your member, and letting out a loud squeal, you cried, \"Ohhh my God...What...what is that?!\" panicking for a second as some foreign object had somehow invaded Emily's still sucking mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up towards your girlfriend and locking your eyes on hers, you watched as she flashed you another mischievous little smirk and slowly began to move her head away from your cock, revealing that it was her long, reptilian tongue that was now coiled tightly around it, still massaging it's length, just as it had done on that very first time. Letting out a sigh of relief as Emily giggled again then placed you back inside her mouth, having forgotten about her tongue for a moment and feeling like a bit of a fool that you had. It did feel nice though, just as it had done before. In fact it felt better than nice, much better; it felt amazing! The combined efforts of her soft sucking lips, while at the same time her tongue pulled and squeezed at your length was absolutely incredible and in no time at all you felt your orgasm building, like an out of control freight train that you had no way of stopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelling out to her, \"Oh God, Em...Emily...I'm gonna...I'm gonna cum!\" afraid that you were going to blow right in her mouth, you watched amazed as her lips clamped down even tighter on your penis and her tongue squeezed it for all it's worth, as you soon began spurting away, cumming more than you ever had in your entire life (or at least it felt that way). Emily meanwhile continued to milk you with her tongue as she gulped down every last drop, before finally letting you go and collapsing down beside you on the bed, looking very satisfied indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Mmm, that was gooood</i>,\" you heard her giggle as you laid there on the bed again, absolutely spent, not quite sure how much more of this you could take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgreeing with her after recovering your breath and propping yourself back up, once again taking in the amazingly bizarre yet erotic sight of Emily's massive lizard upper body and huge beach ball sized breasts laying there beside you, you then shared with her your surprise that she'd actually swallowed your cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What? I alwayssss wanted to know what it tasssted like</i>,\" she told you, acting all coy (even as a giant lizard somehow still managing to find a way).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was the verdict?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Kind of yummy in a ssstrange sssort of way,</i>\" she giggled, licking her lips and slipping a hand between her massive thighs as she lifted herself off the bed. \"<i>In fact, I could probably go for a little more of it in me, if you get what I'm sssaying...You've had more than enough ressst now!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by her commanding voice, you quickly sat up, very much aware of what it was she was wanting; finding yourself completely amazed by just how seemingly insatiable her sexual desire now was. You'd both just made each other have the most intense orgasms ever, and you yourself had nearly passed out twice. Could you really take another round?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't see how that would renew my stamina completely, in fact I think it would probably only restore half my stamina. Plus I would be inexperienced with the form. I would probably get easily triggered into transforming assuming male were-lizards are more agressive and lose control. I have thought about it. The strength, the height, the hot bod, and the terrifying primal instincts when not in control. And even if the were-lizard side of me does remember our love I'm afraid that so much as another guy harmlessly flirting with you could make me lose control. And I don't know how horny I would be when not in control, nor the boundary of appatite. I'm scared that when not in control I'd be more likely to eat people and that unlike our love friends, family, and my pet would not be safe from being on the menu when instincts call the shots, ravenously devouring anyone that's not you simply to satisfy it's hunger. But their also the benefit of strengthening our relationship even more, by both of knowing the same gifts of control over the form. But mastering control I would have the strength to properly protect those I care about. I would need meditation to find mastery of controlling such power, to find balance between my Were-lizard instincts and humanity. Still though it has risks, the benefits of it once mastered outweigh the risks. So I'll take those risks for you Emily my love. Turn me into a were-lizard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Emily nods and does what is necessary to turn me into a Were-lizard. I make sure to be meditating when she turns me into one. The feeling of the transformation did not break my meditation. I'm able to calm my new instincts, and I end my meditation.

Hands grip your elbows and pin your arms to your side as the ribbed roof of her mouth hits the back of your head, and the base of her tongue presses to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassive pressure heaves in on you as flesh bores in from all sides while that tongue wriggles it's way over your shoulders and yanks, somehow cramming them into her mouth. Spit and wet flesh ripple over your head, you squeezing down an incredibly tight tube. Her gullet! It's then you realize you aren't cut. Somehow she opened her jaws so wide her teeth didn't even touch your shoulders!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoesn't stop her from swallowing again however, and when she does your ears pop and you grunt as the pressure wave of moist flesh heaves in tightly. You're starting to see spots in front of your eyes from the lack of air while her tongue heaves in your chest. Creaking around your head makes you jump as you pile in behind her rib cage, giving you a vivid mental picture of your body sliding down BEHIND those massive tits of hers! This is impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands grab your hips as her knees slide to either side of your legs, freeing them. Taloned fingers now aided her tongue in cramming you down her throat and she moans and slobbers over your body as it is heaved into her. You feel a tight ring squeeze over your head and a slightly acrid smell welcomes you to her stomach. It's small, but as she presses your waist into her mouth you find her belly stretches easily to allow your shoulders to wedge inside. You don't think the rest of you will be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her tongue reaches your hips and coils between your legs. Gaping in amazement you shudder at the thought of those reptilian lips and tongue on your hips and... you don't have to imagine it any more. You can't help but buck as that lithe organ wraps completely around your shaft and begins to milk you, even as your hips enter her mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't last long, and soon are twitching and moaning while the beast sucks up it's spoils greedily, gulping the sticky mess down alongside your body. Piling tightly into her belly you curl up, feeling the heat pervade you. The walls heave and quake, shivering for some reason as you fill her gut. The moist prison surrounding you lets your arms in finally as her teeth scrape lightly over your feet and a final gulp shoves you down. Hammering on the walls doesn't seem to do anything and it takes only a couple of gulps to fold your legs into that belly with the rest of you, crammed into a tight fetal ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate you! SHE ATE YOU ALIVE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering and twitching you try to ignore the fact you have a huge hard on right now. Why? How? You just came. Why on earth would being eaten alive make you horny as fuck?</span></div></div>",

Grunting you feel your head jammed between your knees, your body curling tightly in on itself as hot flesh crushes you from all sides. Groans and moans and shaking comes from around you as you are squeezed tightly, but finally it ends, and even relaxes a little about you. That's when you hear a familiar, high pitched voice from around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh... oh god... oh.. NOOOOOO!!\" the scream practically deafens you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily? That was Emily! How? Your mind doesn't grasp it, as frazzled as you are. Then the world shifts drastically around you, twisting, heaving. What is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Oh no! Ryan!\" She sobs, and then starts bawling hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach is still tight and there is very little air left in here, but you twist, edge your face down between your knees to get to the gap there, and then take a slow, deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EMILY!\" you scream \"NEED AIR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shuddering stops abruptly, the crying changing to sniffling, then an incredibly confused squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Emily whispers. \"That's not possible! No!.... R... Ryan? Oh god, air. Hang on! *GULP!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the stomach stretches as air, sweet, fresh air, squirts in around you. Taking languid gulps of the sweetness you sigh, feeling the stomach relax further around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... is that alright?\" Emily stammers. \"Ryan? Oh god, did I wait too long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, it's OK *pant* I'm just exhausted. I'm still here. Let me catch my breath a minute, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wriggle a bit, getting your arms around your knees a little more comfy, and try to relax. Yeah, relax! Right! Despite the panic you're feeling though your groin is deciding it really wants a second chance still. Rock hard and twitching despite the situation you're in. What is that about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, you're really OK in there? How? I... ate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Trust me, I noticed!\" you manage, though it's hard not to shiver at the thought. \"Don't suppose you could let me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no clue how, or even where you are!\" Emily replies, almost in tears again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'where I am'? I'm in your stomach.\" You say, finding it hard to get the bitterness out of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... there's no sign of you. I mean, nothing. I look just like I always do... just like I do after... 'she' eats. I thought it was all digested or something when I switched back. Maybe not huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is ridiculous. She can't show nothing of you in here! You're bigger than she is for heaven's sake. Well, bigger than what she normally looks like. You shudder involuntarily as the image of her eight foot tall scaly alternate shape burns from your memory, her breasts swaying hypnotically before you, tongue lengthening to lick your face... NO! Stop that, gotta think clearly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, OK Emily. But I'm pretty sure I AM in your stomach. Can't you just make yourself sick or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my jaws don't stretch like that, only 'her's' do!\" she says, and it's obvious who she means by 'her's'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is insane!\" you mutter.</span></div></div>",

Oh Ryan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the squishes you think she's hugging you through her stomach. Sniffling yourself you reach out to her. You had no idea she felt this strongly for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily! It's OK, I'M OK, for now. We just need to find a way for me to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to bottle up your fear and panic. This is Emily! It's hard, but you like her a lot... when she's not eating you. You DO want to ask her so many things right now. Like how she did that, change... and if she's... eaten anyone before. Horrible thoughts, but no. You can't believe actually eat people! Shaking your head you try to put that thought behind you. Oddly you start to feel sorry for her and place a hand against the warm surface of her stomach. As you struggle with your thoughts Emily shifts and makes a surprised noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Why are they HERE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel her jump up and dash around, you bouncing rapidly around in her tummy. From the sounds of it she's desperately putting clothes on. God this is weird! She's dressing with you INSIDE her! An odd little shiver goes down your spine. Finally you hear a door slam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Hey, nice to see you.\" A smacking sound comes from above, sounding like a perfunctory kiss on the cheek \"I thought you were out for the weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know dear.\" Comes the somewhat annoyed sounding tones from Emily's mother. It's difficult to make out, sounding muffled and distant. \"Your father is still with Deirdre, but she needed her medicine so I had to dash back to get some. Now, more importantly, what are YOU still doing here young girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Mom's voice had taken on a demanding tone and you felt Emily tense up around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! What do you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the clock young lady! Six o'clock? Ring any bells? Dance practice? Just because we weren't here do you really think you can get out of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heck!\" Emily said, slumping. \"I... I forgot Mom! I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw sweetie, it's OK. I guess Ryan was a little distracting hmm? I take it he left already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a slightly noticeable pause from Emily before she answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, it's OK he... went... a little while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a 'tut' from Emily's Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I detect a problem? Come on Emily, what's up sweetie? Was he mean to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god no! No, he was wonderful. We just... had a little difficulty. It's actually my fault, but... I'm sure we'll work it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gurgle echoed around you as the stomach clenched. Yeah, as long as she didn't 'work it out' by digesting you you were fine with that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, OK, as long as you're fine. Now, come on, get changed, I'll drop you at dance class on the way back to Deidre's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm OK! Just go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. You just get ready. Quickly girl, come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily slumps away from her mom and soon you hear her bedroom door close again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ryan, what will I do? I can't tell my Mom about this, I just CAN'T! She'd hate me! She'd never understand. But... how.... Oh god, what a mess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're going to be trapped in here a while, aren't you? The thought sends shivers down your spine again, but this is EMILY you're talking about! You can picture her sweet face in your head, those lips you've been dying to kiss all week...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK Emily. I'm fine. Just... i don't know, get some antacids or something and head out. I'll be fine! Go! Enjoy your class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a pregnant pause, punctuated by a couple of sniffs from Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't deserve you Ryan. Oh god I love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... love you too Emily.\" Your gonads talking again... maybe... though you are sniffly yourself now. God, what's wrong with you? She ATE you for heaven's sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the odd rustling sounds of Emily getting changed again, this time things pinching a little around you, getting quite tight. You guess she's putting on a leotard or something. Shortly after some pink stuff pours in on top of you, Pepto Bismol you think. A lot of it! Well, maybe that will help. You can only hope! Finally she's ready and you hear car noises outside as her mother drives her out. Clunks of car doors herald her arrival at class and she says goodbye to her Mom again. God this is surreal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Here we are.\" She mutters as you hear the car drive off.</span></div></div>",

Well, it gets out of control. In the last few years I've had it pretty much in check. I have to 'let her out' every month to play or it gets hard to control, but other than that things have gone well... till now. Oh I'm so sorry Ryan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, that explained a lot about why she was acting the way she was this last week or so. Still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how long have you been... changing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she stops, and you think she's leaning against a wall by the feel of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A long long time. It's difficult to talk about. In fact you're the first I've ever told! *Sigh* Um, first I guess I'd better tell you what I am. I'm a were-lizard. As much as that means anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to wrap your brain around that and fail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, like a werewolf, but I change into a lizard creature instead of a wolf man. I don't know how it works, but it's based on emotion. Like I said, the last few years I've been able to control it more, but I used to have a hell of a time. Luckily we lived out in the woods then and there was little to make 'her' come out and play. When we moved to the city a while back I had to learn to control it and fast! I think I've done pretty well, and managed to avoid my parents finding out... somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but why are you a were-lizard, and how long?\"</span></div></div>",

She then takes her shirt off and I can see what looks like three fingers instead of five fingers on each arm. She then takes unzips both her pants and mine. She then notices that I am terrified and having an erection, then starts fucking me. Her belly slowly starts getting bigger, but it isn't extremely large, just a minor pot belly. Her ears then get bigger, and what looks like tusks form. Then on her bell, I see four tiny, for lack of a better word, nipples forming. They are erect. Then I finally zone out to the erotic feeling of in and out. It feels crazy inside of her. Then suddenly, not at the same time, we both came. When she finishes, the only thing I recognize that was Ashley is her hair. She then reverts back to normal and then covers herself up and puts her clothes back on. I am in catatonic shock and don't pay attention. She then comes to me and says, \"Ryan...Are you okay?\" Then suddenly, I just scream, \"WOOOOW!\" I then said, \"BEST! KISS!

She's what they w-would call a, um.... *gulp* a pig-girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pig...girl? What the hell's a pig-girl?\" I asked, starting to piece together what Ashley was telling me yet still confused about the whole matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, I watched as the girl I just dated grab a family photo hidden in a nearby cabinet, where she then handed me the picture and answered, \"This...this is her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did what she asked of me, as I gently grabbed the photo and looked at it. What I saw with my own two eyes was....well, I'll give you the description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the photo, I saw what appeared to be a large female human pig hybrid of sorts. She looked exactly like Ashley if she was a few hundred pounds heavier than when I first saw her as a pig-girl, complete with large thick legs, big flabby belly, plump arms, wide hips, and volleyball-sized breasts. But unlike Ash, the pig woman didn't dye the ends of her hair pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, one thing kept bothering me, as I looked back at Ashley and asked.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jim Randall was a young man from New Zealand who lived on the edge, skateboarding everywhere and spending most of his time indoors behind a computer watching animal videos. One day, after watching a video about a panda being taught to play Hacky Sack, he read a comment written by a user named MotherTawaret. Out of curiosity, Jim looked closer and found out that MotherTawaret had an account on an art website and from the looks of it, she was an artist by profession. Jim learned from the webpage that MotherTawaret\u2019s real name was Elisa Levy and that she was an artist by profession, mainly a painter and used her web account to advertise her artwork. Jim decided to give this mysterious Elisa a reason to trust him and commissioned a painting, writing the message \u201cSurprise Me\u201d. Elisa did just this and sent Jim a painting that depicted a man opening a box containing a falcon, dolphin, lion, bison and rhinoceros. Jim sent positive feedback back to Elisa and agreed to critique her artwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa and Jim quickly became fast friends and e-mailed each other every day. However, since they communicated entirely through the Internet, they didn\u2019t know what the other looked like. It went on for one year until one day, Jim read a particular e-mail from Elisa. \u201cDear Jim, We have been friends for 1 year now. I greatly appreciate your comments. My art has greatly improved since I became friends with you. However, in all the years we\u2019ve been friends, I have no idea what you look like and I would love to meet you. My address is written below. I will be awaiting you in my home in Boston, March 15.\u201d Jim smiled and then typed a response. \u201cI\u2019ll see you there, Elisa. I\u2019d like to know who the mysterious MotherTawaret really is.\u201d With that e-mail sent, Jim booked a plane to America. However, he could only make it as far to New York before he had to take a train to Boston.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jim sat on the train, he was wondering who the mysterious Elisa Levy could be. \u201cElisa,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly a common name. I wonder if it\u2019s short for Elisabeth? If her name is MotherTawaret online, she must have Egyptian ancestry. Maybe she\u2019s descended from Cleopatra. I wonder if she\u2019s hot.\u201d Jim smiled as he imagined the beautiful girl that Elisa probably looked like. Although he had never met her, he already had somewhat of a crush on her and really hoped that she was a woman his own age. Then Jim remembered that while he knew Elisa for a year, he had met her online and she depicted no photographs of what she looked like. But then Jim took a deep breath as if to remind himself that looks weren\u2019t everything when it came to people. As he nodded his head, the train came to a stop. There was thunderous rumbling and Jim gasped. \u201cWhat\u2019s that sound?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt sounds like an earthquake.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t an earthquake. Jim turned his head and saw that it was a female passenger on the train that was the source of the quakes. But this strange woman was anything but normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman was a very large and obese woman who resembled a brown-skinned anthropomorphic hippopotamus. She appeared to be 10ft tall and had a large stomach with D-cup breasts and a booty the size of a couch. Her butt was in fact, so big that it seemed to reach to her shoulders. The hippo woman had long bluish black hair that reached down to her gargantuan rear and brown eyes and from the looks of it, she was wearing orange-red lipstick. The hippopotamus woman was wearing a black t-shirt that only covered the top half of her breasts and her nipples as well as a pair of tight jeans that were coming apart at the seams and a red jacket. Jim could only look in terror as the hippopotamus woman took her seat in front of him, or to be more accurate, took up all three seats in front of him and from the looks of it, even that wasn\u2019t enough to hold up her massive rear. Her belly was also pushing down on the table. Even sitting down, her breasts were higher than Jim\u2019s head and Jim had to tilt his head just to look at this strange woman\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippopotamus woman looked down at the tiny human on the train and gasped slightly. \u201cOh,\u201d she said in a surprisingly soft voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t see you down there. I didn\u2019t know there was somebody else already sitting at this table. If you like I\u2019ll...\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Jim. \u201cNo. That\u2019s perfectly fine.\u201d Jim was sweating because he saw the hippopotamus woman\u2019s large and intimidating teeth as her mouth was opened. From the looks of it, she could open her mouth wide enough to swallow a full grown human man whole. Jim remembered that hippopotami were very ill-tempered and territorial and were deadlier than lions and was sweating heavily. He definitely didn\u2019t want the enormous hippo lady to have any reason to be angry with him. However, the hippopotamus just reached into her cleavage and took out her cellphone to check her e-mails. The hippo lady let out a yawn and showed that she had a tongue piercing. For some strange reason, Jim couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of the massive lady. She was enormous and animalistic but for some reason, Jim found her to be very attractive. It could\u2019ve been her midnight black hair, her mocha skin or her hypnotic curves. But was it wrong to eye such a strange woman who was attracting the stares of all the other passengers on the train?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo woman then noticed that Jim was looking at her uneasily and then blinked. \u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d asked the hippo in curiosity. \u201cUh, no. I just wasn\u2019t expecting such a large... I mean weird! I mean... interesting lady... uh.\u201d The hippo woman then realized something and let out a giggle. \u201cOh, I get it. I guess you weren\u2019t expecting to see a werehippo on the train?\u201d Jim looked uneasily. \u201cWerehippo?\u201d he asked. The hippo woman nodded her head. \u201cI know we\u2019re not as common as werewolves, weretigers and werebears, but we\u2019re around. We mainly live in Africa but I moved here with my mom and sisters a while back. My name is Elisa.\u201d \u201cElisa?\u201d asked Jim in surprise. \u201cI came here to meet my pen pal named Elisa.\u201d Elisa blinked upon hearing that. \u201cReally? I invited my pen pal over to meet me in my home in Boston. A New Zealander named Jim Randall.\u201d Jim gave a gasp. \u201cI\u2019m Jim Randall. You mean all this time I\u2019ve been e-mailing a werehippo.\u201d Elisa smiled and let out a giggle. \u201cIt looks that way. I wasn\u2019t expecting that my pen pal would be a cutie like you.\u201d Jim cracked a nervous smile. He would never have guessed in a million years that he would be traveling to Boston to meet a werehippo</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jim was astonished but smiled nervously. \"I knew that these girls were not always who they seemed like online,\" thought the young man to himself. \"But who would've expected that all this time I was speaking to a werehippo.\" Jim had to admit however, Elisa was absolutely gorgeous (as far as hippopotami went). Sure, she was titanically obese, but that's the only body shape that hippos came in. It certainly helped that Jim had a good view of her breasts that each looked as heavy as a wrecking ball. Her butt was big enough to take up two entire bus stops and her hair seemed to sparkle in the light. Jim absolutely didn't know what to say to Elisa. He never met a hippo who could talk. There had to be something that he could do to break the proverbial ice. He then cleared his throat to get the hippo woman's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Elisa,\" said Jim. \"Now that I've met you in the real world, it's clear there's a lot I don't know about you. Are there a lot of werehippos like you in America?\" Elisa shook her head. \"No,\" she said. \"Werehippos mostly only live in Africa and we rarely leave the continent. My mom, my sisters and myself are the only werehippos in North America.\" \"Sisters?\" asked Jim. \"As in, more than one.\" Elisa grunted and nodded her head. \"That's right,\" she said. \"I'm the oldest of five sisters. I already told them about you.\" Jim suddenly became nervous. Elisa had four sisters. All hippopotami like herself. Jim knew that Elisa seemed friendly enough but if her sisters didn't like him, he was toast. Then it occurred to him. What if Elisa's mother didn't like him. He begun to bite his nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Elisa,\" said Jim. \"Your sisters wouldn't happen to be as big as you would they?\" Elisa just gave a scoff. \"Are you serious? In case you hadn't notice, Werehippos choose their bride based on how big they are. All four of my sisters are as big as me. Heck, my mom is even bigger. I have to warn you though, she's a bit on edge. She's been in a bad mood ever since she found out my youngest sister's boyfriend was seeing another woman.\" Jim's face turned white upon hearing that. \"She turned violent did she?\" Elisa lowered her head. \"You're better off not knowing the exact details. Werehippos generally are vicious when they get angry. A cousin of mine lost her temper a while back and destroyed an entire village. Now that was a scary sight. As for me, I'm the mellow one in my family. I'd rather just paint all day then get into a fight. I'm working on a new painting I'd like to show you at home. Something tells me that it would be better if I showed you my artwork in person than online for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim gave a smile. \"I'd like that, Elisa.\" Elisa then gave a snort before speaking again. \"So, Jim. Tell me about yourself. You're from New Zealand aren't you.\" Jim gave a laugh. \"New Zealand born and raised.\" Jim held up his skateboard and showed a sticker of a kiwi bird on it. \"You skate?\" asked Elisa. \"That's amazing. My species can't skate or surf. We're much too heavy.\" \"Well,\" said Jim. \"I'll have you know that I won three skating competitions in a row back in Wellington.\" Elisa gave a laugh. \"And what do you do for a living?\" Jim gave a groan. \"I'm between jobs at the moment. I used to work as a courier at a shipping yard but the company I worked for recently went broke.\" \"Ouch,\" said Elisa. \"I'm sorry to make you come all this way. I would've paid for your trip if I knew.\" Jim let out a sigh. \"Hey, life is full of surprises. Some good. Some bad. You know, I might actually consider moving to Boston.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa nodded her head. \u201cIn that case,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me be your guide.\u201d At that moment, the train reached its station in Boston and Jim and Elisa were the last to get off. However, Elisa\u2019s large pachyderm posterior got in the way and she grunted and snorted as she tried to squeeze her massive werehippo behind out of the train. \u201c****! This always happens! I keep telling them to make the doors bigger, but no. Nobody listens to the mutant.\u201d As Elisa kept trying to force her way out of the door, Jim was right behind her and got a good view of her massive rear. He even tapped on it and it didn\u2019t look like Elisa even felt it. The young man decided that his new werehippo friend needed help getting out of this situation and started to push Elisa\u2019s wide behind. Of course, this was easier said than done because Elisa\u2019s butt was just that enormous and Jim felt his back burning right as Elisa finally squeezed her butt out of the train. In the process, Jim was wedged between her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisa turned her head and spotted Jim in between her cheeks and then gave a giggle before pulling him out. \u201cOops. Sorry about that, Jimmy. That actually happens a lot. A situation like this is actually how my mom met my dad.\u201d Jim\u2019s eyes popped out of his head. \u201cHuh?\u201d Elisa let out a nervous laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019ve got some mixed ancestry. Come on.\u201d Elisa took Jim\u2019s luggage before Jim could take it himself and started to walk away, forcing Jim to run after her. As they walked down the street, people stared at Elisa and some people stopped to take photographs of the big hippo lady. Elisa let out a sigh. \u201cCome on Jim. You\u2019d think people would be used to me after all these years.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You walked to the lake the path you had worn into the grass felt familiar and the grass swayed side to side as a nice summer's breeze passed through the glade. You froze as you saw a girl sitting near the lake, it was strange as you had been visiting the place for a year now and seen no other people. Well you saw couples who knew of the lake so you'd just watch them for a minute or two slightly envious as they usually enjoyed a picnic near the lakeside. As you got closer you noticed she was some sort of foreigner as she was wearing a light almost sky blue kimono and there were small slatted wood sandals on her feet. She slowly stood up and turned to face you and your eyes met for a second her violet eyes which seemed to stare right through you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to walk towards you and that's when you started to really observe her. She moved with the grace and elegance of someone who was brought up to be a wife. Her long knee length blonde hair flowed behind her. You realized she was slim yet tall as she got closer you realized even at 5ft 8 you probably only came about chest height to her. Her whole body however seemed except for height, petite, small hands and feet stuck out of the kimono. However one place she was not very small was her chest, it pushed against the kimono which barely seemed to contain what you guessed had to be some quite large DD breasts yet she walked like they were no hinderance what so ever. The final thing you noticed was her face, she looked quite young probably no older then 20, 21 yet she gave off a very, motherly vibe like she really knew how to take care of people. You didn't realize she was standing right in front of you till she gave off a small cough and you looked up slightly to meet her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" you reply your gaze locked on her violet eyes and she smiles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing out here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug \"I just come out here for walks, it's quite peaceful\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods and turns around, seems to think for a second, then turns back \"would you like to come to my home?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her for a second \"uh sure, if it's not far\" you reply. She smiles again \"not far at all\" she replies, she starts to walk away and you follow her. A minute later the two of you enter a clearing where a very simple looking log cabin sat, now this was something you had definitley never seen before. She walks to the cabin and simply walks inside, you follow her into the cabin the door shutting ominously behind you and making you jump. \"Must just be the wind\" you think to yourself as you examine the cabin. It wasn't much, there was a small wood burning stove, a small sink with a counter, 2 small chests of drawers, a simple red rug, a single bed, and a small japanese style table complete with sitting cushions. The woman pulls out a small brass kettle and sets to work you assume making tea, she motions with a free hand for you to sit on one of the cushions so you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who are you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kyoko, my parents moved here from Japan, they wanted to live a simpler life, what with all the modernization that was going on\" she replies. You nod and she turns to face you \"it's polite to tell someone who you are after they answer you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry, I'm Alex, I grew up in this area but I never saw this cabin and I've been visiting these woods for years\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoko takes the kettle off as it boils and pours tea into 2 cylindrical cups before setting one in front of you and sitting down puts her own down. You pick the glass of tea up and take a sip, it was wonderful, best tea you had ever had, although you weren't a big tea drinker. You felt something brush against your back and you thought it must have been her hair so you looked over and your mouth just dropped. Sticking out of her head were 2 large golden fox ears and out of some hole in the back of her kimono sprang 9 long golden tails each tipped with white. Kyoko turned and stared at you \"what's wrong?\" she asks, you can't answer you just point at her back, she turns and notices the tails and sighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up she says \"it's as you see, I am a fox demon, I didn't lie when I said my parents moved here, but we were trying to escape, from those who wanted us dead\" she says her voice sounding sad for a second. She takes your cup and hers and puts them in the sink then just stands there, \"the door is just over there, you can leave, just like all the others\" she says. Kyoko didn't start crying or anything she just stood there, her ears and tails drooped to the point where her ears were pressed against her head and the tips of her tails were dragging against the wooden floor. You just sat there for a second, I mean it wasn't like the ears and tail had changed Kyoko's personality, it wasn't like now you knew she was a fox demon she was suddenly trying to kill you. You slowly stood up and walked over to her and hugged her from behind, Kyoko turned around and you got a faceful of cleavage for a second before she lifted your chin up with 1 long finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer violet eyes glowed slightly now as she just stared down at you \"your not scared?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I be?\" you reply. A smile played over Kyoko's lips and suprising you she hugged you your head landing back in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" she whispers lowering her head so her cheek rested on your head. You tapped her arm and she looked down and let you go your breath escaping in a loud \"pwahh\" as you took in another breath. Kyoko smiles and walks over to the small table and sits on one of the pillows before patting the other, you walk over and sit down. She looks at you fro a few seconds before simply asking \"why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why what?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you run away? Why are you still here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug \"does knowing your a fox demon suddenly make you evil?\" you ask. Kyoko shakes her head vigorously \"we aren't evil......just mischevious\" she says. You nod \"So there's your answer, your still you even if I know your a fox demon, plus the ears and tails are quite cute\" you say. Kyoko breaks out into an ear-to-ear smile and she grabs your hand and quickly stands up pulling you with her. She then runs outside and despite the fact that it was perfectly sunny you swear you felt...rain. Kyoko just smiles at you and before you could react she kisses you her tails wrapping around you holding you in place. You were too shocked to do anything for a second before you decided to just go with it and kissed Kyoko back. Kyoko broke the kiss and she smiled \"you know when it rains on a sunny day it's called a fox's wedding\" she says. You nod slowly and you were startled as she turned around her tails suddenly filling your view \"could you please, kiss them?\" she asks. You just stared at the tails for a second before cupping 1 in both hands and kissing the tip, you did the same with the 8 other tails and Kyoko turned around and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the rain stopped as Kyoko lowered herself to the ground in a kneeling position and then laid her hands on the grass and lowered her head \"please take care of me\" she says. You had only seen this pose in manga and it left you stunned as Kyoko raised her head \"I might be inexperienced but I'll do my best to take care of you\" she says smiling.</span></div></div>",

That's because she's a type of succubus that needs lust energy to stay on the physical plane. When she has a physical form, the amount to keep it in the physical plane depends on whether she created the body out of lust energy or out of a human body. If it's a human body, she either is working with the human soul of the body, or had devoured the soul. The human body method needs less lust energy for her to stay on the physical plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she spotted you, she first planned on giving you a wet dream and then moving on.

Fortunately, it was almost the summer holidays, barely 29 days 8 hours, 10 minutes to go as reminded you the countdown you set on your phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you headed toward the room, oblivious to the sexy ghostly succubus over your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh\" she said reading your thoughts \"School isn't really your thing right ? Don't worry, I'll make it A LOT more pleasant for you\" And of course she couldn't help but smile and giggle, thinking of all the opportunities offered to her. It was exhilarating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the room and sat down at your usual place, while all the other students were doing the same, as any other day, as any other month, as any other year.

Alice let out an admiring whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa boy ! I thought your dreams were exaggerating her shape, but far from that !! She's gorgeous ! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, she really was. Ms Chang had a very cute asian face, big and round breasts, as large as her head and Alice knew (because she is a succubus) that they were all natural.

I could make this teacher horny in the front of everybody, that would be really fun\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that a cute girl sitting next to you occasionally glanced at you, she said \"Or I could make this girl who has a crush on my boy, really horny, that would also be fun\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then flew to the top of the room and said \"Or I could make everybody here, or at least al the girls of the room, extremely horny and see where he goes\".

For three reasons. One, I don't think you deserve to become a part of me. Two, even if I turned you into a part of me, it wouldn't be enough punishment. And 3, you being my slave might or might not be temporary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. I need to feed of sexual energy or to absorb a body to gain physical form. Once I do, I plan to officially introduce myself to Leon. After that, I'll let him decide if you are kept as a slave or if you'll receive a different kind of punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was letting Ms. Chang very stressed, worried and scared. Not only she was going to be a Succubus's slave, but the boy she always looked down on would ultimately decide her fate!

It was always a sign of contention with her that she didn't have the horns her fellow demons did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to DOOOOO!\" she wined, sounding rather pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idle flick of a finger and colored swirls formed before her, gelling into a plate of steak and fries. Then her eyes widened and she stared at her own fingers as if bitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can't do that! I mean... oh, I'll run out of juice!\" Sobbing she sat down on the grass and sulkily started eating the rare steak. \"*Munch* How am I going to get more juice? Hmm, I'm going to have to find someone to fuck to get some energy.\"</span></div></div>",

She had no idea where she was, other than the Earth Realm, and no idea where any nearby 'Oomans' were to get energy from. Sliding the plate away she started to wave her hand at it to banish it, and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta stop doing that! Gonna run out of juice!\" she muttered and stood up, glancing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrees were not her thing... well, this whole REALM wasn't her thing! She liked the steamy heights of fashioned granite that adorned the upper levels of the 2nd circle. Very stylish workmanship on that stonework. Mostly fashioned by slaves of course. She always thought they looked so pitiful. OK, so maybe that had something to do with why she was here... Maybe she really shouldn't have given that guy a pity fuck... given that he'd stolen his keys from her belt during it... and escaped the entire area... again. She really had forgotten that that was the same guy as before... though she had thought that cock had seemed awfully familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments she smiled happily remembering the fun times... then grew somber. Yeah, daddy banished her. Never again to see the start veins of Seltium, the pinnacles of Rhem. Oh, and never fuck Terry again! That was TERRIBLE! Instead she was stuck with *shiver* 'TREES'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced around and wondered how far the trees went. This was a small clearing, with a grassy hillock, but around her trees blocked the view everywhere. Must be a hole in a Forest or Jungle or Paisly or something. Wasn't a big group of trees called a Paisly? She was sure it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe. Maybe if she ran real fast she could be through the trees before she really noticed them? Or noticed them any more than she had anyway. Must be more open space SOMEWHERE on Earth. At least something with less trees! Anything but trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath she slitted her eyes, winced in expectation, and ran full pelt at the trees. And bounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWIE!\" she cried, but she was nothing if not persistent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother dash and this time she missed the tree... or at least the first few trees. After the forth attempt she kept her eyes open, despite the horrid treeview as she ran, but she still tried to avoid looking at the trees as she ran. That was how come she missed Arnold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*WHUMF!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sickening thump she collided with a lanky boy, her long blonde hair and his long black hair flew everywhere, as did the sandwich he was holding. The two fell in a heap, Arnold on top of Moi, his head wedging firmly between her impressive chest face first.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She holds one hand up and tenses, and two inch long claws extend from her fingers. With a few deft slashes his clothes are literally shredded, but Arnold remains untouched. Retracting her claws she brushes the scraps of cloth off him and smiles. She tickles and plays between his legs for a few minutes until he hardens down there, getting quite satisfyingly large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that'll do... but I haven't asked him....? Hmmm.\" she ponders the moral implications of raping an unconscious guy, something no other demon would even consider, but eventually just shrugs. \"Meh, I'll just appologise later if he's pissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swiftly and expertly slips from her skimpy dress, hanging it on a *shudder* tree with her tail, then crouches over the boy. Arnold still breathes deeply in his 'sleep' as she settles down, fingers guiding him up between her legs. With an inhumanly wide grin she sits down, feeling him fill her. Her fingers wiggle beneath his buttocks and lift slightly, getting a good grip. Then, she's off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoi rides Arnold like a bucking bronco, her hands jamming him up as she rams herself down on him, pumping like mad. His hips are thrown around as she fucks the hell out of him, but she's hardly being subtle and his head tosses about a bit as his shoulders shift from all the commotion. Blearily his eyes flicker open to a look of total shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? I... Oh my GOD!\" he gasps as he and Moi cum simultaneously. The frantic movements become irratic as they spasm, juddering hard against each other, Moi's wings wide outstretched and flapping faintly, spasmodically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two finally recover Moi finds herself propped up by his shaking hands fastened onto her huge breasts and grins again. Arnold's reaction is a bit different when he recovers.</span></div></div>",

A twitch forms in his left eye. \"OK, this is... Ooooooh!\" A smile slowly flows across his face as he understands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell of course. I mean, no girl would let him do this in real life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey.\" came a high pitched voice and Arnold looked up, to see a smiling face looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smiling face framed by bat-wings behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked, frowned, then pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I just fantasizing about a sexy demon or something? Does my psychologist need to know about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExperimentally he flexed his fingers, feeling the soft breast flesh slide under them, the warmth soaking through that silky red fabric into his palms enticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He he. Is this a greeting here?\" Came that high pitched voice again. \"Nice greeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTipping his head at a slight angle he gazed up at her. Yeah, she was incredibly sexy, and huge hooters, but would he have thought her up? He'd tried lucid dreaming so many times before and never got anywhere. Apparently he'd managed it. Finally. Not really surprising his first experience was a wet lucid dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Hiii?\" He said tentatively. \"So uh...\" He glanced down, seeing her sitting on his lap, her bright red dress draped over... his.... naked body. \"Huh. That kind of dream.\" He muttered, then felt a twinge as he started to get hard again, pushing inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! And I didn't even help?\" Moi said with a giggle. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without another word she was bouncing on him again, even as he finished hardening in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" He gasped, letting go of her tits and falling over backwards as her sex squelched over him, This was better than he'd even imagined! Uh, or he guess he <i>did</i> imagine it? Or dream it at least. However coherent thought left him as he just moaned, shuddering through a second orgasm a few seconds later, though Moi still pumped oblivious to his quiverings beneath her. Didn't take much for her to join him however, and soon she screamed and jerked herself, and with him more awake this time he saw her actually glow. And felt something odd inside himself too, a... rending. As if something was being torn from him slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not unpleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! A twofor. Thanks. Er... wait, strike that. Forget I said that.\" She said, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Arnold managed intelligently. \"So... I'm supposed to forget you like it twice in a row?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No silly. Well I usually want more than that, but with humans, happens less so. Without help anyway.\" She giggled, then got a bit more serious. \"Just... daddy hates it when I apologize or thank people. I don't get it myself.\" Then her smile fades. \"Oh. Yeah. Banished. Ooooh. I don't have to listen to him any more! I CAN SAY WHAT I WANT!\" She grins from ear to ear, then that too fades. \"Oh poo. I miss him already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a sobbing Moi flops on Arnold, her breasts quivering against him as she sobs, her head nuzzled just under his chin. Her red grey wings wrap around him as she sobs and Arnold is flummoxed. His dick slowly hardens once more inside her, but the girl/demon/whatever seems to ignore it, continuing to sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... There there. It's OK.\" He says, managing to get his arms up around her body past her wings to pat her on the back. Well, her naked back. Her dress is cut way low back there it seems, and not just due to her wings. He patted her as she cried onto him, then he grunted as she bucked, his rod slickly oozing out then into her folds. But she kept sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a catch in his throat he hugged her while she started to make love to him once more, but didn't stop sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...Hi... My naAAme is Arnold.\" He managed. Slowly she looked up, eyes puffy from her bawling, but certainly didn't stop her hips' motion and Arnold was finding it difficult to stay calm and looking her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sniff* Moi.\" She said, still not stopping in her pumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PleeeEEASed to meet yoOOOuu Moi.\" He gasped, then grunted and clutched at her as he came, and again she didn't stop. She just smiled, kept pumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee. That's nice. People usually aren't pleased to see me. Well, for a bit. The sex and all. But usually not much more.. Mmmm!\" She moaned, arched her back and came as well, though seemed a bit sedate compared to her earlier ones with no glowing, and Arnold didn't feel that odd sensation this time. She giggled with a silly grin, then sort of shook, as if someone had just walked over her grave or something, though her face was still happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... *pant* can't imagine why. You're cute.\" He said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, thank you. Er.... no I. Um. Yeah. Really! Thank. You. There I SAID IT!\" She said with a grin, which faltered, and then she collapsed bawling on him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Moi?\" But this time she just bawled, and Arnold patted her and said 'there there' a few times... before he realized the crying had faded out a bit and... wait, was that snoring?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough she'd fallen asleep on top of him</span></div></div>",

How on Earth does that thing even stay on like that? Is the front glued on? He chuckles. Of course, it's a dream, anything can happen. He tentatively flicks a finger under the nebulous fabric and into the crack of her rump. He can't resist and slides his hand in to cup her buttock tightly and... buck a little. She murmurs in her sleep happily and bucks back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... just one more.\" He says, and gently slides in and out of the fantastic silky, moist sex down there. One hand on her shoulders, one inside her dress on her ass, he guides and fucks her one last time, and when he comes there is that odd sensation again, though this time it feels... different. And she doesn't glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring down at her incredibly cute back and rump as she snuggles against him he decides to take her home. Though curiously he can't seem to just whisk himself and her back to his apartment. Maybe he just isn't good at this whole lucid dream thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing he carefully shifts her up, then off him and he manages to stand up. Though he is really tired. She's small, easily more than a head shorter than him, and didn't weigh much, but he wasn't exactly a strong man. He managed to pick her body up slung in front of him, but struggled to hold her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't gonna work.\" He muttered, and then heaved her up and over his shoulder into a fireman's carry. \"Meh, it'll do.\" He said, then getting a wing flick in his eye. \"Ack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe adjusted his carry so her wings were folded down, and his arm pinched the bottom against her legs. That stopped that at least, though that tail still waved around a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, with a whistle he headed home, stark naked, carrying a sexy girl in a dress that reminded him more than a little of Jessica Rabbit's outfit.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he walked home he found himself getting more and more self conscious. As he reached the door to his apartment block a frown was on his face. He was pretty sure this wasn't a dream, though looking to his left and seeing that gorgeous looking rump staring up at him while Moi snored on his back seemed like a dream come true to him. However he was still feeling weird as he went up the stairs, plus was getting rather out of breath from the climb, and finally reached his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis locked door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, and glancing around nervously, he reached up, pulled a bit of loose door frame over the top, then pulled out his spare key. Unlocking the door, looking furtively around again, he replaced the key and sealed it's hidey hole back up. Otherwise he'd forget to put it back later, he just knew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind him he sighed in relief and stomped into the bedroom. Heading upstairs with that girl over his shoulder had been rough, but he couldn't just toss her on the bed like a sack of potatoes or something. Grunting he carefully laid her on the bed... and then couldn't resist laying hand on her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl... bat creature, or whatever she was, certainly didn't seem abashed at anything, sex or otherwise so... He couldn't resist and reached around and slipped her dress off her ample chest. Surprisingly it came off with no resistance, showing no sign of how that thing stayed attached. With literally no back to it and no straps he still had no clue how the front stayed up there. Slowly he wriggled it down, sliding it off her legs. From earlier he knew she wasn't wearing underwear, but still the sight of her bare bottom made him sigh longingly. He carefully folded up her dress and stood back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed it washed after all. Right. Yeah, that was his reason. Still he stood there gazing at her perfect body laying there, her long blonde hair spilled over the pillow in a delightful pattern, framing her perfect shoulders. He was using the word perfect a lot in his head wasn't he? Well, he'd never been with a girl before. Never even had a girlfriend before! Now... wow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head he managed to tear his eyes from her back and headed over to his closet and got dressed, as well as picking up a few more of his dirty clothes, then got some change from the jar by the window. Mentally he reminded himself to go get new credit cards sorted out tomorrow. He really should have checked to see if he could find his wallet out there somewhere. His mind had been elsewhere then that was certain. At least he didn't have to worry about a driver's license. He didn't even own a car! Certainly couldn't afford one and didn't have a good enough credit rating for a decent loan, even if he wanted to lumber himself with those kind of payments... which he also couldn't afford.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went for the door to the hall he stopped, staring through his open bedroom door once more at Moi's perf... beautiful rump. As he gazed she wiggled in her sleep, a delightful motion that just drew a contented sigh out of him. And a few second's more gazing before he finally shook his head and went out to the laundromat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over half an hour later he returned with clean clothes, including Moi's dress, and came back in locking the door behind him. He actually closed his eyes as he headed to his bedroom, almost expecting her to be gone. When he opened them he gulped. She was still asleep but had rolled over. He got a wonderful view of her breasts with one knee pulled up against her belly and.... she was sucking her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then his heart just ached, a deep longing calling out to him. Dropping the laundry on the table he just slowly walked into his bedroom, stripping as he went, his clothes cast to the floor unheeded. Naked once more he carefully crawled onto the bed over her and wriggled down behind her, spooning her. He pulled her tight, feeling more than hearing her practically purr as she felt him in her sleep. His cock nuzzled between her buttocks and he couldn't resist, pulling her close and edging it between her legs one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned as it slid into her still warm, wet, inviting sex, gave a giggle, then snuggled back into him affectionately, still apparently fast asleep. Reaching around and under her he cupped her breasts and just began to hump slowly, gently, not wanting to wake her, as stupid as that sounded. Going like that it was a long, slow passion, the clock the only sound as he gently slid in and out of her, closing his eyes in rapt bliss, hugging her to him tightly. It took nearly ten minutes before he came, a roiling shudder as he jerked and pulled her tight, feeling her sex squeeze him delightfully. There was a kind of squeaking sigh from her as she wriggled and he wondered what she was dreaming about. Hopefully him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently he nuzzled her, his six foot lanky frame wrapped around her five foot one, his chin resting on the back of her head, his chest pressing to her folded wings, his knees up between her long legs, and his hands still cupping her chest gently as he drifted to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a happy, very sound sleep.</span></div></div>",

Wanted to be with them, feel them hold her, keep her, cuddle and... well, fuck her brains out... then find they'd done it while she was asleep in their arms. The first time it had been an accident, and then found the idiot had crowed about it, lorded it over her when he realized the power he had. Control. Command. A succubus as his own personal slave. Needless to say daddy had him flayed alive as soon as he heard about it, then gave her a serious talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second time had been planned, she was sure. She'd been used, as much as she used him first. Then she'd been his ticket out of the 2nd circle, and he'd bound her to say nothing, tell no-one. Until daddy caught up with him too. She felt it when the control snapped... and cried. Despite all he'd done he'd been nice to her. He'd actually apologized for what he was doing, saying it was 'needed' but he meant her no harm. Well, harm she'd got, an ache inside her for weeks for the loss, and another shouting match with daddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she twisted her head around and up, seeing the guy she met yesterday there behind her, a blissful smile on his face. He didn't know, had no clue what he'd done. But... when daddy found out he'd... she blinked, tears still welling up at the thought. She'd been cast out. Daddy was no longer looking out for her. No longer running down her failures. This ooman... he'd own her. Forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently, eased hands off her breasts, started to pull away, then got a soft smile on her face feeling him getting morning wood inside her.

Wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked, knowing full well what it was like to be loved only half asleep, or to waken to just know you'd been fucked, feeling the glow and a vague memory of a glorious dream. But with her, the other way around, it was dangerous. She blinked. Actually, right now it was too late. The danger was gone. She was bound. She could hardly be bound a second time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was awake, she just had to have one more didn't she.... but it was sooo gooooood!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. You Ok?\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she felt abruptly chipper, a wave of health seeming to flow through her. Oh, it was starting, and he didn't even know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm fine.\" She was so flummoxed. \"Hi... Moron.. I mean.. I Moi. Moi Rong. Pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle came from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't insult yourself. That's just wrong, at least that's what mom always said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave flowed over her again. She just couldn't insult herself any more. She blinked. Even by accident! A slow smile spread across her face. There were some advantages to this maybe. Though... he still didn't know. She turned and leaned up, looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Not a problem.\" She said, 'any more' she silently added. \"What's your name tall dark and erect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dick twitched inside her and almost without thinking she reached down with her power and fed a bit in, giving him some time, keeping it hard. She just wanted to feel it some more. Maybe another fuck or thirty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arnold. Arnold Mayweather. Heh. Call me Arny.\" He said, doing a silly accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wave again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Arny.\" She couldn't use any other name for him now. \"I'm glad you liked the wakeup call. I sure did.\" Boy did she! Mmm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely. I.... I never knew this could be so... wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, did he? No.... Slowly her eyes grew wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygod. You... You're a virgin!\" She squealed, and saw a look of pain on his face. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah. A twenty five year old virgin. Nothing wrong at all is there?\" He fidgeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't know. Honestly I never met a virgin till now. Relly always said they tasted divine.\" She said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArny blinked, an odd half smile coming to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo kay. Sounds... interesting girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she is. Though you probably wouldn't like her. She'd likely just fuck you a few times then flay you alive. If you're lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked at her. Was it something she said?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I hate to ask this, given how nice you've been to me. But.... what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight. Oomans never did like Succubi did they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't you fret over that! I'm here, open. Come on, don't you want to fuck me a few more times? Anything specific you want to try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a frown he gazed at her, and  Moi squirmed under that gaze uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. Tell me what you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDang! That wave again. She sighed. Too good to last she guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a succubus. Yeah, go on. Scream, yell, cry.\" She said, her face falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... as in... 'suck my soul out' kind of succubus?\" He said, though didn't seem terribly scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after I eat you yeah. Did you want that? It'd be fun.\" She said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No thanks. Don't eat me.\" He said, an odd scowl bearing down on her as that wave of power ran over her. Right, of course, and now she couldn't eat him. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame. OK.\" She said simply, but frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so you think I'd taste that good huh?\" He said, probably just saying a joke she thought. He looked a little frazzled maybe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well duh. Oomans are delish! Mmm. Me I prefer girls, but both are good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared, his cock still plugging her oh so delightfully, but the look he gave was uncomfortable still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really want to eat... people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she DEFINITELY did. *Sigh*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Why not? If you could taste one you'd agree with me. It's just so... Trust me Arny, you'd love it.\" She giggled. \"And I'm pretty sure you'd prefer girls wouldn't you. I can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called me Arny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused Moi tried to remember if he'd said anything against that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, was I not supposed to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never managed to get ANY one to call me Arny.\" He said, a smile spreading across his face. Then it fell slightly. \"Uh. But please don't eat me. No matter how good you think I'd taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. Yeah, guys got hung up on that. Come on, wanting to go out with bang? What was wrong with that? Getting slurped up, pleasured as you're eaten. Sounded like the perfect way to go to her, and those she'd eaten always ended up having a good time. She made sure of that! Not like some stupid sisters! She pouted, remembering Relly's teasing. 'Their gonna be soul food. Why do they need to enjoy anything?' She'd said. Stupid horny bitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. Got it. Don't eat you. I won't no worries. Besides, I love fucking you too much to let you go now.\" She said with a grin. And what was sad was it was true. It wasn't as if she could just go down to the slave pits and grab someone now.</span></div></div>",

He didn't exactly seem distraught over it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, like you already have? If I haven't eaten you by now then what are you worried about?\" She said with a grin. \"Besides, I promised I wouldn't eat you and I meant it. Plenty of fucking of course. Goes without saying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goes without saying... whilst you are talking about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah. That.\" she said. She suspected he was laughing at her, but curiously this didn't seem as callous as when her sisters did it. He seemed friendly still. \"So come on. Look, just a little? Maybe twenty or so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty? You want me to make love to you twenty times?\" He melodramatically stared down where he entered her, quizzically. Yeah, usual wave of energy and now she wanted him to fuck her even more! He motioned to his groin and shook his head. \"I hate to disappoint but I seriously doubt I'll get that far. I... well, as I said earlier you're my first girlfriend. And... well... lets just say I don't think I have the stamina for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty. Fifty. Few hundred. Take your pick. And yeah, you will. I can ensure you'll last as long as I want... or as long as you want. Whichever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't decide if this is a wet dream come true or possibly some kind of nightmare unfolding.\" Moi blinked, looking shocked for a moment. \"Oh, not... I didn't mean that! I mean... you know... if I can't perform as well as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I might be able to help there.\" She says, trying not to show how much that hurt. Her, a nightmare? Yeah, she really hoped he hadn't meant that and was covering it up. \"Magic and skill are tricky though. I can't exactly just 'give' you skill in bed. I can help a little, and dicks and stuff I can make better, but you? That'll take training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned in a little with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to teach me how to fuck?\" She gave a little shiver as the wave went over her. Uh... now she definitely was going to. \"Oh you'll love that won't you?\" Another shiver... it would be fun to teach it. This was... how much of this would she have agreed to any way and how much was the bond making her think she would have? She was getting a bit fuzzy on that now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think what you mean is 'I'll love <i>you</i>' and yes, I will. Repeatedly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he quirked his eyebrow and glanced down to where his still hard cock filled her most pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And.... when you take energy from me it isn't going to hurt me, or make me less or something?\" She sighed. This was getting depressing. She'd probably not be able to take much energy from him at all now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know my magic is fueled by sex energy, right? You want me to run dry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess we can figure something out.\" Then she squeezed him down there and he closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that feels good. Just do that for a few minutes hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTingle.... sigh, no sex right this second huh? Still, this embrace and squeezing was nice. Oh, he just made her think that didn't he? She was beginning to lose track of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently they rocked their bodies together while she used her finely honed vaginal muscles to clench and milk him slowly. She had to admit this kind of slow embrace was something new to her. She usually just went gung ho for a few hours, or as long as her partner could stay conscious. And sometimes beyond that. But she was a little low on juice right now. If she was limited in what she drained then maybe some slow poking might make it last a bit. He certainly seemed to love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes (coincidentally) her interest in the 'slow and steady' waned a little and she began to speed up, starting to stroke her hips against him. That he DEFINITELY didn't seem to mind, especially as she dripped power into him to keep him rock hard throughout. It didn't take much given his already lust filled emotions. Yeah, she might be amping things a little there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god that feels fantastic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoooh yeah, really did. She barely felt the wave of energy flowing over her any more, or cared. She was beginning to really like Arny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Mmmmm! Ooooh fuck me Arny! FUCK ME!\" She moaned, resting her head on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your wish is my command mistress.\" He said in a weird accent, though panting a little from his exertion so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he rolled over on top of her, making her squeal a little with a grin, and straddle her body. He leaned in to kiss her, then began to thrust again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoi's eyes rolled up in her head, just letting herself go. Ah, Relly would think she was a sellout she knew. Her sis always said, 'use it to rule, not let it rule you' but she couldn't give a fuck! Well, maybe a LOT of fucks. That's be acceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe revelled in the sensations, even attempting to inflate him just a tad, just to stretch her a little bit more. It was SOOOOO worth it, feeling her sex so thoroughly stuffed as he pounded into her. Not that was even close to her limit, but to just feel it stretched like that was always fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shudder she felt him come for the first time, and grabbed his rump, pushing him through it. Ah yeah! Keep it coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god I love you Moi!\" He gasped, then plunging his head into her cleavage as he continued.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moi is not (in the traditional sense) naive. However her relationships (her many MANY relationships) all boiled down to nothing more than sex, despite her not being as vicious or manipulative as the other Succubi. Not only that her lovers all knew exactly what she was, and generally had had experience (much to their dismay mostly) of other, more 'normal,' succubi. Thus no-one in her entire life has ever said those words to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaive? No. However her emotions are a little... open, compared to other Succubi, and she does have a rather straightforward look on life that doesn't really consider lies or untruths much. This, needless to say, has also had a deleterious effect on her in the past and was one of the many things that got her dad to finally decide he couldn't put up with her any more and excommunicated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus a person being with her, being generally nicer to her than she was used to, caring, and then professing his love for her during sex is... well, unprecedented for her and hit her way harder than it had any right to. The first Arnold realized about it was when he felt tears running down his chest as she hugged him tightly sobbing into his chest, her sobs getting louder and more emphatic as she squeezed him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she didn't stop fucking him. That would have been silly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold was a little confused, but given the continuous sex he had little time to really react and just hugged her back with a silly smile (and a lot of moaning). Moi sobbed and cried, her hugs getting a bit tighter than Arnold would have liked, but she kept him erect and pounded him hard... for about two more hours. Sobbing the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally ground to a halt (literally), bringing her face up, eyes puffy and red, nose sniffling, tears and snot still dripping down her face, and despite this Arnold couldn't help but smile... and pant. He was... well tired was understating it. Nonetheless he leaned in and kissed her, again taking her by surprise. Once she got over her shock she enthusiastically joined in, almost making Arnold choke as her tongue extended, writhing right down his throat! But, she did let go, her tongue slipping free after a moment or two, her still choked up face looking down longingly at him. He smiled back, gulping a little reflexively at the recent intrusion into his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moi... that was incredible.\" She shivered, grinning from ear to ear as the memories of that whole experience just got more rose tinted for her. \"I know this is... abrupt, but I really do love you. I... hope. I mean... I want... that....\" He paused, taking a breath. \"You do love me too, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe command roiled over her, her emotions already bubbling nicely to affection far more than she'd ever had in anyone before... and now... exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... yes. Oh god yes! Oh Arny!\" She said and leaned in for another deep kiss, sobbing once more even as her tongue slipped down his throat. This time he was less surprised and managed to take a deep breath first and leaned back into her, kissing her back too, his hands slipping down to massage her bum, his cock still twitching inside her. For once she didn't have sex, just hugging and kissing him till a minute later he forced back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack. Oh sorry. I... just couldn't breath.\" He took a few deep breaths. \"There, all better.\" And locked lips with her again, getting a giggle from Moi before they tonsil tussled once more..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoi was in bliss. This was better than she'd ever imagined! How could she be so lucky?</span></div></div>",

Do you mind if I don't carry you all the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh... I .... guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled and slid her down onto her feet, and she landed expertly at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.

Moi Rong, definitely!\" She said, suddenly blushing and staring at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few seconds Arnold stared some more. It definitely wasn't hard she was.... what was the phrase? Easy on the eyes. Less 'easy' and more 'positively fantastic.' OK, maybe that was overthinking things. She looked up and he blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" he said without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, staring. Running into you.\" She giggled, seemingly unaffected by his gaze or their collision. \"Uh. Kinda might have had sex with you after you fell asleep back there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this her face froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh not again!\" She gasped and he head fell down into her hands. At least she wasn't bawling this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you don't like that then. Uh. Sorry?\" He said, though given he was fantasizing this it was odd she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I love that. Too much. I...\" And she suddenly clammed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. then why is that an issue?\" He chuckled. \"What? If I have sex with you when you're sleep I have some sort of power over you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head shot up and glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know!\" She squeaked, a look of alarm on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I didn't. I was just guessing.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... Poo. I did it again! Waaah!\" Her face fell into a thorough sulk. \"Third time. Daddy is so.. Oh.\" Suddenly she was bawling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold didn't think just leaned in and hugged her once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there, it's OK. Heey, stop crying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.... I'm *sniff* OK.\" She said, pulling away from him, looking a little anxious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright.\" Arnold said, smiling. \"I won't bite. You can trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh unh.\" She said shaking her head. \"You're human. I can't trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was weird to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Yes you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just trust me, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\" She said, blinking. \"Damn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what? He'd said 'you can trust me' and that didn't affect her, but 'just trust me' did? He... could control her? Verbally? A little shiver ran down his spine.</span></div></div>",

Not succubi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Arnold's eyes got real big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a succubus!\" He said, suddenly pointing at her. \"What, you were gonna suck out my soul or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. You're too nice for that. I'd at least ask.\" When he just gaped back at her she tipped her head quizzically at him. \"What? All I want is a bit of sexual energy. I'm tired! OK, yeah. I got a fair bit earlier, but... I'm hungreeeee!\" she said with a whiney tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few moments he just panicked, then blinked as he realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Moi Rong. You never will suck out my soul. You don't want to, you won't think about it and... well you just won't, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, OK.\" She said sheepishly. \"Can i have a few fucks though? I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squinted at her accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will that do to me? Be honest with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouted at that, and Arnold realized that probably meant she'd ALWAYS be honest with him. He had to struggle not to grin at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it'll tire you out more. I'm draining some of your energy. But it doesn't hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, is this like sucking the life out of me or something? Meaning I'll live a shorter life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo! Nothing like that! Well, I've never heard of anything like that. I mean, some girls just use magic to keep guys hard all the time, fucking them day and night for years. They don't grow old and die or anything. So... no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tired?\" She nodded with an expectant grin. \"OK, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a little 'Yeee!' that sounded way too cute for a succubus, and then jumped on him, using her tail to swish her dress out of the way so she landed unerringly on his shaft with a sound like foot plunging into mud. Then she went nuts on him again, bouncing fiercely and sending him through the roof!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh god!\" Arnold groaned, clutching at her buns as she bounced till he came in a shuddering gasp barely a minute later. He felt a tingle down there and his hardness didn't go away, her continuing to pound him! \"OoooOOoooOOOHH GEEEARRDD!\" He grunted and almost immediately came a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heee! He likes me!\" Moi giggled, still pounding him, shortly before she screamed her own pleasure and began to glow, that rending, sucking sensation from inside his hips somewhere feeling both pleasant and unnerving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say the next few minutes were... intense. To say the least!</span></div></div>",

We have company!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't stop bouncing, but she did raise her head from his chest and twisted to look past him at the rather serious looking woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey! Wanna join in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArnold groaned and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No miss. Put the man down now.

You have the ri...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you aren't!\" Moi interrupted with a scowl. \"Nobody interrupts my happy time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Arnold there was an odd tearing sound, a scream, and suddenly something slammed into his left shoulder, over it and. Arnold, between gasps, saw the cop, now stark naked, streak by and INTO MOI'S WIDE STRETCHED MOUTH! He gaped as she happily gulped the whole woman down, Mmmming intensely as she swallowed the woman's breasts, then throwing her head back as the legs slid in, feet kicking the whole way. He came just as those toes slid between Moi's lips and vanished from sight, along with the rest of her. Moi looked exactly the same, not a bulge in sight from having eaten a whole human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling and jerking he spasmed as Moi groaned, and she followed suit a moment later. She started going once more, but as soon as he got his breath back he put a stop to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough! Stop Moi!\" And she did, her bouncing stopped abruptly, though her breasts bouncing took a little longer to settle. She did start to pout though. \"OK, what the everloving fuck was that?\" He gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hungry, she was annoying. Hey, you said I couldn't eat you, not others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COUGH HER UP RIGHT THE HELL NOW!\" He yelled and winced as she sort of withered under his screaming. \"... please.\" He added stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed, hopped off his still rock hard shaft, and landed daintily on the ground. With a sigh she leaned over and began to hurk. Soon feet emerged from her maw, then legs and Arnold found the entire sight incredibly erotic as the woman slid from those wide, red lips, apparently unconscious, to lay in a spit covered mass on the floor. Seemingly she was unharmed. Arnold did however notice a lewd gaze from Moi. What, did she notice how he was fascinated when she coughed the woman up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she gonna be OK?\" He asked Moi as the woman squirmed in her sleep slightly.</span></div></div>",

Any complaints?\" Ms. Anand asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! Lizzie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as he remains a man, I have no problems,\" Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zombie girl needs sexy dick,\" Agatha said, licking her lips as she stared a certain part of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have complaints! I-\" You said before Ms. Anand silenced you up with her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop '<i>butting</i>' into our conversation, loverboy. Soon, you'll have all the sex a horny teenage boy could desire!\" Ms. Anand said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Zombie girls were done drawing the runic circle, it began to glow more and more. Then there was a bright flash. Men and women everywhere on Earth became sexy bimbo-ish female supernatural beings of themselves. Even artwork, photos, and statues of men changed to women, but only ones near you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll knew about their new master, Ms. Mikoto. All also now had a desire to use their sexy supernatural assets on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Alice's worry, your clothes did change to women's clothes. Your underwear became boyshorts panties, your shirt became a women's blouse, your pants became a skirt, your socks became stockings, and your sneakers became mary janes. Somehow, the whole experience was making you horny, making you wonder if absorbing masculinity from inanimate objects would make you horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the glow from the runic circle faded, you were...</span></div></div>",

Help!\" You cried out when she looked surprised at seeing you, Alice, Lizzie, and Agetha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Alice, Lizzie, and Agetha, just what do you think you are doing?\" Ms. Makoto asked as she stomped into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls, even with their morrigan-like appearance, looked scared and backed away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you heard next chilled you to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame me!

Her sexy figure gained even more of an hourglass shape, though a bit topheavy. Her breasts were now bigger than her head. Her derriere now could easily entrance anyone who looked at it too long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her figure changed, her clothes began to stretch. Before they could break, Her sweat-clothes quickly changed into a leather corset and thong. She also was now wearing a garderbelt and stockings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wings were bigger than her student and had seemed to have various runic symbols all over them. Her tail was also bigger, and the spade at the end had a visible line that almost seemed like it could open up to form a second mouth. The horns on her head kind of seemed like a cow's horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" You mutter. A mix of lust and fear went through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does this mean we can still go ahead with the 'take over the city' plan?\" Agetha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Makoto glared at her succubus daughter before saying, \"We've been doing it for a long time behind the scenes but it has to done slowly. Otherwise, the humans can and will kill us all.

Any way me and my daughters would be really <i>pleased</i> if you would join us with your special ability it would help us greatly.\" She wrapped both her hands behind your head and then forced it into her breast.

With women it will be impossible for them to get you off  but for me and my girls we can do that and much much more. \" she says you try to process this but your brain keeps coming up blank like a computer trying to divide by zero or something. \"So do you want to join us or not.\"</span></div></div>",

She opened your shirt, exposing your trained chest. When Ms Makoto was teaching you in PE she made you run extra laps, and always watched over you. Like a sort of motherly figure, in a way acting like one to you. And now here she was, Ms Makoto was wanting to be a sexy girlfriend and mature Mother towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hormones were in overdrive, you shivered in her touch. Once she moved her fingers away from your toned abs you took a deep breath and said \"I accept Ms Makoto, I-I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour former teacher smiled in a seductive fashion, standing up before you. She cupped your face in her hands, silently kissing your lips. But oddly enough not letting your tongue in, as if she was wanting to keep that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breaking the kiss Ms Makoto muttered to you \"I must place you into a sleep my child, but fear not. The visions you will bear witness to are but a mere glimpse of what awaits you, for you have walked towards the destiny you so richly deserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she took a deep breath and then moved her left hand to her lips, blowing a kiss to you. In which purple fog appeared out of her mouth, covering your vision. You instantly took a large breath of the stuff. And your mind was flooded with visions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst there was you and Ms Makoto, only she was wearing a revealing wedding dress that did little to cover her breasts. Then the next was you sitting in a throne with several girls all bowing to you, with Ms Makoto sitting on your legs. She was naked, exposing her mature and strong body. You sucked from her tits, hearing her moan out in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that it was just you and her in a classroom, making out on one of the desks. You then sat down in a chair while Ms Makoto wrapped her tits around your cock, taking the tip into her mouth. You began drooling as her lips and breasts worked wonders on your manhood, till at last warm and salty fluids entered her mouth. Ms Makoto sucked on it with greed, taking the chance to enjoy your \"Gift.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision faded to black, and when you awoke you now found yourself in....</span></div></div>",

It was either a closed off room with no windows, or night had fallen. There were some incense clouds near your vision, and the scent of candles. You lifted your head to see where you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room had one window in it, the blinds shut somewhat. There were no sounds outside, you were lying in the middle of a 4 sided wrestling ring. It looked homemade, a bit shabby and used. And then you suddenly realised that you were stark naked! Although you didn't feel a chill, the temperature of the room must have been adjusted for this. You could see that the room had a Japanese feel to it, with kanji symbols on the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear from your right light footsteps, padded by a tatami mat nearby. You stand up to face the source of it, and Ms Makoto slinked into the ring. With grace, and eyeing you with lust and a predatory sense about her. As she stood up you were able to take full sight of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was toned, but not to the extent of bodybuilders. Her sleek hair moved just past her shoulders. Ms Makoto's breasts were large and magnificent, swaying gently with her movements. Pass that was her shaved womanhood, her legs were muscular. It seemed that she knew you were checking her out, as the succubus turned around somewhat. To reveal a perfect and meaty ass. Ms Makoto's entire body was also glistening with droplets of water, it seemed that she had been showering before coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings sweetheart. How was my little dear's nap?\" she purred out as she walked around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush slightly, before smirking and saying \"Oh it was hot uh....Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Makoto chuckled slightly at you referring to her as your Mother, she had always been a tad maternal after all towards you. Although if it was out of true feelings or just because you had a special gift was unknown, but you hoped it was the first one. Ms Makoto smacked your bare backside in playfulness, before moving past you and towards one of the corners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw you think of me as your Mother, how sweet. Well then <b>Son.</b> I was thinking that before you spend time with the girls, I wanted to have some quality time with you. And what better way to bond than with some wrestling hm? You are a strapping young lad, and I've been wanting to do this for quite some time.\" she said, making sure each step had a bounce and sway in her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched before seeing that she had moved to one corner of the ring, and you felt compelled to do so also. You walked to the one opposite her, taking the chance to do some light stretching. You were already a bit erect, but you were only paying attention to Ms Makoto's curvy and voluptuous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is there any rules to this?\" you asked. It felt right, lay down some ground stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Makoto put a finger to her chin before saying \"Well how about this. The winner is by either one pinfall, submission or orgasm. Is that fine with you sweetheart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what the succubus had in mind, but figured you might as well play hard to get. That might be a turn on for her after all, feeling this you said \"Well then, I hope you won't be upset when the son beats the Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, and cupped her large breasts jiggling them before your eyes. You knew how bountiful they were, and so did Ms Makoto. She then blew you kisses and muttered \"Oh that won't be easy, you'll be a good boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing this Ms Makoto then made a fake bell noise, moving her hand as if she was ringing one. You took that as a sign to get ready. The mature woman before you was strong indeed, you didn't care what happened. You knew there was going to be some sexy times ahead. Ms Makoto put her arms forward, offering you a test of strength lockup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accept, she had trained you in PE after all. Made you run laps after everyone else was done, now perhaps that could work against her. But then you remembered that she was a supernatural being, and perhaps had untold strength. Your eyes were focusing on the ample breasts that Ms Makoto had in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was already significant, and then you realised that this might not have been such a good idea after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there my dear, you need to be a bit brave for mommy.\" Ms Makoto purred out in a coddling tone. You smirked slightly, but the fact remained that she was now in control. And Ms Makoto put that to good use, she then quickly altered the hold. She turned around and slammed her perfect rear end into your body, making you grunt out loud. Following this you had the wind taken out of you somewhat, and was distracted for the time being as the soft and supple flesh of the Japanese succubus brushed near your shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing this Ms Makoto muttered \"Now my child.....\" using her Amazonian strength she then lifted you onto her right shoulder. And with her securing you Ms Makoto then proceeded to march around the ring, like a Mother holding an infant. You inwardly were thankful that none of the other succubuses that Ms Makoto had with her saw this, you'd be red faced for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at least from up there you got a decent enough view to Ms Makoto's bouncing and swaying breasts, you had no idea what she might be applying next. But for now it was clear that she was the one in control, perhaps to send you a message. Either way you didn't plan to make it easy for Ms Makoto, it wouldn't be any fun like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what would Ms Makoto do?

All the while the Japanese succubus hummed a little song in the back of her throat, she stopped though when she felt your erect dick was felt behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Makoto stopped in place and let out a little giggle, it was a bit on the dark side though. Whatever she had planned next might not be good for you, granted she was playfully controlling you. But given what she had done to get you how you were, if Makoto wanted to dominate you she'd be able to do so. And the thought created just a little bit of dread within you, although perhaps ironically it was making you feel just a bit hornier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what......time to put you in the perfect place~~~\" she muttered, with that Ms Makoto would strut her way to a corner of the ring. Her bouncing breasts swaying even more in response to this sexy waltzing, as she nears the turnbuckles the succubus would then lean you forward. With one hand on your upper back, the other grabbing your stiff manhood. She slammed you upside down into the corner, with your legs draped up over the top ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only grunt out in pain, as Ms Makoto promptly folded your legs over. Trapping them in the top and middle rope, this resulted in pressure being shot up into your thighs. In an effort to try and reduce you try to move up, only to have Ms Makoto move forward. Your face moves straight into the moistening womanhood of your new \"Mother.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling Ms Makoto promptly trapped your head with her lethal legs, ensuring you were getting a great faceful of her neatly shaved fanny. Then you promptly feel her moist mouth engulf your erect manhood, giving you some delicious head. You could feel her tongue swirl around the tip of your dick, she must have been a succubus for a very long time. To be doing this so proficiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain from your legs being tied up in the ropes was neatly offset by how Ms Makoto pleased you at the same time.

Trapped, with your manhood close by for her to feast on. You could feel her lush lips take your erection all the way to the base of it, before moving back and taking her time in trailing her tongue and swirling it at the tip of your penis. All the while erotic moans of pleasure escaped her throat, Ms Mikoto was quite clearly a pro at giving head. It was as if she knew just the right way to please your shaft, her fingers trailed down your bare skin. Her nails tracing along it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were squirming, doing whatever you could to try and escape your situation. But it wasn't possible, not with your legs being wrapped in that manner in the corner. Plus Ms Mikoto was bearing down on you, even if you could get your legs free odds were that she'd keep you trapped in there somehow. The realisation of this led you to decided that giving up was the best course of option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you tapped on her ass, the side of the right cheek a few times. To signal that you were submitting, this made Ms Mikoto pause briefly. Perhaps she might accept this, and sure enough you feel her mouth leave your manhood. Only for her to then mutter \"Sorry sweetie, but your on the ropes. I can't accept your submission, and I'm causing you no pain. So there's no rope break either, now......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Mikoto resumed pleasuring you as the second realisation hit you, she was exploiting a loophole to get her way. Only she was no longer sucking you off, instead you felt softness eclipse your penis. The opening at the end of it could only mean that she was now giving you a titfuck, putting those ample double D's to good use. Or were they bigger? That didn't matter, all you could do was moan into the succubus's oozing cunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat elicited a giggle from her, and to add to your pleasure further she then coated the top of you shaft with saliva from her tongue. Ms Mikoto continued, pressing her beautiful breasts close as they could go with your penis. You squirmed faster, it wasn't long. You were close to your release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it seemed that the motherly succubus realised this, as you heard her mutter \"That's it son, let it all out. There's my big boy.....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave one last moan, and your white seed shot from your erection. Spurting quite a copious amount too at that, Ms Mikoto made certain it landed on her facial area. At the same time she grinded on your face, which continued to moisture. Until before long she had her own orgasm, she arguably came bigger than you did. Because the entirety of your face to your bottom lip was now quite damp, after this the Milf took a few steps away and unhooked your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe caught you before your head could hit the mat, in a bridal style carry. She then leaned you upright on the corner and looked at you with lust filled eyes, Ms Mikoto gave a quiet moan as she wiped her face of your cum. Before licking it all in, it must have pleased her quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.....that was delicious. You have the gift I've wanted, no question. I'm so proud of you.....my son......\" she muttered as she walked towards you. She gave you a soft embrace as you stood there panting, and Ms Mikoto moved her right breast over to your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now drink my child, fall into slumber. For tomorrow we start our dream, I love you.\" Ms Mikoto moved the tit into your mouth, shortly after warm and runny milk flowed from the nipple. After the very enjoyable wrestling match and orgasm you just had you were quite tired, and the maternal love that your former gym teacher was giving to you was making you very tired. Looking back, she had always looked out for you. Even when you had been bullied she cared for you, perhaps even if you weren't special she might have chosen to take you in. Your parents weren't exactly good, and she had wanted to be a Mother and a naughty lover at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could you refuse? You simply sucked away, and your eyes slowly shut as you entered a dream of milk and honey......</span></div></div>",

Her clothes changed back as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mutter, \"You have a point there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the room. After a few minutes, you did as well. You managed to get home without any problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few weeks went by fairly peacefully. Ms. Makoto seemed to dial back her 'must make you run more than anyone else' attitude. The girls stopped bullying you. So that was a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was negated by two facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne - no matter how much you masturbated, you had trouble cumming. Each day, it seemed to get harder and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo- As the days came and went, less and less men were coming to school and more girls were coming. A number of them were kinda hot and the others were slowly getting hotter. Heck, even the girls that were there when the school year started were getting hotter. And they all were glancing in your direction more and more as time went by, even the female teachers besides Ms. Makoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until you heard of the football team trying to recruit more members because their numbers were getting dangerously down to them being disbanded that you remembered what Ms. Makoto told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"your body takes masculinity from men around you the more your around the more effeminate until honestly they just up and turn into women.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you didn't put a kibosh on your aura, you'd wind up being the only guy in a school of women.</span></div></div>",

You find her and her two 'servants' behind the school and Lizzie is in her succubus form you also see a guy glued to the wall. \"Okay girls get him prepped mistress wants a few guys saved up so get the mark and collar ready.\" The two girls nodded as the boy struggled to get free Agatha and Alice pulled out a odd shaped branding iron and a collar with odd snapped symbols carved into it. \"Am I intrupting something?\" You say walking up to the three and only Liz notices you. \" well it nice to see you here did you change your mind and want to join us or did you just want to see me body again.\" She says with a smile you just shake your head. \"I need your help with this aura thing.\" You say Liz just starts to circle around you. \"Oh so you want my help <i>controlling</i> the aura right. Why should I help you control it hmm.\" She says crossing her arms under her impressive breast. \"Because if I'm see things right you guys are losing prey faster every day.\" You say with a smug look on your face she just scoffs but looks at the guy stuck to the wall and sighs. \"Your kinda right there's been less sex to the family but still I think if you joined us we'd fix that little problem.\" She said walking closer to you. \"Then how about a deal you help me get some control of my 'aura' and I'll give you something in return.\" Her ears perked up when she heard the word 'deal' and stood in front of you. \"Okay how about this teaching you how to use the gift you have you give me some high powered loving about twice a week how's that sound.\" Honestly it sounded wrong but any control of this thing was better than it just changing every body in the town in to girls but still your trusting a demon after all. \"Okay you got a deal so do we shack or what.\" You said then grabbed your head and forced a kiss on your lips your both shocked as she tried to force her tongue into your mouth you pull away after that. \"Was that necessary couldn't you just write up a contract or something!\" You yell she then held her hand to her mouth and seemed to pull a scroll of some kind out of her mouth. \"It was how we succubi form our contracts a kiss to us is like a signature see for your self.\" She unfolds the paper and shows his signature but before you could read it it vanishes in a puff of smoke. \"Now we'll have our first lesson tomorrow and our first payment then to.\" You nod and walk to your home leaving the girls to do their business. \"My lady didn't mistress tell us not to stop his gift from spreading.\" Says agatha still holding the burning branding iron Liz turned around smiling. \"Yes she did but I don't plan to help him stop the aura I plan to help him make it grow no it only grows to about two maybe three blocks with my help he'll turn the city into a bunch of fuck crazy girls it may mean more sisters but when the worlds ours it won't matter. As she says this she grabs the branding iron and press it against the boys chest he screams as the collar is slipped onto him and all of them begin to vanish and the cogs of the end began to turn but where does the story go from here.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shaking off the rain I stepped in further, looking about curiously. This didn't look like a natural cave, more like one of those tourist things. You know, 'See the deepest cavern in Texas!' or something. The floor had been smoothed out, I didn't see any little stones or debris anywhere and the place looked fairly light and breezy... though curiously I couldn't find any lights. Glancing around, frowning as further searching still reveals no lamps or ceiling lights despite the bright interior I headed in through the first chamber via a smaller passageway, just a few feet long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was obvious. Tables and chairs are a bit of a giveaway for some place to be organized, and pretty well too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat. Literally. Well laid out too.\" I muttered to myself seeing a set of shelves on the far wall with cans on them, a refrigerator nearby, and a largish table with three kitchen chairs around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try. Nice to be appreciated certainly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden voice nearly made me jump out of my skin, especially coming, as it did, from right behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JEEZE! Don't do that Lady. You nearly scared me... half... to....\" my voice and brain ground to a halt as I turned to see who had spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI truly was not expecting that she would be naked... though it wouldn't exactly matter... maybe. The scales covering her may leave little to the imagination but they covered pretty well her... oh, I guess that WAS her skin. She was maybe a little over six foot tall, very well proportioned, green, covered in large, heavily overlapping scales on her back and the outside of her arms, and small, smooth scales on her front, inside of her arms and face. And her face was... interesting. She looked like half way between a human and a snake (no hair though), but with two short horns behind two angular, almost horse like ears. No matter how reptilian her face looked though her expression was blatantly exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" She said tiredly. \"And now is the bit where you scream, attempt to kill me, or run into a wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" I said, still attempting to get my brain in gear. No reason I shouldn't be polite though. \"...Miss... or is it missus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression softened a bit and her lip curled in a faint smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss thank you, and the name is Olive. Pleased to meet you...?\" She said, holding out a dainty, though clawed, hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Peter. My name's Peter.\" I said, taking her hand in a firm grip and was somewhat surprised that her hand was warm, \"I'm afraid I'm a bit lost. I was with a tourist forest trek party and got left behind. It was kinda badly organized. Heaven only knows who would let the party spread out like that in the middle of the forest like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you never know, you could run into a dragon or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that she flexed wings I hadn't noticed as they'd been furled behind her back and head, and flapped them briefly. They were rather large wings, almost filling the chamber, and I blinked as the wind gusting in my face for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. Yeah. Guess so. Mind you, wouldn't be too bad a thing now would it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlive paused, squinting at me cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on how much you enjoy being eaten I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked. Did she just say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....\" I managed, fear now starting to creep into my voice. \"... you're going to eat me?\"</span></div></div>",

Besides, she was blocking the exit to the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm really rather you didn't. I'm not partial to death. It really doesn't agree with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe actually chuckled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, still I have a problem. I vowed I would eat intruders into my place. Not that I don't like you, but, you know, I keep my promises. It's important you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked, eyes glancing around for any hint of a way out of here, but the only route out was past her and she filled the little passageway. I really didn't think I could push past her successfully. Though she looked very feminine she gave the impression of great strength, perhaps just by her posture. Difficult to tell, but I did not want to cross her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... understand.\" I found myself saying, and she raised an eyebrow. \"Don't suppose there is some kind of loophole or other? Some way I don't end up dead from this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlive squinted at me, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't like that kind of lawyer talk. Wriggling out of situations like this with some kind of loophole? Hmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you'd posted a sign saying 'no trespassers' I could see it.\" I said, nerves showing in my voice, but amazingly I found I was still not stuttering and being rather coherent. \"But there was nothing to tell me I shouldn't step in here. How can I be blamed for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A point, a point, I'll give you that.\" She said and smiled. \"Still going to eat you though. Sorry. Take those clothes off will you. They taste fowl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor several seconds I stood there, blinking at her. She was really going to eat me? I... no... seriously no. This could NOT be happening!</span></div></div>",

I felt calm, a rather brittle calm to be sure, but calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just appreciate I don't strip for just any girl!\" I said, but couldn't muster a smile. This really wasn't a joking matter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did seem a little surprised as I started to disrobe, peeling off my jacket, shirt, then unbuckling my belt and sliding both trousers and underwear off along with shoes and socks. I did blush and she smirked seeing me 'at attention.' Hey, a girl seeing me naked? How could that not get me hard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've certainly got guts, I'll give you that.\" She said, and leaned over to me, smiling. \"Don't worry, I don't bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't laugh, but did manage a weak smile. Still, she was... slender, and only maybe an inch or two taller than me. Was she really going to be able to eat me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted a hand to my face, claws snicking away into her fingers as she stroked my cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, just relax. I promise this won't hurt a bit. You might even enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked. How could getting chewed up be pleasant?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her mouth opened wide. And when I say wide I mean WIIIIIIIIDE! Suddenly I was staring down a deep red, moist tunnel, uvula (dragons had uvulas?) dangling at the back as she moved in. I felt a hand on the back of my head, then another on my shoulder, and her face moved towards me, AROUND me! I could see her jaws atop and beneath my face, shadows falling over me. Good god, she was going to swallow me? Was that even possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her jaws closed, gently, on my head, her hand leaving it as she grasped me by me waist and heaved. A huge echoing gulp resonated in my head as she leaned back and effortlessly hefted me from the floor, her jaws squeezing tightly over my shoulders, my ears popping as wet flesh squeezed past my head as I plummeted into her gullet. Squishing sensations rippled over me, her throat oozing over and pulling, the muscles firm and sure, drawing me in as she tipped me upside down above her. A tight ring of muscle popped over my head, then started over shoulders as I went deeper. I could feel her lips push up, stroking across my back and chest, then on over my abs and lower back. Then I gasped as deft fingers pushed my hard shaft up over her lips and into her mouth with the rest of me. Her tongue greeting the twitching tool contentedly and she moaned as she sucked on my whole body, though I was focused rather heavily on one specific part being sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI admit I kind of lost it there, and when I came to my senses her lips were sliding up my ankles, and before I knew what was happening she pressed my feet in and swallowed, the last of me sliding down her gullet. Powerful swallows pushed me in, tucking me into a ball in her belly and I panted, gasping from the strain of the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! Dang, haven't had a meal that nice, and cooperative, in ages! Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... you're... welcome?\" I managed weakly.</span></div></div>",

I had no clue why I wasn't shouting and screaming right now. By rights I should have been going nuts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but I think you'd do well. Mind you, I never thought a lawyer would taste that could. Mmmm!\" The flesh around me clenched and rippled, squeezing tightly for a moment, followed by a resonating belch, deafening to me in there. \"Oooh! Pardon me. I think it was someone I ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I gave you gas.\" I managed, though my voice was beginning to break at that point. I think I was near breaking point frankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, still, just as you said, I've managed to keep my vow. Ergo, I ate you. Promise kept, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pregnant pause followed that, obviously I was supposed to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... right?\" I managed weakly. \"All's well with the world.

Never had anyone who hasn't run screaming before. Nice to have a decent conversation that didn't involve death threats.\" She clucked to herself momentarily. \"Tsk, me here, blathering away, but hardly fair to you now is it? After how well you treated me? No, you deserve some attention. Now just relax, this won't hurt a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked. Was this is? Was she going to digest me now? I'd thought I'd be stuck in here for days, slowly.... oh god, can't think like that! No she wasn't going to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the world squeezed, pushing in on my sides and chest, pushing down on my tucked in knees, slowly straightening me out. I felt feet jamming up backwards, pushing into a tight space, then heaving muscles rippled over my whole body. Was this it? Was I going to die?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surging pressure washed over me in waves, disorientating. Then cold air struck my feet, then ankles. What? I barely had time to register that however as hands grasped them and pulled and I found my hips wedging over a familiar tongue which again decided to make itself very familiar with my groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy SHIT!\" I grunted, and immediately started bucking, though it was hardly necessary. Her tongue milked me like a snake strangling a victim, wrapping itself around and rippling smoothly. It was like nothing I'd felt before. Or at least nothing I'd remembered. I guess I kind of blanked out last time, presumably she did something like this when she ate me, but it was all a blur. Now I felt every squeeze and suck. Every ripple and caress. She drew me higher and higher, making my head feel like it would explode... then another head entirely did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gnnnnnn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaking I was in no position to resist, other than pathetically twitching, as she drew me out, drawing my spit soaked body from her wide stretched jaws to finally leave me laying against her, head nestled between her breasts. She was warm there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooowwww!\" I gasped, feeling her stroke my hair softly. \"I... thanks. Really, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't mention it.\" She said in a gentle voice.</span></div></div>",

I'm not letting you gather a mob to kill me. Nope, you're mine now.\" She chuckled throatily as she ran a finger down my back, sending a shiver down my spine, especially as her claw snicked out as it flicked through the divot of my buttocks for a moment. \"AAAALL mine! And I'm not letting you out of my sight. Heh! Oh, I haven't had a lover for fifteen years! I hope you're fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed then propped me up, looking down at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, let me make this blatantly obvious. You're mine now. You do whatever I say. If you do something I don't like I'll eat you. Do something seriously bad and you'll stay eaten. Got it?\" After a slight pause I nodded furiously. Did not want to annoy this lady! \"Good. Don't worry, you'll like being mine. I don't really need much. Maybe you could help clean this place up a little, but mainly, I just want to fuck you. You don't have a problem with that, right?\" I shook my head. \"Good, good. The point is I need you to satisfy me, and it's been a while.\" I felt her legs spread slowly beneath me, letting my body slide between them as I lay there. \"So.... you need to make this good. Very good. Understand?\" I nodded, then felt a hand on my rump, which slowly pulled, sliding my body upwards. \"Now, I'm going to lay here and you are going to make me feel ten times better than I just made you feel, OK? Feel free to start any time you like Peter, though for your benefit the sooner the better. Unless you like spending time in my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand pushed further and I gasped, my shaft suddenly driven into a very tight, wet spot.

I need to be sure what you mean. I know it's almost certainly the first one, but I have to be sure! This is my life we're talking about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, fair enough I guess. Yes, I mean you will tell nobody that I exist. To be honest my first thought was to not let you leave. Ever.\" I froze. Ever? \"This is... difficult for me. I've been alone a long time. Well, a long time for humans. I'm still young for a dragon. Just forty years old.\" He'd thought early twenties, but with alien physiology it was hard to tell... And to be honest that hadn't been uppermost in his mind. \"I haven't seen another dragon in... well, since I was in my teens. I've had proof of what people do to dragons when they find them.\" Her face was definitely fierce right now, but thankfully staring off into the distance. I'd hate to have that anger focused on me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was surprisingly soft and supple on her front, though her sides and back looked a little rougher, the larger overlapping plates of the scales far thicker. So far though I'd rested just on the soft, small scaled skin. And her chest included that definitely. Then she chuckled, probably seeing me eying her bosom rising and lowering around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that huh?\" She idly rested her hand behind my head, then before I could answer pushed gently and I felt my face plop between her breasts. They pushed tightly in on either side like walls of a canyon, shadows covering my brow now, and my mouth was pressed to her skin, breathing through my nose now. \"Me too. I'll tell you what. There is a way you can leave, but it's a firm commitment. Be careful before you agree too hastily.\" She paused, her eyes locking with mine till she saw I was taking this seriously. \"OK. I'll let you come and go as you please, as long as you vow, on your life, to do two things. One, tell no-one of me, as I said. Two... be my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoyfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, seeing the surprise in my eyes, poking out from the shadows of her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your the first guy who didn't run off, and you do look kinda cute. I will tell you now I do kinda have some... pent up needs. It's been a while. A long while! I might get a little... needy.\" She emphasized this point with a hand firmly caressing my rump back there. \"So, you'll definitely have duties to attend to. Other than that I'll let you come and go... but you will be my boyfriend, love and care for me... or I'll eat you. Same if you tell someone about me.

Yes?\" I said, somewhat muffled from my 'containment.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smiled brightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, 'Boyfriend.'

Given I'd just cum... twice, I'd have thought I wouldn't be up for a third helping, but somehow I was. As my saliva coated body pressed to her my cock twitched against her and she 'Mmmm'ed appropriately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently I slid my arms under her body, hugging her, and gently lifting my head (reluctantly) from the chasm of her bosom. She chuckled as I popped clear, then slowly I pulled myself up her body, feeling my shaft stroke up her thighs, then nudge at the apex. I pulled a hand clear and began to stroke gently down one side and leaned in to kiss her neck... Then gasped as she grabbed my rump and heaved, jamming my shaft into her in one stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOOOOAH!\" I grunted as warm heat enveloped me. \"Er... not one for foreplay huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned and stroked my cheek with a claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naah. I'm always ready. And I mean ALWAYS.\" She said with a sultry smile. \"So, never hesitate, just do me.\" she paused, staring into my eyes and I admit to feeling somewhat lost, the heat of her sex and the heat of her gaze making me dizzy. \"That means don't hesitate literally... as in NOW!\" she said emphatically, her sex pulsing, gripping me down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" I muttered and began to pump. She moaned and tipped her head back, eyes closed as I got to work. And very satisfying work it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that's it. Stick that sucker in deep!\" She muttered under her breath as I drove hard into her. \"I expect you to do me as often as you can, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill pumping my hips against her I looked up nervously, panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... *gasp* and how will I know when you want it? *Pant* \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled, then moaned from an errant thrust before fixing me with her steamy gaze once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You misunderstand MmmmmmMMMMMmm! Oh yeah. Like that. What I mean is you better do me as often as you can, whenever you can. Don't wait for me to ask. I can work around you no matter what I'm doing.\" She said idly as she shook beneath me. Then her gaze got slightly pondering. \"OK. Maybe if I'm in battle or something, then don't fuck me. Otherwise consider me open twenty four seven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I said, almost losing my stride, but a firm glare from her got me back to pumping while I talked. \"Any time? I mean, even if your asleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm Hmmm.\" She said, closing her eyes and nodding, then wrapping both arms and wings around me and hugging my upper body tight as I pumped. \"You better believe it! Oooh yeah, that's good! Faster.... harder. HARDER!\" I thought I WAS going harder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting hard I attempted to increase speed and force, but it was difficult. She was way stronger than I and maybe she just assumed I could go like a jackhammer. I really tried, and apparently it was good enough at least, and a few moments later her grip got intense, she threw her head back and screamed. I grunted as her sex clamped down like a vice, her thighs wrapping tightly around me as she shuddered. I joined her moments later... Then everything went dark as she ate my head and shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stayed there, still twitching, still sucking on my upper body, echoing gulps resounding in my ears, for several minutes. The air was getting stale in her throat when she slowly eased back, letting me stickily into the air once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN!\" She moaned, gazing down longingly at me. \"I missed that. Thank you.... That was wonderful, and tasty. Heh... and don't forget your duties in future, boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she rolled me off her body, rather gently, and stood up. How she could still stand after that much exertion I don't know. Well, maybe because she hadn't moved much till the end there, just leaving it to me? Or maybe she just had way more stamina than me. I just shuddered on the floor for a while, laying on my back in the cold. Watching her grin and stretch above me, arching her back in a very nice way, certainly got my attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're. *Pant* Entirely *Pant* Welcome *Gasp* Girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at me, saw my gaze on her chest and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Glad you enjoyed it. But seriously, at least be ready in an hour huh?\" Ready? For wha... oh she isn't serious. Every hour? Or more?!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.... I...\" I gulped. \"Look, Olive. I'd really love to do that but... I don't have the stamina! I'm only human! I can't make love to you every hour for the rest of my life! I'd die. I mean, it'd be a hell of a way to go but...\" I petered out, looking pityingly up at her.</span></div></div>",

It certainly looks like you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You did something to me? Used magic or something to keep me hard?\" Reflexively my hands wend to cover my shaft. What did she do? \"Look magically keeping me... erect, is one thing, but I just can't make love continuously like that! I mean I'd pass out! Literally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her eyes she sighed once more, with a little more emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for... No, there's no 'magic' involved! There is no such thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain I blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you're a dragon.\" I said, simply. I mean, what more was there to say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? I'm a sophant flying reptile, what's magic about that? Look, my mother was insistent on this, there is such thing as magic! We have skills others don't have, but it isn't magic in any way, shape or form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, skills? Like making it so I stay hard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, frankly. Tweaking biology was something I learned early.\" Olive's nose seemed to rise towards the ceiling as she almost preened. \"Most dragons can adjust pheromones and stuff, but I can do far more than that! Though... I seem to be slower on other things, and I don't think I can give you much more stamina. Unfortunately. Mainly I can adjust myself biologically, but do a little to others on contact. I've learned three templates for myself, though this is the one I mainly use. More useful.\" She held up her hand, inspecting the clawed fingers carefully. \"Hands are wonderful things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Templates? Are you saying you're a shapeshifter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All dragons can a little, and older ones can shift between dozens of forms. It's rare one as young as I can manage it so easily.\" She said, preening again with a haughty air. \"But as I said, biological stuff is easier for me. Mental things are very hard. Usually that only comes around after you're a hundred, or maybe two hundred years old. Not easy things to get right.\" She saw the disbelief in my eyes I'm sure as she squinted at me with a huff. \"Still don't believe I can change? Fine, I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly her skin started to ripple. She arched her back, smiling as her body shifted. Her neck lengthened her hands clicked, fingers shortening and leaving the hand more paw-like, and her arms shortened. With a snort she dropped to all fours, while her legs and arms began to shift to look more like a quadruped's legs. Her tail stretched out further as her wings lengthened, and then... she was a dragon. Literally a dragon, if rather small. No human like features at all. The process had taken maybe two minutes total.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That's... incredible! Can you get bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for heaven's sake... No I can't! Mass stays the same, dummy! That's why older dragons have some difficulty blending in with people until they learn the mental arts. People would think it odd if an eight hundred pound, nine foot man was wandering around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly I sat up, still staring at her. This was... my girlfriend? Was this what she really looked like? She twisted her head, smiling at me as I gazed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like this?\" she said, spreading her wings to limit she could in this part of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes actually. I think you're rather majestic looking.\" Then, because I was hopelessly honest... \"of course, there is a certain appeal to the more human looking shape you were in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned, blushing, and she actually chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, as a species we've become rather attached to something like the human form. Babies still look like this for maybe five years or so, then, with help from their parents, they usually take a form more or less like I was when you saw me first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've got this, your other form, and one other? What does that look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you can't count?\" I frowned, huh? \"I have three forms I know. This is not a template, it's the original. I know my Trend form, the one you saw before, a full human form, and a Slither one, which is more snake like, though still with arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're a naga too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naga? Hmm, don't know that one. This is just a snake with arms. No wings, no legs. Is that a Naga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, well, usually they have a human upper torso, then a long snake body from the waist down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, so not quite huh? Want me to show you?\" I nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she shifted and, true to her word, after a few minutes she looked like a snake, though with reptilian arms and a head more like her first dragon-esk form I'd seen her in to begin with. No breasts or hips though unfortunately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go. I know, I know, not as aesthetically pleasing as the Trend template, but it can get into tight places, is rather strong and still has dexterous fingers. I rather like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, certainly not ugly! I think kind of nice.\" I said, attempting to smile about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no breasts.\" She said, deadpan as she stared at me. My blush was good enough for her and she laughed. \"OK, so try this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she shifted, muscles rippling, scales snapping and flicking on her skin, almost seeming to fold in on themselves. Her skin slowly shifted color, looking pinker, breasts blossomed delightfully on her chest and hair sprouted from her head. This change took considerably longer, maybe ten minutes, but by the end of it I was looking at maybe a sixteen or seventeen year old girl. Naked of course and very well endowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like?\" She said, giving a little twirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Definitely!\"</span></div></div>",

It was just really unfortunate that they chose that particular moment to arrive, and for that particular person to be the one to find me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter?\" Came the almost screech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned, my face going white, and saw Melissa, standing there in her jacket and shorts, pith helmet in her hand... which promptly fell to the floor as she stood staring... at the two naked people before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the girl Peter?\" Olive said calmly, crossing her arms over her impressive chest. \"You do realize this complicates things for you? A lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I...\" my gaze flicked back between Olive and Melissa, no clue what to do or what to say. \"Um... Melissa, meet Olive.

The reaction might have been different if she'd arrived when Olive had looked a bit different. \"You snuck out from the tour to... get yourself some skirt! HOW COULD YOU! I shoul... HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa gasped as Olive stepped right up to her and grabbed her firmly about the waist.

As I ran in Melissa's underwear hit me in the face. By the time I'd disentangled myself from them and could see, Olive was peeling off Melissa's shirt, leaving only her bra left. The bed was strewn with clothes, thrown to all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone you... you... muscle bound rapist!\" Melissa yelled, still thrashing ineffectively at Olive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just relax.\" Olive said calmly, grabbing the front of her bra and snapping it off her with a yelp. \"You can't do anything to stop this so just attempt to enjoy it. I know you will. I sure will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olive!\" I yelled, dashing over to the bed. \"Please, don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glare greeted me as she glanced over her shoulder at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, at least you were nice about it. She's given me no reason to be nice back.\" Olive said, while Melissa still thumped on her arms, barely even able to move her. \"Besides, you I can keep under control... or else... but she obviously can't control herself. Also, I'm your girlfriend, not her. Nope, she's going down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring me as I pleaded for her not to, she turned back and leaned over my previous girlfriend and opened her mouth unnaturally wide. Melissa actually froze, eyes wide in shock, gaping into the gaping maw as it closed in and gently enveloped her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EAAAARRRGH *MPHHL!*\" she screamed, then was cut off as Olive's mouth sealed around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was... surreal. There were two naked, beautiful girls there, one slowly devouring the other whole.... and both were my girlfriends! I knew I couldn't force things, Olive was way too strong, but I couldn't not try. I jumped up on the bed in front of her as she drew the struggling shoulders into her wide stretched lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Olive. She's my girlfriend!\" Olive's eyes slitted and she glared, while gulping hard to a faint muffled 'Eeep!' from inside. Her luscious lips sucked across dainty shoulders and down went Melissa a little more. Yeah, probably not a good choice of phrase. \"I know, you are my girlfriend too, but she was my girlfriend first. No matter what you think she deserves respect. Please don't eat her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to fix me with a glare, then smiled around her meal and reached down to grasp my hands. She brought them up, underneath Melissa, then pressed them against Melissa's chest. Still smiling she relaxed her jaws and pushed on my hands, using my own hands to squeeze Melissa's breasts in over Olive's bottom lip and teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gnnnn!\" I gasped, getting a humungous hard on as I was forced to shove my girlfriend down the gullet of my other girlfriend. \"P... please. Don't do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlive paused, but the smile around Melissa's middle as she gently chewed on her bosom belied her intentions. She let my hands slip out from where she'd swallowed them along with Melissa's breasts, then slowly grasped the girl's knees and pulled them up, tucking Melissa into a fetal ball.. then swallowed. Slowly the huge bulk of Melissa's twitching, tucked up body slid down into Olive's massively stretched mouth as the dragoness sat up, tipping her head back to make it easier. She reached forwards and drew me to her, grabbing my hardon and pulling it between her legs. Then she wrapped her thighs around me, locking her legs behind me, and grabbed my hands once more. As she began to bounce on my cock, sending waves of pleasure through me, she firmly placed my palms on Melissa's buttocks... and pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped and moaned, bucked and grunted, as I was forced to squeeze Melissa down Olive's throat. It was the most bizarre experience I'd ever had, and it was way too much for me. I jerked and bucked as she gulped buttocks and my hands down deep, her lips sliding up my arms and over my head even as she continued to pound on me. I felt her cum as my head slid into her mouth and we collapsed onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later she disgorged my panting head and arms, legs still wrapped tight around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMmmmmm. Delicious! Oh, you do have good taste in girlfriends Peter. But that ends now. I am your only girlfriend, understand?\" She said, firmly patting the top of the huge bulge of Melissa inside Olive's tummy, squirming in the tightly containing skin that trapped her. I gazed down in shock at the massive lump that was pressed against my belly, pushing us apart as she kept my shaft firmly embedded in her snatch. \"I said, UNDERSTAND?\" I hastily nodded. \"Good, and in future don't wait for me to force you. Fuck me whenever it's obvious I'm horny.... or any other time you feel like it of course.\" She said with an idle wave of her hand to the last. \"And just to too be concise, I'm usually horny when I'm eating a girl.\"</span></div></div>",

To care for you, to love you... and yet you ate someone I care for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes once more became slitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You care for me Peter.\" She said with a voice like ice. \"Just me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm never to feel anything for anyone ever again?\" I said, somehow managing to meet that gaze, though struggling back tears. \"You can reach into my heart, rip it out so I never like anyone ever again... would you like to be with someone like that? Someone who never feels anything for people, at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes did seem to soften a little at that, but her face still seemed stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be melodramatic Peter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not. I'm serious! You want me to throw away what I feel for Melissa, to give up on her. I can't.\" Out of the corner of his eye he could see the movements in Olive's stomach stop. Hopefully that just meant she was listening to this and was focused. Rather than getting too weak to fight in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to throw away me,\" Olive said fiercely, \"what you could have with me, for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat way lay death, probably inside her stomach. I managed to keep a fixed gaze, not giving away that, despite liking Olive (when she wasn't homicidal), I'd rather be with Melissa than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not both?\" I said instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to surprise her slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to share you with her? What, seriously? No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Olive, she has a life. I have a life. You want to destroy that so easily? To erase a life? How would that make me love you? To love someone who killed a person close to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlive's right eye seemed to be twitching slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. You have a life?\" She said softly. \"Let me guess, You want to go back to it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused. Ah, she planned to keep me here. To be her boyfriend in private, just for her. I wondered how long she'd lived here alone. Before I could voice any questions about her past she spoke up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. You return to your life. You get Melissa back. But I am your girlfriend. I go with you. If she tells anyone of me then I eat her. If you attempt to flee I'll eat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously I should have been scared out of my mind right then, but I mostly felt pity for her. She was scared and lonely, desperate for friendship, for love. I didn't know if I was deluding myself but I thought this fierce aggression, this need to have power over people was just a desperate cry for help. Despite what she'd done I was falling for her, as crazy as that sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am your boyfriend Olive. I'd be happy to have you with me.\" I blink. \"Though I'm not sure what my parents would think.\"</span></div></div>",

You understand you need to be with me as often as you can, yes?\" She paused for emphasis. \"Sex. As much as you are able. This does mean you need to be physically nearby!\" She poked him forcibly with a finger. \"Don't wait for me to insist. By then it will be too late!

Tricky with Melissa still inside Olive's stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few more seconds of piercing gazing she sighed and her thighs unlocked from my waist.

I swear she did that on purpose. Grunting I attempted to hold her as she tumbled into my lap upside down, her bum tipping over and smacking me in the face. Heck, we'd only been together that one night intimately before, and we hadn't even been naked then! This was the first time I'd seen Melissa in the buff! It was incredibly distracting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her lips with a distinctly 'thoroughly pleased with herself' smile on Olive nodded to me and the orally impaled Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so we should head out of here. You head back 'home,' Me and Melissa shall go find a house nearby. I assume she knows where you live?\" I nod, attempting to ignore lips and tongue enveloping my shaft. \"Good. Melissa? Come on girl, up and at 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an uncoordinated wriggle Melissa managed to tip herself upright, pulling herself off my cock and standing, a little unsteadily, and gulping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... yes Olive. I think I know a place we can stay. Though me affording the rent might be tricky... and my parents will pitch a fit... but I can deal with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, Melissa seemed way too calm all of a sudden. She'd just been <i>eaten</i> for heaven's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa? Are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sweetheart smiled that smile I knew too well, love in her eyes, and leaned in and gave me a quick kiss... much to Olive's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine love. But she needs my help. We'd best do what we can hmm?\" She smiled and stroked my cheek. \"And I think you'd better go with her on the way back. By the sound of it she'll need a good fuck on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSay what?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olive....? What did you do to her?\" I said, unable to tear my eyes away from Melissa's smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just minor hormonal thing. She'll accept anything we do and be utterly loyal to you and me. Wouldn't dream of going against anything we say. Well, me first, you second, but you get the idea. Don't worry, she's still the same Melissa she was beyond that. She is right though. I'm assuming it's a long trek 'home?' You don't want to keep me waiting <i>too</i> long. Stamina not withstanding.\" She said, pointedly staring at my groin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At least the forest isn't too far off the beaten path. The school is on the outskirts of town and the forest was barely a half hours walk from there... except they'd trekked at least another hour into the forest after entering it. It took nearly two hours to head back, though at least Olive packed light. I was frankly amazed she had clothes to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo girls and a guy, nothing special to see here. I kept that foremost in my mind. No one is going to suspect a ravenous dragoness is taking up residence in the neighborhood! No siree! I felt like I was sweating bullets. Finally though I reached my home and Melissa and Olive headed on without me. What the school staff would think I don't know. It was a voluntary trip, but we'd signed off and they were going to freak out when we didn't show up. But Olive was insistent she wasn't going to let Melissa out of her sight from now on, and there was no way I was letting her go up from with the teachers on the trek! I could have gone back without them, leaving only Melissa missing... but it felt wrong. Plus I would have been so nervous they would have known I knew something about it. I'm just no good at lying or keeping secrets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all going to go horribly wrong! I just knew it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care Peter.\" Melissa said with a cheery wave, as if nothing was wrong in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlive tucked her arm around Melissa's waist and guided her away. Then my new girlfriend glared back at me over her shoulder before heading away. She didn't have to say more. She was overdue. I hadn't satisfied her recently and she wasn't happy! But... this was in public, I couldn't! I... could have done it while we were heading home in the forest but... I had been so worried I'd forgotten. That kind of forgetfulness would likely get me in real trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pondered my future carefully. They'd need time to sort out the renting, even if it went as smooth as Melissa assumed, and I'd need to explain that I had to head home to my parents.... and then have to sneak out or something. I was going to have to tend to Olive's needs ASAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end things kind of fizzled back at home. Dad wasn't home, out drinking somewhere again, and Mom wasn't worried in the slightest by my arrival. I didn't have to sneak out at all, just grab something to eat, shower, change my clothes, give mom a peck on the cheek and headed out. I'm just glad sis wasn't there to mess things up. Lizzy is always suspicious of me, no matter whether I'd done something or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found the place Melissa had said, and sure enough the 'For Rent' sign was turned over. She'd already ironed out a deal and had moved in. Not that she had much stuff to move in right now. How she'd explain this to her parents I had no clue! How had she arranged the rent anyway? She was sixteen for heaven's sake! Did she know the owner? I hadn't asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was unlocked and I let myself in, hearing noise of furniture being moved around. I knew I'd have to be decisive, to step in fast, no matter what. Olive expected it. This felt so weird, and scary. No matter what Olive had said I was scared that doing this would make her mad... but I had no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripping quickly I folded my clothes and put them on the table and headed for the noise of furniture moving. There was no way Melissa was doing that so it must be Olive. She could probably move the furniture one handed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found her in the kitchen, still in her delightfully pretty human form, shifting the table around. Melissa was sitting contentedly in a chair, a distant smile on her face, wearing the same safari outfit she'd had on in the forest. Olive had changed from the blue and black shirt and trousers she'd worn on the way back to a light yellow top, cut above her belly button and a dark green pleated short skirt. Very short. As she bent over to shift the table I could see she wasn't wearing underwear. Not surprisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, now or never!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath I strode quickly over to Olive, grasped her by the waist, and jammed my hardness up between her thighs with a hard thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEP!\" She gasped, dropping the table as I slammed home, her skirt quivering against me.</span></div></div>",

Oh yes, take me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sounded positively submissive! As I continued she practically melted, and seemed even more submissive. This was freaky, especially after all the aggressive behavior earlier. Glancing to my left I could see Melissa grinning and leaning forwards to watch, seemingly enthralled by the spectacle. That almost made me lose my rhythm, but thankfully I kept going. Who knew what Olive would have done to me if I'd stopped mid-stride!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumping hard I reached around, grasping her breasts and using the grip to drive harder and faster as she practically begged me to do so! She was practically squelching as I drove in now, so wet I couldn't believe it. Then her sex clamped down like a vise and I shuddered in sync, jetting myself as she spasmed beneath me. Soon both of us had collapsed on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes for either of us to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really learned your lesson Peter. *pant* \" She said eventually, grinning up at me over her shoulder. \"Keep it up... literally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled, but recognized this cheery friendliness might be a facade. Which was the real Olive? Dom or sub? Hard to tell. Best play it safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" I said, before realizing she hadn't actually thanked me. Thankfully she didn't seem to think I was being sarcastic and I continued before she might realize it. \"So... in future, when I take you unexpectedly, are there any rules? You've said not when you're in battle, but are the other times, places, or ways you don't want me to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me?\" She finished for me with a chuckle. \"Not that I can think of. Bedroom, kitchen, in the street, in the bath. Day, night. Awake, asleep. In the pussy, up the ass, in my mouth, nose whatever. Naked, clothed, anything in between. I don't care. Just take me, no questions. Got it?\" She paused for a second, seemingly considering. \"Though by preference I'd prefer ass or pussy... and when I'm not expecting it. But vary it. I like surprises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI goggled at her. Say what? I knew she liked extremes but... her nose? NOSE?!? I blinked, remembering her mouth opening like a chasm before me, then thought that maybe nasal wasn't quite as stupid as it sounded. Though what she could get out of the experience I couldn't guess. She could hardly have a nasal orgasm... could she? Oh this was so weird!</span></div></div>",

OK, maybe she wasn't limp after all, just relaxing in the afterglow. She doesn't even looked slightly tired! \"Very good Peter, very good. So, you like Anal huh? Glad to see it, but spice it up a bit OK?\" She pauses. \"In fact, stay here tonight. Play around, see what you like, and do me as much as you can manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Olive?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stepping inside the cave I frown. Looked like a hobo had lived in here or something. Newspapers strewn around the floor. A cardboard box in one corner, partially disintegrating from rain it looked like. An old plastic chair colored a faded orange (was probably red to begin with) in one corner, and over on the far side was a ratty matress on a wireframe bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place was a mess, papers and wrappers around everywhere, and... wait... what was that? Peering in I could see something behind the bed, hiding in the shadow. Were those eyes? They looked scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK, I'm not going to hurt you.\" The eyes blinked and I heard a whimpering noise. \"I'm serious. You don't have anything to be afraid of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the eyes rose up and I could see a young looking face emerge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D... do you promise?\" A very pretty voice said \"I don't wanna be hurt again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurt? I... I'm not going to hurt you. Come on.\" I said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she came out. Her head capped in dirty brown hair with some twigs wrapped in it. As she rose from behind the bed I saw her face was covered in dirt, and... My eyes went wide. She was naked! I blushed even as she stood, shakily, and stepped out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when I got my final surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't help myself, my jaw dropped and I gaped. She didn't seem to mind me staring, exactly, though she was obviously still scared. What I saw though was very odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to be maybe sixteen years old, a year younger than me (though I'm terrible at judging ages. I could be wrong), dirt covering her body. It was the dirt and the shadows that had made me miss the obvious things. Like the horns looping around from behind her head, and the faint scales on her dirt brown skin on her sides. Elsewhere the scales were not as noticeable, but on the sides of her body they were clearer. By the way they got more distinct to the sides they probably were clearer on her back too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her were two, large, furled wings, both damaged it looked like with holes in the membranes. They looked like light brown batwings, but with horn like protrusions on the last joint of the wing 'arm' or whatever you'd call it. She also had a long sinuous tail, but no barb on the end, and her feet were three toed and clawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like a cross between a human and a dragon from myth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... you're gonna hurt me aren't you?\" She said, shying away back into the shadows. Oh god, the holes in her wings! She'd been... what? Hunted? Attacked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, NO! It's OK.\" I said, holding my hands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she came back out of the shadows and I tried not to react to her nakedness... well, other than the reaction in my pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really not gonna hurt me?\" She said, seemingly incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.

She could scarcely have been more than four and a half foot tall and it seemed bawling into my chest was almost as high as she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held her for what seemed like an age, letting her get it out of her system, rocking her back and forth, trying to not poke her with my raging hardon (Hey, she was still naked and hugging me for Pete's sake!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually her snivelling came to a stop and she slowly let go, sniffing as she looked up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... are you gonna eat me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAT?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N... NO! Of course not. I told you I'm not going to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" She looked sort of confused at my response, but took a breath and tried to smile. \"So... can I stay with you? I don't like it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glanced around and could see it was... messy. Not a good place to stay certainly.</span></div></div>",

What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, that could explain a few things. Curiously though she just smelled musky, not smelly exactly. Odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for the others not to notice you I think you'll have to be clean. That means bathing.\" She looked quizzically at me. \"I mean, bathing is when you use water to get the dirt off you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, like running in the rain?\" I smiled and nodded. \"Oh... mom said that was dangerous.

Um, is your Mom around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears started to well in her eyes once more. Dang, I put my foot in it didn't I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She... she's gone. I *sniff* put her in the ground a long time ago. I miss her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Amber.\" I said, patting her head. \"I guess your father....?\" I hated to ask it, but it had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom said I shouldn't ask about him. Bad things happened.\" She said, with a cross face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, sorry to ask this Amber, but how long ago did... you Mom go away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long time ago.

I guess.... back then Mom said I was thirty. So... what's twenty plus thirty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifty.\" I said, blinking in shock. This little 'girl' was thirty? She looked sixteen and acted like she was nine! \"You've been alone since your Mom went?\" She nodded. \"I'm so sorry Amber. It must have been scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at the scarf in my hands and got down to it. After a few minutes we had it more or less sorted out. My jacket was long and went down below her waist. As long as no-one looked up it or she didn't bend over no-one would know she wasn't wearing trousers or a skirt. With the scarf around her heat her horns were covered pretty well... though her hair was still messy... as was the rest of her.</span></div></div>",

With barely a sound the struggling body of Melany was lifted from the ground, sliding into the dainty mouth of Amber. She had difficulty with Melany's chest and my eye started twitching as I gaped at the sight of Amber fondling and stuffing Melany's breasts in over her lower lip. After maybe ten seconds she got them tucked inside, then gulped hard, flipped Melany awkwardly into the air, and swallowed hard. Melany's body slid down amazingly quietly into that tiny girl, leaving not a bulge in her. Hips, thighs and legs oozed effortlessly into Amber's maw, before she gulped one last time and licked her lips, giving a faint burp. Melany had been almost six foot tall and VERY well endowed. How did Amber tuck her away without even looking slightly plump?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mean girl.... but she tasted good... apart from those cloth things. They don't taste good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gaped.

Though might be a while. She's having a little difficulty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, So, while we're waiting for Melany why don't you tell me about yourself Amber? I know you've been alone for a long time. How have you survived?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled sadly, staring off into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mostly stayed in the cave, though I don't really like it. It smells bad. Always did. But I go out a little ways and hunt for food. Sometimes small stuff like bunnies and hawks, sometimes bigger stuff like horses and cows. Mmm, a cow'll last me for months and months before I get hungry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, wait. You can swallow a cow? Whole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber smiles innocently, nodding vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, though what I tasted of Melany she tasted way better than a cow. Better even than a bunny! I like those the best usually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh this is freaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Melany is ready! Hang on, I'll cough her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber leaned over and began to hack, and soon her jaws spread wide and Melany's spit soaked head emerged, gasping and panting as she heaved herself up and out. I couldn't help but get a horrendous hard on again as Amber squeezed out Melany's breasts, chewing them out, to winces from Melany, though she didn't break the skin. If the little girl could swallow a cow why were Melany's breasts a challenge? Was it all a game with her? Maybe she just liked the feel of chewing them down? Who knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Melany's upper body was out and her hips began to emerge, then Melany gasped as she stopped rising out of the little girl's mouth and her eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck!\" She gasped, then gritting her teeth shut and her hands grabbed the grass in fists, straining and arching her back. \"Hoooooooly fuck. Oh m... YEEAAA *MFFFLL!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed to clamp my hands over Melany's mouth as she came, bucking and squirming as obviously Amber's tongue got seriously busy between Melany's legs. That's one busy little girl. Amber just 'Mmmm'ed and smiled around Melany's twitching body, then slowly let the rest of her out to lay in a sticky, very satisfied heap on the grass.</span></div></div>",

It... she killed herself to save me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Amber was bawling again, arms wrapped tight around me and head smooshed against my body once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK. The men are gone, right? Your Mom saved you. It was what she wanted, to help. You lived, so it was worth it to her. I'm sure if there had been another way she would have done it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just babbling, trying to say anything that might make her feel better. Melany didn't seem terribly considerate, still with that silly smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... what did you do to Melany Amber? She doesn't seem like herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Amber pulled back, sniffing as she looked up with reddened eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... *sniff* made her not a nasty lady any more. She'll be nice now. Do what's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're saying you made her want to do what she thinks we want?\" Amber nodded. \"And how long will she stay like this?\"</span></div></div>",

Those that were bad and tried to hurt us were.....well I guess they were eaten. But there were people who weren't bad! Like they were all scared and crying their eyes out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so this was what happened to them?\" I inquire, I'm looking Melany up and down. I've got to admit she looks pretty damn sexy, she's got this sense of afterglow around her that comes from sex. She gives me a wink and I quickly make to look back at Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes on with \"Well Olive used to say they became more agreeable, said that the best way to deal with them wasn't to make them go away for good. But just make them not tell, Mom said it was something to do with our insides. They didn't get afraid after it that I know, they even stayed for sometime helping around with stuff. I was never allowed to talk with them though....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give a nod, trying not to look at Melany. But still at least she won't be the huge bitch she usually is, that's another weight off my back. But then I realise something, Melany's not wearing clothes! And I begin to admire those nice firm breasts, oh this day has just been strange full stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber? Could you maybe cough up Melany's clothes?\" I mutter, reality sets back in. Amber is covered with my coat and scarf, people will probably think her feet are fancy shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But those things taste nasty!\" Amber protested with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh and hold her hand and look into her eyes \"Listen, you've been so good so far. Please do this one last thing for me, and I promise to make it up to you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked at me with those big eyes, I tilt my head and give her a look to signal there's no way of worming out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.......\" Amber said as she shut her eyes and began hacking in her throat, and sure enough slowly but surely the clothes of Melany began to escape from her. They all landed in a heap on the ground, Amber then gave a hiss before saying \"Those things taste really foul, just buh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't say I disagree, but I look to Melany and say \"Melany please put these clothes on and go home, don't tell anyone about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelany gives a light moan as she proceeds to stick her old outfit on, even with it coated in Amber's saliva and god knows what else. But she looks really relaxed and happy, she gives a wink to me and the dragon girl and says \"I won't tell a single soul, hope to see you again sometime......\" with that she left with a big sway of her hips as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to admit, I was checking out that backside. But once Melany departed I turned to Amber and held her hand. \"Okay Amber, I'm taking you home. I'm so sorry that you had to suffer through all that by yourself, but I'm here for you. Everything is going to be alright from now on.\" I say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looks at the forest once again, quietly before she then bit her lower lip. She clearly felt that this was goodbye to her old life, before she can cry once again I'm drawn to hugging her. I feel her tears on my chest. \"Shh, it's okay. Just because your not living here doesn't mean you can't come back, I live not too far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of holding her Amber looks up at me with a smile and nod. \"Okay. Let's go Peter.\" she takes my hand and follows me to the way home......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trip home with Amber was silent, we had come out of the forest onto the main road. I glanced to the girl next to me, Amber was looking at the road and the cars that went up and down it. She let out a little yelp and clung to my arm tighter. \"What are those?\" she mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirk and say \"They're cars Amber, they help people move faster on the ground. Pretty much.\" Amber was quiet once again but gives me a nod in understanding. I know how far we are from home, I live on the city limits. While it means I need to get up early for school at least it would be useful in coming back to the forest in case Amber ever wished to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk down the pavement with Amber holding onto me, she makes a habit of looking down rather than everything around her. Most likely out of a sense of fear, understandable. She's been in that forest pretty much her whole life, I'll help her though. And doing that will be taking her to my home, where Amber was living wasn't a place even pigs should have stayed in after all. Thankfully my parents are out of town, and will be like that for the next month at least. I'll be going to college soon and I'll get my own apartment from there, and I'll take Amber there with me too. Hopefully it will all work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough I'm back in my familiar surroundings, me and Amber get a few funny looks from those we walk past. Most likely because of how Amber looks and probably smells, when we get home I might get her cleaned up. She'd look way more beautiful I'd bet, however I need to focus. \"Are we there yet?\" Amber mutters, she's keeping quiet for the most part. My advice was working, and thankfully we're close to home now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, in here.\" I mutter, I take her to the apartment complex that I live in. And enter using my key, thankfully it's in the evening so not many people are coming and going right now. Perfect to allow me to slip in with a dragon girl, I lead her up some steps and walk to the end of the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here?\" Amber asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm. Welcome home Amber.\" I can't help but say that, I smile to her before unlocking the door and letting Amber in. We walk in and I lock the door behind us, and I flip the nearby light switch on. My parents are rather wealthy, so the place is very nicely furnished. And there's a good amount of food in the fridge too, and I've got enough money to make sure I can keep us both fed. Not to mention that it can be out of the way, which will help keep her safe and away from prying eyes. A quick glance to the girl with me has her face lighting up in awe of the various things, she's never seen most of this stuff before after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber walks forward, looking around in wonder. I smile as she gazes at the big TV in the room, Amber turns to me and says \"I think I saw something like this, on a sheet of paper that I picked up one time. It's a television isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah it is.....\" I say, I remove my shoes by the door and cough a little. I walk up to Amber and the girl again glomps me, and she gives a happy sigh as she buries her head into my chest once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Peter, you don't know how happy I am. I've been....so scared and lonely, but I feel really really happy!\" she says, I smile and hold her close. She just feels so nice to hold, even if she could eat me in a heartbeat. But again, just so cute! Though again that musky smell comes to my nose, it's not a bad one so to say. But still.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well now that we're safe and sound I think maybe it's time for getting Amber ready to stay here, and she's not an animal. She's a human/dragon girl, so it wasn't a full case of human but still! Amber would be a lot better if she looked cleaner. And if my parents come home, and catch Amber's musky scent. They might wonder if I took in a stray housecat or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amber?\" I say, the dragon girl leans back and looks up at me with a big smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember when we talked about a bath? Back in the forest?\" Amber nods in response to it, waiting for where I'm going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unzip Amber's coat, or rather I'm about to. But then I remember that she's stark naked under it, and I pause and bite my lower lip. Amber simply tilts her head, no doubt wondering what I'm doing. I take a deep breath and don't hesitate after it, the zipper goes down. And Amber's tail comes spilling out of it, she had tucked it between her legs to prevent anyone from figuring out who she was. I focus past her, so I don't ogle her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber doesn't seem to mind being naked in front of me, probably because of how she's lived. As I slide the coat off of her Amber's wings unfurl, and I feel a pang in my chest as I notice the holes in her wings. She might never actually fly, I try not to think on that and instead remove her scarf to let her horns show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking, we should get you cleaned up. If your living here with me Amber I want you to look your best. So let's take a shower, it's like being in the rain. But you just stand there.\" I make sure to add that last part in, because Amber would inquire as to what it is. I'll need to sit down with her and explain quite a few things to make sure she gets it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Okay Peter!\" she says, that's good. I give her a smile and hold her hand as I lead her to the bathroom. Our shower is pretty cool I will admit, it has a seat that's actually pretty comfortable inside it and the showerhead is detachable as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open the shower door for her, and motion for her to enter. I'm trying to avoid looking at her naked form, out of politeness. And that raging hard-on is still going strong, has been since she got upzipped. But as Amber enters the shower I can't help but check out her naked back, her tail lightly moving on it's own accord. That said though she's actually got a rather curvy backside, certainly enough to peek out from below her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looks around the whole place with wonder, I grab the showerhead and say \"Right then.\" my eyes dart to her naked tits. I can't help my male instincts, all I can do is try to resist it. But after looking her over, it's clear she needs to get a good wash. Kinda like taking the diamond out the rough and polishing it. \"So just gonna turn this and.....\" I say as I adjust the water valves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater shoots out of it, but I make sure it doesn't touch Amber yet. Because it'll be mighty cold, she lets out a little yelp as the water touches her dragon feet. I then say \"Hold on, it'll get nice and warm.\" sure enough the water gets warm. Not very hot, but certainly pleasant. I set the showerhead up in it's hold and motion for Amber to go under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does, and Amber's eyes shut. She gives me a happy sigh, already some of the dirt on her body is coming loose. And it seems that the dragon girl's really enjoying this, she even gives a small shake of herself. Her breasts lightly jiggling as the water trickles down the bare skin, I can swear that her nipples are getting sharp. Though that might just be the gun in my pants telling me that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm.....so good.....Peter, do you want to join me in the rain?.....\" she mutters with a smile as she opens one eye to me. I will admit being in the shower with her would be awesome, and I could help soap her and make her more cleaner. But what if she sees me naked and my erect shaft brushes up against her, she doesn't know much about the birds and bees as our encounter with Melany earlier told me.</span></div></div>",

They were now three girls with two horns sticking out of their head. Their skin now had a green color to it their bodies from the stomach down was now a giant fuzzy spider. They turned their heads in your direction you put your car out of park and floor it. \"Okay my friends just turned into some kinda spider women this can't get worse. Can it?\" You quick turn your head to see all three of them chasing after you. \"OH SHIT!!!\" You scream.

Some areas in forrests and secluded areas have been legally put aside for their use and a few (maybe one in ten) is assigned as a Cross Species Academy. Even in those schools most of the students are human, maybe only one in a hundred are non-humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade has joined your school only a week ago and there is trouble already. She is shy, retiring, rather sexy looking and, unfortunately, very tasty. Since she is made of slime even humans can drink/eat her and a few have tried already. One of the Naga kids has already been expelled for attempting to swallow Jade on her first day here. It seems that Jade's body is not only tasty, but also addictive. The various non-humans that can swallow people whole usually are very restrained. They don't want to get the image of man-eating monsters and get the 'angry mob' aroused. There hasn't been a generic 'angry mob' with pitchforks etc, but there have been legal problems over the last ten years and that is something the 'Sybarus', as the various creatures have called themselves collectively, have been trying to avoid. With Jade however the restraint seems to go out the window. If one tastes her they want to eat the rest of her... desperately! Even her smell seems intoxicating! This also seems to arouse sexual feelings as well as hunger and gives a whole other reason for her to avoid others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA human seems to act the same, but can't eat enough of her to put her at risk... probably. There have been several lectures on the subject over the last couple of days to the students, attempting to secure Jade's safety in class. The last couple of days, since a few girls from the home economics class attempted to make a banquet of her, Jade has hidden away outside of class and has taken to sitting as far away from others as possible in class as well. It doesn't seem to be helping. There is talk of her moving schools again, which you think would be a real shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this the slime you were looking for or did you want to meet some other addictive green slime?</span></div></div>",

You just hope you can get there in time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding the corner at a run you see two 'kids' holding a third one off the ground. All three are 'Subari', the monsters or creatures that people have learned about this last decade since they revealed themselves. The one in the air is a bubbling mass of human shaped goo, a writhing green female shape in a normal school uniform. Two terrified looking brown eyes jerk between the other two Subari holding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne is a tall feathery creature. Most people would call her a Harpy, though they hate that name. Too many Ancient Greek overtones, and nasty ones at that. Usually Avians (as they prefer to be called) are pretty friendly and helpful. They are rather delicate, if strong muscled and tend to be short, usually averaging three to four foot tall. Lucy here is nearly six foot tall and rather hefty and can't fly because of it. She hates her life and tends to take it out on others nearby all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other bully is a Naga, one of the populous races of the Subari, and VERY strong. Naga's have the upper body of a person from the waist up, and a long snake tail from the waist down, usually three times as long as the rest of them. They can swallow huge things, including people... or bigger items, with ease and have been fighting the negative image of a 'man-eater' ever since Subari were known about. Sandy is not as careful as most Nagas tend to be. She isn't actually as nasty as Lucy, but tends to be selfish and right now has a very hungry gleam in her eye... and Jade's leg in her mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" You yell, and wave a phone at them, the camera pointing at the three struggling girls. \"You try to eat her and I'll send this to the principle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene freezes, Jade with one arm sticking from Lucy's lips, and her thigh emerging from Sandy's, the green girl shaking and quivering as she glances in fear between her two aggressors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, inch at a time, arm and leg are coughed up, though Sandy seems to have a rather edgy look in her eyes.

You get one brief look of Jade's terror filled face before it disappears from sight, Sandy's features lighting up in glee as she swallows... then grunts in shock as you end your jump by headbutting her chest, where the lump of Jade has just about reached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SPLORG!* the three collapse to the ground, Sandy winded, Jade splattered in a puddle on top of you, and you gasping in anger, fear and anxiety. Lucy just looks really panicky. It seems she wasn't really going to eat Jade, just scare her.  She scrabbles to her feet and  half runs, half flies (The best she can ever do!) towards the playground while Sandy retches in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C... *gasp* Come on Jade, pull yourself together!\" You whisper to the goo covering your body and legs, but it just seems to shake \"We gotta get outta here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no response so hastily you scoop her up (and her cast off and torn clothes) into your shirt, pulling it up like a bucket, and stagger up and run off. Jade is pretty heavy, but you run off, dripping green slime from your shirt as you go. Dodging in case Sandy has recovered and is following (Nagas can be real quiet and sneaky if they want to, despite their size!) you end up in the nearest bathroom and collapse in the a stall, shutting it as you peer into your pulled up shirt, green goo bubbling lightly, a few wobbly features in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade? Jade!

Why... OH GOD!\" Jade is more or less solid now and her head darts left and right. \"That snaky, she was gonna eat me! Wait... she DID eat me! How, why?\" Then her eyes focus on you. \"Y... you saved me!\" she says simply, confusion on her face. Then she looks down and sees her condition; stark naked and wrapped around you. She blushes bright green and casts her eyes down. \"Um. D... did we... um... I mean. Did I... Er...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes go wide as you realize what she is thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!

You can feel her arms around you, her hands pressing against your back warmly, and you can feel yourself flushing more. A glance down reminds you that she IS still naked.

She's not reading the mood of the class she's introducing herself to, both the monsters and humans starting up a low whisper of scandalized derision in their various groups. \"This is the first time my family's been able to openly mingle with the human population, but we've actually been earthplane adjacent for several centuries and served as the inspiration for all sorts of culinary...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carries on, oblivious, and your eye's drawn back to her 'nissy' - the normalization identity sticker that, under the dictates of the Pax Terata of 2012, all newly-arrived monsters on earth need to provide on request to prove that they're conforming to law and not ready to go on a rampage against humans. The thing is, it's considered <i>really</i> bad form to wear it openly if you're a monster, and she doesn't know that yet. So all the other monsters are snickering at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat got your attention is that her nissy has a big <span class=\"cred\"><b>AC-XD</b></span> origination designator on it... Artificial Construct, Extradimensional. Does that mean her home dimension's been manufactured and isn't a naturally occurring phenomenon like every other 'dimension' you've ever heard of? You're not geeky enough to grasp all the ramifications of that, but it seems cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ms. Folger,\"  says Mr. Chatterton, the xenosociology teacher. \"That's a first-rate introduction, and I'm certain we all wish you well here at ATIC.\" He'd been charmed, which further doomed the new kid; don't ever charm the teachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's moving back your way, still not getting it... smiling and quietly greeting the other students, who mostly ignore her, roll their eyes, or respond with snide congeniality. You've got the back of the long row because you go unnoticed - does anyone even <i>know</i> there's an extra desk back here? She winds up at the end of the row next to yours, ahead and to your right. She greets you and sits down before you can do much more than pop your hand up in a quick wave. She's gregarious, but socially obtuse. And she smells nice. Hmmm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, you can see Cindi's not holding up well. She's ditched her nissy, but the light's gone out of her eyes. Artesia Teton's not her kind of town and she'd probably never in her chocolatey life figured she'd wind up attending an 'internodal comprehensive' - fancy talk for a regular high school that includes monsters, which hadn't existed when you were still in middle school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere <i>weren't</i> monsters when you were in middle school, except in games and movies and stuff. The Rupture changed all of that in a hurry, and ushered out a whole lot of humans as well. Artesia Teton had done OK, isolated without being <i>too</i> isolated, but you were still down an aunt and a few cousins. Most of the monsters who'd shown up locally seemed nice enough, and life had more or less gotten back to what it had been within a couple semesters. You hadn't thought it might be nice to have monsters around until Cindi showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd arrived as a sweet, light brown, milk chocolate and was now shading to black, utterly aloof. She'd sat cross-legged on arrival, and now had both feet primly on the floor. The indifferent bun on the back of her head with all the chocolate tufts sticking out was now serpentine, mechanical, and not a 'hair' out of place. She'd become stiff and bitter, like baking chocolate, and that's what a bad week could do to you, sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact is, you've taken an interest in Cindi since she's become an outcast. It couldn't have happened any other way, because you'd never have had a chance with someone who wasn't an untouchable. The girls don't like her because she'd come off as goofy and unconventional that first day. The guys don't like her because, well... to put it politely, even though she's naked, she's missing some interesting bits. The monsters don't like her because they don't think something that's a dessert can be a proper monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you take the direct route, passing her a note that says, simply enough, \"<b><i>I</i></b> like you!\" Not one of the great romantic lines of all time, but you think she needs something unambiguous.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the note, there's the expected awkwardness as Cindi gauges your intentions. You talk between classes, then settle on a mutual lunchtime routine, and start generally hanging out the following week. She comes over to your house and meets your mom, which is an acid test: your mom's quite friendly to Cindi and enthusiastic at your bringing a friend home, which surprises you... given that her sister and nieces were devoured by a monster a little over a year ago. Of course, excepting her constituent matter and slimy pedigree, Cindi's pretty much a regular girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindi's also becoming a regular visitor at your place after school, though she has no interest at all in video games and tends to prefer helping your mom with dinner. Odd, because as far as you know, she doesn't eat - meeting at lunch means she talks and watches <i>you</i> eat. She's an excellent cook, but there are many elements of her life that don't bear further scrutiny: what she subsists on, where she lives, her family, stuff like that. You've been wise enough to pick up on the topics she's vague about and then steer clear of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that, while she's fantastic at cooking and likely as accomplished at math (better than you, stated simply), she's terrible with written languages. You've got enough going in that department that you're actually able to help her, which feels weird; you've never been academically gifted, and the idea that you could be useful in this regard is almost shocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the day comes when you're sick of grinding through trig homework and Cindi's had her fill of Dostoyevsky, and you have to ask her something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindi, why is it that...\" you begin, having to break off and point at her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wondered when you'd bring that up,\" she says, grinning. At least she's not sensitive about it. \"Why am I not <i>complete</i>, as a human girl my age would be? Viscomorphs reproduce differently than humans, naturally, but that raises the question: since there was no placenta or umbilical cord involved in my creation, why do I have a navel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that she's not great at reading doesn't mean she's dumb. You nod, suddenly consumed with the hope that Cindi will let you touch her there. You've had some slightly more than friendly feelings toward her for the past week, but you'd been very careful to keep them concealed. Force of habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The simple answer is, it's tradition,\" she continues, noticing you're staring at her belly button. She doesn't seem to mind. \"Humans and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...choco sapiens,\" you supply, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans and <i>slimes</i> have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship for a very long time in other corners of the omniverse, and so humanoid slimes had to adopt mammalian characteristics... since humans don't usually become amorphous. It's sort of like, what do you call it... Wasmannian mimicry. Bipeds are evolutionarily more likely to become tool users, and as embarrassing as it is to admit, slimes are typically free riders, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help yourself, reaching out to give her a Pillsbury poke. She breaks off from her involved belly button explanation to draw her arms up and grin, allowing you access and giving a convincing Doughboy giggle that ends with an \"Eeeeek!\" of feigned surprise. You collapse into laughter as she regards you with a \"boys will be boys\" smile of forbearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've touched Cindi before - hesitantly at first, afraid your hand would come away covered with chocolate, which hadn't been the case - and she feels more or less like a human girl. A little warmer and a lot smoother, but not completely unfamiliar. That aside, a poke at her middle represents a more intimate form of contact than you've ever attempted before, and you're not sure how she'll take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn,\" she says, once you've composed yourself. She's smiling, but she means it. \"Untuck that shirt, Finn, so I can see where to aim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Cindi blushes, you have no way of knowing - sometimes her well-defined but molten eyes will soften out of their usually sharp detail, but she doesn't change color. You're not so lucky and, red-faced, have to flap your hand to apologize for taking the liberty of a navel-poke, suddenly too shy to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right,\" she says, not about to let you off the hook that easily. With a look of eager mischief, she starts untucking your shirt for you, which tickles. So you tickle her back, and stop at once in surprise. She's <b>ticklish</b>?! Why? More of that slimy what's-it mimicry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen follows a spirited contention never before seen in your bedroom: a tickle-wrestling bout with a girl you're not related to. You know she could trounce you if she wanted, but Cindi plays fair and behaves like a human female - with perhaps a little more strength than a girl her size would be expected to possess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly two minutes of give-and-take, your mom comes in to chide you for your rambunctiousness. Cindi has the grace to apologize, still as winded as you are (you're not sure if she actually breathes or just provides a reasonable imitation), and your mom chuckles indulgently before walking back out. Well, why not? It's not comparable to a human boy and girl in the same circumstance, where the girl might potentially get herself in trouble following a cease-fire. Of course, your mom probably wouldn't appreciate that line of reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both try to return to what you were doing, which is almost impossible; you're useless for polar conversions, and she can't focus on Raskolnikov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a secret, I've got a secret,\" you sing to Cindi at a whisper. \"Cindi Charlote's... <i>ticklish</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omigod, tell <b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">no one</font></b>!\" she responds, eyes wide as she completely unspools her hair into a finger-in-socket fright wig - before stepping out to help your mom with dinner. At least she left you laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings proceed between the two of you in much this way, with perhaps a little less roughhousing when your mom's around. In fits and starts, you enter the fuzzy territory between 'friends' and 'girlfriend/boyfriend'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith (as might be expected) the requisite complications...</span></div></div>",

He looks like Pac-Man as done by Bosch, a hovering sphere with a mouth, shiny blue metal under layers of patchy, translucent pink, organic membranous... stuff. Just big enough to swallow a good-sized human. \"From Kappa Uku, world of matter-eaters! We eat and eat and transmute matter to energy with admirable efficiency! We will solve this planet's waste and power issues!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Chatterton's not able to keep this guy chatting beyond his matter-eater pitch, and Tauber eventually floats to the back of the class on the far side of the room. He can't very well sit at a desk. There <i>are</i> classrooms that have been specially modified to accept other monstrous forms, but Tauber's the first non-humanoid monster in your x-soc period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" Cindi whispers once he's settled, smiling and waving. She still remembers her own first day and wants to provide more of a welcome than the other students managed. Tauber had been roundly ignored, but didn't seem to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice he's got small black eyes above his mouth. These blink twice as he pivots toward Cindi, rotates back, and then swivels again in a perfect double take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate girl!\" you hear him mutter to himself. It's good to know he has some voice other than that unappealing squawk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a vid today on the cultural achievements of the Stippleboom, so the lights dim to allow for forty minutes of messing about. Except it's actually interesting, and you wind up paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see something out of the corner of your eye - a long tongue of segmented blue metal is slowly projecting from Tauber's mouth, the tip of it aiming for Cindi. In good spirits these days, she's back to sitting tailor style, so the sole of her left foot is perfectly aligned for a rendezvous with Tauber's gleaming yahzick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" you start to hiss at Tauber, just as Cindi claps both hands over her mouth to stifle an explosive shriek of laughter. Without turning around, she chops her left arm in your general direction, making a furious and unmistakable gesture of \"<b>IXNAY</b>!\" You've maybe been playing intemperately on that particular weakness of hers lately, but that doesn't mean you want Pac-Man shrimping your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTauber draws his tongue back in complete silence, so quickly you don't even see it retract. Given the sudden wobbliness in what's been his otherwise uneventful levitating act, you think he must be going into raptures over the way Cindi tastes. Come to think of it, <i>you</i> haven't even gotten a chance to try that yet. You sit out the period, seething, and miss any opportunity to harsh out Tauber; he's through the door before anyone else, a sphere on a mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't <i>do</i> that in class, Finn!\" Cindi says, giving you a playful shove out in the hallway. You stumble back a little and roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't me! It was a giant metal tongue! You can't tell the difference? It was that new guy, just licking away! Licking and licking to his heart's content, the dirty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a single lick, don't exaggerate,\" Cindi says, looking thoughtful. \"No saliva, either. It <i>felt</i> like a finger, sorry. I should have known you wouldn't be that assertive with everyone else around. Maybe it's a matter-eater pleasantry, since I was the only one who was nice to him. Why haven't you ever tried it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not up for anything dirty like that!\" you mutter, cutting your eyes away as Cindi beams at you. Of course, Cindi can't get dirty if she doesn't want to; she'd told you that slimegirls reflexively manifest 'preclusive cohesion', meaning they keep other stuff from sticking to them and maintain their immaculate composition. Cindi could go dancing in a charnel house or a manure pile and still emerge squeaky clean. Well, squeaky-chocolatey. And was she actually inviting you to Taub out on her? Or... wait, was she giving you a hard time for not being nice to a new student and not talking about foot-tonguing at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindi lays off with her grin once she sees you're blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK, Finn. I know you're more into the vanilla stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can reply to that, Tauber's back. The hallway has been emptying out, and the bell rings. But the matter-eater's blocking your way, and it looks like a school librarian has affixed a projection bud to the side of his metal/membrane shell. The bud flickers on, and a holo of the Lusus Lexipendium appears before the three of you, greatly magnified. You've been studying it in x-soc, of course: a compilation of the laws governing human/monster interaction, a work in progress being tirelessly translated into all human and monster languages. Most people just call it 'The Bean'. Tauber's pointing out a particular section that seems to deal with monster/monster relations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Greek to me,\" says Cindi, shrugging. \"Or is it Latin? No, OK, that's definitely English.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, that can't be right,\" you say. But it seems to be: the relevant passage indicates that anything generally considered food on any world hosting a (the word makes no sense, but it's obviously a reference to the proper name of Tauber's race) 'matter-eater' shall be delivered upon formal request by same as remuneration pursuant to... some legalistic mumbo-jumbo referencing a treaty that's not even a year old. You know some monsters were favored more than others when humans were pretty sure their entire species was going to get gobbled up, so this must be some sort of loophole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is correct!\" Tauber squawks. \"By treaty, I claim... chocolate girl!\" His mouth clangs open and shut three times in succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, technically, she's made out of food,\" you say, feeling weird. \"But she's alive! You can't just eat a fellow sapient!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants to <i>eat</i> me?!\" Cindi says, horrified. Just as quickly, she's curious. \"I wonder what that would feel like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please submit to my completely legal appetite!\" Tauber squawks. His mouth clangs open again, and his tongue drapes out. He looks sort of dopey. A closer look, and you can tell he's smitten. That one taste of Cindi must have really gotten to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what,\" Cindi says, detaching her left leg below the knee and offering it to Tauber. It's still wiggling and kicking around, even as Cindi extrudes some more chocolate and forms a new limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you protest, seeing Cindi's old left leg land on Tauber's greedy tongue. He gobbles it right up - and then drops to the floor in a swoon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really not a big deal,\" Cindi tells you. \"I couldn't even guess how many arms and legs I've given up since I was a kid. I've even been bitten in half a few times. What's wrong with sharing, Finn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choklit,\" Tauber whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man!\" you say, stunned that this sort of thing is legally allowed. Humans have all sorts of rules of conduct they have to follow when dealing with monsters, political correctness taken to a monstrous degree. You'd never have imagined monsters were held to such low standards amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, there's the unfortunate fact that seeing Cindi's wriggling gam and tootsie gobbled up that way had... promoted an effect on you. Which Cindi had noticed with a secret smile before you noticed <i>her</i> noticing, which would have been even more embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tardy bell rings, and the two of you make tracks before Tauber recovers from his epicurean ecstasy to...</span></div></div>",

Which isn't what you had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Kimbro, there's actually very little we can do,\" she says, skimming through her own holo of The Bean while her other two sets of hands work an emery board between them with brisk efficiency. The nameplate on her desk has her as 'Roxy Grimaldi-Rossiter'. You've always had bad luck with the hyphenated surname chicks. \"While I'll agree that the language in this particular bylaw needs attention, the matter-eater is within his rights to consume your girlfriend. She <i>is</i> your girlfriend, isn't she? Aww, that's so cute! [<i>Ahem</i>] The Non-Human Liaison office can't intervene, and would certainly lose any legal challenge resulting from an attempted intervention in this matter. Our hands are tied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you reply, looking pointedly at Roxy's six arms. Monsters mostly live by the whole 'law of the jungle' concept, and it stands to reason there'd be a conflict of interest here. Roxy sighs to herself when she notices your expression.  She actually looks like a pretty hot sorority pledge from a nearby college, if you can get around the extra arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why does she have to be made out of <i>chocolate</i>, anyway?!\" Roxy asks, obviously annoyed that she can't do the right thing. You feel a little better at seeing this pang of conscience. \"She's a slimegirl - couldn't she just be made out of slime? Preferably slime that's inedible by human standards? A chocolate slimegirl... it seems like gilding the lily to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxy takes a deep breath, all six hands together in a gesture of businesslike appeasement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, even if we can't advance an official agenda, administratively... why not just get her off-campus? I'll write up a pass for both of you, and maybe this matter-eater will eat something more memorable tonight... forget all about Ms. Folger by tomorrow. Worst case, she can transfer to another school.\" Roxy brings up a display showing that Cindi and Tauber aren't anywhere near one another, presently. Hmm. You didn't know they could track all monsters on campus like that, but it makes sense. \"You can slip out before first lunch, and we'll play it by ear tomorrow morning... maybe give her a half-day study period or excuse her entirely until we come up with a resolution that <i>doesn't</i> involve her being scarfed like a Snickers bar. Is that acceptable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know what happens if you go ballistic: you're human, and Roxy's a monster, and that would cause a stir in and of itself. Your best bet is to find Cindi and get the heck out of here... so you whip up an expression of assuaged reasonability with a frosting of contrition for throwing this in Roxy's lap and distracting her from her manicure. You get a pass for yourself and Cindi and are out the door of the admin office...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...almost in time. The bell for first lunch rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's already a crowd outside the cafeteria, the noise drawing you there while you were making a beeline for Cindi's English class. Looking inside, you see Cindi go sprinting past the windows with Tauber a few paces behind. She seems to be taking it in stride, and Tauber's got something new stuck to his shell: a little bloop box putting out Pac-Man intermission music. It's almost classy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run in, fully prepared to deal with Roxy under less inviting circumstances once you do something unkind to Tauber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I talked to the NHL rep!\" you shout over the sound of the audience. Everything goes quiet, Cindi and Tauber screeching to a halt on their next circuit to look your way. You realize it's all up to you, and have to ruin a great rescue by telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... she says there's nothing she can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intermission music and shouts start back up immediately, as does the chase. Cindi's much more graceful than Tauber, the matter-eater sideswiping chairs, tables, and people in his pursuit. You decide to maybe accidentally give him a kick on the way by, and he just as accidentally chomps off half of your Severus haircut when you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a fury, you join the chase. Cindi looks back, sees you, smiles and waves. Tauber spins on his own axis, scowls, and spits your hair back in your face. You nearly stumble, but keep your feet and are gaining on Tauber when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...tiring of the chase, Tauber shoots out that metal tongue of his with the speed of a chameleon, loops it around Cindi's waist, and drags her into his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>GULP</b>! says Tauber, with a corresponding \"<i>Eeeeek</i>!\" befitting a distressed damsel from Cindi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTauber then drops out of the air and starts rolling around spastically, transported by the lusciousness of an entire chocolate slimegirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>CHOCKLIT</b>!\" he squawks, and is pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow really in a rage, you try kicking the matter-eater... who promptly rolls on his involuntary way, landing you on your ass. The crowd goes wild and, at present, no one is offering any assistance - none of the teachers, none of the other adult employees. It's monster versus monster, and there are reasons aside from legality that this isn't attracting any disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTauber has started to glow, and your heart breaks. He must have just completely disassembled Cindi and converted her to energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chock...\" he starts to squawk again, and then shimmies around violently. A rill of chocolate sauce trickles out from his linear trap, and then a gout. His mouth's being forced open by chocolatey pressure, and his glow is becoming a full gleam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help, help!\" Tauber squawks out, now clearly having trouble. More chocolate jets forth as he opens his mouth to call for assistance. He's getting unhealthily bright, but there's still no heat. No one rushes to his aid, most probably feeling that he's getting his just deserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a little more helpful, thinking Cindi might have found a way to save herself. Tauber's got a transmission port in his back, and there's a ground station over near the steam tables the lunch ladies are clustered behind. Some monsters are robots, and they need to eat lunch, too - and since it's not considered uncouth, they can dump 'dirty power' in the same area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some effort, you manage to get Tauber rolling in the right direction and seat him over the ground flap. Connections automatically mate, and Tauber's overload radiance starts dimming down at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fudge my life!\" Tauber gargles out, mournful face pointed at the ceiling. His mouth flies open, molten chocolate glurting all the way up to the sound tiles in a sticky fountain. His bloop box supplies the sound of a dead Pac-Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindi jumps out of this mess, looking pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finn!\" she squeals. \"I can't believe I did it!\" She gives you a hug that almost cracks your ribs before checking on Tauber, who looks like he'll pull through (with the matter-eater equivalent of an Alka-Seltzer). Jubilant, Cindi whirls around to pick you up, handling you as though you're not much heavier than a box kite, and charges past the lunch ladies and through the kitchen, nipping out the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's going on here?\" you ask, borne along in Cindi's superhumanly strong arms. Is this her actual strength, or something she picked up while on sabbatical in Tauber's innards? She avoids any possibility of onlookers by heading out the back parking lot and running down the middle of Atonicia Street, where there's fortunately no traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, got excited,\" she says, stopping to put you down gently on your feet. She's not out of breath, so maybe that answers a question you had several days ago. \"I should calm down, first. How long until lunch is over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call it a little over twenty four hours from now,\" you say, breaking out the pass Roxy gave you earlier and smirking. You give Cindi a quick rundown on what you'd been up to before arriving at the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Cindi shouts, hopping around in her eagerness to be somewhere else. And then she's cartwheeling around you, and then she's picked you up again and started running for...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"OK, come on, I <i>can</i> walk for myself,\" you tell Cindi. She pulls up short at Small Street, putting you down and following as you head east. Bigtooth maples lining the sidewalk are dropping the red, yellow and orange of autumn all around you. Cindi grabs a falling leaf and regards it, suddenly mum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that big of a deal,\" she says, before you can prompt her. \"Any kid should be able to do it, but I couldn't before today. So you won't get why I'm both a little excited and ashamed. When I thought Tauber was actually going to eat me, I was able to Bloom. All I had to do was generate more than he could eat at one time. It was scary, but I'm also weirdly grateful. Something so simple, but I'd never managed to get the hang of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe demonstrates by pointing with her right index finger, and an impressive jet of chocolate sprays into the gutter. Leaves boat along on the sudden stream, until Cindi snaps her fingers and the syrupy stuff promptly vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" you say, only mildly surprised. The truth is, you already thought she could do something along those lines. \"Didn't you spontaneously generate chocolate the other day when you fed Tauber your leg, though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but that got incorporated into my matrix,\" Cindi says, sounding a little pleased with herself again. \"<i>This</i> is neutral mass. It's inert - the same substance as me, except not... well, alive. It's just plain old chocolate. Better than anything you could get off the shelf - don't get me started on the state of chocolate-making you humans have going - but I can't do much with it except blast it around. You know, like fat and sugar 'bloom' out of crummy chocolate and it gets all white? Similar, but without any of the crumminess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it,\" you tell her, smiling. \"So you're a late Bloomer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groans, claps a hand to her forehead, and Blooms all over you. You weren't expecting it and almost go down. The warm, liquid weight of the stuff is nearly dragging your clothes off, and you stagger to the leaf-choked verge before collapsing, shouting over the outrage as Cindi laughs at your condition. The truth is, you don't mind much - and then mind a lot less once Cindi, still laughing, tackles you from behind and forces you all the way down. After a bit of slipping and slithering, she winds up straddling you. Needless to say, the mildly crisp September afternoon's gone decidedly sultry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kids get offa there!\" an old woman shouts from her porch. It looks like she's trying to make sense of what she's seeing, and that doesn't stop once Cindi snaps her fingers to unBloom you and the immediate area. Cindi leads you off while, waving and smiling, she apologizes to the lady for the trespass. You straighten your clothes out, stealthily realigning your equipment at the same time. The urge to pounce right back on her is nearly overwhelming, but you keep it together and walk it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finn, that was sort of fun!\" Cindi says, and you can tell she's teasing you. Of <b>course</b> it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-<i>GASP</i>-!\" you respond, flushed right to the roots of your half-haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'm sorry,\" she says, managing not to smile. \"I was all excited earlier, so I thought you could use a dose. You deserve better after all of that in the cafeteria. And, by the way... my <i>hero</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindi presses up close and gives you a lungsucker of a kiss. You've traded pecks on the cheek before now, but this is the genuine article. Your first kiss, really. Again, you're so surprised that you can't offer more than passive participation, struggling to smooch back as fervently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry again!\" she says, pulling away after several moments. \"I wanted to say thanks, but you look wound a little tight at the moment. I guess this wasn't the best place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what it's worth, Cindi, I'll be remembering Small Street a <i>long</i> time from now,\" you tell her, dots swimming at the edge of your vision. The weight of desire is smothering, but you continue your little stroll and impress Cindi with your nearly supernatural restraint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall Street is just that: only six houses long, and then you're in the Mt. Pierron shopping center. It's changed slightly since the advent of monsters being everywhere, but it's still mostly the same little place you've known off and on through the years. It's not considered trendy to get your hair cut at a strip mall barbershop, but you like that there usually aren't many other people around. And no one today, by the look of it. Seeing the 'No Shoes, No Shirt, No Service' sign, Cindi discreetly forms a duplicate of your own outfit for herself. Skipping the duster, naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Kimbro,\" says Mr. Schooley, swinging a chair around for you. He's cut your hair since you were a kid. He greets Cindi politely, but doesn't seem fazed by a cocoa slimegirl stepping into his shop. She probably could have stayed naked. Looking around, you see a lot of new equipment to handle the monster clientele. Mr. Schooley just rolled right along with the changes. His hair's gone white, but he still looks like he should be in a Cassavetes flick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you've had some trouble here,\" he says, getting the cutting cape on you after you've hung up your duster and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have a look next door,\" Cindi says, smiling and stepping out. You smile yourself and frown. What's she going to do at the beauty shop? Offer her chignon as a complimentary appetizer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell Mr. Schooley about Cindi without any leading questions from him. He carves your hard-won Snape down to a Dale Cooper after you both discuss what would look best. Since the shop stays dead during this lengthier-than-usual operation, you tip him five and give genuine thanks; taking your hairdo across fandoms like that is a procedure only Mr. Schooley could manage. You make your goodbyes and head for the beauty shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that looks pretty sharp, Mr. Kimbro,\" Cindi says from behind you. OK - it's not like she had to invest the time to actually get her hair cut, but what was she doing over there? Waiting around for her chance to sneak up on you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting a surprise, you turn around and keep it together without so much as a smirk. She's changed 'outfits' to a very short A-line dress with bloomers, frilly socks, and Mary Janes. You figure the all-day sucker is Bloom-sculpt, as is the huge hair bow. The hair itself is all sausage curls, but at least she left the bangs alone. \"People keep making fun of my hair, so I thought I'd go for something more respectable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll... certainly be set back by this makeover,\" you tell her. She looks so serious. Is she for real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a gentleman!\" she says, grinning. A snap later, and she's back to slimegirl naked - minus bow and lollipop. She <i>has</i> changed her hair, making it much simpler: a slightly longer fringe with the rest caught back in a ponytail. It looks more casual and mature now, less sculpted. The stray pops of hair from the chignon had gotten her teased, but you still secretly thought it had been sort of cool. \"If saving my life meant you had to get a haircut, I thought I should look different too. They gave me some ideas in the salon, and I liked this best. It's like a whole new us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, now, if anyone laughs... you can just Bloom them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finn, I shall not hesitate to enrobe <i>anyone</i> who teases me in the future,\" she says solemnly. And then winks. \"But seriously, I <b>am</b> going to get detention, I can feel it. I won't be able to control myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If cleanup's a snap, how are you going to get in any trouble?\" you ask, seeing it Cindi's way. There's more than a few people at school that would look great coated in chocolate! Except they're all girls, and you're not sure how Cindi would react to being encouraged in that sort of 'revenge'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only trouble I see right now is...\" Cindi begins, looking down at her toes.</span></div></div>",

They want your life that only existed for a little over 20 years to end. The question is why? Why would anyone want to kill you? What have you done wrong? Youre a good kid. You never done anything bad to nobody. Sure, you were no saint, but you dont remember doing anything so bad that it warrants murder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you shouldve never hung out with those guys. Maybe you shouldve never went to that party with them. Maybe you shouldve never had that drink since you were still technically underage. Maybe you shouldnt have looked at that oddly pale-skinned black haired girl with purple eyes weirdly as you left. Maybe you shouldve never took a look at the numbers on their foreheads. At first you thought somebody spiked the drink you had really bad... it's silly to think you could magically see numbers on people's foreheads, but now you know that those numbers had a meaning. The numbers symbolized who was next to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week afterwards, #1 Billy Graham, found dead in a gruesome car accident. A month later, #2 Will Mercer, drowned during a swim in a nearby beach. A few weeks after that, #3 Karen Phillips burnt alive after a sudden freak accident set her garage on fire. It seemed the deaths had finally FINALLY calmed down by the time you went halfway through the next semester... only to read the news that the bodies of #4 Jake Francis and #5 Miguel Santiago were found buried in the middle of a forest during a fierce winter storm. To everything else, these were just ordinary tragedies, but deep down you knew the truth. The numbers. You wanted to tell somebody, but you knew nobody would believe you. Who would? YOU wouldnt believe you. But because you kept silent, #6 Tracy Wong, the leading actress in the school's performance of Romeo &amp; Juliet met her end when the setting collapsed on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that currently remains is #7 Hunter Crane Walters, YOU.<br>\r\nMany sleepless nights pass as you feared for your untimely end. The very few dreams you have repeats of you passing by the purple eyed girl as you left the party. Over and over again. And every time you see the #7 on your forehead in the reflection of her eyes. Now you knew how the kids who were hunted down by Freddy Krueger felt. But at least THEY knew who was killing them. Plus, Freddy only hunted them in their dreams. Whoever's after you could strike regardless of whether youre asleep or awake. In fact, he/she could strike any single moment in however long a life you have left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Bzzzzzzzzzzt!* Went the alarm clock. It was FINALLY 8 in the morning. You groaned tiredly as you pressed the button on the alarm clock, wondering why you even set the alarm in the first place. You had bags around your eyes, your stomach was in knots, and mad were you groggy. You limped toward the kitchen, rubbing your head, mumbling to yourself.<br>\r\n\"Good morning!\" your mom greeted you with a smile as she set up a plate of pancakes and scrambled eggs for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M...morning,\" you grumbled as you sat down. Your mother's smile looked uneasy. You knew that she knew something was wrong, but you ignored it and started eating. Despite the pancakes tasting good, you felt like it didnt seem right you should be eating something like this. Pancakes were a good happy meal and part of a cheerful, get up and get ready to face the day, breakfast. Definitely not for you. You werent even worth a bowl of Cheerios. But for your mom, you gratefully scarfed it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you could see that uneasy look in your mom's face through the corner of your eyes. You pretended not to notice, but it was to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you feeling?\" she asked out of nowhere.<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" you quickly told her and continued eating.<br>\r\n\"Are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you nodded and looked away. It got silent for almost a minute, but then your mom continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... that girl who died,\" she spoke, \"was she a friend of yours?\"<br>\r\n\"No,\" you shook your head. 'She COULDA been,' you thought to yourself, 'if only I had warned her.'<br>\r\n\"Did you know her?\"<br>\r\n\"Not very well,\" you answered, \"we didnt talk much.\"<br>\r\n\"Too bad,\" she noted, \"she looked like a nice girl.\"  You didnt respond, you just kept eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You havent been sleeping very well, have you?\"<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" you stopped eating when she asked that question.<br>\r\n\"Your father and I noticed you seemed more tired than usual,\" she explained, \"youre not as energetic as you used to be. You dont go out as much. You've been skipping a few classes as of late.\" Figured she was gonna start with that!<br>\r\nYou shrugged hard.<br>\r\n\"Hunter, this sudden changed happened ever since that girl died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped your fork and knife. You couldnt eat another bite. \"I'm fine,\" you lied.<br>\r\n\"You dont look fine,\" she knew you were lying, \"Hunter, it's ok to be scared. These things happen.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not scared,\" you almost raise your voice.<br>\r\n\"Then why are you so panicky?\"<br>\r\n\"Mom, can we just drop this?!\" you started to get up out of your seat, but that look your mom was giving you was stubborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something bothering you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you told her, \"I gotta get going.\"<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Hunter!\" she snaps, \"we know youre upset about something! It's much worse than that girl, isnt it?\"<br>\r\nYou just took a heavy breath and that was it.<br>\r\n\"I just want to let you know,\" she tells, \"if there's something you, you can talk to me about it. I'm happy to listen. I'm just worried about you.\"<br>\r\nYoure worried about you too. You didnt know what to say. You didnt want to blow her off, but you didnt want to scare her... or make yourself look like a weirdo. But the longer you kept this a secret, the more miserable you felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can trust me, Hunter,\" she assures in that sweet tone that makes you melt, \"I'll just ask you this one last time: is there something going on that's bothering you?\"</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, you looked behind you and saw her umbrella still standing with the crowd. Great, you lost her!<br>\r\nThe moment you made it inside the cafe and slammed the door behind you, you realized how silly you've been acting just a moment ago! Come to think of it, why the heck did you run away from her? Maybe she just was just trying to be friendly. Great... now you feel like a jerk for purposely ditching that poor girl!<br>\r\n'This is why I can never make friends,' you think to yourself as you head to the register. Ever since you had a hard time sleeping, you at least developed an appreciation for caffeine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Cafe de Grande!\" the girl at the register greeted you with a phony smile. \"What can I get for you?\" <br>\r\nYou couldnt even pretend to be chipper. <br>\r\n\"Tall Mocha Mint,\" you tell her, \"extra icing.\"<br>\r\n\"Iced or hot?\"<br>\r\n\"Hot.\"<br>\r\n\"Any cream or sugar?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"<br>\r\n\"Would that be for here or to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to say 'to go' when you noticed the pale-skinned girl with the umbrella standing just outside the window! For some odd reason, you started to panic again.<br>\r\n\"For here! For here! For here!\"<br>\r\n\"Alrighty. That'll be $4.95-\"<br>\r\n\"Keep the change!\" you slapped a 5 on the table and began sneaking over to a seat... somewhere outside of the girl's view!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Your order's #7!\" you almost jumped out of your skin when she said your order number! When you finally regained your composure, you took your seat behind a tall convenient fern which definitely had you outside of the girl's potential view. Less than a minute after feeling relief, you feel regret. What if she was just trying to be nice? What if she just wanted to stop and say hi? She mustve been worried sick about the whole situation like you. She was at the same party. She saw the same people who ended up dying. What if she saw the numbers just like you?! Somebody else musta saw them... youre not crazy. Youre a dead man, but youre not crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, do you need that caffeine BAD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasant jazzy music on the radio started to get really staticy as the rain poured down even harder. The lights started to flicker a little. You felt the warmth of the heater started to wear down. Wonderful. The cafe felt just as gloomy as you do.  Normally, you'd just blame it on the piss weather, but not anymore! For all you know, everything bad that's gonna happen to you is because DEATH is following you. Hey... for all your luck, maybe your mocha mint is gonna be poisoned?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if you couldnt hold back the urge to wet yourself, guess who walks in the cafe?! YOU GUESSED IN! In came the cute pale skinned girl... her purple eyes twinkled as she shook the rain drops off her umbrella, then dusted off her black jacket and black skirt. You practically ducked under the table in hopes that she wouldnt see you! Sure, you didnt really know why, but 'WHY' didnt matter anymore? Why do you have to die? It doesnt matter... you just will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peeked a little over the table and watched her head up to the cashier at the front... ducking every time you think she's gonna turn your direction.<br>\r\nDamn it... you couldnt believe how tensed up you were feeling. Part of you felt miserable that youre trying to hide from her for no real reason, yet the other part feels something bad is up with that girl. Granted, it's not everyday you see a girl with skin THAT pale and eyes that are purple (NATURALLY purple, I mean! And you most definitely believe those arent contacts!). But you felt something deeper about this girl. Something deep down in the corner of your mind must know why you should avoid her but will not tell you why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number 7! Your order's ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh....crap. A girl at the counter called your number! You'd go up there, but that purple-eyed girl is still in the middle of giving her order!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Number 7? Your order. Number 7!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo go up there would mean revealing yourself to her. Then what? It's not that easy to run away without looking suspicious at this rate. What if she wants to talk? What if she wants to gets to know you? What if she wants-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, number 7? Tall Mocha Mint? It's ready!\"</span></div></div>",

Youre gonna be late... and you have a test today... and if the rain wasnt soaking you, everyone'll notice you already soaked yourself, so why the heck not?! You dumped your Mocha Mint in a trashcan cuz you lost your appetite and headed to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasnt a long walk to school, just an incredibly wet and cold one. You havent blinked the whole time cuz of the vision of that poor employee getting her face torn to shreds burned into your mind. She became #7. YOU were supposed to be #7! The poor girl who probably did nothing wrong and probably deserved to live even more than you took your place. It's not a crime, at least not one that could stand up in court, but you felt entirely responsible for the murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour prediction was right. Youre over 10 minutes late to class. Still, you barged into your Advanced Reading class without a care in the world. Your teacher, Mr. Hethridge turned his head to you the minute you stepped through the door... as did everybody else. Everyone saw you sweating and shivering as if you just saw a ghost... or saw somebody become one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter!\" Mr. Hethridge called, \"youre late! What kept you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spoke quiet as you panted, \"...I was questioned by the cops.\"<br>\r\nThe slightly annoyed look on Mr. Hethridge's face quickly faded, \"Why? What happened?\"<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard and lowered your head, \"I witnessed a fatal accident in a cafe near where I live.\" Normally that'd be considered an incredibly lame and incredibly sick excuse for being late to school.. but judging by the look and voice of fear and distraught on you, your teacher knew you werent lying. Your fellow students suddenly stopped writing on their scantrons and stared silently over at you, completely shocked and have no actual clue what to say at this point. You felt no need to tell them about the pale-skinned girl you thought you saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...you gonna be alright?\" Mr. Hethridge finally broke the scary moment of silence.<br>\r\nYou lightly nodded. \"Can I still take my test?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... here,\" he handed you your test sheet, \"just relax... take a breath... and take your time.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you got to your seat, pulled out your scantron and pencil and started. Despite the vision of that employee's gruesome end repeating in your mind, you werent doing very badly on the test. Just a few vocab questions and trivia on the book you were supposed to read, but nothing incredibly complicated, especially since theyre all just multiple choice. You found it odd the test suddenly skipped Question #8... eh, must be a typo on Mr. Hethridge's part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished the test faster than you expected. Maybe it was the adrenaline rush, pumping all the major blood to brain causing you process the answers so quickly. Regardless, you handed your test sheet and scantron to your teacher.<br>\r\n\"Have a safe night,\" Mr. Hethridge wishes you.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you too,\" you said back as you headed out the door. Safe night indeed. Advanced Reading is done... next is your TV Production class before youre done for the day. Unfortunately, your class finished early, so you still have over an hour of time to burn before TV Production starts. With your mind racing a mile a minute, it was gonna be a LOOOOOONG break!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quit all the afterschool clubs you used to a part of ever since Tracy Wong's death, so you were in no mood to hang out or chat with anybody. You just wanted to be in someplace quiet and comfortable and away from the rain. The only place that came to mind was the library. Without another thought, you walked into the library and found yourself a good mystery novel and sat at a table all by your lonesome while you waited for your class to start.<br>\r\nSadly, you couldnt rely on the library's clock on the wall cuz it stopped at 8!<br>\r\n\"Damnit!\" you muttered to yourself, \"somebody's messing with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around you at the other students reading quietly, working on the computers, and tutoring other students. At least you dont see that purple-eyed girl.<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Why am I still worrying about that girl?!\" you mumble to yourself. Unfortunately, you couldnt answer your own question. You literally had to think hard to find an answer, but nothing came up. Maybe you are going crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shaking that bad thought out of your head, you sighed and started reading your book. Shame you couldnt get too deep into it cuz of the tension youre already building up inside you. Apparently, the story has something to do with a guy who changed his fate where he was supposed to die but somehow survived, which ended up offending a super-natural deity and now he has a humanized persona of Death itself hunting him down and killing any and everybody that he's trying to get in contact with about the Death hunter. It made you sad. It made you feel guilty. It made you curse the author.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also made you feel tired. VERY tired. A bad side effect from not getting enough sleep for too long. As much as you didnt want to go to sleep, your body had to compensate somehow.<br>\r\nBut you still had another class to go. Not to mention that many possible nightmares that'll await you if you doze off. Maybe you shoulda had that Mocha Mint while you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you gotta get your rest. Your eyelids were getting heavy. Heck, youre starting to imagine that damn paleskinned girl sitting right in front of you! Maybe a quick nap wouldnt hurt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You froze up in absolute horror at your dean down on the floor clenching her chest with her face eternally frozen in the look of a scream. Pills were scattered all over the place as she clenched an empty medicine bottle in her other hand. You wanted to jump over the table, scream for her to be alright, perform CPR, jack the defibrillators from the nurse's office, ANYTHING... but it was all too late. Your sick, cruel wish on such an undeserving innocent woman came true. Your dean, the late Mrs. Mocherie, was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered, you twitched, you wanted to scream bloody murder but you didnt have the drive. What you have just witnessed was absolutely unreal. You knew she mighta had a heart condition, but it was this very day, this very moment, she passed on because of it. No... because of YOU. <br>\r\n'I...I'm sorry,' you mouthed as you sobbed, 'I'm so sorry... I didnt mean what I.... *sob!* Oh god... oh my god!' You fell to the ground, on your knees, gazing at the floor in shame, feeling like you were the one that murdered her as visions of her last moments flashed in your head.<br>\r\nShe tried to comfort you, she tried to console you, but you yelled at her and said 'Fuck You' right to her face when she was only trying to help. Why did you have to act like such a dick?! As much as you didnt like her, she did not deserve what she got. It was all your fault, #9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears fell down your face as you covered your face and sobbed while trying to hold back the urge to throw up. This was too much. You should have never left home today. You should have stayed in bed where all this horror could have been avoided. You cried, trying to imagine your bedroom as your own personal happy-place, away from all the horrible death...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you felt someone patting your shoulder. You lifted your head and turned it to see... that pale-skinned girl with purple eyes again!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!!\" you flinched away from her as you stared in a panic. The bitch that followed you from Day 1! Who stalked you all throughout the day! Even haunted your nightmare! Still carrying that stupid umbrella, even indoors! Could that nightmare be true?! Is this woman really Death?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe merely smiled at you, not even noticing the corpse youre also trying to keep a distance from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...STAY BACK!\" you shouted, \"DONT COME NEAR ME!!\" The girl didnt even flinch. In fact, as if to mock you, she took a step forward.<br>\r\n\"I'M WARNING YOU, STAY BACK!!\" you shouted again. She didnt show any fear as she cooly and collectively held her umbrella over her shoulder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShame you couldnt be as calm. You panicked like your life and soul were on the line, and if that nightmare was true, it probably was! You looked around for something to wield... only thing that came to mind was Mrs. Mocherie's golf club (she used to golf... used to)! You grabbed it and wielded it like a bat!<br>\r\n\"KEEP AWAY FROM ME!!\" you warned her!<br>\r\nShe just snickered as she stared at you. You couldnt believe what a fool you've been acting! Even if the nightmare was real, what good will that golf club do?! You sighed hard and dropped the club on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the girl simply turned and casually walked out. You felt like a heavy weight was dropped off your shoulders... then you turned back over to your dean and all that relief vanished in a second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, all the students in the school were evacuated, then the ambulance came to pick up the body and the police came for questioning.<br>\r\nThey questioned a few faculty members, then Mr. Mocherie would spent most of the time sobbing more than you did, and finally you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Walters, I take it?\u201d the big bald muscular blue eyed officer spoke in a light Yiddish accent. Israeli, if you had to guess. You swallowed hard, trying not to look over at Mr. Mocherie still drowning in tears and tissues, and nodded.<br>\r\n\u201cOfficer Leanansidhe,\u201d he introduced himself, \u201cif I could have a moment of your time.\u201d As if you had a choice.<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Leanansidhe asked you a few personal questions, like where are you from, what are you studying, you got any brothers or sisters, you got a girlfriend nearby... for some reason, that question made your blood run cold.<br>\r\nFinally, he got to the point.<br>\r\n\u201cHow well have you known Mrs. Virginia Mocherie?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe was our school dean,\u201d you told her, \u201chad a few conferences with her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou were reported speaking with her last before her demise,\u201d Mr. Leanansidhe noted, \u201cis this true?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you two talking about?\u201d Your heart broke thinking about what you two were talking about.<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes and clenched your fists, damning yourself for what you said to her. \u201cShe wanted to know if I was doing alright since\u2026 the uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe last two fatal incidences?\u201d Mr. Leanansidhe looked through his notes.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you answered, \u201cthe woman was only trying to help, but I yelled at her and told her to get off my back.\u201d He scribbled notes as you continued. \u201cWhen I rushed into her office to make up for what I said to her, I found her on the ground.\u201d The cop hmphed and continued scribbled for a little while. You hated the silence, but it was a break from answering the soul-cutting questions and it didnt last long enough<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am understanding that this is perhaps the 3rd fatal accident you have witnessed throughout this week alone?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d was your only answer.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you by chance believe that these incidences are coincidental?\u201d<br>\r\nYou had to think about an answer for almost a minute. Despite the threat you\u2019ve gotten from that girl in your dream, you felt obligated to be honest.<br>\r\n\u201cI dont anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNeither do I,\u201d you lifted your head up when you that comment come from him. He continued scribbling on his notepad like it was no big deal, but you know what you heard. You just dont know what he meant by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...STAY BACK!! DONT COME NEAR ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the corner of your eye, you saw the other cops taking a look at the footage from the surveillance camera on one of their tvs. It was humiliating watching yourself shiver and shake desperately in front of a dead body.<br>\r\n\"I'M WARNING YOU, STAY BACK!!\" you saw yourself shouted to the g... to nobody?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the part where the pale-skinned girl stepped up toward you, but you dont see her on the video! The very spot you remember her standing in was empty!  You wielding a golf club at nobody. You were scared witless at air! This was just like what happened at the cafe! Nobody there saw the girl either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream out to the cops that there was someone in the room with you! You werent flipping out at nothing! You know what you saw... dont you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a girl there, wasnt there?! Youre not going crazy... are you?!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sure, youre gonna look weird trying to talk to your mom about a girlish embodiment of death being responsible for the fatal incidents that have been occurring recently, but youre already in an off state of mind, so what worse will this do?<br>\r\nYou know that SHE wont be happy about you telling somebody else about her, but she can more than happily take it out on you for it. You're gonna need to confront her and her sisters sooner or later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... mom?\" you swallowed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" she seemed just as nervous as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thinking of the right way to word it. It was difficult to say it. You couldnt just flat out say 'A purple eyed girl that represents death has been stalking me', you have to WORK up to it. 'Just take it one step at a time,' you tell yourself. Start slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been uh... seeing someone... lately...\" Not exactly the BEST way to start, but you were working on a merciless timer!<br>\r\nSure enough, that interested your mother. \"What's her name?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont know,\" you answer. She started looking at you strangely.<br>\r\n\"You never learned her name? You've been seeing her lately, yet you never bothered to learn her name?\"<br>\r\nYou shook your head, \"Nope.\"<br>\r\n\"Why havent you?\"<br>\r\n\"She never told me her name,\" was the only sensible answer you could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... is she nice?\" good question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought she was.\" Honest answer.<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"<br>\r\nFinally, you thought of the perfect way to word this situation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was awful fixated on the people that were dying lately,\" you tell her, \"ever since I met her at the party a couple of months ago-\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, the one where you met those kids who died?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you continue the explanation, \"since then, she hasnt gotten off the subject of death. She's really starting to scare me. And now after Tracey died, she's been popping up more often. Today, she followed me at the cafe. I even seen her at the library before seeing Mrs. Mocherie. Hell, I'm having trouble sleeping cuz I'm seeing her in my nightmares!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother got real worried. Then again, she is your mother, so she'd have to be. \"Do you think she's stalking you?\"<br>\r\nYou nodded strongly. She was silent for about a minute or two, probably in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she took a deep breath and pulled a little card out of her pocket.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should talk to Officer Leanansidhe about it,\" she suggested, \"he was asking for you earlier, but I didnt let him in because he seemed to get a little too personal about you.\" You looked at the card. Mr. Leanansidhe's business card. That cop who was questioning you earlier. He seemed pretty odd himself. Odd.. just like you. Maybe he's odd enough to listen to a crazy tale regarding Lady Death. \"He insisted that you call him right away as soon as you can. You dont have to, but... if this girl is stalking you, you never wanna wait until it's too late.\" She's got a point. No point in hesitating if that pale skinned girl and her sister's are probably just gonna kill you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it,\" you tell her, \"I'm glad we had this talk.\"<br>\r\n\"Like I said,\" she said, \"I'm here to listen if you need me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and headed back to your room. It felt good to get finally get that off your shoulders. Sure, it wasnt the WHOLE truth, but you can reveal the rest bit by bit. One step at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way back to the room, you kept staring at Officer Leanansidhe's card. You wrestled around the thought of calling him. You know you need to call him, but you know you need to keep your mouth shut. All the while, you stared at the phone number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Swipe!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it got swiped out of your hands! The rude thief was none other than that pale skinned purple-eyed stalker of yours! Your eyes widened in terror as she glared at you. Her playful smile was gone. What was left behind was a rather irritated glare.<br>\r\nShe then whipped out a pair of scissors and cut the card into little pieces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, THAT-!!!\" you immediately shut up when pinned you against the wall with her scissors! They looked like plain ordinary scissors, but after seeing what her umbrella really was, you dare not take the chances with her scissors. That's when you remembered... DEATH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Crane Walters,\" she spoke in a snooty tone, \"were you blabbing about me after I specifically told you not to?\"<br>\r\nYou wanted to smart off at the bitch, but because this death is the Reaper, you kept your mouth shut, too afraid to say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guilty silence, eh?\" she tilted her head, still glaring, \"wonderful. Even after I pulled so many strings to save your life. TWICE! THIS is how you repay me?!\"<br>\r\nYou still stared in silence, not taking any chances with her scissors.<br>\r\n\"Your fate was to die today, Hunter,\" she said, \"it not for me, it'd be YOUR face ripped to shreds by an exploding expresso maker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I have to die in the first place?\" you finally mustered the courage to ask.<br>\r\n\"I said it was FATE, you moron!\" she snapped, \"you dont have much of a life to live anyway. What kind of future do you think you could have if you dont even have the backbone to handle the deaths a few strangers you met in a stupid stoner party?!\" Geez, harsh!<br>\r\nDespite her words cutting you like a knife, she lowered her scissors from your throat. You felt a LITTLE less helpless now that you werent being threatened with a weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm giving you the opportunity to be useful,\" she insisted, \"a nice little secret assistant to Death. An undercover reconnaissance agent fingering out those who are next in line to get whacked. Who wouldnt love such an opportunity?\"<br>\r\n\"I certainly wouldnt!\" you almost raise your voice, \"you expect me to live with the guilt that two people died because they unwillingly took my place in line?!\"<br>\r\n\"You'll get over it,\" she shrugged.<br>\r\n\"How do you expect me to get over it?!\" you resisted the urge to raise your voice again, \"I havent had a goodnight sleep for over a while cuz of the crap that's been going on! Youre telling me I'll get used to it?!\"<br>\r\n\"I dont like your attitude,\" your angry responses displeased her, \"you dont seem to know quite well who the hell youre talking to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I dont,\" you tell her, \"you go through this whole episode of threatening me to keep quiet and I never even got to know your name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just tsked, \"My NAME?! What is it with you silly humans? The only species that requires names to tell others apart cuz youre too damn curious for your own good?\" You raised your eyebrow as she continued, \"My kind have no names. We have no use for them.\" She then smirked at you,  \"But you know what? YOURE the inquisitive human. Why dont YOU give me a name?!\" She's letting you name her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had one good name pop in your mind instantly, but you were gonna get tired of calling her 'Cunt'. Nah, you'd rather be crafty with her name. A name is supposed to be a symbol for the individual who has it. Your life as you know it can vary depending on what your name is. What kind of name could suit HER?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mentioned she had sisters... she talked quite a bit about faith... scissors... death...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atropos,\" you name her.<br>\r\nSure enough, her purple eyes brightened as her smirk got wider!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atropos!\" she giggled, \"Like the Moirai! The Sisters of Fate! The last one in line that wields the thread of life... the one who ends a mortal's life by CUTTING that thread! Hahah! I like it!\" She even gave you a thumbs up! Nice to see she appreciates it, at least.<br>\r\nShe patted your cheek and squinted her eyes as she smiled, \"I'll be sure to repay your generosity soon. Provided you dont try to screw me over. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some important business to attend to. I'll be seeing you REAL soon, Hunter!\" And with that, Atropos walked out, humming a chilling tune as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you stopped feeling her chilling aura in the air, you looked down at the cut up pieces of what used to be Officer Leanansidhe's card. Now youre even more terrified to call him. Now that you gave Ms. Death a name, she's probably gonna watch you like a hawk even more than ever. But if you keep silent, who knows who else is gonna fall victim to Atropos?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being in little pieces, you could still piece together the phone number on the card. Question is, do you dare?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nobody's there. The parking lot's empty except for a few cop cars. You see yellow tape and police signs posted everywhere. Police officers were standing outside chatting amongst themselves out in the open.Suffice to say school was closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sir,\" one of the cops approached you, \"school's closed. Move along.\" You knew why they were there. You knew what's going on.<br>\r\n\"Is this about what happened to the dean,\" you asked, despite already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n\"Not authorized to say,\" he replied, \"please leave.\" You knew when you werent wanted. You nodded and turned around, heading off, wondering when the next bus'll arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" but then you heard a policewoman stop you short, \"he's one of the main eye-witnesses! Take him to Leanansidhe!\" Aw crap. Shoulda known you werent gonna get away that easy.<br>\r\n\"Him? But why would he need to-\"<br>\r\n\"You heard the guy! Just do it!\"<br>\r\n\"Alright fine! Come with me, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as your stomach was in knots, \"Yes sir.\" You swallowed hard and desperately held back the urge to throw up from all the adrenaline pumping as the cop escorted you toward the major crime scene. Just remember it made you pale. Especially the last words you said to the dean before she died. The weight of the whole world as you know it probably rests on your shoulders now.<br>\r\nIt was a long walk through the campus. Long and lonely, not counting the cop escorting you. And sadly he wasnt much of a talker. Good reason for that. The only conversation through the long he ever brought up was: \"So... is it true that you really witnessed a espresso maker blowing up in a girl's face on the same day?\"<br>\r\nYou could only reply by taking a cold deep breath.<br>\r\n\"Oh right... uh... sorry,\" at least he immediately apologized. You just pretending you didnt hear anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, just to be on the safe side, you secretly scouted around in case Atropos was watching. You havent seen her so far, but you dare not relax yet. That bitch couldnt be far. You are a useful enough tool to her and her sisters whom you might as well name Clotho and Lachesis. Than again, she could have more than 2 sisters. Hell, she could have TONS of sisters... each with the exact same goal in mind: Make People Die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Leanansidhe, sir!\" your escort announced to the familiar officer chatting with a tall shady looking guy in a black leather trenchcoat, \"your eye-witness is back.\"<br>\r\nOfficer Leanansidhe turned his attention to you in a bit of surprise as his 'friend' just stared at you with a non-chalant frown.<br>\r\n\"Mr. Walters!\" he shouted then turned to the other cop, \"thank you. Return to your post.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" he said and walked off... leaving just you, Leanansidhe, and the sharp dressed man. You looked over and examined the long-brown haired, slightly bearded stranger close. He looked about twice your age and the light scars on his face didnt fail to show it. Oh man, he's carrying a big ol' wooden crucifix strapped to his back! He stared into your soul with dark brown piercing eyelids as he smoked his cigarette. You even saw the letters 'H' 'A' 'W' and 'K' tatooed on his fingers. He had quite a strong aura about him, too. Warming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Walters, you havent called,\" the officer said, \"I was starting to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... needed to be alone,\" was the best excuse you could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" he asked you, \"did you managed to get sleep last night.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" you answer.<br>\r\n\"No he aint,\" the stranger spoke up in a deep, low voice that demanded authority, \"he's obviously shaken up.\" He's also a damn good observer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and nodded, \"Yeah, I'm shaken up. I'm not even sure I should be here right now.\" Damn... the cop's friend is good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a good thing you are,\" the cop assured you, \"because we're going to need your help.\" YOUR help?! What kind of help could you offer other than a quick and easy way to soil pants?!<br>\r\n\"I'm... not sure how I can-\"<br>\r\n\"Sure ya do,\" the second guy quickly interrupts, \"you just dont want cuz youre too shaken up.\" You only met him for about a minute and already youre sick of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Mr. Walters, I would like to introduce you to a distant associate of mine. This is Hunter Hawk Huntersen, of Hunter H Huntersen &amp; Ted Incorporated.\" Ah, his name is your name too. Shame first names are the only thing you two have in common, \"It's an underground organization of... uh... well... it's kind of hard to explain-\"<br>\r\n\"We're Demon Hunters!\" the other guy interrupted Mr. Leanansidhe, \"what's hard to explain about that? Dragons, wizards, vampires, fairies, you name it, I skinned at least one of those little fuckers.\" Demon Hunters? Wow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youre... serious?\" you looked at the cop strangely, \"you guys hired a... demon hunter to investigate a fatal accident?\"<br>\r\n\"No,\" Mr. Leanansidhe answered, \"I did.\"<br>\r\n\"Think of me as an investigator of paranormal activity,\" Hunter said, \"only without all the Hollywood cameras and commercial sponsors.\" Wow. You'd find it silly enough that a police force would put a ghost whisperer on a case as tragic as this, but a DEMON HUNTER? A hunter of demons? Mythological creatures that existed only in fairy tales, tv, and your dad's old adventure novels?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I er... think I should be heading home.\"<br>\r\n\"The next bus headed back to your home aint for another couple hours,\" damn that Hunter, \"I have a gut feeling the Good Lord wants you to stay too.\" Oh and he's one of THOSE types, too. If he's gonna preach to you, he could at least be holding a bible instead of a flask!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeanansidhe sighed, \"Listen. Remember when you told me you did not think those previous deaths were coincidental and I said neither do I?\" You nodded, so he continues, \"Mr. Huntersen and I strongly believe there might be something... supernatural involved.\" He couldnt be more right. But it's not like you could just say 'YEP! IT'S A REAPER!'<br>\r\n\"A kind of supernatural I'm way too familiar with,\" Hunter shrugged, \"someone's messing with the balance of life and death. And youre the little tool caught in the middle of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you met this guy BEFORE the experience at the party, you'd say this guy's a loony. But NOW that youre experiencing what youre experiencing, he hit the nail right on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Huntersen and I have been involved in particular odd cases such as this in the past,\" Leanansidhe said, \"I know something like this is hard to believe, but-\"<br>\r\n\"Oh cut the crap, Noland,\" Hunter once AGAIN interrupts, \"we know the kid believes it. Look at him. He's almost as pale as a reaper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nREAPER?!! No no no no. Calm down. Take a breath. Relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what youre talking about,\" you boldly lie, \"and I dont really have to play with your Van Helsing cosplaying friend, officer.\"<br>\r\nHunter just chuckled. \"So youre gonna deny it then? Alright,\" he then leaned down at you and stared you deep in the eye, \"look me right in the eye.\" He pointed to his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo humor him, you did what he sai... #10?! You see the number 10 on your forehead in the reflection! Oh crap! Somebody else is gonna die in your place again!<br>\r\nYou checked the cop's forehead and then Mr. Helsing's. Neither of them have 9 on their forehead. You looked around to the other cops a ways away... you dont see a 9 on them either! Damn it, who has the 9?! You gotta find them! You gotta warn them! You gotta save them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you panicked, Noland stared at you with even more concern as Mr. Huntersen smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Mr. Walters,\" Hunter said, \"what did you see?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The other Hunter stood right in front of you and faced Atropos, as if trying to protect you from her. The big bad soldier of faith casually smoked his cigarette as the Reapette glared daggers at him. All this time, you were too busy soaking in the thought that your mother became the next to die. Even though nothing was negotiated, that was NOT part of the deal! Not only did she not deserve to die, you would rather take her place instead of her! Little Miss Death has gone too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Atropos still hasnt gotten over wanting to wipe you out. The longer Hunter stood in front of you like a human shield, the more impatient she got.<br>\r\n\"I wont tell you again,\" her voice was cold as she ordered Mr. Huntersen, \"move out of the way. NOW.\"<br>\r\nMr. Huntersen just shook his head and said, \"Cant do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtropos tsked. \"Fine... then he's #11!\" And like a bat out of hell, she leaped at Hunter at mach speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KLLIIINKKK!!*<br>\r\nHer giant scissor blades collided with Hunter's wooden cross that he was holding like a sword! Actually, the wooden cross broke into pieces revealing, in fact, a sword hidden within it! Creative method for concealing your weapon. Atropos gritted her teeth just before leaping back to dodge a swipe from Hunter's sword!<br>\r\nGreat, she's agile too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Hunter was fast, too. With each swing of Atropos's blades, he was quick to block and repel each swing with his sword. You kept a distance from the two, cuz Hunter would literally jump and sway whenever Atropos tries to get cheap shots at his legs!  Atropos was also quick on her feet and flexible enough to swing her head back when Mr. Huntersen tried chopping her pretty head off! In only seconds it felt like they both took a hundred swings at one another. You assumed their movement wasnt human. Well, of course not Atropos, being Death and all, but Mr. Huntersen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAAH!!\" with a good quick swing, your guardian angel knocked one of the blades out of her hand! Her purple eyes widened as Hunter shrugged his arms and grinned.<br>\r\n\"Look, we all know what's gonna happen at this point\" he warned her, \"I knock the other one out of your hand, you whine about how this isnt part of fate, I stab your heart out, then I take the boy. Or you can just turn around tell all your little sisters to play nice from now on!\"<br>\r\nThe purple eyed girl growled... a fearsome beastly growl. The purple eyelids enlarged abnormally wide. Her toothy glare revealed odd-shapped fangs that looked less unusual on a sabertooth tiger than a human!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YoU gOdDaMn <b>DOG!!!</b>\" her voice sounded ungodly, \"I wILL nOt LeT yOu RuIn My <b>DESTINY!!!!</b>\"<br>\r\nHuntersen didnt even flinch. He still casual smoke his cigarette and remarked, \"Silly brat. Everyone knows we make our own destiny. Mine's just better than yours!\"<br>\r\nAtropos's monstrous glare turned into a monstrous grin, \"OhHhHh?!\" she dropped the other blade, \"I dIdNt ThInK sOmEoNe WoUlD tHiNk So HiGhLy oF bEcOmInG gHoUl-ChOw?\"<br>\r\nOh crap. That wiped the grin off Hunter's face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a shadowy set of jaws appeared from the darkened floor below Hunter's feet and engulfed his foot!<br>\r\n\"Arggh!!\" He struggled for a little bit, then ANOTHER set of jaws clamped down on his other foot! \"GYAADD!!\" he shouted when another set of jaws appeared behind him and clamped down on his pony-tail! Then another set of jaws clamped on his arm, causing him to drop his sword as he flinched in pain! Damn, he's defenseless!<br>\r\nAtropos's eyes narrowed to normal and her mouth regained normal shaped as she giggled at his misery, \"Heheheh... must suck when your God's protection doesnt have a long-distance plan, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to run, but after seeing that guy stand up for you like that, you'd never forgive yourself if you just leave him to die. Against common sense, a surge of adrenaline pumped into you, coaxing you to save your new pal! Fortunately, you see Atropos's scythe on the ground! Bad move of her to leave it unwatched!<br>\r\nYou pick up the scythe, slowly creep up behind her, say a brief silent pray, and take a swing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Woosh!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly shit, it went right through her! No effect!<br>\r\nEven worse, she turned around to you! You gulped hard as she gave you a slightly angry frown.<br>\r\nShe stepped up to you, swiped her scythe right out of your hand like it was nothing, and slapped you in the face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aagh!!\" man, did it hurt. It wasnt superhuman, but it was pretty agonizing. Not to mention humilating! That simple bitch slap knocked you on your ass.<br>\r\nAs it your pride couldnt be hurt worse, Atropos was looking down at you with that slightly angry expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I almost forgot about the little snitch,\" she snapped her fingers, causing a giant set of toothy jaws to emit from the ground below you and clamp down on your legs!<br>\r\n\"AAHHH!!\" you screamed as it swallowed and immediately engulfed your lower torso in seconds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crane! Hang in there!\" Huntersen called out to you... by your middle name?! How did he know your middle name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna have a nice long talk,\" Atropos warned, \"as soon as #9's out of the picture.\" #9!!<br>\r\n\"Grr!! ARGGH!!!\" you struggled against the jaws after hearing that number, \"I WILL NOT LET YOU HURT MY MOM!\"<br>\r\n\"You dont even need her!\" she snapped, \"your dad's gonna be fine on his own. He makes more than enough money to support the both of you!\" Man was that enfuriating you! Who the hell was she to tell you you didnt need your mom?! \"Besides, you already have a wonderful career in which the payout is far more valuable than money!\"<br>\r\n\"I... DONT... WANT... THIS JOB!!!\" you roared as you continued fighting the jaws of death!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer purple eyes widened and stared deeply into yours, \"You WILL want it.\" Her voice almost sounded as cold as her beastlike one was earlier, \"I will make you want it. Even if I have your break you apart... and rebuild you, you will willingly accept this destiny!\" What does she mean by that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd where did that flash bang come from? OHCRAPQUICKCOVERYOUREYESANDEARS!! You'll never forget the last image you saw before covering your eyes and ears: the surprised look on Atropos's face as the flash bang dropped in front of her feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a wind shattering pop and saw a nearly blinding white flash! You felt the jaws clamping down on you suddenly vanish. Your ears were ringing, blocking out almost all sound except the faint shriek coming from Atropos as she desperately tried to shield her eyes!  You assume that flash bang came from Officer Leanansidhe, fashionably late for the party! Youre pretty sure those things arent police protocol, but it saved the day and that's all that matters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoland was trying to scream something to you as he helped Huntersen up, but you couldnt hear him. It didnt matter much anyway, cuz something else caught your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the blur cleared, you could see an image in the middle of the darkness. You could see your mom's car driving down a highway in the middle of fog and rain! Good, she's still alive! There's still time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not long. An image flashed of your mom trying desperately to look through the fog. She probably cant see in front of her with all that fog. That's a major problem, because another image flashed... the car's heading straight toward a bridge just over a cliff... and the bridge is out! She's gonna drive right off it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldnt even hear your own voice shouting 'MOM! STOP!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now or never! You had to go over there and stop her! You got up and started running toward the flashing image!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh No YoU <b>DOOONNTTT!!!</b>\" you clearly heard Atropos's beastly shriek behind you! The darkness became consuming the image as if trying to trap you in! <br>\r\nYoure racing against the clock! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to move fast or the next time you see your mother will be at the morgue... to identify the body.</span></div></div>",

Both your mom's and yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter even, the first thing you see when you open your eyes was Mr. Huntersen staring down at you with that cold serious look that'll no doubt become engraved in your memory. Opposite of him was that cop that quite possibly risked his badge to save both your lives, Officer Noland Leanansidhe. You even saw a third face looking down at you. A girl's. She looked as young as you. Blonde hair, green eyes, slightly freckly cheeks, and a look of sheer nervousness. She had a cop's uniform on, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, he's awake,\" you heard Hunter say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FREEZE! HANDS IN THE AIR!!\" Holy crap! The girl pulled a gun on you! You almost screamed in fright when Noland cut in!<br>\r\n\"No! Lydia! Stop!\" he forced her gun arm down, \"that is NOT protocol! He just woke from unconsciousness!\"<br>\r\nThe girl blushed and squinted nervous, \"S...sorry, dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Huntersen didnt look as lenient as his partner, \"Noland... why in the hell did you bring her with us? This was supposed to be just us!\"<br>\r\n\"Mr. Huntersen, she is still my daughter AND my trainee,\" Noland answered, \"I want her to be prepared for the catastrophe ahead just like I will.\"<br>\r\nHunter grunted, \"The less she knows, the better! You'll only endanger her if she learns too much!\"<br>\r\n\"Theyre going to hunt down my family sooner or later!\" Noland snapped back, \"the least I can do is make sure my child at least gets a chance to protect herself.\"<br>\r\nHunter just shook his head and muttered, \"Damn fool...\" before taking out a little flask from his jacket and taking a swig, \"...damn fool...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! My dad is not a damn fool!\" the girl snapped at the big lug, \"it's cuz of him, you and whatshisface are still alive long enough to argue about it!\" Girl looks pretty nervous, but she's got spunk.<br>\r\nHunter just stared coldly at her, \"He has a name, woman. I would suggest you show it some respect.\"<br>\r\n\"And I would suggest you show Lydia some respect!\" said Noland, \"I am not paying you to show lip to my flesh and blood!\" Ok, you heard enough. You got more important matters to deal with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" you speak up as all eyes were on you. You stand up and ask, \"Where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive us, Mr. Walters,\" Mr. Leanansidhe answered, \"youre in my office. Purgatory City Police Department. We feared the worst when you suddenly disappeared last night. This morning, a few of my boys found you unconscious in the middle of a church fountain.\" Found at a church. How quaint. \"Oh... perhaps I should introduce you. Er... this is my daughter, Lydia. Lydia, this Hunter Crane Walters.\" Lydia looked at you nervously, as if she wasnt used to meeting new people.<br>\r\nStill, being a guy (who's being stalked by the Reaper!), you politely extend your hand to her, \"Nice to meet you, Lydia.\"<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too,\" she extended her hand... only to realize she still had the gun in it! \"Oops!\" she quickly put it back in her holster and shook your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youre supposed to put the safety on,\" Hunter raised his voice a little.<br>\r\nLydia's face went red, \"Oh...r...right!\" she quickly put the safety on and put it back in the holster! Poor girl's gonna shoot herself in the foot one day... or shoot somebody ELSE's foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Huntersen,\" Noland decided to change the subject, \"enlighten him regarding the threat that we are up against.\"<br>\r\nHunter took a sharp look at Lydia, who returned her look with an angry glare, but then spoke, \"I wanted to tell you this sooner, but 'fate' apparently didnt leave much time. That thing that attacked you last night was a personification of a Reaper.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" you told him, \"she... it already explained it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo she didn\u2019t,\u201d Hunter once again knew better, \u201cotherwise, you\u2019d be a lot more confused and terrified than you are now.\u201d Oh\u2026 crap. Do you even WANT to know more about Atropos now?! \u201cI hope you and little miss rookie over there are ready for a history lesson.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m more than ready!\u201d Lydia boldly stated, \u201cA Leanansidhe never backs down from a challenge!\u201d<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t think Mr. Huntersen cared about what she thought. He had his full attention on YOU.<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I aint gonna lie,\" he started sweating, \"Reapers are a bitch to deal with. There an even bigger bitch to get rid of. The rules of life and death dont really apply to these things, because technically they ARE death. Not zombies, not ghosts, not even fallen angels... if anything, they're probably classed closer to locusts.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLocusts?\u201d Bugs?<br>\r\n\u201cNot the grasshoppers,\u201d he explained, \u201cthe biblical Locusts. The ones that crawl out of Abaddon\u2019s bottomless pit. Book Revelations.\u201d You probably dont wanna look up that passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReapers are more legion than individual,\u201d Hunter put up more detail, \u201csimilar to bees, they gather in colonies composed of pretty much clones of one another. The major bulk of them are practically soulless drones that act on command of the older alphas that actually HAVE a personality.\u201d Oh\u2026 so Atropos\u2019s little sisters are basically carbon copies that do what the big sis\u2019s command. That got you thinking\u2026 what if those times Atropos popped up to visit you werent the same girl? Maybe the other Atropi that followed you were her little sisters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike a legion?\u201d Lydia asserted, \u201cmy name is Death and we are many.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat would probably be the best way to describe her,\u201d Noland responded, then added, \u201cthem.\u201d Huntersen was right. You are more confused and terrified than ever. You dont have one crazed lady death in your life to worry about. You didnt even have a few crazed lady deaths. You had an ENDLESS amount! But something doesnt add up. Too many questions remain unanswered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen\u2026 how come it wasnt until recently that I started seeing her?\u201d you asked, \u201cand how come it wasnt until recently that I started seeing numbers on people\u2019s heads? And how come WE can see her but nobody else can?! And why\u2026 why am I involved in this mess in the first place?\u201d<br>\r\nSadly, Huntersen remained silent. The big walking talking demon dictionary had nothing to say!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we're still trying to find out,\" Noland humbly answered. It was an answer you didnt want to hear, but it was the answer. The mystery of Atropos continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran your hand across your face then through your hair trying to soak all the bad news you've heard so far in. There was nothing you could say. You felt determined to say something, but nothing came to mind. Nothing to do, but gaze out the window and watch the rain fall... and gaze at the girl with the umbrella standing on a rooftop, purple eyes still staring into your soul. Question is, which girl is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Riiiiing!* Just then, the office's phone rang. Noland answered it. <br>\r\n\"Hello? ...I see. We'll be right on it. See you there.\" And then he hangs up the phone and looks toward Mr. Huntersen, \"...I'm going to need your help with this one.\"<br>\r\n\"Gonna cost you extra,\" Hunter said.<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll write you a check,\" Noland shrugged, \"Lydia, would you mind watching Mr. Walters while we're gone?\"<br>\r\n\"C-Cant I come with you?\" Lydia asked, \"I mean, I think I trained well enough! I'm more than ready to go on a mission with you!\"<br>\r\n\"Learn to carry a gun properly and we'll talk,\" Huntersen remarked as he lit up another cigarette. Lydia flashed him a glare, but her dad intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you here with Mr. Walters,\" Noland told his daughter, \"I need you to watch him while I'm gone. Can I trust you to do this?\"<br>\r\n\"But... but I-\"<br>\r\n\"Can I trust you to do this?\" he repeats himself. Lydia's face gets a bit red, but nods. \"Good. Shouldnt be long. This way, Mr. Huntersen.\" And in a flash, the two were out the door, leaving only you and Lydia. Didnt know how long you were gonna be here. You were getting homesick, but you knew this was for the best. At least the reapers turned their attention away from your family... for now at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Atropos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?!\" you almost jumped when you heard somebody ELSE say the name of that alpha stalker! You turned your head back to Lydia, who no doubt had a look of intrigue and curiosity on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you mumbling that name in your sleep,\" she said, \"who's Atropos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap... Ms. Rookie here heard you calling the reaper by her name. Should you tell her?</span></div></div>",

Crane.\"<br>\r\nOh crap... that's Lydia's voice!<br>\r\n\"Lydia!\" Noland recognized her voice too, \"are you alright?! Where are you?!\"<br>\r\n\"Give me...

Fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter ushered his head to you, \"You better give the phone to Crane.\" Noland shrugged, but handed the phone to you. Question is what could you say to her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lydia? It's me,\" you tried to sound calm, even though you were almost as scared shiteless as Noland!<br>\r\n\"Alone...\" she spoke like she was in a trance, \"you alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick! We have to trace the call!\"<br>\r\n\"Why? I dont think we can just DRIVE down to Hell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored Huntersen and Leanansidhe and tried to continue with Lydia. No, it was clear you werent talking to Lydia anymore.<br>\r\n\"What do you want? What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n\"Come alone...\" Lydia spoke, \"no one else.\" Figures Atropos's family would want to meet you by yourself! <br>\r\n\"Where do you want to meet?\" you had to ask. Both Huntersen and Noland leaned in to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where we... first met...\" she gave you such a loose answer! Yet, you were incredibly quick to decipher it. Where you and Atropos (at least you assume it was her) first met. Doesnt really mean anything to the other two, cuz technically you never told them where you two met.<br>\r\n\"Come alone. No one else.. or mother eats her.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait! How do I get there?! Where-\"<br>\r\n*Click!* *Beeeeeeeeppp.* Too late. She hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you two first meet?!\" Noland was quick to question you.<br>\r\n\"Do you have a map?\"<br>\r\n\"Here!\" he handed you a map, \"now tell me!\" As much as you wanted to tell him, the walls had ears. No doubt she's still listening in. For his sake and his daughter's, you had to keep it a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you regretfully tell him, \"I dont wanna risk your daughter's life.\" Too bad he wouldnt take no for an answer.<br>\r\n\"You have to tell me!\" he ordered, \"I cant just leave her behind!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry... I need to go.\"<br>\r\n\"ANSWER ME NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noland!\" Huntersen once again intervened! He grabbed Noland's shoulder. Noland was about to pry it off, but one quick look in his eyes and a moment of silence made him give up instantly. Deep down, he knew he couldnt risk startling the Reapers.<br>\r\n\"Beat it, kid!\" Huntersen told you as Noland lowered his head, trying to hide the tears.<br>\r\n\"I'll save her, I promise!\" you gave him what was clearly an empty promise before rushing out of the office. They didnt follow behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the map as you followed the directions on getting there. Fortunately for you, the police department wasnt very far from that little frat house that started your whole adventure. You only had to pass a few traffic lights and one unfamiliar neighborhood, and judging by the rain suddenly starting up again, it looked like you were on the right track. The atmosphere was getting gloomier, you saw less and less people around, more barren empty houses, and eerie quiet besides the sound of the rain drops. DEFINITELY on the right track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there it was. The frat house. Or what used to be the frat house. Seemed like only yesterday that it was packed full of people, ranting and raving and cranking loud music and smoking all kinds of unsmokeable substances! Now it's ruined. The paint's worn out, the windows smashed and barricaded, graffiti all across the walls, old yellow police taped left all over the grass, toilet paper hung up on the tree, and several cigarettes and beer bottles left behind on the ground and an realtor ad STILL hung up on the garage door.. After the incidences began, NOBODY would want to hang out at this place anymore. Prices slashed to the point where realtors would lose money trying to sell it and no takers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked around the pile of leftover trash and put your hand on the knob. Sure enough, the door was opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the inside looked even worse than outside. The whole place was trashed. Couch torn to shreds all across the room, tv smashed in with a lamp, the place reeked of expired booze, the carpet was STILL wet and sticky, and ants were crawling toward the rotten beef you see in the kitchen. Dreadful. Nobody ever bothered to clean up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Slam!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door slammed shut behind you! Not only that, the room got dark! It was like that darkened area Atropos dragged you and your crew in last time!<br>\r\nOnly this time, you saw huge purple eyes suddenly open up all across the walls! Each eye staring deeply at you... blinking every once in a while!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's here,' you think to yourself.<br>\r\nAnd as luck would have it, there was Atropos, standing right in front of the door you came in, giving you that eerily carefree smile that's still burned in your memory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you bring me here for?!\" you questioned her. She didnt say anything. She just smiled. You were just about to repeat yourself when you saw another Atropos standing in front of the doorway to the kitchen! Then there was another blocking the stairs. And another guarding the one window that wasnt barricaded! You shoulda expected an ambush! Now you just lost your means to escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\" you heard Atropos's voice behind you. You turned your head to FINALLY greet the head Reaper responsible for your misery yet again! Still carrying that stupid scythe of hers disguised as an umbrella. \"Youre late,\" she spoke with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that youre here, you wanted to get this over with!<br>\r\n\"Where is Lydia?!\" you got right to the point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtropos merely giggled, \"Is that all you have to say to me? Hunter, I thought we had something special! Didnt all those times we spent together mean anything?\"<br>\r\nYou just glared and repeated, \"Where is Lydia?!!\"<br>\r\nAtropos sighed, \"You've only met her for less than an hour and already youre her little knight in shining armor?\" She started pacing around you. \"If I were to kidnap the daughter of some high and mighty tribal king of some arabic land whose name you cant even pronounce, would you blow off all your life savings to hop on the fastest plane to get to me?\" she then stopped pacing around and put a hand to her chin, \"hm... to be honest, that WOULD be kinda flattering. Wasting all that effort and money for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont flatter yourself, bitch,\" she lowered her hand from her chin the second you called her that 'b' word! \"I came here alone like you demanded. Now let Lydia go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snickered at you, \"Hah! I never said I'd let her go just cuz you came!\" she then glared, \"Not after you screwed me over the last time, especially!\" Damn! You shoulda known it wasnt gonna be that simple! Lydia is now the bargaining chip!<br>\r\n\"Your little trigger happy friend is just FINE,\" Atropos assured you, \"none of my sisters want her dead anymore than I want YOU dead.\" Her umbrella morphed back into a scythe, \"However, I'm not as cheery and patient as they are. And 'mother' is even less patient than me... especially when she's hungry!\" All the purple eyes on the walls widened as they gazed toward you! You could a faint growling to match the ragefilled eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didnt have much choice. For your new friend's daughter's sake, you had to comply.<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"First of all,\" she raised one finger, \"I'm getting kinda tired of referring to that... THING that spawned me as 'mother'. Since you gave ME a name, would you be a dear and give her one, too?\"<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n\"Mama... din-din!\"<br>\r\nYou groaned, \"FINE! Nyx! Her name is Nyx! Happy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by the intrigued smile, she was. \"Nyx... goddess of night. Mother of the Moirai!\" The eyes on the wall softened their widened glared. \"That'll work just fine. Better not let the big sisters know where it came from. Then THEY'LL want names, too!\" Like hell youre naming all thousand of 'em! And something told you that naming these things is a bad idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Atropos wasnt done! \"Second,\" she raised two fingers, \"Youre my official counter again! And we're starting RIGHT back to 1!\"<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth, \"So you can kill my mom again?! HELL no!\"<br>\r\nAtropos rolled her eyes, \"No, unfortunately not her. Because you intervened, you imbalanced the scale and now she's off the list. Chances are the next souls I have you spot will be nobody you ever met in your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want me to do this?\"<br>\r\n\"Duh! Cuz you can see the numbers, stupid!\" she tapped her forehead!<br>\r\n\"No!\" you correct yourself, \"I mean why are you after these people? What is the point of this little death-hunt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you a cold COLD stare. Colder than all the other eyes in this room. Is was the same fierce stare she gave you when you told her you didnt want this job!<br>\r\n\"THAT is none of your concern!\" her cold, dark voice matched her cold, dark stare, \"now do we have a deal or not?\"<br>\r\n\"But wait! I need to-\"<br>\r\n\"DO WE HAVE A DEAL?!\" she raised her voice and repeated, \"...OR NOT?!\"</span></div></div>",

Despite some errors I hoped you guys emjoyed this chapter :)!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pretty much had no other choice. You were getting tired of innocent people dying for their selfish reasons. What's worse is that one of those innocent people actually tried to help you and now his daughter's life is at stake! Not only do you need to return the favor to the man that helped you,you also have to find out the truth.You had to find out why they're making you pick out the people who gets to die,and also why they're interested in you and only you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly raised your head back up and stared at Atropos,who is staring at you with a smirk. She kmew what your answer was but being the sick bitch she is she wanted you to admit your defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's it going to be Hunter?\"Atropos spoke,breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to accept the deal,or are you going to let the foolish man's daughter die?\". You took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept the deal...but only if I can see right here right now that Lydia's safety is guaranteed. And that you swear not to go after her or her family\"you replied with a stern voice. Atropos glared at your request,but for some odd reason. She seemed obligated to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,I'll let this one little request pass. Only if you promise to return the promise later.\" You paused for a moment,pondering at what she wanted. You didn't want her to change her mind at an instant so you simply nodded. Atropos smiled and stared at her sister guarding the stairs. Her sister than walked up the stairs and into the room at the top. After what seemed like forever,Atropos's sister walked out with Lydia. She seemed fine despite her arms being tird up,but you knew she was terrified. She walked down the stairs and cut the rope binding Lydia's arms. Lydia immediately ran to your side and wrapped her arms around you. Poor girl...all because of you she almost died....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thank you Hunter\"she cried\"t-they were going to do horrible things to me!\". Jesus what the hell were they trying to accomplish by killing her!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok,don't worry about it. You have to get out of here though. Tell your father to not call me or look for me anymore. You got that? I promise you they wont harm you if you do that.\" At least...you hope they wont...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! Do yourself a favor and scram! Unless if you want to meet mothrr again I can arrange that\"Atropos shouted,making Lydia release you from her arms. She looked back at you one last time and ran out of the house. Good,at least she's safe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back at the reapers starung daggers at you. Especially Atropos,who you think is probably staring at you the hardest out of all of them! What the hell do they have in mind now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that she's out of the way\"Atropos spoke,with the same scary smirk she had on her face since day one.\"I think it's time for your initiation\". Initiation? What initiation?! That question was soon answered the momemt they...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could see each one of them burning red hot and smoking with anticipation of branding something! Sadly, there were no cows around... and you wouldnt be surprised if all of Nyx's little girls were into kinky shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mother of God!\" you gasped. Atropos grins at you with squinted eyes. All of her little sisters grinned with the squinted eye expression. Even the eyes on the wall squinted the same way! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nyyyyyx...\" Atropos called out to her 'mother', \"would you kindly hold the snitch still?\"<br>\r\n\"!!\" just like last time, a huge set of jaws appeared from below and clamped down on your lower torso! It wasnt tight enough to pierce skin... just tight enough to keep you from moving as Atropos and her sisters approached you! Despite being terrified of the pain that's about to come, you remind yourself that you did this to save Lydia. You kept your promise to that cop who rescued you earlier. His daughter is safe thanks to you. All it cost you was a couple of branding irons. A couple of scorching hot branding irons that are about to roast your flesh like a barbecue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to hold the urge to scream... at least until the irons come in contact! You could feel the intense heat just being near them!<br>\r\n\"LET HIM HAVE IT!!\" Atropos shouted as her purple eyes enlarged in anticipation.<br>\r\n*SSSS!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just about to shout in horror, when you realized you didnt feel a single iron. Each one literally went through your body, like a ghost! But you were quite confident it wasnt an illusion, because you felt something deep DEEP within you felt the intense burn! You could almost hear a faint scream in agony... maybe it was your soul? Whatever it was, it was obviously something terrible if it came from Atropos's ilk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several seconds of listening to that faint scream of sheer excruciating pain, Atropos and her sisters finally pulled their branding irons out of you. The jaws below you open, releasing your body, then sinking back into the floor. You patted yourself, trying to feel any burns or singes... there was literally nothing. Then what the hell did they do to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... look at the big boy!\" Atropos giggled, \"didnt even flinch!\"<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n\"Nothing you need to worry about,\" Atropos smirked as she pinched your cheek, \"provided your obedient.\" Just assume that you DONT by any means wanna know what it does! Assume the worst if you rub this Reaper the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, party's over, girls!\" Atropos tells her sisters, \"you can all go home now. Buzz off.\" And just like magic, the darkish gloomy hall of eyes vanish without a trace along with her sisters. At least THAT's out of the way. You sighed and headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you, Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SSSS!!!\" you flinched like mad when Atropos grabbed your shoulder! Her hand was incredibly cold!! It also emitted bad chilling vibes that even your soul itself could probably feel! Touch of Death, perhaps?! By the time she let go, you fell to the ground and twitched for a little while!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not off the hook yet,\" you stared at her feet walking circles around as you fought back the urge to foam at the mouth, \"I hope you realize that because of your so-called 'act of heroism' earlier, those 9 people that were fated to die have just died for nothing.\" The part of your mind that wasnt paralyzed was cringing from that fact. Worst of all, Atropos was upset at you for the wrong reason! \"I was THIS close to fulfilling my goal! THIS close! I woulda finally been liberated from my annoying big sisters and that THING once and for all! I couldve finally been MY OWN Reaper... with MY OWN rules... and MY OWN name... until you screwed it up!\"<br>\r\nSomething told you she was telling you more information than she shouldve, but the rest of you was too frazzled to register a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So before we get started on the new #1,\" Atropos stopped and looked down at you, \"I think you owe me a favor. A HUGE favor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frazzling sensation finally stopped and you pulled yourself up off the ground cuz you dare not let HER help you up!<br>\r\nYou wanted to smart off at her, but she was more than capable of smacking the taste out of your smart mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you groaned, \"what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loathed seeing that smirk on her face as she answered, \"I want... no...

Out of all the things that she demanded,you were more shocked to hear that from someone like HER! You know that its crazy to have to pick out which people are going to have to die,but a date with a reapette?! What the hell are you going to do with a reapette?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-pardon Atropos?\"you asked,shivering at her answer once more. She simply smirked and step toward you slowly. You simply started to step away from her as well,fearing she may touch you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear me,you are going to treat me to a night on the town! And I mean I want to be spoiled!\"Atropos shouted,making sure that you do not forget her demands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you've got to be friggin kid-\"you muttered until you backed up into a wall and Atropos quickly dashed towards you and stopped until her face was a mere couple of inches away from yours causing you to hold your breath fearing this is the end of it. She simply grinned as she stared deeply into your eyes,making sure that you see the reflection of your terrified face to remind who who's bitch you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless of course your parents can be numbers #1 and #2,that would be a GREAT and FAST way to start off\"she threatened. You clenched your fist and glared back at her. Clever bitch...You stopped and took a deep breath,reminding yourself that you have to figure out why she is making you do this and how you can put a end to it before things get worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mam'...\"was all you could say. Atropos backed up from you and smiled at you. You sighed in relief and stared at your feet,but it was far to early to think that your in the clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?!\"Lets get going! We don't have all night!\"Atropos interrupted your moment of peace. Damn...right the reapette. You looked back up at her and saw that she has completely changed her appeal! She was wearing black earings,while wearing a black silk dress with black heels. She was wearing purple lipstick,along that her dress didn't even cover her chest that well! In fact she looked gorgeous! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...wow Atropos...\"you stuttered,still awing at the amazing sight you,although,some people do believe that death is a beautiful goddess...you only wish that they weren't that evil...Atropos smiled and gave a little twirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you enjoy this Hunter\"she said,but then a small glared appeared on her face. Oh boy..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just to let you know,if either your so called \"demon hunting friend\" or police officer and his little twerp side kick show up they WILL be the first to go!\". You prayed that Lydia told Noland and Huntersen to stay away from you,if they intervene,not only will they be killed but they're the only people that you can depend upon to help you find a way out of this! You slowly nodded,just so you can show that you understand. Luckily,she was pleased,and she walked towards you grabbing your arm,leading you to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now then,off to empty your wallet and max up your credit card!\"Atropos cheered. Whoppdy fucking doo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped out of the house and started to head towards a certain part of the city that you know that is close to where Atropos made you meet. You could say that the atmosphere of the district is calming and relaxing,you know that there are some restaurants and bars that you can take her to that you used to take your ex-girlfriend to when you two were dating. It was a pretty good relationship until you two decided to end it,you kind of have feelings for her but you know that it is time to move on. Oh if only you two were together so you could have focused on her rather than partying that lead to seeing this evil bitch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like a half hour,you and your \"date\" arrived to the city. You and Atropos stopped to observe everything.What surprised you was that people actually noticed Atropos standing right next to you! It would only make sense,people would think you were crazy taking an imaginary girl with you! Luckily,you can forget that reapette was standing right next to you holding your arm as she observed everything around her.There were street musicians playing acoustic sets,a river where there is a merry traveling on the waters,tables outside of restaurants and bars.This part of the city always brought you warming memories.It was pleasant,it made you forget your dating the grim reaper herself out on a date that depends on your very life! Atropos noticed that you were distracted from her,and decided to give you a little reminder,by making you feel that could sensation against her fingertips! You shivered and looked at her,grinning your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are you going to take me to Hunter?I mean you are the man treating a lady,how do you plan to satisfy her?I do hope you have enough money to do that\"Atropos said with a smirk,that is a good question. What ARE you going to do???</span></div></div>",

However, you didnt wanna take Atropos out to eat, because GOD only knows what reapers consider to be adequate food sources. You whipped out one of the Visas and said with a hard, HARD groan... \"Let's go shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at seeing the damn curse of your life hop up and down with excitement and clap her hands! The cute satisfied smile she was giving you made your stomach cringe. Also, the fact that you had the gall to watch her boobs bounced when she hopped made you puke mentally.<br>\r\n\"Oh Hunter!!\" she pretended to swoon, \"you really know how to treat a girl! Let's see if your platinum card knows how, too!\"<br>\r\n\"You sure you dont wanna just kill me?\" sadly, Atropos ignores you and locks elbows with you and drags you down the shopping center! She dragged you across plenty of stores you believe are the best places for girlfriend\u2019s to waste their boyfriend\u2019s money! Clothing stores, Hot Topic, Cinnabon,  flower shops, music stores, the who shebang-bang! You even stared in horror at the jewelry store. No way in hell you could afford ANYTHING that place offers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHANKFULLY, she walked past the jewelry store. Guess she\u2019s not big on bright shiny things (*COUGH!*Flashbang*COUGH!*). But you know what she IS big on?! Hot Topic! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! This one would look good on me! So would this one! And this one! Not this one, but I like the color. Eh, maybe sis\u2019ll like this.\u201c And man was she quick to pull shirts, skirts, gothic dresses, lip stick stripped socks, a handbag, little bows and collars off the shelf and into your shopping cart! You raised an eyebrow when she dropped a box of condoms into the cart!<br>\r\n\u201cWhy the hell would ya need THOSE?\u201d<br>\r\nAtropos merely snickered, \u201cAs if YOU would need to know\u2026\u201d What was THAT supposed to mean?!<br>\r\nAnyways, the total rang up to about $200. You groaned as you tossed your leftover birthday money on the counter and waited for your change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the Cinnabon. Fortunately you were hungry too, so you didnt object to buying two caramel pecanbons. Then you went to Jamba Juice to order some \u2018healthy\u2019 fruit drinks. Yep\u2026 youre buying DEATH a health drink.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take an original Banana Berry,\u201d you order then turn to Atropos, \u201cwhat\u2019ll you have?\u201d<br>\r\nShe casually answered, \u201cA Penis Shooter.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA what?! What the hell are you-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, one original Banana Berry and one Penis Shooter!\u201d you did a double take when the cashier reacted just as casually! That drink exists?! Probably part of a secret menu or something. \u201cWill that be all?\u201d<br>\r\nYou squinted in a disgusted expression, but nodded.<br>\r\n\u201cTotal comes to $31.17\u201d $25 for a friggin Penis Shooter?! Good lord! No wonder Atropos wants it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it werent bad enough, as you enjoyed your drink, Atropos took one sip of hers, cringed at the awful taste and spit it out!<br>\r\n\u201cUGHH!!\u201d she groaned and tossed her drink in the trash, \u201cthis crap is nasty!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen why did you order it?!\u201d you objected.<br>\r\nShe wiped her mouth and cracked a grin, \u201cJust to see the look on your face!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the music store. She bought one of every single CD in the Heavy Metal section\u2026 and one Adele CD. Cost ya around $300 and the clerk looked at you strangely when you paid by credit card, but the transaction went through and you were yet another step towards being poor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtropos clinged to your arm sweetly as the two of you casually walked, knowing you were loathing every second of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So THIS is what a 'first date' feels like!\" Atropos said with glee, \"for the first time in my life, I finally see myself as a girl... instead of some inhuman scary ghastly soul keeping drone of some other scarier ghastly soul keeping monstrosity.\" If she wasnt making your life miserable, you'd actually feel sorry for her.<br>\r\n\"Then is this night almost over then?\"<br>\r\nAtropos just squeezed your arm tighter. MUCH tighter. You felt no blood circulating to your arm as she squeezed!<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" she smiled, \"you havent even begun to spoil me! We still need to see a movie, go to a danceclub, maybe a fancy restaurant, watch the firework display, then spend the night at a fancy hotel!\" UGGGGHHH... \"...THEN we look for the new number 1.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn second thought, youre in no hurry to end this night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look! A bar!\" your 'date' pointed to a nice looking pub, \"do you drink, Hunter?\"<br>\r\nYou wanted to smart off to her, but then you remembered the LAST time you had a drink: the first night you met Atropos! \"Not anymore.\"<br>\r\n\"I dont either,\" she replied, \"but I've been wanted to try at least ONCE in my life! Let's go get plastered!\"<br>\r\n\"That's ok, why dont we-GOD DAMN IT!!\" you screamed the second she poked your exposed neck with her chilling fingertip, \"FINE! FINE!\"<br>\r\n\"That's a good boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth as you walked through the door with Death by your side. As predicted, you got several drunkards staring at you weird-like... but not because of Atropos.<br>\r\nAgainst your better judgement, you walked right up to the bald fat red-bearded bartender and kept a straight face.<br>\r\n\"Aintcha a little young tah be caught drinking here, kid?\" the ginger fat man of irish descent asked you. You just sighed and pulled out your drivers license, revealing it to him. He stared at it for a few seconds and then said, \"Arright, boyo. What'll ya be havin?\"<br>\r\n\"Ask HER,\" you pointed to your 'girlfriend', who smirked at you.<br>\r\n\"Ya might wanna find us a seat,\" she told you, \"it's gonna be a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was SLIGHTLY revealing that you got at least a moment to yourself if just a few minutes to find a table. You found a nice one at the very end of the room just aside the jukebox. You sat in your chair and waited. This might take a while.<br>\r\nNot far away from you, you saw a much older gentleman sitting all by his lonesome staring sadly into his glass. He wasnt crying, but that's probably because he already had. Just staring at him made you feel worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recognized the guy. He was the man who was crying when the cops came to question you back at school. Mr. Mocherie. Your late dean's widower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn it,\" you muttered quietly, \"why here?\" The guy is probably still hurting. And who could blame him? His wife's dead... and YOU were the one involved in her death. #8. You still remember the last words you shouted to her, 'FUCK YOU AND GET OFF MY BACK!'<br>\r\nYou couldnt just stand there and stare. You had to talk to him. You at least owed him a small chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, how could you talk to the husband of the woman you killed? The innocent woman who was just concerned of your well being and who you repaid by shouted in her face and turning your back on her?!<br>\r\nYou felt like scum... but just sitting there in awkward silence didnt make you feel any better!</span></div></div>",

The tunnel vision is going black as you see the figure step into the group, hauling there progress. It's back is facing you, but somehow you get a sense of femininity form the new comer.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you locked eyes with her the silence seemed to last for an eternity until she pulled a small book out of one of her pockets. It was bound in leather and seemed quite thick and well worn. A feather pen adorned the side but she didn't pick it up, instead flicking through the pages so fast it looked like a blur before stopping. Her eyes scanned the page before snapping the book shut and looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you well (Your name)?\" She said pulling a chair from beside her and pushing it to the foot of your bed where she took a seat. How did she know your name? You couldn't bring yourself to answer. The shock of seeing your saviour (let along seeing that she had wings!) left you speechless. She looked you over quickly and smiled, a more genuine and heart-warming one you'd never seen. Only accentuated by her flawless face, her eyes also played a part feeling like some of her confidence was flowing into yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" You say watching as she grabbed the feather pen and hastily scribbled something down. It didn't have ink on it though. Although that wasn't nearly as strange as her wings which captured your attention. They were a pure white and seemed almost hypnotic to you as you took in every detail of them. Although that was cut short when she stopped writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I understand that you were attacked yesterday?\" She said like a detective reading a crime report. She was there why did she even need to ask? \"Do you have any idea why they would have attacked you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Money I guess.\" You said trying to shrug. A look of annoyance spread across her face and she muttered something under her breath before continuing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Gabrielle. I hope you understand what I am?\" She said looking you in the eyes again, this time the gaze was more expectant and made you uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An angel?\" You said sheepishly making her sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose in a way I am but that's not the name of my kind. I am a Valkyrie.\" She said much to your disbelief. With the wings you could believe Gabrielle was an angel, but weren't Valkyries warriors? You know, spears, shields etc.  She could obviously tell what you were thinking from the amused smirk she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we used to be like that before customs changed so we changed to adapt. I could adorn it if you want, I was simply going for a less intimidating look for our first meeting\u2026 also the fact that armour is less then common in this age.\u201d She said with mild amusement while motioning to her casual wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so other people can see you?\u201d You ask confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, why?\u201d She said tilting her head as though it was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about\u2026\u201d You motioned to her wings, you knew you weren't dreaming but maybe the meds were getting to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, these?\u201d She asked fanning them out a bit in one graceful motion. \u201cYes they\u2019re real, but only those with Odin\u2019s blessing can see them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so I'm blessed?\u201d You ask, you had trouble believing that with the bad luck you\u2019d been struck with in the last year. This assault was one of the more serious occurrences.  \u201cWhy?\u201d You were sceptical, what had you done that deserved the attention of a god? You didn't know much about him but you learnt enough in history to understand what that meant. This time however, she didn't answer instead averting her gaze for a few moments before turning back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should be discharged later today, I saw to it that your healing would progress faster.\u201d She said proudly almost as if you had never asked the question at all.  Then again you had the feeling that if she didn't want to tell you, you\u2019d never have a chance to get it out of her anyway. So you sigh and continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what am I supposed to do? Just go back to leading a normal life?\u201d You say sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I'm glad you catch on so fast.\u201d She said, clearly oblivious to the sarcasm dripping from your voice. \u201cOf course there will have to be some changes made\u2026\u201d She said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d You raised an eyebrow, what didn't she want to tell you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you are aware of the supernatural, you\u2019ll be more attuned to it and the creatures will become more attuned to you.\u201d She says before noticing the steadily increasing look of hesitation on your face. \u201cOf  course with Odin behind you few creatures would dare offending him by attacking you. Some may even get on your good side to increase their standings. Only followers of other gods would mean harm, and those that can see a blessed person are precious few.\u201d She quickly followed up easing your tension somewhat. Just how long ago had you become blessed? And how dangerous were these 'precious few'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy couldn't I see them before?\u201d You ask carefully, thinking back to any time you may have seen one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you simply weren't aware of them, and because of that they never bothered to look your way.<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"> Except for one</font>\u201d She said trying to explain as best she could although you couldn't hear the last part. You were still left slightly confused as she began writing something again. She tore the page out and handed it to you. You looked on it to see a strange symbol and above that a phone number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you need me just call that number and keep the paper on you. It should stop all but the strongest beings trying anything foolish and will alert me to it.\u201d She said preparing to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! You\u2019re just going to leave?\u201d You say honestly hoping she\u2019d stick around to protect you. Although you knew she was going for a good reason your brain just wasn't listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, the longer I stay here the more likely you are to be noticed. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be around and you'll see me soon. Just ignore what you see and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She said walking out the door before you had a chance to do anything. Now that her warming aura was gone you felt truly alone. Just what was out there waiting for you? You at least knew one thing, you'd protect that piece of paper with your damn life. You sat there for the next few hours, trying to figure anything else in the ad breaks between the shows you watched from your bed. None of this made any sense but you weren't going to give up like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely even notice when a confused nurse made her way into your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Michael?\" She asked reading her clipboard. The way she snuck up on you made you jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's me.\" you say hoping she has something that can take your mind off this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your release papers have been signed... we just need to do some tests and you're free to go.\" She said, probably confused how you recovered so fast. You don't know yourself but you have a good feeling that Gabrielle was the one that made that signature. After a few standard health checks you find that you're completely recovered, something that confused the nurse beyond belief. She said your estimated recovery time was at least a week. You just said you lived a healthy lifestyle and left it at that. \"Someone left you a spare change of clothes at the front desk, here they are.\" She said producing a small bundle that looked quite impressive. The logos on it and other pictures were all done in Norse style giving the impression of top quality craftsmanship. Looking at all the writing and the like you wondered if it actually served more of a purpose then just to look impressive. She handed you the rest of your belongings, which was mainly your wallet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a lot of strange looks on your way out. Some of the doctors and nurses whispered behind your back making you all the more eager to leave. Once you got the bus stop you didn't have to wait long. You had enough change left to pay the ride back to your apartment, most of which was uneventful. You did find it strange though that you kept seeing things on flick in the corners of your vision. You must have looked crazy flicking your head around everywhere to try and catch a glimpse of it. When people started giving you weird looks you stopped hoping that it was just your imagination. If not you hoped that you didn't draw attention to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came to your stop, you moved faster then you ever had before to get off the bus. Your apartment was a block away, but at your panicked speed you made it there in record time. Running up the stairwell you fumbled with your keys before throwing the door open only to slam it shut moments later. Your breathing became shallow and rapid as only now did the exhaustion get to you. You never were an athletic person. Slumping to the floor you try to forget the day. Why had any of this happened to you? What was that thing on the bus? You just made more and more questions until you weren't sure if you were sane any more. Suddenly you feel something furry rub against your leg. Your head snaps down expecting some monstrosity...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut its just your cat, Amber (Named after her eye colour). She was a strange cat you adopted from a shelter. She was quite vicious at the start as you had been told she was found beaten and unconscious on the side of a road. That was what you assumed made her so anti social. At the start you felt that she was dangerous for some reason, something subconscious told you to stay away, but your pity for her won in the end (even though it landed you numerous scars). Over time she had warmed up to you and became your companion, always there to soothe you after the day. You'd always feel safe around her and whenever you were woken up in the middle of the night by some noise or something, she'd be off for a minute or two and then be back with the disturbance gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you never questioned it, hell you still didn't. You were just glad for her company and warming presence. She was good at telling when you were distraught and helped most in those times. You stroked her soft fur with a smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Amber...\" You said and you could have sworn you saw understanding in those eyes but you just dismissed it before going to watch some TV. She followed behind you,  and hoped you'd never find out that she was the creature that noticed you...</span></div></div>",

Anybody who was you right now would be shaking their head in disbelief. Some would be shaking their head until it falls off! This little miraculous discovery is something you'd find in Weekly World News... or at least in a small brief article a larger article regarding President Obama being a killer robot who emits hidden hypnotic waves in his deep monotone voice during his speeches! <br>\r\nIt all started with your mom and a bunch of your her relatives going on a little camping trip in the woods! Since you were getting disgusted by one of your uncle Bert's many stories regarding his ingrown toenail, you decided to kill some time by taking a nature walk into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure it's believable you'd find an unconscious woman lying in the middle of the forest... but a woman with white, birdlike wings?! The poor woman had golden blonde hair that would be the envy of all your blonde cousins, bright peachy skin like out of those skin cream commercials, and a long flowing white dress that despite lying in the middle of the dirty ground, is somehow incredibly clean! Not a drop of dirt on it! The atmosphere around her felt incredibly warm and intoxication.  She had a wondrous aura about her no one you've ever met in your life felt. Of course, that's not nearly as shocking as the white feathery wings sprouting out her back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinged woman or not, she was still in need and needed medical aid! You tried to gently wake her up, but no good. She was fast out... and had a nasty scratch in her arm. She's bleeding green blood?!<br>\r\nFortunately, you had a miniature first aid kit on you. You quickly addressed the wound, disinfected it, and applied bandages over it. You get pulled out a washcloth, soaked it in the river and put it on her forehead to cool her fever down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to carry her back to the others but she was a little too heavy for you to handle (Those wings must weigh a ton!). You shouldve found a nearest phone and dialed 911, but for some reason you didnt wanna leave her side. It almost felt like you would be punished severely if you tried!<br>\r\nInstead, you stood there staring at the winged woman and shook your head in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Mmm....mmmnn....\" she started coming to. She slowly opened her eyes, giving you a brief glimpse of shining golden eyelids in the middle of blackened eyeballs! Those didnt look any fancy contacts you've ever seen before!<br>\r\n\"Unn.....huh?\" Her black eyes widened as she gazed into your soul! No, seriously it honestly felt like your soul itself was compromised by her stare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*WOOSH!*<br>\r\n\"WHOAA!!\" you fell over the split second the woman bounced up on her feet with just a flap of her wings! You stared up at her in awe as she gazed down at you, spreading her wings out! Th... theyre real!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's not a happy glare she's giving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...wh....y...e....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mortal!!\" her shout nearly the earth around her! Her voice sounded like it was of nobility... and demanding, \"you have just desecrated the sanctity of an angel in training!\"<br>\r\n\"W...wha...\"<br>\r\n\"Putting your filthy impure hands on an pure celestial is a capital offense!\" she demanded, \"one punishable by immediate death!\" D-D-DEATH?! What's she going on about?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa! Calm down!\" you got up and tried to calm her, \"relax, I'm only trying to help-!!!\" You felt an invisible force freezing your body! You couldnt move anything below your neck! She's... she's not human! \"Wh...what the hell-\"<br>\r\n\"What your language in front of a celestial mortal,\" she warned you. You complied.<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry! What the HECK are you?!\" She squinted her eyes as she stepped closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot possibly be this dumb, mortal,\" she coldly spoke, \"even the lowliest creature on the face of this planet knows an potential angel when it sees one.\" ...A...An angel?! But angels are make believe! They dont exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. 'Potential' angel?!<br>\r\n\"Uh... POTENTIAL angel?\"<br>\r\nShe put a hand to her chest... her ruby ring on her ring finger glowed, \"I am Alexandria. Soon to be St. Alexandria. I was in the middle of an important mission advised to me by my superiors... before I was rudely interrupted by the likes of you.\" You interrupted an angel's mission to be a certified angel?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N..Nice to meet you, Alexandria,\" you tried to sound friendly, \"I'm-\"<br>\r\n\"Jonathon Carpenter,\" she already knew your name!<br>\r\n\"H-How did you know my name?!\"<br>\r\n\"Fool, dont you remember what I told you?!\" Oh right, she's an angel... er... POTENTIAL angel! \"I know more than that about you. Son of Helen Carpenter and Michael Carpenter. Middle child of two sons and a daughter.\" She squinted her eyes, \"...atheist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh dear! Worst time in the world to still be doubting religion! All those religious folks were right. You'd know the power of God just by FEELING it! Sadly, praying for mercy would be useless at this point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria looked at her bandaged arm. The arm you so kindly nursed to health.<br>\r\n\"Did you do this to my arm?\"<br>\r\nAint no use lying to an angel trainee.<br>\r\nYou nodded, \"Yes. It was bleeding. You were out cold, so I was just trying to nurse you to health. Is it wrong that I helped you out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is, Mr. Carpenter,\" Alexandria told you, \"as I said before, tainting an angel with a mortal's touch is a high offense. While your... vague act of chivalry seems admirable, the crime was still done.\" Crime?! For touching an angel?! How shallow is that?! Would she rather just be left to die?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you werent gonna be meeting your creator yet.<br>\r\n\"I'll overlook this capital offense just this once,\" Alexandria 'mercifully' told you, \"however, youre now known to me, Mr. Carpenter. Interfere in my mission in ANY way, I'll see to it you regret your action for TWO eternities!\" JESUS CHRIST, WHAT DID YOU DO?!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the invisible force faded away, freeing the rest of your body from her angelic grasp! Alexandria turned around and walked off. Where she was going, you probably didnt wanna know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Geez, what an ungrateful bitch,' you thought to yourself... and immediately hoped she couldnt read your mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know when youre not wanted. You'd better head back to the others before theyre worried sick. Hopefully, you wont have to worry about that stupid angel trainee again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, ever since she brought up her 'mission' to become a full fledged angel, part of you got a little curious. Despite it being suicide, you thought about following that angel to see what this mission of hers was about. Then again, you remember what Alexandria said about interfering with her mission! You definitely shouldnt mess with one of Heaven's pupils!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should just forget her and head back to camp with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or maybe you should try following that angel trainee at a safe distance and see what she's up to?</span></div></div>",

Heaven, Micheal, the lucky mortal and his angel harem, the sparkly, glittering buildings... all vanished without a trace! You shoulda known it was too good to be true. Then again... angels?! PSTT!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess it! A friggin dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the split moment you woke up, you see a pair of narrow eyes gazing at you at point-blank range! You were spooked out of your mind, but in a way, so was this stranger!<br>\r\nHer pink eyelids narrowed in her blacked eyeballs similar to Alexandria's and her jaw dropped in fright!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEeeeekk!!\" she shrieked as she leaped off of you... and... floated in the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman... er... girl... midget(?!) was small! Literally half your size! And very pink, too. She had pink hair, pink eyes, work a pink dress with hearts stitched on it, pink lipstick, a pink heart-shaped birthmark on her cheek, pink boots also with hearts on it, even had pink wings sprouting out of her back! Her aura seemed similar to Alexandria's, but not nearly as strong... or threatening! Mainly fragrant and inviting.<br>\r\nYou both stared at eachother practically scared out of your wits. Well, you probably werent as scared as she was. She was shaking and shivering as he was floating in the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-U-u-unbelievable!!\" she put her hands to her cheeks and spoke in a high-pitched, \"how could a mere mortal break out of the love-trance?! Nobody breaks out of the love-trance!\" Love-trance?! ....THE HAREM HEAVEN DREAM!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...You?!\" you jumped out of your sleeping back and approached, \"You created that dream?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... um... uh... \"<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in my tent?\" you question the short pink angel then looked down, \"...and did you just try to unzip my pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... d-dont be scared, mortal,\" she tried to tell you in a comforting tone as she flew closer to you, \"just lie back down and receive your bliss like a good-\"<br>\r\n\"Get away from me!!\" you shout, not trusting her and not wanting to break the angel touching rule for the second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YIKES! I KNEW THIS WAS A BAD IDEA!!!\" the pink mini-angel shrieked and flew out of your tent!<br>\r\n\"HEY! WAIT UP!!\" you tried to give chase of your dream molester, but she was way too fast. You expect no less from a celestial entity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw great...\" you sighed, \"MORE of them?\" Great, one wanted to kill you and the other wanted to get in your pants. Does this mean the third's gonna try to eat you?! You werent gonna find out, cuz you were not going back to sleep. Fortunately, it was nearing dawn. Not much time before the others wake up. To kill time, you decided to chill out at the main table where the rest of your family would soon be having breakfast. <br>\r\nYou wait patiently staring at the mountains in the distance. You a few trees, a couple of birds, a few deer... a bright blonde angel surrounded by the birds and the deer!<br>\r\n\"!!\" you quickly turn away, hoping she didnt notice you. If that was Alexandria, like hell you'd want a reunion with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pretend you dont notice the bright aura in the distance and head back to your tent. You pull out some hot cocoa mix from your bag and brew yourself up some hot cocoa. It didnt taste bad, but it wasnt enough to quell your uneasiness. After all, it was just yesterday that you begun to question your outlook on life. Now that you know that angels exist, what are you supposed to do? Convert? To what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it, you never saw angels before in your life! Why are they here NOW?!<br>\r\nGreat, now you lost your appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd best stop thinking so hard about it for now.<br>\r\nYou set down your cup of cocoa and wait for the rest of the family to get up...</span></div></div>",

Here came your grandma Janice, then grandpa Rufus, then uncle Bert, then aunt Lucy, then cousin Stu, then uncle Roy, then the other cousin Stu, then Stu's wife Trisha and their baby boy little Stu, then great uncle Albert and his wife Stu (short for Stuella), and finally your brother, sister, and finally your father, who no doubt didnt wanna be here. (eldest brother was away on a business trip... in Iraq).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lookee here, Rufus! Little Johnny-boy's up with the chickens!\" your grandma spoke in that thick southern accent that you can always spot in a crowd!<br>\r\n\"I can see that, Janice!\" remarked grandpa in a rather grizzled throaty voice, \"what you doin up so early?\"<br>\r\n\"I... couldnt sleep,\" was all you could answer as you sipped your cocoa, trying to soften the thought of angel existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, dont be worrying yer head off over a bad night,\" quipped grandma, \"we still got loads to do out here to kick it all down. Which reminds me, we gotta start breakfast!\"<br>\r\n\"I gots the pancake mix!\" said grandpa, \"HEY BERT! Where ya keepin' the bacon?!\"<br>\r\n\"In the mini fridge next to my dermatophytosis cream.\" Whelp, now you lost your appetite, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, the rest of the family gathered together at the camp table chatting amongst each other while grandma was prepping some pancakes and bacon on the camp stove. Uncle Bert went on about the time his doctor was completely flabbergasted to discover a brand new strain of fungus growing on his toe. Everyone had a laugh except for you and your dad who was keeping to himself pretty far away from the family. No doubt he felt like the odd one out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause you wanna leave him left out and he seemed like the most sensible person to tell your story to, you walked on over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, John?\" he turned his head and asked. You couldnt just flat out TELL him that you saw angels last night. It's way too bizarre. But you did know ANOTHER way to tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I had a weird dream last night,\" you explained, \"I dreamed I saw an honest to goodness angel (in training) lying unconscious on the side of the road.\" He raised his eyebrow at you, but you continued, \"I nursed her to health, but she threatened to kill me because apparently touching her is a cardinal sin or something.\"<br>\r\n\"I... see.\"<br>\r\n\"Anyways, she knew everything about me,\" you continued, \"about my name, who I am, my family... even that I'm an atheist! She knew EVERYTHING!\" You didnt wanna tell him about the angel harem dream and the angel rapist in pink, You had to maintain a sense of dignity in front of your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it scare you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded hard, \"Yes. I mean what if theyre others out there that knew just as much as she did? What if some came after me? And what if they knew I broke the rule about physical contact with an angel?!\" Oh crap, you almost panicked there! You tried to keep your cool, but after thinking about it, those are very good questions! One of them DID come after you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, youre an atheist arent you?\" then your dad had to bring THAT up, \"since you dont believe in the existence of a supreme being, you dont believe those angels are real, do you? It was all just a bad dream.\" Your dad had a good point, but it made you very uncomfortable. That little incident is making you question your outlook on life.<br>\r\n\"Well... it all seemed so real,\" that was the best you could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad smile, \"Maybe it's just God's way of telling you he wants you to go back to church.\"<br>\r\nYou sighed hard, \"I'm not going back to church, dad.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's fine,\" he sighed, \"God has given you a free will after all. But if youre scared, I'm sure he'd be willing to lend you an ear.\" You had no response to that. If God exists and those were really angels you saw, who better to comfort your ills than the Big Guy in charge?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you couldnt take this anymore. You needed to clear your head. \"I... I think I better lie down,\"<br>\r\n\"Youre not gonna have breakfast with your mother's folks?\" your dad asked.<br>\r\n\"No, I already lost my appetite,\" you said, \"I'm just gonna rest for a bit. Thanks for listening.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" your dad said, \"...the offer's still on the table if you wanna come with me to church next Sunday.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it,\" normally that'd be a lie. But after this episode, you probably should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you head back to your tent wondering how youre gonna handle the fact that angels may in fact exist and that your entire view on life itself may be WRONG. DEAD WRONG. Speaking of dead, you really really REALLY hope you never have to get on Alexandria's bad side ever again. Heck, you hope you never have to see Alexandria again. Finally you reach your tent and you a deep breath and exhale and head inside and what the hell is that letter doing on your sleeping bag?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fancy looking letter with plenty of glittering heart designs on it and little pictures of cupids. It had a nice fragrant perfumey smell to it, as well. On it, the words 'TO JOHN' were written in carefully hand-written purple ink with a heart replacing the O in JOHN.<br>\r\n\"Ugh... this should be good,\" you muttered as you opened the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the cutesy handwriting, you felt bad vibes as you read it.<br>\r\n'DEAR JOHN, IF YOU VALUE THE LIVES OF YOUR FAMILY, PLEASE MEET ME AT THE LAKESIDE WEST OF WHERE YOU FOUND ALEXANDRIA. COME ALONE. AND DRESS NICE. PREFERABLY SOMETHING EASY TO UNDRESS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-LOVE, MEDEA' There was even a big pink kiss imprint by her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be fucking kidding me,\" you groaned. Well, so much for trying to clear your head. You wanted to toss that letter in the campfire, but she mentioned your family's lives. It sounded like either a threat or a warning. Either way, youre worried.<br>\r\nThen again, it could just be a trick. Or a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The thought of fleeing flooded your mind, but so did the fact that this was a friggin angel you'd be attempting to flee from! An ANGEL! You might as well run from a tornado or a tsunami! It cant be done.<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard and believed that keeping on Medea's good side was the ideal choice. Since she was generous enough to answer so many questions that a lowly mortal like yourself probably shouldnt know the answer to, it's only fair to answer one of her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... after the 'nice' encounter with Alexandria, I had a crazy dream... and it sorta involved... um, is that KY jelly?.\"<br>\r\nMedea squirted a dab of jelly substance from a squeeze tub, \"Just wanna make this moment memorable for the both of us. Keep talking!\" Jesus! You turned your head away, not wanting to see her rub that sex lube between her legs in prep of the divine fucking!<br>\r\n\"Er... a...anyways,\" you continued, \"I dreamt I was in Heaven and I met Micheal.\"<br>\r\nMedea's pink eyes widened, \"Micheal?! You seriously dreamed about Micheal?! The same Micheal I was just talking about earlier?!\"<br>\r\nYou nodded, \"I... I think so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea tilted her head and looked up at you with more interest, \"And what did she say?\"<br>\r\nYou gulped, \"Well, she talked about what Heaven is like... and her brother, Lucifer... andthatshefallenformeandwantedmetobecomeheroneandonly.\"<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Medea squeezed out a HUGE glob of sex jelly in lieu to hearing that, \"did you just seriously say what I THINK you said?!\"<br>\r\n\"Er... what did you think I said?\"<br>\r\n\"That Micheal, OUR Micheal, our one and only Lady Micheal, the 1st of 786 daughters of YaaHuuWeeHaaHaaWeeHuuYaa, has fallen for YOU?!\"<br>\r\nYou sweated bullets as you get her fragrant aura become a little more fragrantly than ever, \"Um... yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible!\" Medea practically shoots you down, \"Our Micheal took a vow of celibacy long ago. A vow to even this day she refuses to break out of fear that the impure child she makes with an impure mortal man becomes the Anti-Christ!\" Holy crap!<br>\r\n\"F...For reals?\"<br>\r\n\"For reals!\" Medea assures you, \"it's gotta be the work of a demon! Are you just sure you didnt like accidentally sell your soul or prick yourself and bleed on a devil or anything?\"<br>\r\n\"I am dead sure!\" you tell her, \"I would remember something like that. And something like that has never happened before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedea squints her eyes, \"Maybe that demon wiped your memory so you wouldnt remember the deal you made with it. Oh well... let's knock boots to be safe!\" And yet again, she's back to trying to 'purify' you!<br>\r\n\"Er, s-sorry, but I'm gonna have to pass,\" as if she cared what you think. By the time you were thinking of a good excuse, you suddenly heard jazzy music playing in the background.<br>\r\n\"This is for your own good, John,\" Medea assures you, \"I'm pretty sure you can imagine what would happen to you if a demon keeps a grasp on your body for too long.\"<br>\r\n\"But I'm awful sure I dont have a demon uh, grasping me!\" you say to her to no avail. The lakeside was vanishing before your eyes and turning into what looked to be a big pink dimly lit boudoir setting! Oh dear, who suddenly cranked up J-Lo's 'If You Had My Love'?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. aw man, look at the time! I better get heading back before the others worry I-\"<br>\r\n\"Time doesnt matter here!\" Medea said with such a cutesy smile, \"it's put to a halt in my realm! We could go at it for the next millennium and not even a second will pass outside!\" Aw crap! She can freeze time too?! She really is an angel!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could so much as blink in shock, you felt a sudden draft! You looked down and immediately find yourself standing buck naked in front of a deviously grinning midget angel who is somehow gripping every bit of clothing you had on in the palm of her hand!<br>\r\n\"Give those ba-EEEESSSHH!!\" bad move! The split second you touched her, you felt an incredibly strong surge of energy rush all through your body! You felt your veins pump blood at incredible speed throughout your body until it passed through the vein between your legs! All the pent up blood circulated to your crotch, hardening your member to the point where it hurt! It was the biggest, stiffest, and most painful erection you have ever felt in your life! You worried that the tip was gonna burst!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WH-WHAT... HAVE YOU... DONE TO ME?!!\" you groaned in excruciating pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry,\" Medea assures you, \"it's a perfectly natural side-effect from Angel's Lust! It only stings for a few seconds. Then youre gonna feel REALLY good!\" Thankfully, she was right. The pain quickly subsided, but the oversized erection still remained! Multiple thoughts raced through your fragile mind which ranged from 'Is this permanent?!' to 'Is this seriously gonna be able to fit in THAT little twerp?!'<br>\r\n\"L-Look, s-seriously! Cut this out!\" you pleaded with her, \"this could lead to irrepairable damage to my body doing these kind of things!\"<br>\r\nMedea gave you a cutesy frown, \"Oh c'mon. Stop acting like such a high and mighty prude! You should be thankful I'm offering myself to you. Love from a bonna fide angel is something lowly beings couldnt begin to DREAM of experiencing! Not to mention...\" she added with a cute wink, \"...the demon wont be able to make a virgin sacrifice out of you!\" That's a good point-WAIT NO IT'S NOT!<br>\r\nPerhaps it's another side effect from 'Angel's Lust', but sex with this little angel doesnt seem to sound so bad. As you ponder it, the positives seem to outweigh the negatives. Sure you'd be breaking the 'touching' taboo, but maybe it doesnt count if she OFFERS herself to you willingly! She's probably doing this to sate her own lust, but it'd not only sate yours too, you'd be 'purified' and feel absolute pleasure not of your mortal realm! It was getting a little difficult finding a downside to this whole rape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pink eyes gleamed with joy, as if sensing you were caving in! <br>\r\n\"YAY! Youre finally giving in to the light!\" she literally jumped for joy, \"now... SUBMIT!\"  With just a touch from her palm, you felt her will knock you over and you land on a big soft pink heart-shaped bed! Before you could even think about whether or not you should give up, Medea had already leaped on top of you and straddled your waist like an celestial cowgirl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed both your hands tight as you felt your crotch about to press against hers!<br>\r\nYou sweated a bit as you locked eyes with her at point blank range. 'Here goes nothing,' you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" Medea's grin widened as she announced, \"LET THE PURIFICATION BEGIN!!!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It wasnt technically 'sex' you had with Medea. You cant have sex with a hurricane. You cant have sex with an erupting volcano. The intense rush you felt throughout it felt less similar to sexual pleasure than to surviving a death-defying feat! Granted it was a turn-on, but the turn-on you feel when you leap out of an exploding building or jump Springfield Gorge or summon Exodia the Forbidden One! Heck, it reminded you of the rush you felt that one time you FINALLY finished that long ass 20-page essay on Why God Doesnt Exist in your sociology class! Safe to say, it was an A+!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you had with this miniature angel of love, it was an experience. The split second your tool entered her, you were showered with loads of adrenaline coursing through your body! Sweat dripped down every pore and your veins bulged out from this intense exercise of unearthly proportion! The heat from the rest of your body was far more extreme than the one from your crotch due to the heating sensation of the sex-jelly! You wrapped your burning hot arms around the angel's back, twitching against her smooth gentle skin. Even the feathers of her wings felt invigorating to touch as they constantly vibrated on instinct from your touch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shuddered just feeling the tips of Medea's fingers running against your bare chest! Even though her nails scratched slightly deep into your skin as you thrust, the pain was a mere mosquito bite in comparison to the rush your body was feeling! Man, who woulda thought your first time would be THIS awesome! There was no way you could have sex with a normal human girl at this rate! Medea had just raised the bar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each thrust, you fed off more and more of the intensity with visions of soaring above the clouds and swimming through uncharted filled your mind. You could only imagine the face you were making as you gazed almost hypnotically at Medea, who was rolling her eyes back and gasping heavily, even moaning in some unfamiliar tongue! Just watching her squeen in ecstasy was a thrill itself. You literally saw big pink hearts spin around the two of you as you went at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after you orgasm, you didnt stop. You didnt even slow down the pace the tiniest bit! You kept on going, continuing your heart-pounding adventure! Who knows how long time had passed. You lost count of the number of times you came into her. It almost seemed like an eternity passed, but could very well be a second outside Medea's realm!<br>\r\nIt was a long long LONG road, but the adrenaline was beginning to die down. Your body was starting to get tired. By the time the joy-ride was over, you were barely clinging to consciousness. With one final orgasm into the angel, you began to white out. You barely made out an exhausted smile on the pink angel's face before giving you a gentle but incredibly slobbery peck on the cheek.<br>\r\nConsider yourself officially PURIFIED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John?! John!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you suddenly wake up, feeling refreshed. You werent showing any sign of groggyness or fatigue getting up. It felt good getting up. Which was a plus, since you woke up back at the lakeside, but Medea was nowhere to be seen. Where could she have gone?<br>\r\nThe only thing you have of her is a cute little pink lacey wristband around your wrist. A little parting gift, perhaps? It even had her fragrant scent on it. Perhaps that 'purification' mighta meant something to her? Oh man, Alexandria's gonna be PISSED...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing all the way out here?!\u201d you heard your father calling, \u201cI thought you said you were just taking a nap in your tent!\u201d<br>\r\nYou got up and faced your dad, \u201cS\u2026sorry.

But after being \u2019purified\u2019 by Medea, you had a lot more vigor than you used to! A hike sounded exciting to you. You couldnt wait to go! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright!

Is there nothing on this planet that can wash those kind of stains off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you and your folk have split up into a couple of groups hiking toward the nearest hill. Your hiking group consisted of you (duh!), your dad, grandpa, and Uncle Bert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when I say 'hiking' I mean 'hitching a ride in grandpa's old pickup'! And when I say 'toward the nearest hill', I mean 'down the country road about a few miles or so past the nearest hill!'<br>\r\nYou sat between grandpa who was behind the wheel and dad who shaking his head with his hand in his wondering why he ever agreed going on this trip in the first place. Bert had to sit in the back of the pickup to air out his toe infection. Throughout the ride, the radio was blasting 'Big and Rich' and everybody in the truck was jamming to it except for your pops, who was keeping to himself and being the odd man out. Before that magical moment with Medea, you wouldnt been a mental no-show just like him. But with a new boost of confidence flowing in you thanks to her, you happily sang off the top of your lungs along with the others!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND I SADDLE UP MY HORSE AND I RIDE INTO THE CITY!!!\" you, your grandpa, and uncle Bert sing, \"I MAKE A LOT OF NOISE CUZ THE GIRLS THEY ARE SO PRETTY! RIDING UP AND DOWN BROADWAY ON MY OLD STUD LEROY AND THE GIRLS SAY...\" you banged on the dash, \"SAVE A HORSE, RIDE A COWBOY!! EVERYBODY SAYS...\" You all looked toward your dad to finish the chorus of that song!<br>\r\nHe regrettfully muttered, \"Save a horse, ride a cowboy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the song finally came to a close, your grandpa started to notice your old man's uneasiness.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with ya, Mike?\" he asked you, \"ya'll act like you never had any decent fun in yer life!\"<br>\r\nHe sighed, \"I thought we were just going on a simple little hike up a hill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah!\" your grandpa shook his head, \"let those suckers have their little hike. Leave the true treasure huntin' associates to their business!\"<br>\r\nTreasure hunting associates?!<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Rufus?\" your dad got suspicious.<br>\r\n\"Heh! The hell did ya think the REAL reason I had us all come down on this camping trip for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad took a deep hard breath and said, \"Please enlighten me.\"<br>\r\n\"I heard from a few special sources o'mine that there's some mighty fine treasure tah be found in this mountain's ancient burial ground.\"<br>\r\nTreasure hunting in an ancient burial ground?! Maybe it's the boost of adrenaline talking, but that sounds SWEET!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad, however didnt approve, \"Are you out of your mind?! We've come all this way just to disturb a Native American burial ground?!\"<br>\r\n\"Er, I dont think theyre Native American, Mike,\" uncle Bert said from the back.<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" grandpa said, \"heard they were more of a bizarre private sacrilegious cult that got their asses handed to 'em LONG time ago for their heresy.\"<br>\r\nYour dad dropped his jaw, \"U-Unbelievable! Youre putting my soul and the soul of my son in jeopardy over some treasure left by a satanist cult?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, they werent satanists,\" Rufus shook his head, \"but the kind of weird-ass sacrifices those yeehaws were into, they might as well have been!\"<br>\r\n\"This... this is outrageous!\" your dad rightfully gets worried, \"this is the problem with you, Rufus! Every single time I agree to go on 'family trips' with you, you SOMEHOW find a way to turn it into a godforsaken test of my patience AND faith!\"<br>\r\n\"And Mike, THIS is the reason I keep dragging you into these wild shenanigans o'mine!\" Rufus replied, \"cuz ya seriously need to get yer head outta yer ass and find out what it means to have a REAL good time with our family?! What, ya think I was just gonna HAND ya over my darling little girl with no strings attached?!\" Yeah, there was a good reason your dad hardly ever gets along with your mom's side of the family!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell us about the treasure, grandpa,\" you had to change the subject before things got out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I dont know much about it,\" he admitted, \"but legend has it, this cult stole this priceless rarity straight from the temple of the holiest capital of the world itself!\"<br>\r\nYour dad got interested, \"they stole it straight from Jerusalem?\"<br>\r\n\"Ho yeah,\" gramps answered, \"and since then, those cultist aint have nothing but bad luck since they brought it over to their place. Shitty weather, poisoned food, uncurable illnesses, you name it! Each one of 'em was dropping like flies... the last one of those culties that died claimed they saw an angel of death stalking him. Guess the Big Guys upstairs werent too happy wit their mischief.\" Dang. That is bad. And now that you learned that angels are indeed real, you can believe every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now you want US to go look for it?\" your dad got scared for all the right reasons, \"god help us.\"<br>\r\n\"Tsk! Course god's gonna help us! That's why YOURE here!\" gramps remarked, \"you, Johnny, and Bert here are the best of us to get this job done! Janice woulda never let me go if she knew about it and let's face it... those others... they... uh... aint exact the sharpest knives in the crayon box.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm working to get my PHd!\" said Bert, \"gotta figure out a cure for this toe SOMEHOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis bit of tantalizing info still fails to provide your dad with assurance. Thinking about it, his concerns are justified. Why arent YOU getting as worried as he is?! You'd have PLENTY to worry about!<br>\r\n...Maybe it's that little good-luck charm your cute angelic mate left for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the bloody devil! You can see in the distance a certain short pink-haired girl in a cut up tank top and daisy duke shorts on the side of the road thinking her thumb out while holding a sign! The text was of a completely different language unfamiliar to you, but the purple glittery handwriting with a kiss-mark dotting the '!' was a dead-giveaway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMEDEA!! At first you were absolutely thrilled to see her, but then you remember the guys with you... and where youre going! As the truck drives closer and closer toward the little angelic hitch-hiker of love, you ponder whether or not it'd be a good idea to bring her along. It could bring up tons of questions that youre probably gonna have a tough time answering, but if your dad's suspicions were correct, you were heading for unholy territory. At least you'd have one of God's little helpers with you, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Provided going there to begin with wouldnt piss off the rest of the angels that might be out....</span></div></div>",

Even then that might be nothing compared to what other angels might do, but you can't afford to think about that right now. What you're more concerned with is the nature of this angel of death. Was it the Grim reaper or an actual angel? And if so is it still guarding that place? If it is then you're fucked. Something like that will easily wipe your group out, and if it knew about your encounter with the other angel's it might just choose you to be the first to die..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had trouble hearing any of their conversation as you focused on trying to hide your face in a non suspicious way. Something you failed at as you resorted to pulling your collar up to hide your face until the car passed her. Hopefully she hadn't seen you, else she might have taken it the wrong way as most angels seem to when they encounter you. You focused on the changing scenery as you drove onward, trying to take your mind off of any impending dooms that might be awaiting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough you hear the car pull into a driveway made of gravel. Weeds grew rampant in between the stones and made the ride more than a little bumpy. Eventually the car rolls to a stop in front of a decrepit house. It looked to be abandoned for at least a decade. A tree grew from the veranda nearly blocking off the entrance entirely. Not like it mattered, most of the windows were broken anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped out of the car slowly behind the rest of your group. Your dad was saying something you couldn't quite hear, this house just gave you bad vibes. It felt unnatural making your skin crawl. Your grandpa was the first to head for the door, leaving you at the rear to follow them. Only your Dad seemed to share your feelings on the place. Walking onto the veranda you noticed that the wood was rotted and the paint peeling. The creaking beneath your feet gave you a sense of unease, it felt like the floor was trying to swallow you whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else headed into the bedroom next to the entrance while you noticed a small door down the end of the hallway. You felt compelled to walk towards it, though every fiber in your being was screaming not to split off from the group. Especially when an apparent angel of death may be lurking around the corner. This long hallway did a fine job at increasing your tension, messages scrawled on the walls were faded away leaving nothing but a strangely smudged stain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway was warped, making it look longer than it actually was. Soon enough you found yourself in front of it making you crouch down in front of it. You wiped the dusty door clean, gripping the door handle. Trying to pull it outwards you figured that it must swing inwards. It took more than a few tries to pound the door inwards. What you didn't expect was that pushing the door open resulted in you being thrown into open air, you barely had time to scream as you plummeted downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how long you fell for, only that you had to take a breath to continue screaming before hitting the ground resulting in your immediate blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't have been to long afterwards that you awoke. Pulling your head up you noticed that you were in some sort of sacrificial chamber. Runes surrounded you, was some sort of magic at work here? Otherwise you don't know how you survived, or how any of those cultists got down here aside from the fall. Torches adorn the walls, they were lit. Someone obviously got here before you did.

Now you shall face the consequences...\" She said drawing a golden blade from the air itself. Was her mission to recover the relic?! From the way she's looking at me you, you can't help but back up. Looks like you're royally screwed as she takes a few test swings. Well, at least heaven would be free of any angels like her if it was any consolidation.  You couldn't respond due to the anger shown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room developed an odd chill that seemed to slow her down, though she still headed towards you. She still looked in the corners of her vision, almost like she thought something was there. You on the other-hand could barely move let alone think with your approaching doom. That all changed in a moment though as a cold wave of clarity washed over your mind and someone began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to learn to be patient, how else are you going to call yourself an angel? You can't even appreciate his act of kindness, for shame.\" A strangely cold voice reverberated around the room bringing the approaching angel to a standstill. Her face contorted into a look of realization as she heard his voice. She looked around wildly, almost as if afraid which was anything but what you'd learnt to expect from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show yourself Demon!\" She shouted, her voice had conviction but her face held anything but. A fact that seemed to worsen for her as she was met with laughter that surrounded the room. Oh crap, this was a demon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I don't have to do anything; especially when you lack the conviction to follow through. At this rate I think I might be better suited to take your job. After all, we both know that if I wanted it, you'd be dead.\" The voice sighed making her head jerk again. \"Sadly, I can't otherwise I'd be going against orders. You should be thanking the mortal, he's the only reason you're still alive.\" If you didn't know better, the voice sounded bored! Was he really so high up the chain of demons that he could instill fear in angel's? That set a whole new wave of terror over you, now the forces of hell wanted you? How much worse could your life possibly get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This boy?\" She said, her voice taking on that same angry tone but she still wavered. \"What does your kind want with him? Or do you think I won't kill him to get an answer out of you?!\" She sounded desperate, but she was silenced when the voice took on a much more menacing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An angel willing to kill a mortal... and you dare call us monsters. Don't think you have any choice here, if you make a move for Jonathan I'll make sure to kill you before your foot hits the ground. Don't make the mistake of thinking I can't when many of your comrades fell the same way. Your harbinger of death knew that, she up and left this place the moment she heard I was coming.\" Jesus he scared death!? The shadows started to pull towards the altar like hundreds of snakes before it was rendered as black as you imagined the void to be. Soon after the shadows started to fall away like pieces of ash revealing a man sitting on the altar. He wore a black vest over his scarlet shirt, the likes of which could only be compared to blood. His irises  held no color and were as black as the shadows the revealed him. His hair was slicked back against his head falling down to his neck, its blackness a contrast to his inhuman paleness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that he knew your name made you feel faint, he started to walk down the steps his footsteps leaving blackened stone beneath his feet. Alexandria started to move back slowly something you barely noticed as the demon approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl surely you know of my name?\" He said looking over your head at the angel who barely responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mephistopheles.\" She sounded slightly out of breath \"The Devil's right hand.\" Well, that was just about enough to make you hate your life and every event that led up to this point. Seriously, someone that fucking powerful just had to take interest in <b>you</b>?! It's like you've won the worlds worst lottery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see the man upstairs hasn't forgotten me.\" He said with a dark smile. \"Though I much prefer the lower management. Someone like you would suit it, but even we have standards.\" Oh snap, that must have hurt. \"So you may leave us, but not before I strike this day from your soul.\" He said holding his hand out before  swinging it. You turned around just in time to see her fall to the ground unconscious. He could alter an angels mind? Of course, he's 2nd to the devil himself whereas she's not even a fully fledged angel yet. Just thinking about what he could do to you is enough to leave you paralyzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lea-\" You could barely form a word, let alone a complete sentence with the panic attack you were experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. Didn't you hear that I was here for you?\" Yeah you did, and it's why you're freaking out so bad! \"OK, bad way to word it. Look I'm not going to hurt you so stop with the panic attack. After I went to the trouble of saving you from that girl you don't trust me?\" This allowed you to think for a moment, it didn't seem like trouble for him to do it but he did save you. He's also true to his word so far, he's standing right in front of you and hasn't done a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you want?\" You ask, barely resisting the urge to vomit. The fear you felt with this guy compared to Alexandria was like comparing a forest fire to a candle. It just didn't quite stack up. He sighed and offered a hand to you, one you knew you should take lest he become annoyed. He pulled you to your feet like a rag doll and gave you a few light taps on the shoulder to steady you. His eyes were endless and you couldn't help but stare into them as he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, I was told that you were having troubles with angels. Thus my sovereign sent me to find you and make you an offer.\" He said giving a brief smile. \"We can make your life normal again, no more angels to bother you or threaten you.\" Right about now the deal was sounding pretty good, but you kept your opinions in reserve until he told you the price. \"All you have to do is turn away from god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I already have, I'm an atheist.\" You said not understanding what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that is merely walking the border, what I mean is to believe in us. Our power is what changes the world as we interfere in it, not god. He would sooner leave the world to rot than interfere, we at least give humanity the right to do as they please.\" What he was saying was true, but at the same time you didn't want to commit fully to an eternity of suffering even if you were heading there anyway. \"I can understand any reservations, but be aware that you have a rare honor. My Sovereign wants to help you and will consider any requests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does he want to help me? Aren't there plenty of souls out there for the taking?\" You ask, skeptical about the apparent 'honor'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but your's has a quality the likes of which this world hasn't seen in centuries. I was told not to force your hand. The offer will always be available, and I'm sure you'll grow to see it our way.\" He said folding his arms. Your spirit was worth that much huh? Then why exactly did the angels you'd meet treat you like no one special?</span></div></div>",

You look at the room and wonder about two things why the bracelet and what he said. 'The world you enter may not have a easy escape.' You look at Alexandria and try to clime the old ladder up only to have a familiar set of shoes kick you back down Medea enter spinning her staff. \"Back foul demon I sha--- where is the demon I sensed it a second ago?\" You rub your nose in anger and pain while she looks around the room you stand up and try to sneak up the ladder but she notices you. \" oh Jonathan I see you found your way back to me want another round.\" She says like a cheap hooker you sigh in frustration and shake your head before looking at her and saying. \"No I was brought here against by my grandfather now if you don't mind I gotta get out of here before she wakes up.\" You say pointing to Alexandria who was starting to wake up you start to back up to the ladder again but a certain pink light seems to stream in from the hole great she is screwing with you again then you hear a the crack of a riding crop on the floor as her outfit changed to a dominatrix outfit. \"Now John you know it won't matter besides how do I know your not possessed or made some deal I may have to go heavy duty on you this time.\" Oh great god she's going to do it again wait where was that bright self confidence you had a little while ago. Then you start to hear grunts from behind Medea. \"What in name of The Lord happened?\" Alexandria turned her head to see you both in the act before drawing her sword again jeez repeats today. \"So the foul being didn't take his little pet with him.\" She said while pointing the blade at you as you back up into the ladder before Medea put her hand on her shoulder she swings around almost striking her with the blade Medea grabbed the sword making it vanish. \"Now Alex you don't need violence to deal with all humans this one is slowly is easy to sway once he sees the greatness of The Lord again.\" She says floating between the two of you. \"Fine then allow me to introduce him to the pathway of the holy one.\" She then grabs your shirt and drags you off shocking Medea she sighs and floats up the hole leaving you two alone now your scared beyond belief you try to walk away but a chain wraps around your leg she then summoned.</span></div></div>",

She stands back before snapping her fingures the pain vanishes and so do the nails. \"If you seal a human's body with a holy nails the demon will be forced out of the human's body and force them apart the demon is bound to the object.\" You turn around to see nothing the cross hovers with nothing bound to it just the nails you look angrily at her but she ignores it and snaps her fingures again the object vanish. \"Being I'm a low ranking angel I can't use other means to purify some one but this way works to.\" You sigh and try to walk away but your stopped by her angelic aura again. \"So how did you know lady Medeas' name boy.\" She walks in front of you your scared. \"We met earlier she thought I was possessed and she purified me.\" She seemed angry and grabbing you by the neck proved it. \" that means you broke the no touching rule again and I told you-\" \"I Know the truth about heaven!\" You shout she stares at you. \"What was that about heaven atheist?\" She asks \"Medea sent me through a 'love trance' and I had a vision of a angel named micheal and she showed me heaven only saying women can become angels Medea confirmed.\" She dropped you and the aura seemed to vanished and she dropped you. She fell to her knees. \"Great so you know the truth that most angels are whores right because those who see micheal without knowing her are those who become profits or lead the beliefs further which means you'll do something to move us forward. What did she tell you?\" You sit down and sigh. \"You won't believe me Medea didn't.\" She looks at you and frowns. \"You tell me and I'll tell you a secret okay.\" You look at her with a wtf stare \"okay why not choke me out or erase my memories.\" She stands up and turns to look at you. \"I'm not going to do that because new age angels annoy me I prefer to be around those who remember the age of lucifer those who remember him as a brother rather then a failed creation of father.\" Well that explains her action towards you. You sigh and start talking. \"She told me I was chosen to be her mate and so far it's kinda been given me a cosmic screw to me.\" She looks at you with a odd look stands up and holds out her hand. \"I am alexandria the daughter of the virtue courage I plan to be a arch angel to join the angelic army and I'm ... I'm ... <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">lesbian</font>.\" If you had a glass of water you'd do a spit take she's playing for the other team.

So much time passed that you were starting to fall back to sleep! Where was everybody? You looked at your clock. It was already 10am! You and the crew woulda finished breakfast and Uncle Jake's seventh story regarding his ex-wife's cat by now! They were never the type to sleep in during the yearly family outing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasnt a coincidence! You nursed an ungrateful angel-in-training to health and a pink cherub tried to rape you in your sleep! Maybe there IS a demon that's gonna eat you! And he's starting with your family!!<br>\r\nYou didnt have a gun (Uncle Hank had his taken away after rehab) and you didnt have pepper-spray either. You did have a decent splitting axe perfect for chopping firewood. Whether or not it'd work on the outer-worlders remains to be said, but it's all you got. You stash the axe in your jacket and head back to the tents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys?\" you called out to them as you headed to the tents, \"Guys, rise and shine! ...Guys? Mom? Uncle Bert? Aunt Christine? Grandma? Great Grandma? Great Great Grandma?\" No response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch that. No family. The tents are all empty! Everybody's gone. The cars and trailers are still here, but everybody else is gone! They couldnt have just gone off on some sort of walk without you! At the very least, they'd leave a note.<br>\r\nAnd ever since that damn angel, youre gonna start assuming the worst! Now that you found out the hard way that your whole outlook on life was wrong, you'll never be the same again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, the sky was reddish colored. There was an awful look of dusk up above. It's not even near the afternoon and already it's looking like the moon's gonna come out soon!<br>\r\n\"What in the heck?\" you muttered to yourself as you gazed up at the reddened sky. Something deep down inside you told you something bad was up. Something REALLY bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Rrrrrrrrrrr....*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap! The earth rumbled! The ground below you shook! Quick, what did they teach you in earthquake drills?!

Trees sprouted out of nowhere, pushing aside trucks and tents. Right under the table your hiding under, you were surrounded by sunflowers, posies, and pansies. Never in your life have cutesy fragrant flowers seemed so threatening. So what did they teach you in killer plant life drills? Uh... stop, drop, and roll?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT'S THIS?!! A HUMAN?!! A PESKY HUMAN DEFILING MY PRECIOUS GARDEN?!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell's bells and enchanted sea shells! An incredibly thunderous commanding voice of a goddess shook the world around you! It sounded high-pitched with a hint of brattiness, but commanding nonetheless! The aura you felt from the Voice toppled Alexandria's by a mile.What did they teach you in angry merciless god drills?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP HIDING UNDER THAT STUPID TABLE, BUG!! COME OUT! NOW!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh right. Do as youre told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...y...yes, ma'am,\" you whispered in so low a voice, you couldnt hear it... yet youre betting SHE could! You crawl out and muster up the courage to gaze up at the ginormous goddess...<br>\r\nUh... hm. She's not there. Yet her empowering aura still remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down here, you idiot!\" shouted the goddess's voice in front of you... only below. You tilted your head and saw.... the God of Twerps glaring up at you. A cute little blonde girl with no eyelids wearing a dress decorated in roots and vines, wearing a thorny rose crown on her head, and a tiny rubbed-on tattoo of the planet earth just below her left eye. Your look of fear turned into a look of dumbfoundedness as she glared up at you with her hands on her hips! However, you still felt the godlike aura towering over you, so you kept your guard up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...Hello,\" you put on a forced smile and greeted her.<br>\r\n\"Hello, bug!\" she still glared as she replied, \"enjoying your little invasion of my garden?\" The forest around you was completely covered in large vines, trees, and flowers. It was a thousand times more green than it started with! Nature went Montezuma's Revenge on this place!<br>\r\n\"What did you do to this place?\" stricken with shock and awe, you had the gall to ask.<br>\r\n\"I only restored it to it's natural luster,\" the munchkin said, \"you know... before your species made a mockery of it!\" Your eyes widened as you looked back down at the young(looking) god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Gaia,\u201d she introduced herself, \u201cthe mother of the former good-hearted guardians of this world that you mortals refer to as the Titans!\u201d Oh crap! TITANS?! THE Titans?! The Titanic rulers of the planet before they were overthrown by their children, the Gods?! HELL\u2019S BE-wait. She\u2019s a Titan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d your look of fear went to dumbfoundedness again, \u201cyoure a Titan?\u201d<br>\r\n\"The MOTHER of Titans, to be exact,\" Gaia pounded her chest and proudly announced, lifting her chin. Despite her overwhelming aura giving you the heebie jeebies, you got curious.<br>\r\n\"Er, no offense,\" you spoke, \"...but... I... always thoughts Titans would be a little... uh... bigger.\" Famous last words!<br>\r\n\"!!\" Gaia's eyebrow twitched as her face started going red, \"Y...ye....yeah... well... that's because your kind used to be incredibly tiny back then! I'd accidentally step on a few during my nature walk, they were so tiny!\" She pounded her sandal as she said that. As funny as it was to make her sweat, comic relief didnt last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You creatures have abused this sacred planet for far too long!\" she spoke with absolute disdain, \"cutting down trees, burning lively green land, robbing plant life, destroying the lives and homes of your fellow species for your own personal gain! Such a weak species capable of such destruction should be purged of this planet once and for all!\" Oh crap. A nature Titan. A human-hating nature Titan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-wait a minute there! You sh-\" vines entangled your feet!<br>\r\n\u201cLong have I and my children been sealed away by your ancestors and their precious babysitters. Long have we sit idly by and watched your ilk deface the sanctity of this planet like the filthy insects you are. Not anymore! Starting today, there'll be a new chapter in history! The green earth will be restored, your pathetic species will return back to the bottom of the food chain where it belongs, the reign of mankind will fall... and what will rise in it's stead is the glorious rule of the Titans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus Christ! This was supposed to be a friendly outing with your distant folks! How did it turn into the revenge of Elder Gods?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd though,\" Gaia tilted her head as she looked up to you, \"I thought there were more of you here. Where's everyone else?\"<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew,\" you sighed.<br>\r\nGaia just shrugged her shoulders, \"Oh well! Just means less mess.\" Gaia grinned up at you as the vines at your feet spread up your legs! \"Congratulations! You get to be the first human to embrace the wrath of the mother of Titans!\" Goodie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...GRRR!!\" Suddenly, her grin into a glare again as she quickly turned around and smacked away a projectile of blinding light aimed at her! She already saw it coming! \"Ugh! Ages later and you celestis STILL resort to wimpy sneak attacks?!\" She even already knew who tried to attack her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guardian angel was none other than that angel-to-be herself! Alexandria! And still wearing your bandage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexandria glared back. But not at Gaia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was aiming for that nosey mortal, Titan!\" Oh... she's harsh! Alexandria then turned her head to you, \"I gave you a direct order to stay out of my affairs!\" Ugh... why'd SHE have to save you?<br>\r\n\"It wasnt exactly my choice!\" you tried to explain, \"the hell was I to know your mission involved the fucking Titans?!\"<br>\r\n\"Didnt I tell you to watch your mouth?\"<br>\r\n\"Watch THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia snickered as she stepped toward Alexandria. \"So the celestis hired a low-rank lackie to thwart the Titans' Dream World, eh? Where's your halo, little missy?\"<br>\r\n\"As if I need to explain myself to the likes of a dethroned god that can grow everything but herself!\" Alexandria snapped.<br>\r\n\"Have it your way, rookie!\" the brat quipped, \"how's about you scamper along and deliver a message to your boss? Tell him that this is between humans and Titans. And Heaven itself will crumble if they get between us again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were at eachother's throat, you felt obligated to take the opportunity to escape! Gaia was at a pretty far distance from you. And you still had your axe. You could probably cut the vines and make a break for it. Lord knows you dont wanna be anywhere NEAR a fight between a Titan and an angel! This wasnt your business anyway! So why bother being where you werent wanted?<br>\r\nThen again, maybe you shouldnt run. Maybe Gaia'll get p'oed and vent her anger on you if you try to run! Then again, she was gonna vent her anger on you anyway, so what's the difference?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to think fast. And if you DID escape, you'd better hope you can RUN fast too!</span></div></div>",

Currently I'm wearing dress pants and a dress shirt. I am waiting for my date in this resturaunt she requested. I knew nothing of the girl. The only thing I knew was that she was late. But, I heard the door open at the entrance. \"I believe I have a dinner reservation...\" said a very soothing voice. I looked over and nearly fainted. I saw my blind date, and man was she exotic! One thing was her body; DD cup breasts and wide hips. Her skin was deeply tanned. She had long brown hair that was down to her hips. She wore this strange-looking hair clip that resembled a cobra. Her face, was possibly more beautiful that her body. Her eyes were a deep blue that the ocean would be jealous of. Her hair covered one of these beautiful eyes. On her face were these black markings that were foreign to me. The dress she was wearing was bright green and hugged her body correctly. She prepared to sit, but I got up. Like a true gentlemen, I pulled out her seat and she sat down with a small giggle. I sat back down and greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be my blind date\" she said. Her accent was new to me but it seemed very nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am\" I replied. \"My name is Tyler. It is a pleasure to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Xandra. It is a pleasure as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued to talk until our waiter came. I told her everything about me. Well, mostly everything. Xandra though was exotic, just like her. She grew up for a few years in a rainforest in South America before leaving to the U.S. She lives far in the woods but takes a routine trip to the city. Her parents are still together; which I find quite rare in most teens. She had a younger sister but she died before they came here. That memory caused her to cry, but I was there for her. I think she was starting to like me. I actually hoped that. I know what I said about going on a blind date, but WOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I know the first one was kinda short but I will make them longer in the next ones.)</span></div></div>",

A mother, father, and one boy took care of a farm that they grow food on that they sold in Negav. They almost never made more than they spent and often broke even. they grow common foods from other worlds and today was harvest day. the father picked and harvested the crop. The mother cleaned it. And the boy took it to Negav to be sold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now take good care of this crop boy. It's how we make a living.\" the father said to his boy only 16 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take good care of it. Negav is only a day away so I'll be back in three days.\" The Boy said proudly as he left in cart pulled by the family horse. the mother and father waved they're boy goodbye not even knowing if he was safe or would return home.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was farm boy who grow up in the world of Felarya. Many times he had heard stories of Giant Nagas and Dryads eating people alive but where he lived it was rare to find even a normal sized Naga. Alex took the path he always took to Negav and would sell his goods near the Dimensional Gate where it was safe. As Alex went down the path to Negav he heard a strange noise coming from from the forest along the left side of the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he even knew what was going on a girl butt naked jumped out and ran in front of him. She was beautiful with her long pink hair and matching eyes. Her body was young and tight but she still had to be older than Alex. She ran over giving you a great look at her very full chest and cute, round ass. Before you knew it she jumped into your cart and hide under some blankets your mother made to sell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then about 5 or 6 men ran out and stopped in front of your cart and scared the horse. One was very tall and strong looking, he walked up to you and gave you an angry look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey farm boy. You seen a pink hair fairy come through here?\" He said looking right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pink hair fairy? I saw one just a bit ago. She was very cute girl and she ran to the forest to the right. I almost hit her with my horse.\" You said to the scary man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks boy. Now get lost before I steal that horse.\" He said as him and the other men ran into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to head off again and once you were a way off you looked back at your cart and removed the blankets where the girl was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're safe now.\" You said as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks human. I guess I'll not eat you for this.\" she said as she sat back giving you a great view of her body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat me? Oh right, the men said you were a fairy. Why is a fairy being hunted?\" You asked not really knowing how to talk to a known man eater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took some of their gold and gems. I need it for my hobby.\" The Fairy said still sitting in your cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hobby? I thought Felaryan monsters only thought about eating?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off I am not a monster. I am a fairy and a strong one so watch what you say or I'll swallow you alive. And I make magic jewelry.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this armlet.\" She said holding out her arm for you to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a gold armlet on with a weird gem inside. It was the only thing she had on. Other than the armlet she was completely naked. You couldn't help but look more at her chest then her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it do?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made this because I was almost eaten once. It makes it so i can't die if some one eats me.\" She said still riding along with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will come in handy. I wish I could have something like that.\" You said watching the road more than her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the fairy girl put a neckless on you and you jumped a little as she did. The neckless was silver and also had the same kind of gem that her armlet did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you won't die if someone or something eats you. Now we are even for saving me.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you..... Sorry but I don't know your name.\" You said looking over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Samantha. Who are you?\" Samantha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My names is Alex.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Alex. I better go. You're almost to Negav and a fairy like me would be in trouble if I fallow you.\" Samantha said as she jumped out of the cart and ran into he woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never seen a fairy before and as she left you noticed her wings. they were like dragon flies. But her right wing was ripped in half and mostly gone. Alex knew that a fairy with a broke wing would be unable to do magic. You hope she will be alright alone in the forest. you came up to Negav and went into the city ready to sell your goods.....</span></div></div>",

A little fruit and a blanket was left, but it was getting late and Alex needed to head back to the Farm before it would get dangerous. He crossed the bridge leading out of Negav and onto the path to the farm. As he left the bridge she looked out into he woods thinking he saw something moving. He never liked it when something was moving in the woods. In Felarya it could be anything from a hungry Dridder to a sexy Succubus all ready to eat him alive. But then he remembered the Neckless that Fairy girl gave him. What was her name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Alex could even think the thing moving in the woods jumped out onto the cart next to the boy making him almost all off the cart and his horse almost fell over too. It was the same Fairy as this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alex. So what are you doing now?\" she asked in the most casual way anyone could after something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean what am I doing? You almost gave me a heart attack, what if you were a Naga or something?\" You asked still a little startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you would be in my stomach and wouldn't be asking my stupid questions like that.\" She said with a smart ass tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you even here Samantha? Shouldn't you be off doing Fairy things?\" You said finally remembering her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think Fairy things are? I can do anything I want, and if you want to put together with all the Fairies maybe I should act like one and swallow you alive.\" she said looking right at you and licking her cute lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't mean anything rude but... I thought humans are only thought of as food and Fairies are one of our most feared predators?\" You asked not knowing what she would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true, I mean I would love right now to swallow you whole but sadly I can't. My wing is ripped so my magic is to weak to have me grow and eat you.\" Samantha said looking a bit sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to hear that. I mean I am glad you're not going to eat me. But I hate to see a pretty girl sad.\" You said not knowing what you said until you already said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think I'm pretty? Maybe I won't eat you once my wing heals..... Maybe.\" She smiled a she moved a little closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could help you but I don't think my dad or mom would like me helping out a Fairy.\" You said keeping an eye on her as she sat even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom and Dad? How old are you Alex?\" She asked giving you a weird look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm 16. Why? You look about my age. Not that I'm think of anything wrong I'm just saying.\" You said as you blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm 21. You're just a kid and a young one at that.\" She said a bit mad and then moved back way from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're 21? I though you were 15 or something? You look far to young for being 21.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I look young. I try to keep my body young you know. Now if you don't mind I think I'm going to go. I don't need a human to tell me I'm old or anything like that.\" Samantha said as she started to get down from the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Samantha..... How about I take you to my family farm? You can stay in the barn until your wing is better? I'm the only one who works in the barn so my parents won't see you.\" you said trying to stop Samantha from leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I hate to be in someones debt. How will I ever pay you back?\" She asked looking at you with her big pink eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to do that. That's what friends do.\" You said blushing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha smiled at you than moved back over to you. she put her arm around you and moved in for a quick peck on your cheek. Your face turned a full red color and you looked over at The fairy who just kissed you. She was giving you a look that said kiss me and you moved in to kiss her back. But just as you did she pushed you away and started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! Man Alex you are so easy to mess with. I think I will stay for a few days. I'll be all better after I rest for 3 or 4 days and after that I will have to get back home. I live in the woods next to Negav so we can still see each other.\" She smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha seemed like a cool girl even for a man eating fairy. You told her to hide under the last unsold blanket and you made to your farm and moved the cart into the barn. Samantha looked over at you poking her head out from under the blanket but you told her to stay down until you closed the doors tot he barn. You ran out and shut the doors leaving the fairy alone as you headed inside for dinner and to give your parents the money you made.....</span></div></div>",

Alex had to hurry to Negav if he wanted to get a good spot to sell the food and get the best supplies. As he sat down in the front of the cart and got the horse ready to go.

Then she looks into your eyes, still holding you effortlessly against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be a fine mate,\" she coos, \"I may have to fight the others off when they see you in order to keep you as mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to tell her that you'll stay hers regardless, but before you can speak, her large mouth overwhelms yours in a powerful kiss, a surprisingly large and strong tongue shoving its way into your mouth.  She moans loud in her enthusiasm, her lips smacking wetly against your face.  It is without a doubt the most enthusiastic kiss you've ever been involved in.  After what seems like an eternity of sucking face with Selina...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had never been a big man, but her? She made you look TINY! She was all muscle, she looked like someone who worked out, a whole lot, and not in a way of wanting to just stay skinny either. She had a noticeable chest, C cup or so in proportion. But that was over shadowed again not only by the rest of her build but by the fact that she was about twenty feet tall! You swallowed, hard, now very nervous, and that brought a mildly amused smile to her face. The rest of her was of a relatively pale, cream colored complexion. You got the impression she got a lot of sun but just did not tan. And then there was the striking red hair and green eyes that adorned her face and head. She was massive, but she was also quite stunning to look at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, who, are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Aurora. I am of the Amazon nation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazon's?\" But aren't amazon's just a story, you thought to yourself.

Most will tell you that there is no prize, NO PRIZE that is worth selling your soul to the devil over. But most have never had the opportunity. And those that HAVE might say otherwise.<br>\r\nLucifer was an angel of pride and irresistible charm. It knew what you desired. It knew how badly you desired it. It knew how to tempt you with it. And it knew there was little you could do to resist it's oh-so-generous offer outside of divine intervention. It has tempted millions throughout the ages that were smarter, stronger, and far more clever than you. You were just a kid, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began just before your graduation of elementary school. Before finally passing the 6th grade and moving on to middle school where you'd finally be qualified to call yourself a 'teenager'. Your friends were excited and couldnt wait to finally graduate to the 7th grade. You on the other hand were in no mood to celebrate. You werent in a mood to do much of anything except worry. Worry for your little sister's life. She's still in that hospital, clinging hopelessly to life. You always walked with her across the street on your way to school. It was your obligation as a big brother to protect her and make sure nothing bad happened to her. The day you had to stay home sick and she decided to walk herself to school like a big girl... she was hit by a speeding car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many wounds, so many broken bones, so much blood loss. The doctors said the damage was critical and that she might not have long to live. She grows weaker as the days go by. She wont have long to live. At this rate, she might not live long enough to see you graduate.<br>\r\nYou promised you'd protect her! You couldnt bear to let your little sister die! You'd give anything to save her! ANYTHING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the nightmare began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mi....chael.... Mi....chael...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the cold absolute darkness, you heard a voice call out to you. It sounded young and feminine.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmiiiiicchael!! Mmmmicccchhaaeelll!!!\"<br>\r\nAnother voice called out to you. It sounded harsh and raspy, like it had the worst case of strep throat!<br>\r\n\"MICHAEL!! MIICHAEEEELLL!!!!!! MICHAEL!!!\"<br>\r\nAnother voice roared which sounded deep and grizzly as it the shook the invisible ground around you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore voices called out your name from all directions! Up down left right, EVERYWHERE a 'Michael'!<br>\r\nSuddenly, big red glowing eyes lit up the darkness. Pairs of red eyes all around you, staring deep into your timid body.<br>\r\nFor the first time in your natural life, you felt absolute unrivaled soul-chilling terror. You didnt really notice how badly you were sweating though you did feel your stomach tying in knots! You didnt know what those things were and you hoped that you'd never find out. Each one of them knows your name. Imagine what else they know about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a bright soothing light shines in the middle of this cold darkness. It felt soothing and comforting, as if assuring that everything's alright. But something deep down told you not to relax. The blissful light shining was not a good one. You continued to tremble in the bright heavenly placebo.<br>\r\nNot long after, the chilling darkness faded away and you found yourself in the middle of a fancy garden. With plenty of statues all over the place. Each one had an expression of horror in their face with their jaws open if they were in the middle of screaming. Before you could question it, a warm alluring light appeared on the grass in front of you and shined toward the direction of the gazebo in the middle of the garden. Like a naive lamb blindly being led to slaughter, you follow the lit up grass directing to the gazebo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source of that alluring light came from a beautiful young girl in the blue and white dress sitting aside a table sipping tea. <br>\r\nThe girl, who looked who looked to be your age, even from a distance, was breath-taking. You can see her golden-blonde hair sparkling with joy, no friggin lady-shampoo commercial could secure a set of hair so shiny and gorgeous and alive and not having a single breaking strand (yes, you can notice!). Her lovely serene peach-skinned face lacked any unnecessary wrinkles, zits, blackheads, and looked incredibly smooth, your hand BEGGED to stroke her cheek.. let alone did your lips beg to press against her soft smooth cherry red lips!<br>\r\nHer bright shining sky-blue eyes gazed at you hypnotically, nearly sending your feeble mind in a trance as you dumbly approached her. Something deep down told you to keep your distance from her, but the rest of your body didnt listen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!!\" You suddenly flinched when she flicked her golden hair and smiled your way. In a split second flashed the sight of six big beautiful feathery wings sprouting from her back. It was only a quick second, but the image remained in your head.<br>\r\nYou spotted her necklace which had a medallion with an unfamiliar V-like sigil engraved on it. Something deep down told you to were WAY too close to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael!\" she spoke in cutesy adorably uppity voice that warmed your heart (yet chilled something deep down), \"I've been expecting you! Please, sit down! Sit!\"<br>\r\nStill speechless at her presence, you nodded and sat in the chair opposite of her. You swallowed hard as the heavenly aura about her entwined your cold body.<br>\r\n\"So...\" you finally muster the courage to speak, \"...who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost drops the cup when you said that! One of the orbs in her blue eyes widened almost with surprise!<br>\r\n\"Wh...who am I?\" she repeated with a surpised smile, \"who am I?\" She set her cup down and stood up, \"WHO. AM. I. Ahahahah!\" She started her laugh a gentle, yet ecstatic laugh. \"Hahahaha! Who am I! Youre joking! Youre clearly joking. Dear child... you already know who I am. I need no introduction! Only someone who has never stepped outside or at the very least read a book or turned on the tv in his entire life would not know who I am!\"<br>\r\nBefore you could deny it, something deep down within you had a very good guess who she is... and is scared shitless because of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went by many names throughout the ages and I doubt you never heard a single one of them! I have seen many nations rise and fall. Witnessed many events that revolutionized history as we know it. I was written in many books and poems, songs, television shows, you name it! Bringer of the Dawn. The Morning Star. The Prince of Light.\"<br>\r\n*zip*<br>\r\nSuddenly, she zipped at lightning speed and appeared right behind you!<br>\r\n\"The Angel of Beauty,\" she whispers in your ear!<br>\r\n*zip*<br>\r\n\"WHOA!!\" you shouted in surprised when she reappeared inches away from your face!<br>\r\n\"The Great Seducer,\" her soothing breath blew in your face as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked back toward her chair, \"And the best damn fiddler player the world has ever known! ...ER... the SECOND.\" She then turned back to you and grabbed the folds of her dress and curtsied before sitting back in her chair, \"...Pleased to meet you. Hope you guess my name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe something deep down was right! You knew EXACTLY who 'she' was! As much as you wanted to deny the existence of the greatest fallen angel known to man, you couldnt.<br>\r\nNoticing something clicked in your head, 'Lucy' smirked as she sipped her tea. You could almost hear the faint screaming of thousands of tortured mortals in that cup!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knocked the table over and dash out of the gazebo like a bat out of... well anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youre welcome to leave anytime,\" you hear her voice echo in your mind, \"I wont keep you here against your will. ...But do you wish to deny yourself the only chance to save your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped running. The bitch knew about your sister. You turned around to see Lucy already standing before you smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you questioned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly as I said,\" she spoke, \"your sister's condition is critical. Fate has decided not to be generous with her. By the time you wake up from this wonderful dream... she's going to die.\"<br>\r\nYou paled at those words. You wanted to scream your head off at her, but youre not that stupid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, I can save her,\" Lucy said, \"I guarantee you that with a wave of my hand, she'll make a startling recovery! And then she'll be right as rain and be back at school dodging stray cars in no time!\" Smart mouthed...<br>\r\n\"You... can seriously do that?\"<br>\r\n\"You already know the answer to that question!\" the prideful angel said with a wink, \"and I think you know what I want in return!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE CATCH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My soul,\" you whispered in horror.<br>\r\n\"BINGO!\" she snapped her in your face, \"but dont worry. I wont claim it NOW. I dont need it YET. I'm gonna give you plenty of time to spend with that brat, to appreciate how lucky she is to have a big bro like you. And after 6 years from this day... right after you graduate high school... I'll come back. To claim what's owed to me.\" 6 years. That's quite a bit of time... but then it's an ETERNITY! You wont get to experience becoming an adult before your soul becomes doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... if what's she's saying is true.... if you refuse, your sister will....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem! Mikey? Wakey wakey!\" she derailed your train of thought, \"we dont have much time left! I'm a very busy woman! Will you accept my ever so generous offer? Or that poor little girl not important enough to you?!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After thinking for a few seconds, you reach the conclusion that you don't have any other option if you want your little sister to live. Sure, you could wait and see if the medics could help her, but then it might be too late and she might not make it. You certainly don't like the idea of making a deal with the Lady of Hell, Lucifer, but, right then, it seemed like the only thing you could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...deal.' you said through clenched teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sorry, could you repeat what you just said, please?' she toyed with you, very well aware of what you had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I said that we have a deal.' you repeated, unwilling to turn the most dangerous demon into your enemy with your sister's life on the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's very good to hear, Michael. It's good to see you're so wise even when you're so young.' She mocked and acknowledged at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't get me wrong. I'm not giving my soul out of fear, as many have surely done when they were here. I'm an atheist. I don't believe in God's existence, and that translates into me not believing in your existence as well. But I've seen what you can do, and you're my best choice. If you want my soul in exchange for my sister's life, take it. Six years by her side are worth it. But first, we need to set some terms to this deal, and that isn't negotiable.' You swear you didn't know how you managed to talk to the fallen angel like that, but you certainly hope she doesn't get angry or it's your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, instead of angry, she seemed somewhat amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Some nerve you have to talk to me like that, HUMAN. It's been ages since anyone has done it. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">More accurately, since I was cast out of Heaven...</font>' her face flinched for a moment and then Lucy, caressing her golden hair, turned to you and continued speaking. 'Well then, let's hear those terms YOU need to set in order to feel safer.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, no. Those terms weren't for you to feel safer, at least not about yourself. You knew that if she wanted, your soul would already be in her hands. Those terms were meant for another thing even more important than your own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'First thing: you'll heal my sister fully, not only from the injuries of the accident. This means, if she was going to have cancer, or she has a broken bone from before, you'll heal her. Second: you will not play any role in my sister's future, nor will any of your underlings. After this, you'll leave her alone from your presence. Third: you will not harm my sister, even if indirectly. Fourth: her soul will not be for you. She will stand by God's Right for all Eternity. These terms aren't negotiable as well.' you were shaking in fear, a fear so primary and absolute that, were you in any other situation, you would have already collapse. But the vivid image of your sister laying in her hospital bed, unable to do anything but trying to fight a hopeless battle against Fate, gave you the strength and resolve you needed for this inhuman task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed hard and looked at Lucy, who seemed a bit off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Strange. I thought some of the terms would be related to you. Humans tend to prioritize themselves over anything. Strange and interesting indeed. Very well. I shall give you what you desire. I, the Morning Star, swear upon mine name to fulfill the deal made with thee.' She said the last part using an archaic form of speech you had only read about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And that's it. Now is my turn to work.' She closed her blue eyes and extended a hand toward the sky, which changed from blue to red in a moment before returning to the soothing blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes (or so you thought), she opened her eyes a gazed directly into yours, like she was staring into your very soul (and you could swear she was doing just that, as if she was checking the quality of an item after buying it) and said the three words that made you happier than ever before:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It is done.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'F-for real?' you asked without thinking too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you, per chance, doubting my words?' her voice turned too hellish for you likening and you saw her right hand turn into a claw as she rested her head on it and grinned a bit angrily, with the cheek on the palm. She had also spread her six wings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'N-no!' you shouted, afraid. 'Of course not! It was just... too good to believe. I'm very sorry.' You bowed your head., hoping that that would calm her down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is that so? Well, in any case, you are forgiven. Funny, I think it's the first time I've ever said that.' She giggled and, for a moment, you caught a glimpse of her as a normal girl. However, you were too much aware that that was just a lie. A lie she had been improving since millenniums ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I believe it is time for you to wake up. Our business here it's finished.' She turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you.' You said sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Save it. You might want to wait until your soul is mine. However, the thanks are.. appreciated.' You could have sworn she had blushed, if just for a nanosecond. 'Oh, and by the way, if God notices that Fate hasn't gone the way he wanted, and believe me, he always notices, he will probably send someone to... deal with it. But, do not fear. My underlings will... protect you and your sister. That is, without breaking the second term of our deal <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Though I'm not very sure they'll like the job</font>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What---' Your complaint was silenced when she approached you and gave you a kiss on the forehead, standing a bit on her tiptoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now, go with my blessings. We'll see each other in six years. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Or perhaps sooner...</font>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up with you clothes completely soaked and an expression of fear and amazement on your face, or so you felt. You sat on the bed and gently massaged your temples, making sure that hadn't been an extremely realistic dream. However, you were very sure it wasn't a dream (at least, not an usual one) because of the lingering sensation of Lucy's cherry lips pressed against your forehead. Sure, some dreams were so real that you still felt the sensations even after you had awakened, but you were damn sure dreams didn't left a lipstick mark on your forehead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got out your bedroom, entered the bath, closed the door and, having abandoned the idea of sleeping, washed your face and wiped the lipstick gently (just in case the Lady of Hell was watching you!). While you were still drying your face and trying to take all the information at once, you heard someone hit the door REALLY hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Michael! Michael!! Get out!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your mother. You sighed, finished drying your face and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, mom? What is it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's... it's...' she said out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mom, calm down. Breathe and then tell me what is it.' You tried to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did as she was told and resumed talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's your sister! Elisa! The doctor said... he said that she was recovering!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, you knew this. But it was still shocking to hear it. Your sister, who had been just a few heartbeats away from dying, was now starting to recover, and soon she would be just as she was before the accident, perhaps even better, and all thanks to you. That made your eyes well up with tears and embrace your mother while both of you sobbed and cried in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hurry up and get ready! Your father is getting the car ready. We're going to the hospital right now!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and ran to your room. After that, you dressed up quickly and got down the stairs three by three, You got in the car as quickly as you had done all of those things and all three of you departed toward the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half an hour the trip took was the longest one in your whole life (excluding the time that you had been with Lucy, obviously). When you reached the hospital, the doctor made you wait in the waiting room for another half and hour, and your heart was racing like crazy. When the doctor finally came to talk to you, you felt relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mr. Evans, Mrs. Evans. I'm very happy to inform you that your daughter is recovering at an amazing speed.' He said, with a faint smile in his face. You felt a bit bad when he didn't bother to mention you, but you stood still and continue listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In fact, it's such an amazing speed that it almost looks like.. well, I shouldn't say this, being a doctor and all, but... it almost looks like magic. It must be that new surgery method. We definitely need to adapt it to our whole hospital right away.' The last part wasn't about your sister, but you couldn't care less. She was okay! She was recovering! That was all that mattered. You silently thanked Lucy again and continue to listen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She is sleeping right now, but I believe in two or three days, maybe even less at this rate, you will be able to talk to her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can we see her now, doctor?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Of course. Please, follow me.' He started to walk and you all followed him. When you entered Elisa's room and saw her sleeping so peacefully, her life no longer threatened, you started to cry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother kindly embraced you as she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It is a miracle. This is God's doing, no doubt. Thank you, Lord.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, mom,' you said bitterly. 'God had no part in this. That, I assure you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Michael, I understand that you don't believe in Him, but please, do not say that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Whatever. I'm not going to ruin this moment</i>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days went by and your sister got out of the hospital. You greeted her crying and embraced her with all your might, a gesture she returned the same way. That same week, she resumed school, and you made sure to go with her all the times. You trusted Lucy, after all she had done, but you didn't want to take any chances with Fate ever again. A certain day, while you were walking to school with her, you got a weird feeling and itching all over your body. Somebody was watching you, or at least you REALLY felt that way. But was the feeling true, or it was just your imagination?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then a few seconds later the fearsome aura was watching you again. Then the fearsome aura seemed to dimmer as if it was dozing off. Then the fearsome aura gleamed brighter as if forcing itself to stay awake. But then the fearsome aura decided 'Screw it' and glimmer out and you could hear almost hear snoring in the distance on cue with the glimmer out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. That was weird,\" you said to yourself.<br>\r\n\"What's weird, Mike?\" your sis asked you.<br>\r\n\"Um... n...nothing!\" you lied to her, hoping to keep her from learning the truth of her miraculous recovery as long as possible, \"let's hurry. We dont want to be late.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, Mike!\"<br>\r\nAs the two of you headed to school, the fact that your soul is sold clouds your head and will continue to cloud your head for a long time. You shoulda known better than to make such a deal with the Devil, but it was either that or lose your sister. Sooner or later, she had to know the truth. But until then, you were gonna keep it mum until you could find a way to explain it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year had past since that horrible night. Youre halfway through the end of jr high and you still remember the deal. Your attitude towards others changed a bit and you distanced yourself from your friends since. Sure, you were confident enough to join the school's soccer team, but you never hung out with any of them after the game. Heck, you didnt so much as join them for the pizza party after winning the city championship!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and dont think Lucy hasnt forgotten about you! During your thirteenth birthday party, your mom said a friend from your school came by and dropped off a nice little present. The words 'From Lucy' was a dead giveway but to avoid suspicion, you had to open your birthday present in front of EVERYBODY! She got you a nice little necklace with a V-shaped sigil you remembered her wearing in your nightmare. With it was a note that read 'Hope you didnt forget! Love, Lucy<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/devil.png\" alt=\"*Devil*\" title=\"Devil\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">!'<br>\r\n\"Who's Lucy?\" your mom asked.<br>\r\n\"Uh... just a friend who I owe a favor too!\" was your best response that may/may not be true.<br>\r\n\"What did she hope you didnt forget, Mike?\" your sis just HAD to ask!<br>\r\n\"Just the little favor. Nothing big,\" was definitely not true!<br>\r\nThe next morning, you tossed that damn necklace in the lake! But later that night, you found it sitting next to your bed completely clean and dry with a note that read 'DONT EVER DO THAT AGAIN! Love, Lucy<img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/devil.png\" alt=\"*Devil*\" title=\"Devil\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">!' You lowered your head with a mixture of shame and fear, making it even harder to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, waking the hell up was no issue thanks to the fearsome aura you felt inches away on your very bed with you!<br>\r\nYour basic animal instinct assume a fearsome demonic grizzly beast staring hungrily at you ready to sink it's jaws into your throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zzzzz....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or taking a nap. Still, considering that the aura was still fearsome, you took no chances and slowly crept away until you finally got off your bed. Fortunately, the demon didnt follow you. It didnt even wake up. You gazed questionably at the large lump in your bed hogging all your blanket and snoring away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zz...zz.z....ZZZZZ....zzz... zzZz. ZZ! ZZZZ!! zzzZZZZZ<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><i><b>ZZZZZZZZZ</b></i></font>ZZzzzzz!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus!!\" you gasped in horror at the sudden beastly snore that didnt sound like something a human throat could make! It left chills down your spine. Despite this, you got way too damn curious and gotten closer to the sleeping demon wrapped in blanket!<br>\r\nAgainst your better judgement, you pulled back the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes at the tall slighty corpulent brunette in a black nightgown with cartoony pictures of little sleeping devils on it. The fearsome aura was overflowing from this girl! Despite this, wondering what she's doing in your bed outranked the animal instinct!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wake up! Get up!\" you said, constantly shaking her around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zzzz....e..r... wh... huh?\" she took her slowly waking up as she turned her head your direction. Even after shaking off the sleep, she stared at you sleepily barely opening her widened brown eyes (possibly enlarged like she was in a dream state!) as you noticed the thick dark bags under her eyes.<br>\r\n\"...Oh... hey,\" she said lazily with little to no care. She even tried to go back to sleep until you shook her up again.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing in my bed?!\" you questioned her.<br>\r\n\"Sleeping,\" she lazily answered.<br>\r\n\"I know THAT!\" you almost raised your voice, \"why are you here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just stared at you for a couple seconds registering that question like her brain was on dial-up \"...Oh... Oh! That Lucy girl sent me.\"<br>\r\n\"Lucifer?\" you questioned.<br>\r\n\"Yeah...what time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed at the clock. It was almost time to get up and get ready for school! Dang it! Lucifer FINALLY sends somebody to protect you TODAY of all days?!<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"Bel....uh...\" she squinted her eyes a little as if forgetting her name, \"...Bel... something. I forget.\" You facepalmed, but quickly registered a possibility who this particular demon might be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belphegor?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! That's it! Heh,\" Bel laughed a little, \"...could you massage my neck? I think I pulled something there in my sleep.\" Awesome. Lucy possibly had thousands up thousands of suitable demons to watch over you... and she chooses one that represents SLOTH?! Then again, should you really be all that surprised? Lucifer is well known to be a cruel manipulative dick! This might be part of her sick sense of humor! She's probably laughing her ass off, watching you suffer with Bel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bel,\" you tried to calm yourself down, \"you gotta get up. If my parents find out youre here in my room, they're gonna freak and-\"<br>\r\n\"Eh, nevermind, I'm sure the pain'll go away soon. Zzzz...\" she actually fell asleep in your grip!<br>\r\n\"Bel! Wake up!\" you get tired of her so fast!<br>\r\n\"Zz..w..wh...what?\"<br>\r\n\"This isnt the time to be sleeping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... yeah, youre right,\" she agreed, \"I'm supposed to be protecting you from the Fallen.\" The Fallen?<br>\r\n\"The Fallen? Who are the Fallen?\" you began to tense up worrying about that name.<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you in a couple hours... g'night!\" she pulled herself out of your grip and lied back on your bed, immediately going back to sleep!  Man was your blood-pressure going off the charts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bel! Bel, get up! Get up now!\" no matter how much you shook her or shouted in her ear, she was not getting up! She was much heavier than she looked, so just rolling her over was nearly beyond your strength! \"C'mon, Bel! Wake up! Wake up before-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael! It's time to get up! Breakfast is ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze up when you heard your mom call out! You were not only running out of patience, you were running out of time! How are you gonna explain a girl sleeping in your bed refusing to budge, let alone that girl being a demonic embodiment of the Sin of Sloth!<br>\r\n\"Bel, c'mon you gotta get up!\" you whispered to her, still shaking her, \"if mom sees you, I'm gonna get in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zzzz...\" she curled up in your blanket, offering no care.<br>\r\n\"Bel please wake up!\" you still pleaded and still shook her, \"we dont have much time!\"<br>\r\n\"Zz...mm...MMmmph!\" Bel began to squirm, pushing your struggling away, which kinda made you mad!<br>\r\n\"I said wake up! WAKE UP!\" then finally with one hard push!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUMP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell off the bed and landed on the floor! You flinched in fear hoping you didnt hurt her... or piss her off!<br>\r\n\"Bel, Bel I'm sorry! I didnt mean to do that! Are you alri-\"<br>\r\n\"ZZZZZZZZ!!!!\" she's STILL sleeping! The regret for your action immediately vanished! Now you wanted to KICK her awake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael! Didnt you hear me? Breakfast is ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didnt have much time left at this point! Better think of something fast!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You turned around quickly and watched your surroundings, but you didn't saw anything strange. Furthermore, the feeling had disappeared. Sensing you had stopped, your little sister turned around and asked with a worried face:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Michael? Is something wrong?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not at all.' You smiled to calm her (and yourself) down and resumed walking. After you had dropped her at her school, you went to your own, to where you arrived ten minutes later. A new building, one which you had only seen a few times, stood high, meaning a whole new future for you. Yes, only six years of that future would be yours, but you had already decided to enjoy them as fully as you could, knowing that, after you had graduated, you would exchange your life and soul for your sister's, a deal that you wouldn't ever take back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked through the hallways until you found your classroom. You entered, found your desk (which was next to the window on the last row) and sat, thinking about what you had lived the past few days. However, your trail of thought was soon interrupted by one of your friends, Josh. Josh was always the best of the year in all physical activities, and was in almost all of the sport clubs. He was tall and muscular, with short, straight, brown hair and blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey man! Come here and gimme a hug!' he said while doing so. 'I've heard your sister got better just the past Saturday! Man, I'm so happy for you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Can't...breathe..' you muttered while tapping his shoulder. He was VERY strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'God, Josh, release the poor guy. Nobody deserves a death like that.' said another of your friends, Shin, appearing behind Josh. Shin, opposed to Josh, was and intellectual guy who always got top scores. He was about your height, with green eyes and shoulder length, straight, light black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh released you and looked playfully at Shin. 'I'll let that one slip just for today!' he exclaimed. Shin gave him the same look and looked at you more serious. 'But, man, no kidding, good for you. We were very worried when we heard about Elisa, but seeing you act like... you were devoid of life, it was harsh. We didn't know how to cheer you up. Good to have you back.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at them, and with tears in your eyes, said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you for everything, guys. Really, you are the best friends I could ever hope for.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh put his arm around your neck and smiled. 'C'mon, don't go crying on us.' 'Yeah, wouldn't be good for ANY of us.' Said Shin, also smiling. 'Besides, now we finally are 7th graders! We have a new life ahead of us!' When you were about to reply, the teacher entered in the classroom and everyone went to their desks. The teacher was a middle-aged woman who seemed to have a way with booze. Hell, you coulda sworn you saw a hip flask sticking out of her red purse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay class, so I'm your English teacher this year, Mrs. Renard. And today there's a new student in this academy and in this class. Please, enter.' she beckoned someone to enter the classroom and you saw a stunningly beautiful girl entering. She had very long raven-black straight hair, and a perfect face. In fact, all of her looked like it was made to be perfect. You thought that her measures must have been 90-60-90.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Introduce yourself, please.' said Mrs. Renard. The girl nodded and and faced all of you, and then said with a beautiful (as well!) voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My name is Marie Laurent. I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.' she said in a formal way. Her name sounded French, or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's see... Marie, sit on that free desk.' She pointed... next to you, at your right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn, you're one lucky son of a bitch!' whispered Josh, who was in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat next to you and, during the next hours of lecture, didn't say one word, she just wrote something down on her notebooks every now and then, and not even during the lunch break uttered a word to others, besides the answers to the questions the other girls and guys asked her. When the bell rang, marking the end of class, she packed her things and went out of the classroom, but a piece of paper fell of her pocket. You grabbed it and opened the mouth to tell her what had happened, but she was nowhere to be seen. Judging that it wouldn't hurt you, you read it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Please, meet with me behind school when school is over.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered who would be the one supposed to receive that, but you kept on reading:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'To Michael Evans''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was for you! But how did she knew your name? She must have memorized in the roll call. You wondered what could be the matter that had made her summon you after school, but your thoughts all said the same thing: a confession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>No, there's no way.</i>' But, just in case, you decided to go. Who knows? Maybe she would become your girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou packed your things quickly and went behind the school, where you only had to wait a few minutes for her to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good afternoon. I'm glad you came.' she greeted smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart started beating faster. She was very, very beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good afternoon. Wh- what did you call me here for?' you were VERY nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'd like you to tell me one thing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wh- wh- what is it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Would you...' you were expectant of what she would say next. '... please tell me about how your sister was saved?' Your heart stopped beating for an eternity, or so it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It was... thanks to the doctors.' you said with your throat almost totally dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No it wasn't. She should have died, and you know it.' her words were giving you fear and rage, but mostly fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who.. who are you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My name is Fate. I'm here by God's orders to ensure that the flow of life that he has disposed in me goes without a fail.' SHE WAS FATE!? HOW IN THE HELL!? 'Well then. Will you tell me, or do I have to guess?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't about to say it, that was for sure. It was bad enough to be against God, but against God and Lucifer, you didn't dare to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I think it's time to start guessing. Who would be powerful enough to go against me? Not anybody can. It must've been a demon, am I wrong?' No, she wasn't. She was aiming her guesses the right way, and she saw it in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A demon it is, then. But, among them, who? There are many. But only one has taken a likening to go against me. Lucifer, the Fallen Angel, the Morning Star.' her voice was very cold, devoid from its earlier beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinched when she said that, and again, she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Poor you. Another poor soul tricked by a foul demon. But, do not worry. I can help you break her grasp on you. You just have to follow what I say to the letter.' For real? She had a way of breaking the deal? You didn't want to, but a part of you was listening with all its attention. 'It's very simple. You just have to summon Lucifer again, and break the deal. Then the correct flow of events will start playing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What about my sister then?' you asked, fearing for her life yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She will die, as God has disposed.' WHAT!? She wouldn't save her!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No way! I'm not calling the deal off! I want her to live!' you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then, I'm afraid this is the only way of making you go the right way. I'm sorry.' she apologized as an unknown force left your body rock solid and unable to move! She began moving closer to your body, until her face was almost touching yours. She put her hands on your temples and you felt a surge of something that left you almost without breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmm? A strong will you have there. Most would have already given up at this point. It seems the corruption of your mind is stronger than I thought. I'll have to use other means to achieve my goal.' she moved her face even closer and just as she was about to kiss you, you heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why are you tempting him?' you moved your head what little you could and saw Lucy, just as the last time, moving closer to the both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate took a few steps back and, just as it came, the sensation of paralysis disappeared. Lucy came to your side and clinged to you. 'I'm the only one allowed to tempt him.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Lucifer.' said Fate. 'I was just about to freed him from your influence. This poor soul must not be lost to your deal.' Lucy smiled to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm sorry, but he's not under my control. In fact, he was the one to put most of the terms to our deal. And in a very handsome way.' she blushed a bit as she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And why would he do that?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'To give more life spawn to his sister, whom he loves very much, whom you wanted to kill and whom I saved!' she exclaimed. She was right. All you did was to save her. Everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It was God's will that she would die a few days ago. He should respect it.' argued Fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't think that logic works for an atheist.' countered Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My, my. What a pity that you don't believe in Him. But that's fine.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It is?' asked Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes.' Fate changed her attention to you. 'I will make you an offer. Break your deal with Lucifer, and He will save your sister's life, as well as your soul. You don't want your sister to be sad after you die and after she dies and sees that you're not on Heaven, now do you?' She was right about that. It'd break her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Do not listen to her!' shouted Lucy, looking at your eyes. 'She's the same one that God created and what was about to kill her! She was talking about having your sister dead only a few moments ago! Please, believe in me!' She sounded very sincere, but then again, she was the best lying. But she had a point. Fate certainly talked about your sister dying. What will you do? Trust Fate and risk everything, or condemn your soul to Hell and ensure your little sister's life?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked at Lucy, who was still clinging to your left side, and stared for a long moment into her blue eyes. You gently pushed her a bit and, looking directly at Fate, walked a few steps towards her. You heard Lucy's voice behind you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No! Please, Michael, don't go! Please...' her voice trailed off. You walked a few steps more and stopped until you were almost in the middle point between Fate and Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fate.' you uttered that only word. She smiled and opened her arms, welcoming you, waiting for you. But you didn't move. 'We're done with our business, if it even can be called that. My deal with Lucy remains. I side with her. I believe in her. For all I care, you can disappear right now.' you said those words with a newly found confidence, the confidence to defy what you didn't liked; the confidence to defy what was already written for all of humanity; the confidence to defy God Himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But why, poor soul? Don't you see that she is lying to you? That she is trying to trick you?'. she seemed genuinely confused. She must have thought that you would choose her side, as all that she had offered a similar deal had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What I see and feel is that she saved my sister when she needed help most, and only asked in return a fair price, which I agreed to pay of my own free will. Meanwhile, your plan was to take her away from me to Heaven or whatever place there is before she had a chance to fully enjoy life. Lucy, or Lucifer, if you may, gave me a chance to choose, and I chose. I chose for her to live. And when I die, and the payment is complete, I shall be by her side, even while suffering the worst punishments of Hell, for my soul will be taken, but not her memories of me. I'll live on through her.' your speech finished with those words that now were the absolute truth to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But, the same could be said for her. She could have lived on through your memories of her!' Fate desperately tried to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'True, but that is something reserved only to me, right now. Only to a sinful person like me. That was my choice, those will be my consequences. Now please, turn back and go.' the last part was a plea. You just wanted her to leave you and your family alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when you had finished your speech, you felt Lucy (it had to be her, because there wan't any other being around that part of school) hugging you from behind, and a warm sensation that ran down and through your clothes. Could it be that... she was crying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm very sorry, lost lamb,'  she interrupted your thoughts and you noticed that she had called you 'lost lamb' instead of 'poor soul', 'but I can't do that. My duty and being say that I have to kill that temptress' she pointed to Lucy, who was still behind you 'the moment I see her. I only had this chat because I wanted you to choose the right path for yourself, but it seems this demoness is too strong. I'll kill her and you'll realize the truth soon after. Please, move aside.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yeah, sure. You actually expected me to do that?' you mocked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Then, I'm afraid I'll have to do this. I'll try to harm you as less as possible. Please, forgive me in advance.' she raised her hand and muttered strange words, and the wind grew stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I won't let you!' you shouted and pushed Lucy, who was still behind you, out of harm's way, while you raised your arms and assumed a defensive stance to protect from the incoming attack. But it didn't worked. Instead, it seemed like the wind only hit you stronger, sending you against the wall of the school and making a few of your ribs break in the process. All of your breath was knocked out of you and you fell face first against the floor. Somehow, even with the injuries, you managed to turn around and tried to gasp for air, but all you did was imitate perfectly a fish out of the water. You stood on your knees and coughed some blood, which you wiped with the back of your hand. Then, you looked to where you were standing and saw Lucy, with all of her wings fully spread and horns sticking out of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I won't forgive you! I won't forgive you!' she repeated louder and louder very time until only a demonic voice came. A strange glyph appeared on the floor, red as the blood, and as an incantation began to flow out of her lips, the sky was covered with fire. After that, a white light blinded you and when you regained your sight, you saw the place where Lucy had taken you the night of the deal. At a single move of her hand, fire sprouted from the earth and burnt everything, Fate included. Even before that was over, Lucy moved her hand again an more fire fell of the sky right above Fate. When the element had finally disappeared, Fate's silhouette could be figured among the smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that had finally cleared, Fate appeared, with several burnings all over her once beautiful body, and her clothes (the school uniform, a white blouse with some red and blue stripes and a skirt with the same design) were almost completely destroyed, revealing the still perfect shape of her body. She had ragged breathing, and was on one knee.<br>\r\nBut, even in her state, she smiled and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You are stronger than I thought, Morning Star. No wonder why you were God's favorite until your failed rebellion. And I may have lost, but this is far from over. God won't allow you to interfere with this world's destiny any longer. The Governor has been watching us from afar, and will come her eventually. Even you, the first Fallen Angel, won't stand a chance against the Governor.' and with those words that inflicted fear upon you , she disappeared amidst a white mist. With another withe flash, you returned to the school grounds. And, when you were totally sure that there was no relative danger (you had Lucy near, and the Lady of Hell was always danger), you allowed yourself to lose consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke at some warmth spreading all over your upper body, and soon you saw a green light that, as you could feel, was healing your broken ribs and a few bones that you didn't knew that were broken. The source of the green light seemed to see a combination of Lucy's hands and tears that were flowing down her face and fell onto your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What...is happening?' you asked, still a bit weak because of that big hit. However, as low as your voice could be, Lucy heard it, opened her eyes in amazement and hugged you REALLY hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank God you are safe! Thank God...' there was something that seemed of to you. Had she just thanked God for your well-being? Wow, she must've been REALLY worried about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, it's not thanks to God. It's thanks to you.' as her healing abilities went on, you were capable of speaking better. Her eyes opened again and she hugged you even harder. After a while, she let go and helped you stand on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you,' she said with a smile that couldn't be but true, 'for believing in me. You are the first one to do that since Him. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'In any case, I believed in you because you prove me you were worthy of that. It's all thanks to you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really,' she said, with a bit less of a smile, 'it was because of that that I... It doesn't matter right now.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to clear your thoughts and deal with a headache at the same time. Bad move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yeah, one thing.' you remembered. 'You didn't seem to be on good terms with the idea of me taking up on Fate's offer. Why is that? I mean, I know we have a deal and all that, but if I broke it, you could just get my soul and then make another deal to another person. Why did you care?' you were really curious about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. 'At first, this was only going to be a normal contract, you know? I got your soul, you got your wish... A win-win. Then I'd make another contract, and another, and so on. But you,' she gazed directly into your eyes, 'you had to go and act all mighty for your sister's sake, didn't you? And you said to Fate herself that you believed in me over her, then you protected me... What could I do...but to fall in love with you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, you did a double take. Had she just said what you thought she had said? You had managed to make the Great Seducer fall in love with you!? What in the Hell was happening!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you got a chance to process all that information, she approached you and kissed you on the lips. Man, you had no words to describe how good tasted those cherry lips of her! It was beyond anything a human would surely get in their lifetime! Totally amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backed up a bit and then whispered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was my first kiss.' and with only those five words, she made your blood boil, your cheeks burn and you could have sworn that they also made your nose bleed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at the sight of you and stood there, a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I love you. I would have never thought that I would fall for a human, but here I am.' she giggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You... love me? Why?' you certainly had a hard time dealing with that much info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I already told you, silly.' she laughed. 'Now, tell me: do you love me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was. The question. Did you love her? You certainly were grateful because of her help with your sister, but that was not all. A few times you were able to see her childish side, and you were sure that there was more than a mere affection to her. You loved her. It was the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I do'. you said, confident in your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and kissed you again, and this time, her tongue entered your mouth and entwined with yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Enough of this.' she said breaking the kiss. 'There will be time for this... later'. a mischievous smile was shown on her pretty face. 'Now, we have to prepare to deal with the Governor.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's right. But who' s the Governor?' you were clueless about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's her Sumerian name. She's known as the Announcer, the archangel Gabriel.' An archangel was hunting you!? SHIT!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wanted to help your sister. More then anyone could ever know, but at least she'd go somewhere nice after she died. You on the other hand would only be delaying her death and would suffer all eternity for doing so. You'd never thought like this before but with Lucifer coming to tell you that she can save your sister you have no trouble believing in heaven and hell any more. You don't want to anger the ruler of hell, as you see she begins to become frustrated with how long you were taking. She clearly thought that you would choose your sister over self preservation, but you were still human and if the lord er... <i>queen</i> of sin should know anything it would be the lengths the survival instincts goes to in humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry... but I don't think I can.\" You say quietly hoping not to offend her. Of course you should have given her some credit, being the most powerful demon in all of existence has to count for some supernatural level of hearing. Although she didn't tell you that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again?\" She said pretending to clean her ear.Truthfully, she thought she had this one in the bag and to hear she was wrong shocked her more then anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't condemn myself to an eternity of torture just to delay the inevitable...\" You say in a defeated tone. This was not going her way at all, she had to think of something fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww come on, an eternity with me couldn't be that bad could it?\" She said flaunting her perfect figure. This struck a cord with you though, you didn't like to be thought of as a brain dead sex machine a lot of males were portrayed to be. Sure you had your urges but you made sure to keep them in check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not stupid, I know the stories. Hell (No pun intended) I don't know how many of them are true but my stay wouldn't as pleasant as you make it out to be.\" You say turning away. That was a first for Lucifer, she'd never had anyone turn her down. But this only made her want to break your resolve even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I can take away all her pain, I could even make everyone forget that it even happened. All I need is your soul...\" She said delicately before you scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then what? Once I'm gone you'll be free to kill her anyway, you might even make me watch as another punishment.\" You weren't really watching what you were saying around her even though every logical part of your brain was screaming at you to start grovelling and begging for your soul. Your sisters well-being was a touchy subject and now that she claimed she could make it all go away, didn't exactly help in the trust section. \"If you could have done this at any time then why now? Why not do it the same day she was hit?\" She was the first person to lie, she had all of eternity to hone that skill so how could you trust her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, only recently had you become desperate enough for me to appear without your summoning of me. That was a deal I made with my brother, that I would have claim to the desperate souls.\" She said with a sigh of annoyance. She was being awfully patient with you, but you could tell that it would only carry her so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I worth so much to you?\" You ask turning around to face her again. \"You could be off doing more important things, you said we didn't have time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was merely an attempt to rush your decision. Do you really think that I couldn't make time, especially in a dream?\" She giggled. \"Oh you are so innocent, I could just eat you up!\" That sent shivers down your spine, that uneasy feeling was growing by the minute and the holy fa\u00e7ade was beginning to wear thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't tell me why I'm worth so much...\" You say but notice the happy mood vanishes almost instantaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I explain mortal?\" She said, a coldness creeping into her voice. \"I could rip the soul out of your frail body leaving it a lifeless husk.\" She said stroking you cheek with her claws... WAIT CLAWS??? You look at her hand seeing it was no different then before. Now you were paralysed, you barely even breathed as she stared into your eyes, no your very being. \"I give you this option because it amuses me, the fruitlessness of life and how your kind so desperately clings to it...  I cannot begin to fathom why he would bother making life in the first place if it would lead to so much suffering. It was almost as if he made my fall from his gates deliberate.\" A look of anger began to take over her features and you noticed something wet hit your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and saw the sky was blood red, the dark thunderclouds as black as the pit rained scarlet. Every drop that hit you froze you to your core as you started to hear the wailing and cries of the damned. You would have curled into a ball and waited for the end if not for lady Satan standing in front of you. Although she almost seemed to have forgotten about you being there. You found it strange that the entire scene had changed and yet her form hadn't, sure she had gotten a little taller and her eyes had gone a deep shade of black that you felt would swallow you if you stared for too long but it wasn't as bad as the environment around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plants grew thorns and the sap turned to blackness that stained the ground. You shut your eyes as you felt a rough vine curl around you shin. You were, as they say, 'quaking in your boots'. You knew that praying would be useless now, your atheist lifestyle wouldn't just change with one prayer for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It seemed like an eternity but you felt the vine recede and the rain stop. You still didn't open your eyes until the wails of the damned were replaced by the chirps of birds. You cracked an eye open to see the scene was much the same as when you first saw her, she even looked the same again. You didn't dare speak in case this was just a trick, although something was strange about her expression... was that sadness? Before you even have a chance to register it she puts her happy face back on almost as if nothing had ever happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what Michael...</span></div></div>",

You dare not do anymore to get on her bad side, but you dare not change your mind either. Your sister wouldnt want it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It that's your decision,\" Lucy's voice calming and soothing tone was a polar opposite to the nightmarish demeanor earlier, \"I will respect it. I cant force you to sell your soul against your will... no matter how painfully easy it would be.\" You swallowed hard as she humbly curtsied. \"...But I assure you, youre going to regret the choice you've made here. Youre still desperate. Your soul reeks of hopeless desperation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were scared. But as she said, she cant force you to sell your soul against your will. If she could, she wouldve just as easily TAKEN it. You tell yourself she's not as powerful as she pretends to be.  She may be a fallen angel, but she's still just a guest in your dream. An unwanted guest.<br>\r\n\"Yeah... of course, I'm desperate. I'm scared. I'm scared of you. I'm scared of what might happen to my sis at this point because I turned you down,\" you look Lucy in the eye and force some courage into that corner of your soul that's still shivering, \"but I'm still telling you to fuck off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"clred\"><b><i>\"HaAaAaH!!!!\"</i></b></span></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou literally fell over in fright from the strange sound that came out of Lucy's mouth! It did not sound like something a human throat could make. You even saw her jaw unhinge and her throat contract in an awkward abnormal way to make such a sound! The sound was quite possibly the closest you thing in your life that you could describe as 'demonic'. Just that very sound she made removed all doubt that this bitch was the Devil!<br>\r\nIn an instant, she regained her 'normal' composure and assume a surprised expression herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" the devil spouted, \"that's the first time in a few millenniums that someone actually made me sincerely laugh!\" You dont think you'll ever wanna grow up to be a professional comedian at this rate! The beautiful sweet smile she was giving you could no longer hide that show of ungodlyness earlier! You'd probably remember it for the rest of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should keep a REAL good eye on you,\" she says as she giggled her dainty lady laugh, \"Ahahahah... ah, your adorable little sister is lucky to have someone like you.\" Even though you were man enough to turn Lucifer down, you were still not happy nor relieved. Not only is your sister gonna die, but your flat out refusal didnt so much as wipe the smug smirk off her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sad to say we wasted too much time,\" Lucy said as she turned around and walked back to the gazebo, \"sorry we couldnt make a great trade today. Perhaps next time, yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Dont hold your breath, Ms. Satan,\" you tell her.<br>\r\nYou heard her continue to giggle as she walked, \"It was an absolute pleasure to meet you, Michael. But I'm sure we'll meet again soon. Very soon.\" What in the heck did she mean by that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as something deep down inside you cringed by whatever she meant, she stopped walking and just stood there faced away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*crack!* You heard a loud cracking sound as Lucy's neck bent backwards out of proportion! You would never forget the moment she twisted her head so far back that she smiled at you upside-down. Her two blue eyes became three blackened with red blood-filled pupils, boils suddenly sprouted all over her formerly serene face, tiny little animal jaws ripped opened from her cheeks, and her wide sharp crooked blood dripping teeth formed the biggest ugliest grin as she said:<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><i><b>\"...SlEeP wElL!!!!\"</b></i></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH!!* Suddenly, a ginormous set of crooked beastly jaws snapped shut behind Lucifer, devouring the entire scene behind her! You let out the loudest blood curdling scream a boy your age could let out as you turned tell and ran like there was no tomorrow! But the jaws came even closer, consuming Lucifer and the entire scenery around her! The jaws continued to devour your dream world as they gained on you!<br>\r\nOh crap! You bumped into an invisible wall! The rest of the 'garden scenery' was just painted on! You turned around and paled with so much fright, you couldnt even must the courage to scream anymore! You took one final gaze of horror as the jaws opened up one last time and came down on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike! Mike! Wake up!\"<br>\r\nYou were forcefully shaken up by your dad! You woke in a sudden jolt only seconds away from screaming, before waking up in the hospital room! Or rather, your SISTER'S hospital room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... it's a miracle...\" you saw the doctor gasp as he stared at the heart rate monitor, \"she... she has a pulse again. But... she was just...\"<br>\r\n\"Doctor! What's happening?!\" your mother got restless.<br>\r\n\"The...\" the doctor was still dumbstruck, \"...the heart... her heart rate... it's... beating back to normal level! But... she wouldve been declared dead only a minute ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made you immediately jump out of your seat! Did this mean your sister's not gonna die after all?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-does this mean,\" you swallowed, \"my sis is gonna live?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still too early to tell,\" the doctor wiped the sweat from his brow, \"but it looks like we might have another chance to save her. Nurse! NURSE!!\" He screamed for the nurse who quickly hauled butt on his call!<br>\r\n\"Doctor? What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Go get the others! Get the table ready! We're saving this little girl tonight!\"<br>\r\n\"W...wh... her?! But didnt you say she-\"<br>\r\n\"We got us a second chance! Move your ass NOW!!\"<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an irregular heart beat, the crew in scrubs dragged your sister's bed out of the room and got ready to perform the surgery that the doctor said only moments ago wouldve been waste a time. This was... you couldnt believe it! Your sister was gonna live! If such a pessimist doc like him could have a change of heart, there's no doubt in your mind that your little sis is gonna live!

You have brown hair, wear glasses, ADHD and autism, and have had no experience with woman in a romantic sense.  You just returned to your dorm after watching your younger sister\u2019s Irish step dance residual and you were beat.  Nothing out of the ordinary has happened your roommate and his girlfriend relax a bit but then leave before long and you relax.  That is until around 10 p.m. where you here a bang outside your window.  You look but see nothing and you go back to what you were doing until five minutes later when you here it again.<br>\r\nYou start to think you are going crazy and decided to turn in for the night, right after a nice hot shower. Your room is right across from the rest room so you leave the door open a crack, bad move right there.  15 to 20 minutes later you return to the room only to hear a feminine voice saying \u201cso you ready for the night of your life\u201d behind you when you make it half way across the room.  You turn around to see a gorgeous girl lying in a seductive position on your roommate\u2019s bed.  She had white hair, red eyes, looked about your age and was wearing very little clothing, only enough to cover her large breasts and nether regions.  At this moment you confused weirded out and slightly turned on.  Shrugging your shoulders thinking that you roommate is cheating on his girlfriend with a blind girl you return to your bed.<br>\r\nThe girl then say \u201coh that is your bed; well then that made thing a bit more awkward.\u201d Then she get off the other bed and walks towards yours.  You ignore her until she yanks your laptop away.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the he---\u201cyou were about to scream at her but you were interrupted because she planted a kiss on you, your first kiss and with a hot partner at that.  You were so stunned you did not realize that she was stranding you making very erotic noises.<br>\r\nThen realized a scent that you missed due to all the visual distraction.  The scent of blood and it was coming from the girl.  Terrified you tried to get away,<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

The girl then said \u201coh come on, I know we got off on the wrong foot but I swear you will remember this moment for the rest of your life.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah cause having sex with a girl that I just met and don\u2019t even know the name of will not be dangerous, especially the one that smells like blood.\u201d You replied sarcastically <br>\r\nNo kidding you hear her she actually smell her hand (not the one she\u2019s got you with).  \u201cI do not smell anything.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?  It is stronger on this hand\u201d<br>\r\nShe actually pulls away to smell it.  \u201cOh crap, well that explains your reaction.  Listen I am not here to hu-\u201c, the bathroom is connected to a second hall and you ran out of there and doubled back to see if she goes in.  \u201cDamn it you won\u2019t get away\u201d, she runs in and you run towards the stairwell, go down the stairs run to the front entrance, and as soon as you get outside you hear the police sirens.  Just as soon as you show the police your student i.d. card and give them the short version of what happen the fire alarms went off and everyone got out of the building.  You figured your intruder must have also heard the sirens and pulled the alarm to make a distraction for her escape.<br>\r\nAfter giving the police the full story you thought they would tell you \u201cya sure kid\u201d but the broken bathroom door and item she through at your window, which by the way was a severed hand of so guy dead for over three hundred years, were evidence enough.  The next morning the building was going to be closed off for the mourning at least during your class hours to look for any more evidence, during or first class you decide to look up mythological creatures and pulled up one of your favorites; ghouls, they were considered zombies only faster, smarter, and deadlier.  That was until you remembered the basic appearance of a ghoul, white hair and red eyes, exactly like the girl, only she was not a shriveling corpse and was kind of hot.  You shake your head and tell yourself \u201cwhoa Ben calm down, you only have an interest in this stuff, there is no way stuff like monsters and the undead exist.\u201d  Little did you know you were in for quite a surprise when you</span><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well to be more accurate most of the stuff on your side of the room stayed the same if not organized, but more importantly everything that was on your roommates side was gone; or rather was replaced with an even larger model, the laptop was defiantly different and the Xbox one now had a ps4 companions.  Then you here a feminine voice behind on your former roommate bed (d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu), \u201clong time no see Ben, I am going to be your new roommate.\u201d  You turn around expecting to see your stalker from last night, however this was different woman.  She did however share a few similarities with the girl before, she about your age, had red eye, a gorgeous body, and she was in a sexy pose when you find her.  She did have really pale skin, almost sickly, while the stalker had a more of a tan, her hair was midnight black, her voice was a higher pitch and this time she was fully clothed.<br>\r\nNow you were asking yourself quite a few questions one when did your roommate move, while it is possible for a person to move out of and another person to move into a room with the help of the movers, you as the other roommate you should at least be notified beforehand, your previous roommate did not give you a reason good or bad; and the elephant in the room your new roommate is a female.  While the dorm itself is co-ed the rooms themselves are grouped into gender specific quadrants, there is no way the school would do something like this without a strong reason.  Second what she said \u201clong time no see Ben\u201d, you are very certain that this is the first time you ever met this girl so how did see already now your name.  You decide to confront her on the second question first.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry miss but have few meet before, I am normally very good with remembering a face but yours is escapes me.\u201d  You weren\u2019t lying, but you where cautious of the information you were about to give her.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry guess it has been a long time hasn\u2019t it.  My name is Veronica Foster, we first met when we were, 2 years old I believe, honestly the only reason I even remembered was because mother kept referring you as my fianc\u00e9 for the last 18 years.\u201d  You probably would have believed her up till the point where she said that you were her future husband.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Veronica was it, but could please repeat that last part, I thought you said I was your fianc\u00e9.\u201d You reply<br>\r\n\u201cI did, mother said she and your mother set the engagement way back when, honestly I could hardly tell whether or not she was joking.\u201d  <br>\r\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019ll call my mom on the subject later.  I have another question at is more urgent.  Tell you what I\u2019ll let you guess what I\u2019m going to ask.\u201d You say will acting like a smartass.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I your new roommate right?  Well your old roommate has had a death in the family and the relative had a pregnant wife and the government is not give her enough insurance money in order to raise a child and your room was the only one available.\u201d  You call total bullshit for her excuse, but if she was able to get become your roommate without the school system have a problem she either had a lot of money or a lot of friends in high, you were not going to call her bluff just yet.  \u201cDo you have any more questions Benny-boy?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFirst never call me \u2018Benny\u2019, second yes you have answered all of my questions for in terms of why you are my new roommate and how we knew each other, however ground rules will have to be made no later than tomorrow, and finally welcome to Fitchburg state.\u201d  As soon as she left you take out your phone and call home.  Your mother was the first to pick up.  \u201cHey mom I got a question, does the name Victoria Foster ring a bell?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it does, in fact her Mother is here now, why?\u201d  Your mom replies, you note that she voice is a bit shaky.<br>\r\n\u201cReally what a coincidence, may I speak with her?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHello Benjamin nice to hear from you again how are you?\u201d  She sounded like some kind of upper-class woman in her mid-forties.  \u201cSo are you adjusting with your life as a college student?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs well as one can but that\u2019s not the reason I am calling, why is your daughter, Veronica, my new roommate?  Her story sounded completely half-baked and she mentioned something about the two of us being engaged, especially during the 21st century?  Care to fill in the blanks \u2018mother-in-law\u2019 because last time I checked I wasn\u2019t in a comedic romance anime.\u201d  Normally you would handle the situation more calmly but yeah with the break in, the line of bullshit Veronica just gave you, needing to take care of advising this month, and changing your major officially, your stress level was through the fucking roof.<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down tiger, you don\u2019t want an \u2018accident\u2019 to happen now do we?\u201d  Just then you blood turns cold was as you hear the sounds of firearms being locked and loaded on the other side of the phone, and you wonder did they take your family hostage.  \u201cNow listen the engagement you have with my daughter will it may not be legit, that does not make it any less real, also we have a tradition of having shotguning a wedding, so do us a favor and start making an heir to the family please.\u201d<br>\r\nYou turn off your phone and start turn around to run, only to see Veronica standing there with small revolver like pistol with the door behind her being locked, and while you do have a black belt in karate if there is the one thing that your instructors it is that even though you can disarm an armed opponent at close range you should only do it if it is a complete life or death scenario.  \u201cWell crap you got me by the balls in more ways than one.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAt least smart enough to know when to give up, remind me after our marriage to get you in shape because your brains are the only appealing thing about you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOuch that\u2019s cold, could you at least tell me why it is me and not someone else.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry but we cannot my family is deep it as is and that is without the hostage taking.\u201d  She replies while removing her skirt and starting to unbutton her shirt you notice the hammer on the gun is not pulled, not wanting to risk her reaction being faster than the time it would take you to bring her down you point it out.<br>\r\n\u201cYou do realize you have to pull back the hammer to fire the bullet right?\u201d<br>\r\n</div></span></span></div></div>",

The stare in her reddened blood-filled eyes was beyond any horrible thing you have ever witness in your short life. You could\u2019ve just given up and taken your punishment like a man. Instead you fuck up even more\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too curious for your own good. Ever since you found out the family secret that you descended from a clan of wizards, you felt obligated to learn magic. It started off as bending spoons, then it turned to bending pipes, then fancy magic tricks to impress your friends, then using illusions to cheat in school, then scaring away bullies with fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire. It was the 1st of your royal fuck ups. After your mother was killed by a drunk driver, you felt the urge to seek out the lush that did such a horrible thing and spook him GOOD with a nice fiery illusion. You scare him into thinking his house was on fire and barring the doors and windows shut so he couldn\u2019t get out. Problem was, the fire wasn\u2019t an illusion. By the time you realized the goof, you couldn\u2019t stop the fire! By the time you realized you couldn\u2019t stop it, the fire spread. The fire KEPT spreading all to the way to the next house and the next! Who knows how many innocent people and children were burnt to death cuz of your fuck up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, the local police couldnt explain the supernatural occurrence\u2026 but the White Council of esteemed wizards could. They knew what happened and they knew who did it. You broke the Council\u2019s First Law of Magic. The sentence for breaking the Law is death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of accepting your end before you caused more trouble, you fled like a coward. You looked into more magic, specifically regarding how to raise the dead to reverse the murders you committed. You withdrew a huge chunk of your life savings and began your research to bring back the innocent lives you carelessly taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour research took you all the way to Okinawa, Japan\u2026 to a nice little Shinto shrine that according to the black scriptures used to be the gateway to Yomi, the land of the dead. You played yourself off as a friendly tourist taking pictures, buying souvenirs, pretending to listen to the tour guide\u2019s history lesson in broken English, and even sweet-talking the cute young black haired Miko sweeping the steps. Sure, she probably couldnt understand you, but by the way she smiled and bowed as you spoke, she was flattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after reading a little more from the black scriptures, you gave a hefty donation to the Miko elder and she gave you permission to pray and meditate in private for an hour. During that hour alone, you set up shop. Poured salt on the ground into a big circle, placed the spell bearing stones around the circle, lit a few candles, gripped your mother\u2019s amulet tight, and squat in the circle, concentrating your power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your mind and chanted the words so that the spirits of the netherworld could you hear you, wishing to bring back those who have fallen. You expressed your regrets and sympathies and offered to make amends for your misdeeds, inviting them to join you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe circle glowed bright! The candles lit black flames! The earth rumbled! A cold, chilling wind began to blow! You felt a powerful force shake you out of your meditation! Something deep down inside you told you somebody or something heard that invitation! Something BAD! It ripped the shrine in half!<br>\r\nThis was your 2nd fuck up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNani?!\u201d the cute black haired miko ran to you, obviously shocked at what\u2019s going on, \u201cNani goto?! Nanika atta?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGET OUTTA HERE!\u201d you screamed to her, \u201cGO!! QUICK!!\u201d Too late. The miko froze in horror at what was behind you. You felt the icy chill of death itself from that direction. You turned around and paled at the sight of the tall ungodly black haired silhouette in a burnt and tattered pink kimono standing before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was female. What was left of it, anyway. The majority of her was wrapped in bandages, but the parts of her that wasnt was burnt and scarred beyond recognition! White snakes slithered around her body and through her exposed gaping wounds. <br>\r\nShe wore a white maiden kabuki mask covering what you knew wasnt much of a face left! Her reddened bloodfilled eyes gazed into with intrigue, filling you with absolute regret of what you just did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god\u2026 oh my god!\u201d<br>\r\nYou knew who she was and you cursed the black scriptures for lying to you! She was Izanami-no-Mikoto, the Shinto goddess of the dead. What was once a lovely divine deity responsible for creating this part of the world with her husband was now a charred, heartbroken ill elder god who spent WAY too long in Hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Izanami pant almost exhaustedly under her mask. It looked as though she wasnt to speak, but wasnt able to. Her throat muscles must be too damaged to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miko behind you shrieked and ran, but one of the white snakes slithered out of Izanami\u2018s ribcage and zipped at the poor girl, sinking it\u2018s fangs into her!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!!\u201d you screamed. AGAIN someone suffers because of you.<br>\r\nHer eyes rolled back, but she wasnt dead. A kanji seal appeared on her forehead. The poor miko stepped toward you in a hypnotic daze and faced you, despite her eyes being rolled back!<br>\r\n\"What in the hell...\" before you could finish that sentence, you felt the similar chill emitting from the miko that's emitting from Izanami herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GaIjIn MaHo TsUkAi...\" the chilling voice coming from Miko's mouth was not her own, \"O-mAnEkI aRiGaTo...\" Izanami must be using the miko girl as an anchor to speak to you. Problem is you forgot to bring your translation book! This is embarrassing! You not only freed a fallen god from Hell, but you cant even speak her language!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'm sorry,\" you stuttered, \"I dont understand you.\"<br>\r\nIzanami tilted her head with intrigue and stared at you in silence for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"pErD\u00f3NaMe PoR fAvOr,\" the miko suddenly started speaking Spanish! \"eStA cOmPrEnDe AqUi, ExTrAnJeRo?\"<br>\r\nYou blinked in amazement. But you should probably expect nothing less from a god. Still, you dont understand Spanish.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I still dont understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzanami put a rotted finger to the chin of her mask in thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DoEs ThIs LaNgUaGe SuIt YoUr LiKiNg, FoReIgN wIzArD?\" the Miko suddenly spoke english!<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard, holding back the urge to panic, but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzanami's bloodfilled eyes widened as she slowly stepped toward you. A white snake poked out of her open stomach and hissed your way.<br>\r\n\"WiZaRd...\" the Miko spoke with a hint of curiosity, \"...FoR wHaT pUrPoSe hAvE yOu DaReD tO oPeN tHe GaTeWaY tO hElL aNd FrEeD mE fRoM mY EtErNaL iMpRiSoNmEnT?\"<br>\r\nThat was a good question. You were far too terrified of Izanami to answer. <br>\r\n'This wasnt supposed to happen!' you thought to yourself, 'I just wanted to bring back the people I killed by accident! I didnt mean to free a dead god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AnSwEr My QuEsTiOn!!\" the Miko shouted as Izanami squinted her eyes with impatience, \"wHy HaVe yOu, a LoWlY yEt PoWeRfUl fOrEiGn WiZaRd, SuMmOnEd ThE gOdDeSs Of ThE dEaD bAcK iNtO tHe LiViNg ReAlM?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nerve wrecking just to think of an answer to that question. You were asked by a god of death, after all! Your knees began to shiver from her chilling approach. Izanami was in no mood to wait. But you were in no mood to answer, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could you possibly do? Do you dare answer her question?</span></div></div>",

At first, everything was goin according to the plan. But then the fire incrased. By the time I noticed the fire was real, the it was to late to save the man and the house. I tried to extinguish the fire but, to no avail. By the time the fire extinguished itself, a large number of houses was burned. And so were the people inside of them. So, I hidded myself from the White Wizard Coulncil and began to research and to focus in magic to resurrect people.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I see.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Confessing a sin to an actual god was a lot more nerve wrecking than the churches led you to believe. You expected Izanami to be furious, to bring down the hammer of damnation on you for doing something so horrible in your life. You thought that what the goddess of the dead would do to you would make you WISH you accepted the White Council's execution!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you saw no hint of anger or fury behind the goddess's mask. If anything, the dim look in her bloodfilled eyes seemed less threatening than before. If you had to make a very educated guess, you'd think this was a hint of merciful understanding she was showing you. She stepped a tad bit closer, but you did not step back.<br>\r\n\"hOw NoBlE...\" the possessed step-sweeping Miko spoke to match Izanami's visual expression, \"...iF nOt FoOlisH. tEll mE, foReIgN wIzArD. wHaT mAdE yOu AsSuMe YoU wErE cApAbLe oF dEfYiNg tHe dIvIdE oRdEr Of LiFe AnD dEaTh?\" Fair question. Unfortunately, you didnt have the answer. What did make you assume you could pull off such an impossible task that not even the White Council in their centuries of existing couldve pulled off?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" you swallowed hard and bowed your head, \"...I dont know, Izanami-sama.\"<br>\r\n\"wHaT mAdE yOu ThInK tHaT yOuR pLaN wOuLd NoT bAcKfirE?\" another good point!

Mom must be rolling in her grave right about now.\" You felt depressed now. Looking back, you know your mom wouldnt have wanted it this way. She must be very disappointed in you right now... wherever she is. Why oh why couldnt you have just left well enough alone?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you thought about her, Izanami stared at you in absolute silence, minus her heavy panting. Her chill was still making you shiver. Youre depressed and terrified of the potential horrors you now released into the world.<br>\r\nDespite your fear, you couldnt help but find it cute the way the burnt goddess was bending over and tilted her head at you in some sort of a cute curious pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wHAt Is YoUr NaMe, WiZaRd?\" she finally asked your name.<br>\r\nNo use to cover your identity from a fallen god, \"...[Jeremiah]. [Jeremiah] Westwayne.\"<br>\r\n\"ArE yOu AfRaId Of Me... JeReMiAh?\" the possessed miko asked.<br>\r\n\"I am,\" you said with brutal honesty.<br>\r\nYou could see Izanami squint her eyes as her human-puppet spoke, \"...YeT yOu StILL sTaNd BeFoRe Me?\" You didnt even budge where her icy cold bandaged hand lifted your chin up as she gazed into you at point-blank range! \"eVeN mY fOrMeR hUsBaNd RaN fRoM mE sCrEaMiNg WhEn He FiRsT sAw ThIs.\" Izanagi... \"a LoWlY mOrTaL wIzArD wItH A BiGgEr SpInE tHaN a GoD...\" You could her eyes squint in some sort of a gleeful expression. You assume whatever face she had left had a rather wide grin behind that mask, \"...InTErEsTiNG...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on cue with the potentially evil goddess's intrigue, the earth shook once more. Tremors turned into cracks in the ground. Cracks turned into holes. Holes turned into deep gaping chasms. Several silhouettes crawled out of those chasms. It was difficult to fathom the figures outside of their shadowy silhouettes, but it'd probably be best you couldnt fathom them.<br>\r\nEach silhouette had a different bizarre of grotesque feature. Long batlike wings, long furry arms and knuckles like a gorilla, fangs almost the size of their head, long spiney centipede abdomens, or limbs replaced with slithering spikey appendages... whatever they were, they werent of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzanami stood back up and looked down at you while her white snake slithered atop her shoulder staring as well.<br>\r\n\"WeStWaYnE-sAn...\" she actually addressed you formally... or at least the miko did, \"I aM iN yOuR dEbT fOr FrEeInG mE fRom tHE bOwElS oF YoMi.\" Those words offered relief. A lot of relief. \"tO rEpAy YoU... I WiSh tO EmPlOy YoUr SeRvIcEs.\"<br>\r\nRelief changed to caution. You said nothing. Employing your services could mean anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I iNtEnD tO rEcLaIm My GLOrIuS LaNd oF tHe RiSiNg SuN...\" Izanami's puppet claimed, \"...aNd ReStOrE iT tO iT'S nAtUrAL LUstEr.\" <br>\r\n...Your eyes widened. In that brief sentence, you summed up her intentions!<br>\r\n\"You wanna take over Japan?!\"<br>\r\n\"RECLAIM iT,\" the possessed miko corrected and heavily emphasized the word, \"TeChNiCaLLy, It iS MiNe By BiRtHrIghT.\"<br>\r\nThe horde of creepy silhouettes gathered around the destroyed shrine. Each set of glowing eyes gazed your way (sets ranged from 1 to upwards of 8 eyes a silhouette). Bad. BAD. BAAAAAADDDDD!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzanami extended her arm to you, \"I InViTE yOu To JoIn Me... aS mY ChAmPiOn KnIgHt.\"<br>\r\n\"Y...Your knight?!\" you flinched at the word. On instinct, you gripped your mother's amulet tightly, \"you want me to help you rule Japan?!\"<br>\r\n\"I DeEm YoU tHe MoSt WoRtHy,\" she acts as if that's a blessing to you! \"Do ThIs FoR mE... aNd I sHaLL pErSoNaLLy sEe To It ThAt ThE LiVeS yOu'Ve TaKeN aRe ReStOrEd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat offer keen your interest. She'd bring back the people you inadvertently killed? Can she do that?!<br>\r\nYou tried to keep your cool and not look TOO excited by that offer, \"You... you will honestly do that for me... Izanami-sama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzanami... bowed. You felt a spiritual sense of assurance when a goddess bowed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YoU hAvE mY SoLeMn PrOmIsE,\" the puppet vowed, \"wILL yOu AcCePt mY InViTaTiOn... mY kNiGhT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it. You thought hard, but you couldnt think long. To say it was a tempting offer would be putting it mildly. But it was at the cost at potentially putting a foreign nation in danger at the hands of a fallen god. The White Council would never forgive you at this rate... but you'd be under the protection of one of Japan's senior deities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whether or not the 'protection' was worth it remains to be seen. How badly did you want to save those poor innocent souls lost? Would it be worth possibly putting more innocent souls at risk?</span></div></div>",

I would have the protection of a goddess. And the best part of it, I'll be able to fix and redeem my mistakes. Besides, she seems nice even if she is the goddess of the dead. Also, it's so strange. Somehow, I feel attracted to her.</span>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into her eyes once again and say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I have made my decision, Izanami-sama</span>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"What have you decided, Sparrow-san?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering right away, you bent down on you knee, as a knight would do and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cblue\">I solemnly swear upon my immortal soul that I, Leon Sparrow, shall serve thy, Izanami-no-Miko, as your knight and aid you in achieving your goal. And I shall do so until my either, the goal is achieved or my services are no longer necessary for thy, watashi no Megami-sama.</span>\", as you said the last word, you picked Izanami's hand and kissed it, to show your loyalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzanami was impressed by the whole ordeal! She expected a simple \"Yes\" or \"I accept\". She never expected for you to make an oath or for you to vow to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">And I accept thou, Leon Sparrow, as my champion knight. And I, Izanami-no-Miko, solemnly swear to keep my word of reviving the ones that thou hast killed and to spare the lives of the innocent. And thou shall be my knight until <u><b>our</b></u> goal is achieved or until thy services are no longer necessary for me.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said the last word, commanded her puppet to come to her and to give her a cutting object. The puppet did as she was commanded and handed a knife she had in the waist of her clothes. Izanami then asked you to give her your hand and she raised her own hand. She then used the knife to make two small cuts, one in your middle finger and one in her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">For the vow to be complete, you must drink a drop of my blood and you must drink a drop of my blood.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did so, and then, something began to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After you drank Izanami's blood, you fell on you knees and began to feel something inside of you. It wasn't anything unpleasant, like pain. But it wasn't pleasant either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Ugh... I feel... strange. What's happening to me, Izanami-sama?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Since you drank my blood, you are gaining powers. But, I do not know how they will affect you or or you body, Sparrow-san.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a strange and intense red aura began to emanate from you body. The aura became more and more intense and bright until you where completely engulfed by it and couldn't be seen. When the aura engulfed you, Izanami began to worry about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Sparrow-san?! Sparrow-san, can you hear me?! SPARROW-SAN!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't answer due to the transformations your were going through. You felt that your body started to change. You gained more bulk, your nails became wolf-like claws, your hair became so long that it reaches the end of your back and it became silver in color. Your canines became fangs, many rune-like symbols appeared in you arms and torso. Three sets of red claw-like marks appeared in your face and your eyes became blood red with slithed, black pupils (like those of Akashia Moka from Rosario+Vampire in her inner form when she's really angry, check episode 12 from season 1). In the meanwhile, Izanami was still calling for you, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Sparrow-san! Please answer me, Sparrow-san!!!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was as worried for you, like someone would worry for their most beloved one. Then, suddenly, the aura around you started to diminish until you were somewhat visible again. Then, Izanami, recognizing you form, started to run in you direction, relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Sparrow-san! Are you alright?\"</span>, she asked, stopping right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes, Izanami-sama. I'm okay. But I feel different.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the aura vanished completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"*gasp*! Sparrow-san?! Is that you?!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes, Izanami-sama. Why?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"No wonder you feel different.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"What do you mean? How do I look?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Well... Personally, I think you look quite good. *And quite handsome, too* But I think you should judge that. Here, take a look at yourself.\"</span>, she said blushing behind of her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then summoned a full-body mirror with obsidian colored borders and put it in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"GASP!!! Wow...\"</span>, was the only thing you managed to say, at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"So? What do you think?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I... I don't know how to put it in words, Izanami-sama. I can hardly believe that the image in the mirror is me. Still, after seeing you, the goddess of the dead herself and you possessing someone, I guess seeing myself transformed like this shouldn't surprise me so much.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"*Giggles*. Maybe so. But tell me, do you like your new form?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Yes, Izanami-sama. I do. Judging by the fangs and by the affinity I now feel towards bats, I'm assume I'm a vampire or half vampire, right?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Indeed. Still, I feel your transformation is not complete.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Eh? So, this isn't my full form?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Exactly.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I see. Now that I think about it, while I was transforming,I felt like something in my back and also right at the end of my back wanted to come out but, whatever those things were, something, maybe my own body, stopped them from coming out. But, although I'm not sure, I have an idea of what they were.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Is that so? And what do you think those things were, Sparrow-san?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"If what I know of the japanese mythology is correct, then I assume that it would be a pair of wings and tail.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Hmm... Interesting. Still, for someone who's not from Japan, you know quite a lot, don't you, Sparrow-san?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I said I'm not from Japan. But, that dosen't mean that I haven't studied and learned about it and it's culture. I was always fascinated by the japanese culture. Especially the music, mythology, folklore and fiction. Also, vampires are something common to many cultures, though they have many differences from one culture to another.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"I see. You mentioned that you liked music first. So, I assume you like music more the the rest, don't you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Indeed. But not only the japanese music. I always really loved music, since I was a little kid.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"How unusual. You are quite an interesting person, Sparrow-san.\"</span> she said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Thank you, Izanami-sama.\"</span>, you said, blushing thanks to the compliment, but you trying to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"You're welcome. And you if you want to hide something, like the way your blushing, which I think it's quite cute, then I suggest you try harder next time, my champion knight.\"</span>, she said giggling like a high school student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment only made you blush more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Tee hee! How cute! I really like the way you blush! I can see that I'm going to have quite a lot of fun with you, Sparrow-san.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I think that with that \"having fun with you\", you mean both, actually having fun with me and teasing me, don't you?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Bingo! The hee! How did you knew?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"I had some experiences like those with Onee-san.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Ah. So you have a sister, hmm? Interesting. I'd like to meet her, some day, if you don't mind.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Not at all, Izanami-sama. Rather, I'd be honored!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Sparrow-san...\"</span>, she said, blushing again. Tough, again, it was hidden by her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"So, what do we do now?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">\"Hmm... I think we should...</span></span></div></div>",

I'M calling him Jeremiah Westwayne!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt quite a bit different than what you were much earlier. Physically, you dont notice anything different about yourself. No wings or claws or devil horns or centipede-like appendages, etc! Yet, you feel different... somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... happened to me?\" you spoke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In ackschange fur a share of ya mortal burack enahgy... I gavuh you a taste of my divine powah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard another voice answer your question. A voice you didnt hear earlier. A young yet heavily accented voice. High pitched, kinda cute, sounds even younger than you, but the aura given about it demanded authority. <br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes at the young Japanese woman standing where Izanami used to be. This tall beautiful black haired (slightly braided) woman with fair peach skin, purple mascara coating her slanted eyelids, pointed elf-like ears, enlarged pupils in the middle of her shining silver eyes, a black Shinto symbol tattooed on her forehead, wearing a thick warm pink kimono sparkling with glittering golden designs (you wouldnt be surprised if they were in fact REAL gold!). Even if you didnt know by heart who this woman is, the kanji ring on her finger, the kabuki mask in her hand, and the white snake slithering around her wouldve given it away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I....IZANAMI-SAMA?!\" you shouted in a mixture of disbelief AND awe. To say she was gorgeous wouldve been an understatement. She was HEAVENLY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzanami giggled as she pulled out an oriental fan, \"Hohohoho... you may stop durooling now, Westwayne-kun!\" You wiped the drool off your lip as she spoke, \"sadiry, zis is only an irrusionary image of my fahmer self. Da enahgy I ackwired furum you is still rimited, but 'as potential to gurow.\"<br>\r\nYou glanced over at the reflection of her in the pond... still revealing her corpsy form.<br>\r\n\"I see.\" That's one hell of a magic trick.<br>\r\nEven the demonic creatures around you had human forms in tattered clothes, military uniforms, and broken samurai armor. Perhaps these were their previous lives before their damnation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzanami squinted her eyes and gave a cutesy smile, SO ungodly like, \" 'Owevah, dis sample of powah does not eben compare to what I've gibben YOU! You havuh notting to fear from yo Whitah Gouncil anymore!\" Nothing to fear, she says? You looked down at your palms, curious at what kinds of magic she has just given to you in exchange for what you gave her. Considering this game from the Goddess of the Dead herself, you'd be lying if you said you werent slightly terrified. You were reckless with the magic you already had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I berieve we havah spent more dan enough time here, Westwayne-kun,\" it sounded a little odd she was now calling you 'Westwayne-KUN! \"In cereburation of my newbound freedom, I am curious tah know how my rand has changed throught dhe ages. Would yoo kindury show me around?\" You dare not assume this was some sort of 'fancy' way of her asking you out on a date! Perhaps your newbound knowledge was telling you otherwise, but you flat out ignored it and just believed she wanted to know how her country looks in modern-day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou humbly bowed, despite your newbound knowledge telling you it was no longer necessary, \"As you wish, Izanami-sama.\"<br>\r\nShe giggled at your continuing show of loyalty as she fanned herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"/My loyal children! Let us depart from this fallen shrine quickly before the authorities arrive!/\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzanami gave that order to her followers... in Japanese! And you understood every word completely! Another taste of your newbound power from Izanami, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"/You heard the Goddess, men!/\" the slightly aged samurai with the fancy mustache announced, \"/ONWARD!!/\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"/YES!!!/\" announced the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could depart with them, you turned your attention back to the poor Miko who's now lying on the ground unconscious.<br>\r\n\"What about her?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"She wirr rive,\" Izanami casually replied, \"an' when she wakes, she wirr remember notting of what 'appened to her.\" You hope so. Still, you couldnt help but stare at that poor girl. As the others marched out of there, you sensed someone glaring behind you. You turned around and saw the samurai with the fancy mustache staring at you, showing little emotion on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe squinted his eyes. \"/I see doubt in this foreigner's eyes/\" he spoke in Japanese, \"/It is REALLY a good idea for Ms. Izanami to trust THIS lowly boy to be her head knight?/\" Did he assume you couldnt understand a word he's saying?!<br>\r\n\"/Oh, come off your high-horse, Oda-san!/\" rattled a middle-aged grey bearded man in a WWII military uniform, \"/we're finally out of that damn place! Tonight's the tonight we should be celebrating!/\" After grey-beard left, Oda still stared at you with a distrusting look, but moved along with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding ding-a ding DING!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, your cellphone went off. Since you were kind of away from the revived Hellspawn's attention, you checked your phone. You got a text message your dad. On your phone, the message read 'Where are you?'<br>\r\nOh right. Your dad! You never told him you left! You just didnt have the heart to worry him with the fact that youre wanted for murder by the White Council. Well, he's probably worried about you now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didnt wanna tell him what you did, but he's still your dad. He's the last member of your family left. You'd only feel even more miserable if you keep even MORE secrets from him!<br>\r\nBut how the HELL (no pun intended) are you gonna be able to explain to him you freed a Goddess from Hell?!</span></div></div>",

Everywhere you looked did not reveal the presence of your stalker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, your future girlfriend, foretold to find you by the priestess of my village...\" A melodious feminine voice called out from around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show yourself then!\" You demanded, while stopping in place in an attempt to hide your anxiousness from the mystery lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So turn around.

But their potential upside is they stick with a code of conduct and are willing to hear your side of a argument/story/debate, even if they don't feel like talking to you at the moment. Of course, you might meet the rare Elf who is kind,sweet, and caring toward everyone. If you do meet with that kind of Elf, count your blessings and hope her family doesn't try to separate the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark elves like to fight, prefer low-lit places, and have a fondness for spiders. They have a great desire to be the one in control of the relationship, but some people claim that a few secretly want the guy to fight back and dominate them. They also have a hidden jealous streak a mile wide, so if you find yourself in a relationship with one, avoid talking to any other women at all costs. Because if you do, She won't kill you, but she will make your life very unpleasant for quite a while. You better hope that she isn't a wiz at creating potions.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story begins one dark and rainy day in Texas when a young man was driving down the street in what appeared to be a Cadillac car. This young man was Trent and he was driving to work in his father\u2019s car. His father had borrowed Trent\u2019s own truck  to go to a flea market. \u201cI hope that Dad doesn\u2019t bring home another \u201cBigfoot\u201d foot fossil. This obsession with cryptids is really beginning to bug me.\u201d Trent\u2019s father was a self-proclaimed cryptozoologist who claimed to have seen Bigfoot and had been tracking him for years. Trent himself didn\u2019t believe in the supernatural and doubted the existence of cryptids. Of course, he was 24 and had never been on a date in his life. This gave Trent a cynical outlook on life. It didn\u2019t help matters that working for a Mexican restaurant was the closest excitement that he got in his life. The customers at his workplace were eccentric bordering on insane but by now he had gotten so accustomed to such strange happening that he had fallen into depression. The reason he took the job in the first place was an attempt to meet a beautiful girl, but so far, none of the female customers ever interested him. It was as if there was a certain quality that he was looking for and never found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent just let out a sigh and then came to a red light. \"Houston just isn't what it used to be. I gotta get out of here.\" Trent then heard thunder and looked in the sky over the traffic light. \"The rain is really coming down hard today. And it's not even noon.\" But then something flew through the sky that looked too big to be a bird. \"Huh?\" asked Trent. Trent took a closer look and saw that the creature flying through the sky was large and heavily built but surprisingly humanoid and it appeared to have arms and wings and horns and a tail with sharp talons. Trent's jaw dropped and while he was trying to figure out what he saw, he heard a honking noise and turned around to see he was holding up traffic. The light had turned green. The young man momentarily had to forget what he saw and drive off towards his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15 minutes later, Trent had arrived in the parking lot of El Rodadoro, the very restaurant at which he was employed. His first reaction was to take out his cell phone and contact his father. At that moment, Trent's father was at the flea market and was observing what he believed to be the skeleton of a gremlin in a jar when the phone ran. \"Hello?\" asked Trent's father. \"Dad!\" yelled Trent on the phone. \"On my way to work, I saw something amazing.\" Trent's father's eyes popped and he put down the gremlin jar he was observing. \"Did you see <i>him</i>, son. Did you see Bigfoot?\" \"Not Bigfoot!\" yelled Trent. \"Bigfoot can't fly! What I saw was a large flying creature with leather wings, the horns of a demon and sharp talons! I don't know <i>exactly</i> what it was since it was too cloudy to get a good look but it looked like a gargoyle.\" \"Impossible,\" said Trent's father. \"The only area in North America where gargoyles live is in New York. With one exception. Wait. You're in Texas and you're not that far from Houston's NASA base. You must've seen Frank Shaw's Gargoyle.\" \"I'm not sure what I saw, Dad. Listen, I've got to go to work in a few minutes. I'll call you again later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrent hung up on the phone and let out a sigh. \u201cAnd now for reality to win over fantasy.\u201d The young man walked up to his post behind the counter but surprisingly there was nobody there in the form of customers. \u201cWell look at that,\u201d said Trent. \u201cIt\u2019s raining so hard that not even the freaks are coming out. Heck, I don\u2019t even see Isaiah today? Where is that boss of mine?\u201d Trent noticed a not left on the counter and picked it up to read it. \u201cDear, Trent. I\u2019m feeling under the weather and couldn\u2019t make it to work. I\u2019m going to need you to be in charge for the next few days. I am expecting a new employee today to help you out. She will be working as the waitress for El Rodadoro and recently arrived from France. Her name is Monique and I believe it is only fair to warn you. She looks somewhat unusual. Do not give her any reason to feel uncomfortable in Houston. Signed, Isaiah.\u201d Trent rolled his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s about time he hired somebody else. I keep telling that idiot that we need more employees in here than just him and me. Looks like he finally listened. Hmm. A young lady all the way from France. Hmm. This might be just what I need to spice up my life.\u201d Trent looked in the window and adjusted his glasses and then fixed the collar on his shirt.\u201d He gave a smile and then he heard the door to El Rodadoro open up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bonjour?\" asked a female voice in a French accent. \"C'est le Rodadoro.\" \"Huh,\" said Trent not looking to see the new employee. \"That was surprisingly fast. Yes, this is El Rodadoro. My name is Trent. You must be Monique. Welcome to Tex...as?\" Trent's eyes popped because he could not believe his eyes. Monique was indeed from France but she was most definitely not human. Monique was a rather large gargoyle. She stood 10 feet high and was very fat and pear-shaped. She had bright red-violet-skin with long blonde hair reaching down to her rather enormous butt. Her fingers were sharp claws and she had talons for feet. She had two long, pointy and curved horns facing downwards and a long lizard-like tail with leather wings that had bright lavender-colored membranes like the wings of a bat. Finally, in terms of appearance, Monique had a small mole on her chin. For clothing, the gargoyle girl wore a brown loincloth with a belt, fishnet stockings and a light blue tank top.\" Trent gasped as the gargoyle girl smiled at him and wagged her tail. Then it hit him, he was looking at the same creature he and seen flying through the air earlier. Trent wanted to be afraid, but for some reason, he also felt somewhat fascinated with the gargoyle beauty standing before him and shaking her hips.</span></div></div>",

No serious. THEY ACTUALLY EXIST?! Something that spawned from a stupid South Park episode actually exists in your flipping reality!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, I'm not talking about Manbearpig, cuz that would actually make a little sense (a LITTLE sense!). I'm talking about... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nok, bare with me here... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...the goddamn Underpants Gnomes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, short little underground-based munchkins that swipe people's underwear for some apparent reason that allows them to make profits are REAL. You couldnt possibly dream this kind of stupid! Matt and Trey are spinning in their graves and theyre not even dead! It was incredibly hard to come to grips with that kind of unbelievable fact! Before this incident, you wouldve never believed that the Underpants Gnomes were real. You didnt even find that episode all that funny! But one night, one cold lonely night during a really bad blackout, things changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up after hearing a loud rustling in the middle of the night. As tired as you were, you assumed the worse that you had a break in and judging by your bedroom window shattered, you were right.<br>\r\nYou slowly got up being careful not to make a sound, fearing the intruder may be armed (and wishing you finally did the sensible thing and got that damn gun permit your dad constantly suggested you getting!), and quietly slip out of bed while your eyes took time to adjust in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood news is your little cash-safe remained untouched. You tip toe toward the sound of the rustling\u2026 and the sound of the sniffing. The heavy sniffing. The direction it came from was your clothes hamper. Yep, your CLOTHES HAMPER.<br>\r\nSeems like your intruder is worse than a thief, it\u2019s a creepy stalker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your eyes better focused, you could spot what looked to be a short brown-haired girl in funny little brown munchkin clothes with funny shoes and a brown cap that looked sort of like one of those mardi gras hats. You squinted your eyes at this odd girl, not being sure how to react until you noticed her pointy ears. They actually looked elven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mouthed \u2018What the fu-\u2019 then you noticed what exactly she was sniffing. A pair of your used boxers! For that moment, forget the funny clothes, forget the funny ears, your intruder is sniffing your underwear! Friggin ew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the hell are you doing?\u201d you spoke up, startling your underwear sniffer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c!!\u201d she nearly jumped just before turning around and tilted her head up at you! Her big jade green eyes widened at yours. Despite being spooked, she was still gripping your boxers tightly in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing in my house?\u201d you questioned, \u201cand were you just sniffing those?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d she stared back at you in nervous silence like a cat that just got caught sticking her paw in the fish tank\u2026 while sniffing her master\u2019s boxers! You waited impatiently for an answer.<br>\r\nBut instead, she just quickly swipes a few more pairs out of the hamper and makes a dash out the window!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY! COME BACK HERE!\u201d you shouted and gave chase to that thieving creepy stalker pointy eared thing! \u201cWHO ARE YOU?!!\u201d<br>\r\nShe doesnt even reply. She resumes running from you and you chase her across the block. Dang this midget is fast! After a couple minutes, you follow her toward the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when youre starting to catch up, the short pointy earred raises her hand and some bright pink aura of light emits from it! The ground in front of her suddenly glow a bright strange weird symbol! Then all of a sudden, the earth shakes and the glowing ground tears open, revealing a huge hole! You stop running and drop your jaw at the oddity before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gotta be kidding me!\u201d you mutter. The gnome turns back to you one last time, locking her big green eyes with yours before leaping into the hole with your stolen boxers in tow! Unbelievable. There were no words to describe what just happen but WTF. You dont get enough time to reflect on the weirdness tonight before the hole begins to close\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story begins one dark Halloween when a young man in his early 20s is in his apartment putting together his costume and makeup. He put in a pair of red contact lenses before he heard the phone ringing and picked up a metal mask made to look like the head of the Marvel Comics villain Ultron. \u201cHello?\u201d said the young man on the phone. \u201cHey, Mack,\u201d said the voice on the other end. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? It\u2019s almost Sundown. You don\u2019t want the costume party to start without you.\u201d Mack gave a scoff and put on his Ultron mask. \u201cI can wait, Duncan. You said the theme was superhero comics? I can\u2019t wait to see everyone\u2019s faces when I come in dressed as Ultron. It took me a month to design the costume.\u201d On the other end of the line, Mack\u2019s friend, Duncan, was dressed up in a costume that made him look like Iron Patriot. \u201cGoing as a super villain this time, huh? Well, I\u2019ll be seeing you there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Duncan hung up, Mack adjusted his Ultron mask and looked into the mirror before he gave a hiss. \u201cI wonder if chicks dig killer robots.\u201d Mack joked to himself. Mack then took out a flashlight and painted the lens blue before placing it in a jack-o-lantern with the Avengers logo on it and turning the light on right before placing it outside of his house and locking the door. Mack let out an evil laugh as he saw that the sun was going down. \u201cShowtime.\u201d He said. Mack walked down the streets noticing that this Halloween was wild as ever. The buildings were decorated with fake spider webs and gargoyle statues. Mack heard giggling and saw three children. One was dressed as Frankenstein\u2019s monster, one was dressed as a mummy and the third was dressed as a wolfman. Mack couldn\u2019t help but laugh at their costumes. \u201cFor a minute,\u201d he said. \u201cI would\u2019ve sworn that those were real monsters.\u201d That was when Mack heard a scoff. \u201cThat\u2019s only because you\u2019ve never seen a real monster.\u201d It was there Mack heard loud footsteps and turned around to see a woman who looked like she was on the way to the same costume party that he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most striking feature of this mysterious woman was that she didn\u2019t appear to be human. Though it could\u2019ve possibly been a costume. She was a huge 10ft tall minotaur resembling a white Holstein cow with pink spots instead of black and long slicked-back hair as red as blood worn in a ponytail. Fitting a cow she was very fat and most likely weighed 1000lbs and she had massive E-cup breasts and a huge cow\u2019s udder between her legs as well as a pair of large horns. The big minotaur lady wore dark red lipstick and gold earrings. While it seemed that her bovine features were her costume, this strange woman was wearing a purple domino mask and cape and an indigo tank top and shorts with a belt (albeit opened up to reveal her udder), making her resemble the Huntress from DC Comics. Mack took one look at the cow girl and was in utter surprise. \u201cThat is an amazing costume.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow girl turned her head to face Mack and then she gave a smile. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cI was going to dress up as Jean Grey, but I\u2019ve dressed as a Marvel superhero for the last 7 years and decided to throw DC a bone for a change.\u201d \u201cActually,\u201d said Mack. \u201cI\u2019m more amazed at that cow costume under your Huntress costume. It\u2019s so realistic.\u201d The minotaur Huntress girl gave a look of surprise and then let out a slight laugh. \u201cUh,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah. But to be fair... my mother made that costume, if you know what I mean.\u201d Mack didn\u2019t appear to know what she meant and looked around. \u201cShe did a good job. Tell the old girl she should be designing costumes for Mardi Gras.\u201d The minotaur girl had to fight back the urge to laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s so ignorant it\u2019s cute,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cBoy, is he for a big surprise.\u201d The cow girl then cleared her throat. \u201cI really like your Ultron costume as well. My favorite Marvel villain. I take it you\u2019re heading for that big costume party at 77 Wyvern Street.\u201d \u201cI sure am,\u201d said Mack. \u201cWait. Duncan never told me about you. I don't even know your name.\" The cow woman turned her head and smiled. \"Dominique. See you at the party.\" As Dominique walked away, Mack could've sworn that she had a tail. But at that time, Mack didn't think much of it because it was Halloween. \"That is a <i>very</i> good costume.\"</span></div></div>",
