Cocking her head to the side in a curious manner, she softly pads over. Yall are still trying to see each other when the wolf sets her paw right on top of the bus, causing a slight but not dangerous cave in of the roof. Everyone on the bus freezes. The wolf takes her paw off and the roof resets, the metal groaning. Everyone starts freaking out, but the windows and doors are all stuck, EVEN THE BACK EMERGENCY EXIT! The wolf lays down in front of the bus and her body curling around it clockwise and her tail is on resting against the tires on the left side. She rested her muzzle on the bus' hood, which also groaned under the weight. She was doing it carefully, so it was light enough that the bus didn't bend, but heavy enough that the metal groaned and it was noticeable. Everyone is staring at the giant muzzle in the front window. How do they react?</span></div></div>",

She stood up and, carefully using her paw, knocked the bus onto its side. Everyone inside, including you, are suddenly tossed to the side, landing on the windows. The bus was rolled again onto its top. Everyone fell again onto the roof of the bus. Using her claw, the wolf tore off the emergency door and then using her paws, held the bus in nosedive position. You can guess what happened inside. The wolf opened her mouth and clamped it around the now open emergency exit. Her lower fangs were behind the tires and her upper fangs pierced the roof. She then tried to poke her tongue through but only succeeded in spilling saliva into the bus, making the backs of the seats really wet and slippery.

He seems calm, but you can feel panic in him. At first you feel like telling him to drive on, but then you start feeling the same sort of panic. You saw the leading zebra trample a blade of grass under its humongous hoof. The same could easily happen to you. Quickly, people begin realizing the seriousness of the situation and the bus is filled with panic. Some people begin screaming and others bark random orders at the driver. The driver is too baffled by the mayhem and for a moment simply stares at the incoming herd. He quickly recovers himself and begins turning the bus around, but it is too late. The herd catches up with you. Hooves slam down all around you. The ground shakes and dust flies everywhere. The driver stops the bus in its tracks clearly realizing that there was nowhere to go. People come up to the driver and shout at him telling him to drive. Others try to brake through the doors whilst the rest simply loose it and just scream. A select few (including you) just curl up and hope for the best. Just in the nick of time you look out the window to see a dirty hoof coming at you. You hear the breaking of glass as the bus is thrust in the air. Everyone tumbles about inside. You slam your shoulder hard against the seat opposite of you. Someone's high-heel scraps your face. Your elbow slams against someone's face. The bus crashes onto the ground and rolls over a few times before slamming against a rock. You lay still, waiting for death to take you. But it never does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter who knows how long you dare to open one eye. The bus seats hang above you. You turn your head left and are greeted by light peeking through the broken windows. You turn your head right and gasp. Next to you lies a crushed and bloody face. The person was dead. You quickly look away in horror. Immediately you try to pull yourself out of the wreck. Shards of glass cut through your skin, but you keep on crawling. The dead face was too horrifying to lay next to. Finally you make it out of the bus and see a fair amount of survivors already outside. One of them notices you and helps you out. You inspect your body. No serious wounds. A few minor cuts and bruises. You were lucky. Then you inspect your surroundings. You see zebras grazing everywhere. At least they were not stampeding about. You are surprised at the amount of people still alive and more were still being pulled out of the wreck. You decide to make yourself useful and help when the sun is blocked by a huge shadow. You look up and see the gigantic muzzle of a zebra who had taken interest in your group. Some people scream and start running. Most people keep their nerve and remain still, but a group takes off into the grass and one woman dashes the opposite direction alone. You realize that she was making her way to the bushes away from the zebras which was without doubt pretty smart compared to the people running towards them. As the zebra's muzzle descends you make your choice.</span></div></div>",

You almost loose your balance in the process, but manage to stay up by hugging the huge muzzle. You expect the zebra to loose interest quickly, but instead it roles out its tongue and licks you. You are coated with saliva. Just an affectionate lick you hope. Indeed, the zebra had meant it only as an affectionate lick, but then it got a taste on your salty body and, unfortunately for you, equines love the taste of salt. The next lick comes with such greed that you know there's more to it than affection. You quickly turn around to run and see your comrades already doing so. The first two leaps seem promising, but on the third darkness envelopes you and you feel teeth clamp against your waist. The zebra lifts you high-up in the air. With the little light that creeps through the gap between the teeth you can make out the pulsating tongue and the hind-incisors, but beyond that there is only darkness. You struggle against the zebra's grip, but your efforts are useless as the tongue rubs against your face and the teeth press even harder on you. Outside, the people watch in horror as they see your kicking legs disappear between the lips as the zebra sucks you into its maw. Inside, your experience is worse as the zebra manipulates you with its tongue. Sometimes you scrap against the teeth, other times you are rubbed against a slimy cheek, but the worst is when the zebra presses you against the roof of its mouth and sucks on you. Warm and sticky saliva drenches your entire body. Your screams and kicks are answered only by soft neighs of pleasure. As a final effort you kick the mouth as hard as you can and this time something happens. The mouth tilts, but no the direction you want it to. You begin sliding down towards the throat! Desperately, you try to grab on to something, but unfortunately the mouth is constructed to allow food to pass on into the throat as efficiently as possible. Your body drops in and the zebra swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the audible gulp you try to scream for help, but you voice isn't heard even as a muffle on the outside. The trip down the esophagus is horrible. Mucus gathers onto your body, the heart beats like a huge drum and as if a distant call to you, the stomach growls. You try to stop yourself from sliding, but your destination is inevitable. Slowly, you reach the stomach entrance. The esophagus pushes your head in and your nostrils are filled with the most horrendous smell imaginable. Soon you find yourself diving into the gastric juice which immediately starts eating your skin. Though you cannot see, you can feel the disgusting mush that was once grass gather around you. More mush enters the stomach and falls on top of you. You try to keep yourself above it all, but then you realize that it is only prolonging your demise. You try to think of happy things, but it is of no comfort as you writhe in pain, slowly digesting inside the zebras belly. Alive.</span></div></div>",

The group in front of you slows down to a fast paced walk and you catch up with them. This calms your nerves a bit. Working together surely would increase your chances of survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not get far when someone in the group shouts, \"Look out!\". Before you have a chance to react the ground sends of massive tremors as something huge slams down right behind your back. Turning around you see a giant hoof where the man next to you had stood just seconds before. Next people begin to scream as a giant muzzle descends and hungry jaws close upon a bunch of grass. Luckily, the zebra had noticed your group and tried avoid it. This is of little comfort, however, as everyone realizes that the patch of fresh grass you are standing in attracts yet more zebras. Hooves thunder around you and dust shoots into the air as the creatures push in to grab at least a mouthful. Unfortunately for some of your comrades, they find themselves being part of those mouthfuls. A small distance from you a woman gets caught in between a zebras incisors. You turn your head and spare yourself the sight. The shaking ground, the dust and the munching around you makes you loose your sense of direction so you simply dash towards whatever whole you happen to see in the ongoing chaos. More than once your instincts save you from a slamming hoof or closing jaws. To make matters worse some of the zebras notice your panic filled puny group and either through irritation of pure curiosity begin snatching people up or pinning them under their hooves which ultimately crushes them. You see somebody in running towards something and assume that he has found a way out. You dash after him only to see him getting snatched up and lifted into the air by eager lips. Despite the horror you are feeling towards that person you realize that he may have just saved your life as a perfect gap for escape opens up for you. You make a desperate final attempt which just and just succeeds. You find yourself outside the horrible conglomeration, but keep on running to get as far away as possible from the monsters. Not far off you see five survivors doing the same thing and you dash after them. You pray that nothing would go wrong.</span></div></div>",

Saliva washes over your onto your body and even soaks your hair. There really is nothing you can do to fight back yet you still flail about violently. You are determined not to give up.
