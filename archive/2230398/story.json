He could feel the eyes of everybody watching him. They were gigantic compared to him, utter goddesses. Their looks consisted of curiosity, wonder, disgust, awe and excitement. He felt weak and vulnerable. He didn't want to come here. He had begged his mother to allow him to stay home-schooled, but she insisted that it would allow him to finally have a social life and meet new people. He was so nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello. My name is K-Kieran McLoughlin.

Kieran, you'll be going with Heather\" said Mrs. Brown. She picked him up and brought him over to Heather's desk before placing him back down.  Heather was a young christian girl with dirty blond hair and glasses. Kieran looked up nervously at the beautiful face before him. She was absolutely gorgeous. However, Kieran was still scared, due to her massive size compared to him. The teacher began the lesson and Heather turned her attention towards her new little friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, little Kieran\" she cooed quietly, smiling down at him. To her, he looked like the most adorable thing she'd ever seen. \"Don't be scared, I won't hurt you.

Kieran sighs in relief that she wasn't going to eat him. His little sister had tried to eat him countless times, which had seriously traumatized him.

Her slim waist like a mountain.

Before he could say anything, she sucked him inside, his world becoming pink. Hot, hot like in a Jacuzzi, her salvia enveloping his whole body, her bodily odor assulting his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather moved him left and right. Her face determinated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes slided by themselves, his naked body in contact with her tongue, his sweat mixing with her saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAACH!\" Kieran screamed hauntingly. \"HEATHER!

It was so tight that Kieran felt like he was going be squished or end up popping from the pressure. His limbs were bent in ways that didn't seem natural. He could hear the sound of her rhythmic heartbeat as well as the sounds of Heather going about the rest of her schoolday. Eventually, he was squeezed through a tight sphincter and dropped into the cavernous, hellscape that was Heather's stomach. It gurgled and groaned, welcoming its new meal. The low pH caused Kieran's nose to sting. He couldn't breathe. The acids slowly began to work on his tiny naked body. He desperately tried to get out, pounding on the stomach walls and pleading for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEATHER!!! HEATHER!! PLEASE LET ME OUT!!!

She was clearly walking somewhere... Kieran rested, lying in her mouth, his body sweating slightly, the temperature hotter then in sauna and as wet as in a pool.

Ashleys pussy was soaking wet from torturing Kieran.  The air was thick for Kieran, and her scent was driving him mad, he didn't know if he should be scared or aroused.  Just then ashley scooted forward trapping him under the weight of her pussy.  \"Squirm for me you little bug, make yourself useful for once.  Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley must have spoke up a little too loud as Mrs. Brown heard this and walked over to Ashley's desk. \"Ashley, where did Kieran go?\" Mrs Brown asked impatiently.
