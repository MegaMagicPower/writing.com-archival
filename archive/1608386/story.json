Leave options for race of monster<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*One of my reviewers has told me that people don't know what sorts of monsters are allowed, well here is what type of monster you are allowed to use,<br>\r\n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,<br>\r\n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br>\r\n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br>\r\n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br>\r\n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br>\r\n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,<br>\r\nYou can use any monster you want! You want a dragon, I want a barbeque, If you want a giant, I want to hear someone saying \"Fee Fie Foe Fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.\" If you want a kitsune, I want to know if he has one tail or twenty. If you want a werewolf, I want to hear someone howling at the moon. <br>\r\nIf you can think up a new one, put it in, As long as you follow the rules, the monster can be as outlandish as you want. All I ask is this, leave an other as an option for others to put their own monster up. Also, when it comes to age, all that I ask is that you find the right age range, when you first start. <br>\r\nHowever, if time passes, like years, I will allow it. All I ask is this, follow the rules, be creative, make sure your stories make sence, and have fun. Oh, and keep on writing, writers.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Here is an example of what I am looking for in my story. The charactors are my own, and yes, this will be like a paraphrasing of Lethal Weapon, in a manner of speaking.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked at the two females, one who was five years my junior, and the other who had just turned thirteen, I couldn't help but wonder what it would be like to grab both of them, stuff them in a bag, toss them in the oven, watch them cook, and savor their delicious flesh. <br>\r\nHowever, the fact that it would be the same thing that had happened to the love of my life stops me from taking the lives of my wife and stepdaughter. <br>\r\nI loved my girlfriend, and when I heard that some, monster, had eaten her, I tried to kill myself. <br>\r\nHowever, at the last second, just as I was about to do it, something happened, and I had the desire to live. <br>\r\nEveryday is a battle, everyday I long to eat the flesh of my human bretheran, as I am half human. <br>\r\nHowever, and this is the funny thing, the thing that keeps me from doing so is the love that I have for those humans that I care about, like my wife and stepdaughter.</span></div></div>",

My father wants me to watch as he tortures this one soul. Sorry John, but I've got to go,\" Steve said, as he opened up a portal to Hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" John said. \"I best get ready to go to my cooking class. Something tells me that it will be my best meal that I've cooked yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, I wish you luck,\" Steve said, as he walked through the portal, and John left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\nAs Steve watched the portal close, he turned to see where he was, and recognized that he was in his father's throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father,\" he said, looking at the hundred foot tall demon that was sitting on the throne. \"Why was it that the love of John Wolfstone had to die the way that she did?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know why son,\" The crowned demon said. \"By the truce that is between Heaven and Hell, demons and angels are forbiden to directly interveane in the affairs of motrals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW THAT!\" Steve shouted. \"However, John is my love's stepbrother, and if she hears that he killed himself, all because someone couldn't, persuade, the man that took his love's life to not do it, she will call the whole wedding off. While the demon side of her family and ours agreed that one of her family and one of ours would one day marry, she is mostly human, and was raised by mortals. She will not care for that thousand year old contract, she will care for her brother, first and formost.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is still bound by the contract.\" the demon king said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she isn't father. She could have her own children and I could have my own and one of them could marry.\" Steve said, getting angry<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize that, if you interfear with this mortal's life, it could lead to war with Heaven again!\" his father said, also getting angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care father. I'm going to pervent him from taking his own life, even if I am cast out of Hell, and forbidden from entering Heaven. And I'll do it for his sister's sake!\" Steve shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET OUT OF MY CASTLE Half-breed!\" the king yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me, FATHER!\" Steve shouted back, as he left the castle, and went to another part of Hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in the realm of mortals, John was busy cooking like no tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why John, you seem to be on fire today,\" said the cooking teacher, a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case,\" John said, with a smile. \"Don't bother trying to put me out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" the dragon asked, with a smile. John was his best student, and everytime he had gotten a letter from someone called Honey, his cooking outshined the rest to the point that the teacher had to eat his cooking last, so that the rest were not affected by the taste of John's cooking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey asked me to marry her when we graduate, me from here,and she from Snaptail College,\" John said, as he added a few ingrediants to his cooking. \"And I'll tell you this, I plan on writting her back, to tell her yes. About the only problem is how to tell her it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" the dragon said. \"This might be your best cooking yet, at least until the wedding, so be sure to invite me to that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll do that,\" John said, as he gave out a burst of happy laughter, causing more than a few of the other students to look at him, with looks of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class was done, and the teacher was blown away by John's cooking, in a really big way, as usual, John walked to his room, with a smile on his face. As he walked in, he saw that his roommate, a dark wizard named James, was painting a portriat of a female kitsune, who was laying down on the bed, in a seductive posse, naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two,\" he said, quietly, so that he wouldn't desturbe the two of them too much. \"The letter that Honey sent me is really special today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How special is it?\" the kitsune asked, quietly, barely moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Clara,\" James said, as he carefully took the painting off of his easle, and set it on a rack with other paintings of naked women, to dry. \"Next form. This time, let's do a werewolf.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the fox-like kitsune's shape began to morph, and change size,shape, and color, turning into a werewolf, with only her eyes staying the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as James placed a new sheet of paper on the easle, Clara, who was really a shapeshifter, said, as she sat up, \"Wait, before we start Jimmy, let's hear John's news.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey has asked me to marry her,\" John said, as he laid down on his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Clara said, as she turned into the form of John's girlfriend, as she had seen a picture of the woman, which was on John's desk. \"This lovely woman has finally asked the untouchable John Wolfstone to marry her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" John said, with a smile, as he looked at the shapeshifter. \"And while you look good in her form, nothing will be better than to place my arms around the real version, and feel her body against mine, as the two of us swap sweet whispers in each other's ears.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" James said, as he stood up. \"Let me see if I can summon her in my seeking bowl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" John said, as he tossed a small lock of light brown hair at the wizard. \"Just don't use up too much. Her sent helps me to cook.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" James said, as he took out a few strands, and after giving to rest back, he dropped them into a small silver bowl, and said a few words under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, instead of the woman that John loved, James found himself looking at two incompleate images, one of a man and a woman holding each other, in a manner suggesting saddness, and one of someplace else, something that was dark. Curious, James made a slight alteration to the spell, so that he, and only he, could hear what was being said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't belive she is dead,\" a man said, with a ragged voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to say to John?\" said a woman, with sobs in her voice. \"You know how the two of them were in love and always wrote to each other.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the other image was silent, so, James altered the spell again, so that he could see the whole area surrounding the image, and realized that it was a septic system. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, James cancled the magic, looked at John and said, \"She's busy with some um, bathroom things. Something tells me that you wouldn't like it if I saw her naked, as it were.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you would be right,\" John said as he got up and gave the wizard a light smack on the head, with a bit of laughter. \"I just can't wait to tell her my answer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, while you get busy with your work,\" James said, \"Me and Clara have a date to go to. The resturant that I have reservations for suggested that I try to show up thirty minutes early, at the very least.\" He then looked at Clara and said, before she could say otherwise, \"Isn't that right, my lovely lady of many forms?\" Clara knew that he only said that when it was something important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" she said. \"We do have to leave now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, John had a dream about Honey. He and the woman were on a hill, holding each other, in a loving embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey,\" he said. \"I love you with all my heart and soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I love you as well Wolfie (Honey's nickname for John),\" the woman said. \"No matter where you are, or where I am, I'll always love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Honey said, \"John, take care of yourself, until we can be together again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we'll always be togther,\" John said. \"After all, you are a part of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" the woman said, as she kissed him. \"But I have to go now. Never forget the times we had together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" John asked. \"I can never forget the woman of my dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a tear comes to the woman's eyes, as she vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\nThe next day, John got a letter from Honey's parents. Thinking that it was about whether or not that they would allow their daughter to marry him, John was shocked when he opened it. Honey, the love of his life, and his reason for cooking his heart out, was dead. A fellow student at her collage had eaten, digested, and flushed her into the septic system of that collage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" he asked himself. For the rest of the day, he stayed in his room, not even moving from his chair, stuck on that single thought. It wasn't until close to suppertime that he moved, when he heard someone knock on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away James,\" he said. Once again, someone knocked on the door. \"I Said 'Go Away'!\" John said, with a deep growl in his voice, as he started shifting into his werewolf form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, it's me,\" said a voice belonging to......</span></div></div>",

Are you sick or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah,\" John said. \"If you call getting your heart ripped out and crushed, and being betrayed by your best friends an illness.\" At this, John started to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\" the teacher asked, as he laid down on the floor, as he couldn't sit in a chair, and was too heavy for the bed, next to the upset, and saddened, young man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read this,\" John said, as he handed him the letter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the teacher let out a heavy sigh. \"John,\" he said, handing the letter back. \"While I can't imagiane how you feel about the lose of your girlfriend, why would you say that your friends betrayed you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve could have honestly told me that she was dead, and James didn't have to lie to me when he tried to summon her imiage up yesterday,\" John said, as he took the letter back, folded it up, and put it next to the one that Honey had written him the other day, as well as the one that he had started to write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he looked at the one that Honey had wrote. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I say yes, when you are in a septic system Honey?\" he asked. \"Even if I found your remains, there would be no way to bring you back, not even to make you one of the undead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, John slammed down on the desk, destroying it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, you need to control your emotions,\" the chef said, as he had ducked to avoid being hit by some of the larger slivers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, John said nothing, as he looked at Honey's picture, the glass sheilding it from dust and sun damage broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been taken over the summer, after their graduation from Snapjaw Centeral School. She had been wearing a red sweater, one with a red hood, and he had been in his werewolf form, and, in a candid moment, the photographer snapped the picture as the two of them started to kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being upset with the man, John had paid him extra, and the pair had left, after they had got a copy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, the two of them went to a tattoo parlor, and after Honey got a tattoo of a small heart, John had pulled out the copy of the picture and told the artist to use the picture to make a tattoo of the two of them kissing and put it on his shoulder with a heart around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" he asked himself, out loud. \"Why couldn't I convince my parents to pay to send you here with me, where you would have been in relative safety? Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, the teacher left, and got John something to eat, a beef stew, one that he had made himself. As he watched John eat, in a manner which seemed to almost make a zombie seem to be alive, he was really concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you feel better soon,\" he said, as he left. \"I'll tell the other teachers that you are not feeling too well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks, John seemed to act as if he was on auto mood, as if someone had to control his body just to make him clean himself, get something to eat, attend classes, though he avoided cooking class, much to Flamescale's sadness, barely spoke, only saying \"Here\" when his name was asked during roll call, never answering any of the questions. In fact, even the zombie students started saying that they were almost alive in comparison to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grades dropped from high A's to low D's, just barely passing. Also, were he had once attended every party that had been held on the campus, he stayed in his room. John had went from being the most care-free and helpful student, to someone that made being a zombie seem like a living breathing human, all within the space of two days, from being elated at being asked to marry the love of his life, to being despaired at the thought of her dead, digested, with her remains settling in some septic system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, John walked outside, and walked to the cliff that was relatively close to the school. He looked out over it, and saw the ocean. In his hands were two things, Honey's letter asking him to marry her, and the picture of them kissing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be with you soon,\" he said, as he tossed them over the edge. He looked at the moon and the stars, as he shifted into his giant werewolf form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you,\" he said, as he took what was to be his last step in this world, when something stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?</span></div></div>",

Back when I was accussed of cheating in English class, you were the only one who belived my innocense. You even found the real cheater. Then, when you found out that I was having problems in math, you took it upon yourself to help me out. Then, when I told you who I really was, you respected my reasons for not using my royal rank. Why, you even respected my decision to court, and date, your sister, and take our time, even though her blood family and mine made a contract that someone from her family and mine would someday be married, so that she could know the real me and not the Prince of the Demons of Hell. Besides, a demon doesn't like to owe the dead.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, you best give me a good reason to live,\" John said. \"This holding spell won't work for much longer, especially when Monster takes over, and tries to kill you, and forces you to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Steve's mind began to race, trying to find a reason to make John want to live. Honey and cooking had been John's whole reasons for being. He could not use them to make him want to live, as they were intertwined too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Steve saw someone next to him, an angel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, isn't this currious,\" she said, as she watched Steve struggle to hold John in place. \"Normally, someone like you would enjoy watching someone kill themselves. Why do you want this one to live?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,\" Steve said, speaking in a language that mortals couldn't hear nor understand. \"I care for his sister, and she cares about him. If he died, and I could have prevented it, she won't speak to me again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you are trying to save his life, out of the love that you have for his sister,\" the angel said, as she looked at John. \"His heart is filled with lose. This Honey was a big part of it. However, the Holy One does agree that John Wolfstone has a role still left to do in this world. That is why she has sent me to help you, for a price.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, besides becoming an angel, which I won't become, what is the price that she'd have me pay for her aid?\" Steve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until John's life is over, you are to remain in the form he first saw you in.\" the angle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Steve realized what it would mean. At ten feet in height, every other demon would be like a giant to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the price that she wants me to pay to save his life?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, but so would your children, and their children, up until John Wolfstone dies,\" the angel said. \"Also, your magic would be one sixth of its real capacity, that also extends to your children as well. until he dies.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Steve looked at his friend, who was starting to lose control of himself, and he was losing control over. \"Alright,\" he said. \"I'll do it, for the sake of his sister's love.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is a first,\" the angel said, as she lend her holy powers to Steve's demonic powers. \"I've never knew that someone like you would agree to such a price for such a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the angel lifted John up, and slammed him to the ground, knocking him out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he alright?\" Steve asked, more concerned for his friend, rather than the fact that he was losing his size, and power, with every second, as he looked over his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will be,\" the angel said, now towering over the prince of Hell. \"Now, to give him a reason to live.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she kissed the giant werewolf on the lips, turning him back to his human form, and vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was gone, Steve rushed up to his friend, who was starting to groan. \"John, are you all right?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that I found my reason to live,\" John said, as he put a hand on the side of his head. \"I can use the pain of my lose to teach others, so that they will never lose the ones that they love, like I did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, by my forfather's foe, you scared the Heaven out of me when you did that,\" Steve said, holding onto him. (Note: Demons can't really refer to anything Holy, as it could kill them, unless they are \"swearing\". Also, instead of scaring the Hell out of them, its Heaven.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, I know,\" John said, as he sat up. \"I guess you managed to pull me from the edge before I fell. By, the way, did you see a bright light? It felt like someone was watching me before you caught me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Steve realized that the angel had erased John's memory and altered it, to make him believe that he had been grabbed by Steve before he had fallen to his death. Does he tell John the truth, and the price that he has paid, or does he go with John's story?</span></div></div>",

At this, Steve knew that he could either go with the lie that the angel had planted into his mind, or, he could tell him the truth, but that would mean that he'd have to tell John the price that he had paid to save his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he said, \"Yah, I saw a bright light. It showed me that you were at the cliff, and about to jump to your death. Well, I had to jump through a few portals to get here in time to  save you, but I am glad that I did.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he gave the man, who was two and a half feet shorter than him, a hug, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry that I couldn't tell you the truth about her,\" he said. \"It's just, I couldn't bare to see you suffer, you mean a great deal to me.

I mean, is there anything left out there that can remind me of her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, unless James found some of her hair, and kept it, after you destroyed your desk, all that I can say for certian would be that tattoo of yours.\" Steve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John took a look at his shoulder and said, \"I doubt I'll ever find another like her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he looked at Steve and asked, \"Can you take a verbal contract?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" Steve asked. \"Do you want to sell your soul to find your girlfriend's killer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" John said. \"However, when I find the bastard, I'm going to kill him, and when I do, I'll make sure to tell him why, and to send him to you. Hell, I might send a few souls to you for the evils that they do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would the duration of this contract be?\" Steve asked, his demon side waking up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until I kill him or I am dead, whichever comes first.\" John said, calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, what if you die before you kill him?\" Steve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have my soul then,\" John said. \"Of course, concidering that I might be sending a lot of souls your way, you might want to keep me alive until then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" Steve said, taking out a special knife, and clasping his left hand over John's, with the knife between their hands, palms touching the blade. \"We have an accord.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a quick jerk, he pulled the knife, cutting the palms of their hands, and their bloods mingling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, Steve let go of John and said, \"You do realize that this binds you to me, and that I could call upon you to do things for me, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John gave a quick chuckle and said, \"You marry my sister and I'd have to help you anyways. She's had boyfriends before and they've all come to me for help. However, when I get my teaching degree, I'm going to head back home to Splittooth, walk up to Mr. Snapjaw, and ask for a job at his school. I have a feeling that the students need to be protected from the other teachers, and each other. Also, there are a lot of monsters out there, and I don't mean by their race, but by their behavior towards others, especially towards children. So, if a soul comes to you saying that I killed them, call it an intrest payment or something. The soul of my girlfriend's killer, I'll bring myself. Of course, if he or she dies before I kill them, let me know. If that happens, well, I'll keep sending souls your way, and I might do that even if and when I kill him, until I die, at which point you can collect my soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well John, all that, just because someone ate Honey,\" said Steve, with a chuckle, as he helped his friend, and future brother-in-law, back to the dorms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" John said. \"Not just for me and Honey, but for everyone else that feels my pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, do you want to see John change his courses to teaching, and finish collage, and get a degree in phlosophy and teaching, or, just skip to when he is twenty-five years old, with his degrees in philosophy and teaching, and going back to Splittooth?</span></div></div>",

While students were encuraged to not prey on each other, and faculty and staff were given a bonus for each month that they didn't eat a student, there was nothing in the rules that said that the dean, a black dragon who had built the school, couldn't eat a problem student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was at this moment, that John decided to knock on the door way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" the teacher asked, turning to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wolfstone,\" she said, with a look of confussion. \"Shouldn't you be in Chef Firescale's cooking class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore,\" he said, with a sigh. \"I can't cook like I used to, not since- (At this, a tear threatens to fall from his eyes.) Well, I just can't cook, not anymore. So, I asked him if I could drop his class, which he let me do. So, basically, I'm free to do what I want, though I'm not sure what I want. Perhaps this class might help out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm always looking for new students,\" the teacher said. \"And I see you already have a Philosophy book, unlike one of my students, whose always forgetting his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, this book might be his,\" John said, opening it up to show the teacher the student's name, Billy Whitetip. \"I found it after he bumped into me and he dropped his books. Then again, with the way that he was running, he probably didn't notice that he forgot to pick it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case, take a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" John said, as he entered the room, and handed the kitsune his book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he sat down, John heard heard the chair of the desk next to him scrape across the floor, and heard the kitsune's voice say, \"Thanks man, I owe you. You saved my tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I owe you,\" John said, as he looked at the kitsune. \"I was wondering what to do now that I can't cook anymore. Your book gave me the idea when you bumped into me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what did happen to you?\" the kitsune asked. \"I heard that you used to go to every collage and faternaty party until a couple of months ago when something caused you to turn into something that makes the zombie students here seem like living, breathing humans. What was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A part of me died,\" John said, with a sigh. \"Someone, at Snaptail Collage, ate the woman that I was going to marry. Needless to say, it's a little hard to cook, when you know that what's going to happen to that food is the same thing that happened to the person that you loved, be eated, become digested, and get shitted out into a toliet and flushed into the septic system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, was it was that hard on you?\" the kitsune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even more,\" John said. \"I almost killed myself last night, but Steve saved my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The demon saved you,\" the kitsune said, in amazement, as Steve had something of a reputation for being unlucky, especially since he always seemed to be around when something bad happened to someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep,\" John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would he do that?\" the kitsune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's in love with one of my sisters,\" John said, with a chuckle. \"It wouldn't look very good for him if he just let me die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the kitsune was shocked to hear this. Most people wouldn't want a demon as an in-law, not even the most blood-thirsty of monsters, that loved to eat at least one human every day, wanted to see one of their children with one of them, even when the demon was a child themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen John got out of class, he found the kitsune, Billy, tagging along after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, mind if we do some studying together?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" John said, handing him a slip of paper. \"Here's my room number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, isn't this the same room that that one dark wizard has?\" Billy asked. \"The guy's got a reputation for fooling around with women you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know that,\" John said, with a smile. Almost every week he had had to deal with an angry boyfriend, whose girlfriend had been with James, or an angry ex-girlfriend that he'd dumped for another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"However,\" he said. \"I think that he has found the right woman for his tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Billy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that one female shapeshifter, Clara,\" said John, with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would she go out with him?\" Billy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember about four months ago when he put that barrier up in the girl's lockerroom?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah,\" Billy said. \"The girls couldn't leave until they stripped naked and had sex with him, and no one else, except for young women, could enter the room, not even the female teachers could enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah well, I found a way to get him to take the barrier down,\" John said. \"I asked Clara to turn herself into his mother, enter the room, and try to have sex with him. Of course, it did help that she'd had something of a crush on him. Well, when he came out of the room running, she was right behind him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the kitsune started to laugh at the idea of someone running away from someone who looked like one of their parents, one that wanted to have sex with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that's the funniest thing I've ever heard,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all of a sudden, John stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Billy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, John said, \"It's....</span></div></div>",

After all, I had a bunch of older brothers and we fought all the time, and I tended to come out on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as in most collages and high schools, the moment the two males issued their challenges, this caused every student to come to see the action, a trained martial arts user, who'd been trying to rape or eat a human woman, aginst someone who was better known for using his hands for cooking as opposed to fighting, who was trying to protect the woman, and the usual chanting of \"Fight. Fight. Fight.\" is heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf sent a kick towards John's head, but the sizeshifting werewolf raised his left arm to block it, and absorbed a blow that would of shattered the bones of a human's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible,\" the werewolf said. \"There is no way that a human's arm could of withstood my Wolf Kick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy, I never said that I was human,\" John said, as he turned into his werewolf form, and grew twenty feet tall, more than twice the height of a typical werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT!\" the werewolf said, as he ran away from the size changing werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched the werewolf run, John gave a quick \"HIMPH\" as he reverted into his prefered human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whow!\" Billy said, as he looked at John. \"How did you do that? I heard that you were a werewolf, but that you prefered your human form. But I've never heard of a werewolf who wasn't more than twelve feet tall in their wolf form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy,\" John said. \"Father was a werewolf, mother was a giant. Mix them together and you have me, a size-changing werewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" Billy said, his eyes bulging. While not unheard of, sizechangers were very rare, and were feared, even by giants who could eat every other species, as they could change from the size of a human into the size of a giant in a split second, which made them every monsters' nightmare, as that human that they had eaten could turn into a giant, and cause them to burst into pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he asked, \"Arn't you going to go after him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" John said. \"I've shown him a small bit of what I could of become. Now, he needs to try to figure out how tall that I could have become, and he will fear what he doesn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wise words John,\" said a male voice belonging to.....</span></div></div>",

After all, his hometown of Splittooth was the most dangerous place for a human to live, and he wanted to be able to protect them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter graduating at the top of his class, amazing concidering his turn around, he went back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked into town, anyone who had known him a few years earlier saw that there was something different about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he had gotten into trouble in school dozens of times for fighting with the students that tried to hunt the others, or tried to force others to have sex with them, he was always smiling, with a sort of cocky grin that said, \"Try it, I dare you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, his face said, \"Mess with me at your own risk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen one officer went to him to ask for his identification, John said, \"Here's my identification,\" and forced him to look into his eyes, which were cold and hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he said, \"If you and every other officer don't do your jobs, and protect the people that you are servents to, which is all of them, I will come after you, and send your souls to Hell. Now, get out of my way,\" and pushed the officer, a werewolf, away from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the officer realized who the man was, he shuddered, as he had fought John before, back in the tenth grade, and lost.

It was the most delicious thing that he had ever eaten, and he asked what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when he found out that it was human flesh, he became overwhelmed with so many conflicting emotions, he threw up on her wedding dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had eaten the same thing that many of his brothers and sisters were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he wanted it, badly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, every night, for a year, he had blocked his door with a shelf, and slept alone, with none of his siblings in the same room as him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was afraid of what he was, and that he would eat one of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him a long time to get over it, but the craving was still there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just before he went to collage, a friend of his almost became a main course at another cousin's wedding, until he crashed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of all of it, he hated his cousins with a passion, and would of gladly killed them all, except for the fact that, back then, he didn't like to fight, though he would to protect those that he cared for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow though, if someone wanted to mess with him, chances were that they would be sent to a hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked to where the rest of his brothers and sisters, and their children and grandchildren, were, everyone looked at him, from those who were bought by his parents first, to those who must have been bought within the last few years. \"John,\" said the eldest. (Then, the sibling says something else, but what?)</span></div></div>",

You have to resist, you need this job and that means no eating the human. But he just smells so good. The new law was passed a few months ago and you haven't eaten a human sense, quitting cold-turkey hasn't been easy, and it just became 10 times harder now that you'll have a human with you pretty much all day everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, I guess we are we're Partners now.\u201d the human distracts you from your inner turmoil. Stepping forward, a little man offers his hand and says, \u201cmy name's Dan, good to meet you, officer...\u201d his smile seems a little uneasy, you can smell his nervousness, but he IS putting forth the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing another mouth full of saliva, you bring your own hand forward and grab his whole forearm between finger and thumb, not even risking an attempt to shake it. \u201cCroner Micks. Good to meet you.\u201d your tone is a little Gruff. First Impressions have never really been your thing, in this was far from a normal situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally when you're dealing with a human and you're introducing yourself, you like to play the \u201cplayful predator\u201d. You like to tease and mess with your prey, have a little fun with them, maybe even let they might even make it out alive , before you eat them. Some might call that cruel, but that's just how things were. Humans were food, sure they could talk back and even look like giants but smaller, but they were still just food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you have to work with this little guy, treat him as an equal basically. It's hard for you to reconcile how you treated humans in the past with how you treat your fellow cops. Looking down at the little human, your first instinct is to start teasing him, act friendly and fun, and then gobble him up. But you can't do that, you have to repress that instinct now and treat him like a professional. In the end that leaves you acting stiff and reserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d the human, Dan, get your attention again, \u201cwhat's on the agenda today? I'm ready to get to work if you are.\u201d his nerves become more tense the longer you just stand there staring at him, the smell of fear only makes you crave him more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d you quickly break through your own thoughts, \u201cI was just about to go to lunch.\u201d you need something to distract you, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you turned to leave, Dan spoke up, \u201cbut it's only 10 a.m., little early for lunch isn't it?\u201d turning back, you see a look of confusion and a bit of disapproval on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, uh, skipped breakfast.\u201d he quickly excuse, though you actually had quite a big breakfast in preparation for today; lot of good that did you. \u201cI'm just gonna grab a quick snack in the break room, then we can get to work.\u201d you turn to leave again.<br>\r\n\u201cwhy don't I come with you? I should probably grab something to if you're eating now.\u201d Dan calls out. You practically stopped breathing at his next words. \u201cmind giving me a lift? It's a bit far for me and will probably take too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there with your back turned to him, debating how to handle this. Yes, you knew you'd have to hold and carry the little guy around while on the job, that just made sense. Could you actually handle this? If just standing by him left you starving for a taste of that delectable flesh, how were you supposed to carry him around without just tossing him into your salivating maw within the first 5 Seconds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do?</span></div></div>",

Tasting and gulping a human is bad, but killing him is seriously against the law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing yourself for what's to come, you turn and offer your hand for the little human. Being careful not to show your inner hunger. After thanking you, the little guy - Dan, remember his name is Dan - stepped on with only slight hesitation and sat down in the center of your palm. To distract yourself from the delicious smell and wonderful tingles of his movements on your hand, you focus on his appearance and the type of person he seems like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlonde hair and blue eyes, looks like what your sister and her friends would call Handsome. Basic body build for a young cop, though he looks like he's seen at least a couple years on the job. His uniform and haircut are the most telling of his personality, both are well-groomed and properly done, this guy seems like a straight Arrow; he's probably one of the few that actually carried the police handbook with him so that he can be sure not to break a rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yourself weren't that bad looking. Red - blond hair, green eyes... Uniform might not be wrinkle free and you might like to leave the top buttons undone to make room for your thick neck, but you're far from a slob. As for the rules... Well, you follow all the big ones like no drawing your weapon when it's not needed, no drinking on the job, no stealing from the collected contraband, and, now, no eating humans; that one's going to be hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you reach the break room, human partner still safely in hand. You quickly set him down on the counter, careful not to jostle him or give away your true desire. Looking around, you see the same old snack bags, generic fruit, and stale donuts and bagels. Going to the fridge you are presented with other people's lunches, some milk, old soda cans, and some sandwich fixings that may or may not be out of date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing back over at the human, you see him with his back turned as he checks out the new space. Your stomach growls demandingly as you watch him, so innocent and Clueless, no idea what's going through your head right now. Swallowing another mouthful of drool, you...</span></div></div>",

You met her by accident, when riding past her home of your ten speed bike, you heard a woman scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA caring person, you responded to the shrieked cry, as leaped off your bike and ran toward the house, only to see then Hazel kicking out her back door, ran a large Mastiff breed dog. She was yelling at the dog, saying something about it not trying to act like he or it was a husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat and then was when she in a rage saw you, and with her evil stare, she pointed at you with her arthritic kinked index finger, and called upon her Crystal to deal with a trespasser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can recall to this very day what happened next, as from inside the house, or the living room, through a glass pane shot forth a gold-yellow ray of light what engulfed you. Standing there as if frozen but feeling a warmth from the ray of light, the beam reached inside your mind, it searching for what it hoped was there, some situation recalled as being humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please not again, not that, why, why must you...\" you can remember your asking of some power as it dredged up a foolish time when you got caught when learning about the birds and bees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with a sudden surge of weird sensations, you remember well as all your worn clothing you had on then turned into a black ash piled at your feet. You looked with fear at Hazel staring at you, as the yellow rays of light took control and from your memory it began to cause your body to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyperventilating your breathing as the changing began, light headed feelings became brutal sensations as a curse engulfed the old you, making from what was born human to become a teenage Minotaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Minotaur clone of that friendly Black Angus breed yearling bull you were caught by the farmhand when fondling the bullish size scrotum. Your own changes began there, you feeling your balls swelling, becoming weighty, sagging, the skin furry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the changes to urinary plumbing, as a boyish penis retracted up, moving inside your groin, to weaseling upward, where formed a black furred as having long dangling hairs, you grew a bovine sheath. Your new sheath set two inches below your navel, as human skin became blacker as dense bovine hide, what sprouted black soft feeling, thick fur everywhere on your body, arms, legs, and then about the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only real pain came with the jutting surge of your soon to be bovine bullish tail sprouting as growing to be your new appendage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking of your tail and the sensations from something messaging your bare set anus, caused arousing feelings, letting you see your penis being the cock of a brute yearling Angus bull. It was then while you had human hands that in front of Hazel watching, you masturbated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the body began to change and conform you to being in part as a bovine animal, you watched in silence as Hazel came near, she smiling, and said to you, \"A Minotaur teenager, how sexy is that!\"</span></div></div>",

They have scaly fur, but they're humanoid (to the point that they could be mistaken for a furry giant.) The spiked shell around their body offers them protection in a battle. It makes their running speed slower than a horse, however. They can take the shell off (they're still protected by their fur) and they become really fast (220 at max). Ultimos are not exactly muscular, but they ARE strong enough to kill at least 20 dragons with their clawed hands. An Ultimos tail can (if they are either annoyed or pissed) make spikes grow at the end, similar to a stegosaurus. Their bat-like wings are long and wide (about 20 feet long.) They thrive for battle like a person drinks water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve however, is different. A 10-year old with a tomboy personality, she will not eat humans for any reason. The weirdest thing about her though are three things: She will eat quite literally anything (earning the title The Iron Stomach). Eve is rumored acting very similar to a human and her angel wings. She loves helping, but she will stand her ground if someone talks rudely to her.</span></div></div>",

He turned around and ducked, seeing a fireball that barely missed him. \"Why does this kind of stuff happen only to me?\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Eve was sleeping in her cave, oblivious to the threat. \"HELP!\" a young boy shouted, waking her up. Rather worried, she waited for the thing to come to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill, after a long, tiring chase, was trapped between a massive tree and the monster. The dragdra leaped at him, his death certain. Suddenly, a hand a little smaller than Will grabbed the monster and slammed it down to the ground. Yelping, the dragdra tried to run, but due to the thing's strong grip, it could not. The creature then showed itself, revealing it to be Eve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill, scared of this thing that just stopped a dragdra, curled up in a fetal position, hoping the monster would leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but are you alright?\" Eve said, worried about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Who's there?! If you can hear me, save me from this thing!\" said Will, the fear evident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only one that is talking to you is holding the dragdra!\" Eve said, a little angry, but glad the kid wasn't dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wh-Wha-What!?\" Will exclaimed, surprised at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to help you because I can.\" Eve told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks?\" the boy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye!\" Eve then said, leaving with the dragdra, who gave up some time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait! What is your name?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's Eve. As for you beast, you're coming with me!\" She then said to the dragdra. The dragdra, scared at this revelation, tried to claw her eyes out, but to no avail. \"Bye little guy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye.\" Will repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she left and seeing the coast was clear, he got up and ran to his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Eve got to her cave, the dragdra tried biting its paw off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O.K dragdra, lets see if your like me or different.\" Eve said to the dragdra before flipping it over to see if it was a boy or girl. The now known dragdraness, angry at what Eve just did, roared at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry miss dragdra, but I had to know. Please tell me why you were trying to kill the little guy.\" Eve explained and asking why she chased after him at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragdraness, amazed at what she asked tried to tell her by roaring and grunting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry miss dragdra, but I don't know what you're saying!\" Eve said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragdraness, surprised, tried to nuzzle Eve, almost as if saying 'At least you tried.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, \"Do not worry, I've got an idea!\" Eve said a plan forming in her head. \"I need you trust me, alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragdraness stood still, as if she saying 'OK.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eve recites a spell she made, \"O Mighty One, please help me with this matter. Help this creature learn the gift of knowledge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finished. a bolt shot out of her hands and struck the dragdraness. A lot of smoke covered both of their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing Eve asked, \"Miss dragdra, are you alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I am not!\" The dragdraness said. \"I-I understand you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! What did you have to-\" The dragdraness did not finish because she was in shock at what happened to her. Eve you see made her more human! She looked 20 or so, her yellow-red hair stopped at her shoulders, her body, though more mature than Eve's, still looked a teen's(19B, 40W, and 21H). Her wings, although they still looked demonic, they looked as if they slimmed down, and the three heads appeared to share the new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm-I'm hu-hum-human!?\" The now human-like dragdra said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently.\" Eve commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" The dragdra shouted before putting her hand around Eve's neck in a death grip. \"WHY DID YOU DO THIS!?!\" She yelled, the anger apparent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I thought I would kill two birds with one stone: Understanding you.\" Eve said before coughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other!?!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....To have a friend.\" Eve finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragdraness, shocked because of the answer, dropped her. \"R-Really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I mean If you lived all by yourself, wouldn't you become lonely?\" Eve explained, her sadness obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never told me you name\" Eve said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You first.\" The dragdra countered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. My name is Eve.\" Eve said introducing herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-I-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I don't have a name.\" The dragdraness sadly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! You don't have a name!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. My parents never named me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can-Can I name you?\" Eve kindly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, If you can.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Dina?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dina...I like it\" The now named Dina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda dark out. If you want-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve was interrupted by Dina's answer, \"I accept.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Dina.\" \" Good night, Eve.\" the two said to each other before sleeping on opposite sides of the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they wake up...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </span></div></div>",

That was the first day of school after Summer break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\" Patrick said, gently stroking his bro's soaked hair with the tip of a finger. \"I don't want my precious BIG brother to be all dirty on this special day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah... Patrick was now a freshman at college and for the first time was going to go to school with Mark, who was a senior, attending his last year of college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I hope there aren't going to be too many troubles at school.* Mark mused.

Humans could be a protected species, due to over hunting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The job you have gives those who don't eat sentient beings a bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The love of your life was a human that someone ate, and you feel guilty for not protecting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. One of the parents of your boy/girlfriend is a monster that will kill/eat you if a drop of your saliva lands on their baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Your parents were vegetarians and taught you to not take the lives of others just to eat them, unless it was absolutely necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. You were a selective hunter, looking for a good reason to eat someone, when something happened that changed your life and you vowed to never eat another human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Your beliefs about how all life is sacred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason, you have the urge to eat humans, but you battle it, everyday, and hope that you will never eat another human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. Character struggles with their urge, trying to not give in, which can be difficult when they are around a human, especially if they are addicted to the taste of human flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Sex is allowed, but try to keep it on a casual level, although I will try to be lenient about the other styles. *Note, all types of sexuality is allowed, gay/lesbian, straight, or bisexual*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Other monsters may eat others, but main must try not to, unless protecting someone that they care for, like a human that they are in love with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Don't kill off too many people, or, at the very least, don't try to give them names if the character is forced to kill someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Character Note* You are free to use any type of monster you want, even if it is your own creation, much like John Wolfstone is with me. Also, you are free to be a human, perhaps one who is being protected by a monster friend, or even one with magic. Of course, the monster, or magic using human, has to try to follow the rules that I set up, though if another monster tries to eat the human, the first one can eat that monster. Also, that monster may have a romantic interest for the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: This story is based off of, and takes place in, \"Human in A Monster's World\" which is by an author with the penname oddler. Thus, some of the people and places will be the same. <br>\r\nPS. since that story has a GC rating, look for \"Monster School\" which is available to the public, and click on his portfolio. After that, click on the story. <br>\r\nPPS. That story is full of vore and sexual references, just to warn those who might take offence at that sort of stuff.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, here is a list of things I've made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"position:relative;\" class=\"norm\"><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"56\" style=\"position:relative;\"><div style=\"position:relative;\"><a rel=\"awardlightbox\" title=\"...
