The room you're in seems too... nice to be a kidnapper's hideout. There was a large bed (king sized?), a walk in closet, and a bathroom off to the side. The nightdesk next to the bed has various items scattered across it, such as spiked bracelet and hair bands. Nothing in the room seems out of the ordinary to you. Suddenly, you begin to hear footsteps approaching the door! You brace yourself for the worst, expecting your kidnapper, the door opens...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it's Chun-Li?! You were in shock. Chun-Li was your kidnapper?! She's a police officer, a hero! Why would she kidnap anyone?! You stare at her in shock. Even if you didn\"t have your mouth covered, you'd still be speechless. Chun-Li, strangely enough, seems just as surprised to see you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Oh my god, what on Earth...?\" </span> She rushes over to you to unbind you, starting with the gag around your mouth. You thank her for untying you. Chun-Li, seemingly deep in thought as she unties you, doesn't answer until a moment after. <span class=\"cblue\">\"O-of course. You're not hurt are you?\"</span> Despite being suddenly kidnapped, you feel fine. <span class=\"cblue\">\"That's a relief.\"</span> She sighs to herself, muttering something about \"a gift\". As you stand up from the chair and stretch, you ask her where we are. <span class=\"cblue\">\"You're in my house, your kidnapper must know who I am. I have a pretty good feeling as to who your kidnapper is...</span> You ask her who it could have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Your kidnapper was...</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> You are Aaron, not very athletic and not very strong. You just were born weak, you got sick all the time when you were younger, being weak in body you trained your mind instead. You watched street fights all the time, and the street fighters were just amazing, you wanted to really watch one. So you used cameras to watch them all over the world from your little room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Today was different though, one a camera you saw a street fight going on so you quickly rushed your stuff, closing your laptop. You threw on a hoodie, slipped on shoes, and grabbed your home keys and id before running out the door to the fight, it was just starting and it was so close, seeing it in person is all you want right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you were running you took a shortcut in the alleyway, you almost tripped but caught yourself. Then you saw her, Ibuki running through the alleyway, and she saw you, to her you looked suspicious but you didn't realize that as you were distracted, an actual street fighter, so amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ibuki? Did you finish the fight alre-\" you were about to finish but Ibuki had already reeled back her fist. In her mind, you were stalking her as a stranger holding a laptop and dressed suspiciously calls out you by name and mentions a fight you had a second ago. She gathered Raida into her fist and was about to strike you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The energy, was different, instead of blue, it changed from blue, to green, then yellow, orange, and Red. It changed through the spectrum before she punched your gut, with your weak physique, you were out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It waa dark as you opened your eyes, nothing seen you tried standing up but then you noticed the ground you were on was moving. You fell back down and you heard a quiet gasp, it was quiet to you so you didn't realize how much higger the voice was but you would realize soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The shaking slows down a lot before smoke appears everywhere, you cough out before opening your eyes and seeing darkness still, what was that smoke? You soon feel something grab you as fingers wrap around your body and you feel yourself hoisted up until light hits your eyes hard and you're forced to close them. Eventually you open them to see a girl in a ninja outfit, long hair, a mask, and beautiful bodyline. Ibuki the ninja, and she was gigantic, no, the bathroom you were in was gigantic as well, you were just small. Wait, what are you doing in the bathroom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Calm down, Aaron, I don't know who you are but I didn't know you would shrink, can you please forgive me?\" You stop squirming and look around rationalizing everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uhm, alright, but, I was just a normal kid, I am not strong but I live watching street fights, I noticed one was in town and...I guess it doesn't matter right now, can you turn me back?\" You look around before staring at her questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah about that, I have to keep you, I have school, and I only came to the bathroom because you woke up, I don't have very long. I also don't know how to reverse the shrinking, I really did try, sorry for looking at your id. I guess I got to go now, hmm, I don't have any pockets, I suppose it will have to do, I am sorry, I have gym a little later and my breasts are off limits, they could catch you in there or spot you while I change, I suppose it was inevitable. Sorry little guy, but you have to hold on tight, I will try to be gentle with you.\" She gives a nervous smile, she had no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You gulp as your vision lowers, and lowers, and drops to just below the waistline, she opens up her ninja costume and slips you threw her underwear, into her panties and at the womanhood, a ninja being so delicate and calm about this, was she preparing for this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves around for a bit, probably changing to school clothes before she heads out to class. The first class was math, and with it came a lot of concentration. She would be completely still which bugged you, who was stuck in her panties as it was holding you ontop of her womanhood, but when you moved, so did she to get comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At one point you felt she was ready to moan so you did your best to stay still even though, but since you stayed still, you began to slip in, your legs were inside of her partially. When the bell rang, she stood up and grabbed all her belongings, holding them in front of her, the standing up jostled you in a little more, and the stuff she carried slammed you into her much deeper, you were a little more than waist deep, your arms and head were just barely out of her. You just did your best to stay still and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then heads to science class, there nothing happened except that time when someone was staring at Ibuki and embarrassed, she looked down and put her hands down in front of her to attract less attention. You felt yourself get pulled in more, part of your arms are pulled in. You then decide to grab one of her hairs, it was very short for a hair but after grabbing a few short hairs, you felt you were secure enough for the toughest of movement, I think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She finally heads to gym class and by then you were causing a little feeling for her, some reaction as she got changed for gym class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pov change<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I finished getting ready but I haven't finished getting over this feeling, he was getting deeper in and he was feeling so good. PUSH HIM IN, no, Ibuki, you are a strong girl, you can do this! Although having him all to myself, I would...I think I am blushing as my friend approached me, \"Ibuki, are you in love, I saw you blushing and,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No it is fine, I just thought of an embarassing moment earlier. Let's just have some fun,\" overall we had fun in gym class until we left school. I knew exactly where to go, I had to go home and get some privacy in my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPov change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I slowly woke up from my imprisonment, I felt myself on wood, so I was freed, but where am I, last time I checked, I got knocked out in gym due to the pressure. I look around and see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Ibuki in love with you by a bit too much, she wants you all to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. She is gone, you are alone in her room but something says she might return soon, you remember her to be a friendly person so when she returns you might talk to her unless you move somewhere<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. It is very dark in this room, you can make out the outline of her sleeping as you sit on the nightstand of her bed, getting to her is possible but dangerous.</span></div></div>",
