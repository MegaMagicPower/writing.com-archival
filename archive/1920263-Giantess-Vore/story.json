As you stood up and took in you surroundings, you noticed that you were trapped inside of a Tupperware container that sat atop a desk in the corner of what appeared to be a teenage girls bedroom.  As you take note of this the ground begins to shake and the bedroom door opens. Standing behind the door was the beautiful teen actress Millie Bobby Brown (best known for her role as 11 in the Netflix series Stranger Things. As she entered she approached the desk and once there, looked down upon you. \"Well I'm glad to see your finally awake, I wouldn't want you to miss what I have planned\". You, upon hearing this decide to address a few concerns. \"Can you please tell me, how did I get here? Let alone at this size,\" Millie just giggles in a cute girlish manner. \" well it's actually quite simple.\" \"I brought you here myself\" she replied. \"Well what about my size?\" \"Well that is quite simple as well... I shrunk you!\" This newest devolpment created more questions than it gave answers. You stood there with your jaw dropped thinking of what move to make next, but all you could bring yourself to say was\"h..how?\" With this remark Millie plucked you out of your container with her thumb and fore finger and raised you into the air. \"In the industry, you meet a lot of people, and sometimes, it just so happens that some of those people can shrink other people.\" You started questioning everything that the papratizi had ever told you about Hollywood.(then again, you can't really trust the paparazzi to begin with.) \"well then why did you shrink me? I'm just a nobody compared to you\".\"exactly!\" She replied. \"As a \"nobody\"! No one will even care that your gone!\" You then started to question her objectives even further. \"Define gone) you say with a slight hint of fear in your voice. \"Let me tell you a story\" she replied \"once there was a man who could shrink people who happened to owe me a favor, but when he refused to help me out, I used his own abilities against him...\" \"What then?\" You nervously croak. \"Then, I swallowed him whole and digested him until he was nothing more fat on my sexy thighs and supple breasts.\" You stared horrified. \"After that, I found a new favorite snack...Tines! She laughed as she saw the fear on your face intensify. \"The way they squirm, the flavor, their desperation to cling on to life, it's all so... Delicious.\"  \"Now then, how should we do this?\"</span></div></div>",

You'll make a great snack\" she says before continuing to lick you, more vigorously now. \"Please don't eat me! I don't wanna die!\"you pleaded \"you know that's what they all say, right?\" She says as she tilts her head back, parts her lips, and holds you over the moist cavern that is her mouth. \"Bye bye little one\" she coos before releasing her grip and letting you fall directly into her gaping maw. You land on her soft, massive tongue, which grabs you and begins to feel you all over. You are pushed up against the roof of her mouth and forced to swallow her saliva mouthful by mouthful. You hear a pleasurable moan arise from the deapths of her throat. As you hear this you realize that she is wrapping her tongue around your member who must have been aroused by these events. As the licking intensifies, you can't help yourself and you burst your load all over the inside of your moth. With this, she spits you out into the palm of her hand. She swallows and traces the bulge in her throat all the way down. \"That was really yummy\" she said seductivley. \"You are very cute, almost too cute to eat...\"</span></div></div>",
