One look at the reading, and she let out a loud shriek that caused a ruckus throughout the rest of the household: since the last weigh-in, she had gained approximately 15 pounds. Her stomach even looked to be a bit more plump than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi struggled to understand why she now weighed 130 pounds instead of her usual 115 pounds. It could have been all those bedtime snacks she had been wolfing down for the past week, but then again, all of those snacks were low in fat and calories. Maybe it was the second helpings of dinner she had asked for. Maybe not, since she had made it a point to jog it all of when she was done. But she knew, for whatever reason, that she was starting to gain weight, and she had to do something. She thought it all over later in bed, and she narrowed down all of the possibilities to four choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first option was to go to a weight-loss program to take the excess fat off and keep it off. Of course, she'd have to do a little research to find out which fit her lifestyle. Option 2 had her eating and exercising a bit healthier, which, while not as professional as the program, would ensure that she lost those 15 pounds. She's have to keep a sharp eye out for all of those new-fangled organic foods too, which, from what she had heard, tasted gross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer third option was to go with the flow and hope for the best. Hey, sometimes it's best not to rush things. Maybe over time, she'll lose that weight abd get back to normal. Option 4 had her talking with her long-time boyfriend, Mamoru Chiba. If she wasn't sure about which path to take, Mamoru might be able to help give her a push in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================================================<br>\r\nOPTION 1: Usagi joins a program called \"Weight Managers\", but to her shock, she realizes that the program helps people GAIN weight instead of losing it! Too late to back out, Usagi starts gaining weight like never before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOPTION 2: Usagi makes an emergency trip to the grocery store, but is suprised when she finds that most of the healthy food is sold out, even the organic foods! She is forced to buy the foods that are high in fat and calories, resolving to exercise more to make up for it, but the gain manages to keep up with her new routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOPTION 3: For the next week, Usagi continues with her normal lifestyle, but the next time she steps on the scale, she's shocked to learn that she now weighs 150 pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOPTION 4: Usagi talks with Mamoru the next day, who tells her that Usagi is Usagi, no matter what she looks like or how much she weighs. This calms Usagi, and when she steps on the scale next, she's actually thilled to learn that she now weighs 145 pounds!</span></div></div>",

Therefore, I have added time lapses to the options. Thanks for the majority of the work, Vfan!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi, not wanting to be a total pig decided to join a club, or something that could help her lose the excess flub. She looked in the phone book but there was nothing. She took a walk around town, tempted by candy stores and bakeries. She fought the strong urge to eat the food as she wandered looking for some place to help her weight issues. After about 30 minutes she sat down, sighing. \"At this rate I'll never lose any weight! I'll become a pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a flier blew into her face, she removed it and read it 'Having weight problems? Sign up for our Grand Opening Sale! Half Off for a monthly membership!' Serena got up and went to the location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome!\" The woman at the front said welcoming the blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to join, you had a special deal?\" Usagi asked holding up the flier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes. Just take this.\" The woman handed Usagi a clipboard and a pen. As the young woman wrote down her information she watched heavy build women walk by, thinking they were looking to lose weight too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing she handed the woman the papers and she asked Usagi to sit down while they prepared a room for her, after a good 10 minutes the woman asked Usagi to follow her. After that Usagi was sat down in a room with a table. \"Your food will be here in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi tapped the table with her fingers when suddenly waiters came in with with a large chocolate cake, sundaes, and pies the young woman blinked in shock. \"Please enjoy your meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi blinked again. \"Maybe it's some kind of food that looks and tastes like sweets but really is diet food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug into the cake, chewing she stopped and began to scarf it down like crazy. \"THIS IS AMAZING! I'VE NEVER HAD FOOD LIKE THIS BEFORE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate and ate, the cake was soon gone and she moved onto the ice cream pouring it down and using a spoon to send it down faster, then taking the remains and putting it on the pie she almost inhaled the food . Licking her chocolate and ice cream covered lips Usagi patted a rounder stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, Usagi stayed in this program for quite some time, so far oblivious to her enlarging figure, until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOPTION 1: After a week, Usagi sees she's gaining, not losing, yet she still hungers, addicted as she is to the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOPTION 2: After half a month, she's 100 pounds heavier and still hungers for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOPTION 3: After a month (and 200 pounds), she realizes she prefers being fat. Bring on the junk food!</span></div></div>",

That program your joined is on the phone for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom!\" Usagi said as Her mother went back to work, as she did Serena picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Hey. Yep, just got the shipment yesterday...good as always...\" The sounds of eating a light joyful moaning came from the room, the door was partway open which allowed for Usagi's cat to push it open, the cat sat down gazing at Usagi, her bed was now being pushed down by a wide and round fat ass, her stomach was protruding out resting on her huge thighs and knees and being a bed for breasts bigger then a girl of her age would have, she was chewing on a candy bar listening and nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REALLY!? That sounds great I'll be right over!\" Serena had put on much weight in the last month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Month ago.<br>\r\n\"Um excuse me...\" Serena was speaking with the woman at the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ms Tsukino?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This program is for gaining weight and not losing weight is it?\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it isn't. Oh don't tell me our posters didn't say that did it, I'm so sorry, we'll cancel your membership if you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, no...when I was eating I was thinking maybe putting on some weight wasn't so bad if the food was worth it.\" Usagi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we're sorry for the confusion, here take this, that's the room and time we'll service you, please stop by that time whenever you want.\" The receptionist said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Present<br>\r\n\"I went everyday, I was almost addicted to their food. I've put behind my skinny life behind me! Not with such delicious food to be wasted!\" Usagi said putting her new clothes that she bought using the program's special card for buying food and clothes outside the place, she struggled to put them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'll need to head out for a shopping trip tomorrow.\" She said before leaving the room and waddling down the stairs, each foot step making loud thuds and creaking the weakened stairs from her trips up and down them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading out.\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be safe dear.\" Her mother responded. Usagi headed over, panting all the while and eating candy bars in her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, it's getting harder and harder to make it there.\" Usagi said leaning against a stone wall panting before heading into the building she was greeted by the usual recptionist who had also put on weight like Usagi, eating from an extra large box of doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afternoon Usagi.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, so were you guys serious?\" She asked leaning over the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head on in and see for yourself.\" The receptionist said as Usagi walked into a room ready to do a photo shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Usagi welcome!\" A woman with long red hair, dressed in a purple business attire and heavier then Usagi waddled over and wrapped her long arm around the young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been waiting for you, this is your big day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really going to be in a photo shoot? Why?\" Usagi asked a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi, we've been monitoring your gain, and looked at the weekly pictures we've asked for and I've got to say you're the best choice to be our post child and launch this weight gain program into regional territory, maybe even national.\" The woman said as Usagi's eyes brimmed with hope and joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, not come on. This couch is waiting for you, so's these delicious cakes.\" The woman said having various cakes on a tray next to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi only drooled as she slipped into a bathing suit perfect for her size and ate the cakes while photos of her were being taken, she felt like a model, and did her best to contain her joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shoot Serena sat up on the couch finishing the rest of the cakes as the woman walked over and handed her the paycheck, she blinked and took it, opening it up she gasped. \"Take it, with your body as the poster child for our program we'll easily make double that back, and we'll be sure to send you the share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ma'am.\" She bowed and went to go spend that large paycheck on food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next week, the day of Usagi's premiere in the magazine the program put out...  </span></div></div>",

She quickly put on a White shirt, a pale blue skirt and White sandals.

By the time Usagi got there, every thing that even vaguely resembled healthy food had been old.  Not even a single solitary carrot remained.  So she was forced to buy the food that had plenty of fat and calories, deciding to simply exercise more to make up for it.
