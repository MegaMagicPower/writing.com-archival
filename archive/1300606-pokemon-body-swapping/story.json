Ash had Misty's memories, and learned that she had feelings for him. He could also imitate her perfectly. The two Ashes gained knowledge about being in both bodies, and then completely blacked out.

I'm totally fine~ heh heh~\" Ash smiled and did a 360 degree sway with Dawn's body, the motion cause his cute pink skirt to flutter a bit in air, revealing his pantie slightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sorry? I want to thank you, giving me a chance to become such a cutie girl, even if it's just for a short time... as soon as Dawn wakes up in my body, she'll want to change back no matter what... who wouldn't, being a girl this pretty, every one loves her...)

Dawn... and I get nothing... this sux, I'm sure if I was in my own body when he was talking to me, he would never have made that offer...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(oh well, at least it was fun being Dawn and messing around with her stuff for a day and took advantages of her body while i can, normally i wouldn't dare touch her...

Clad in Dawn's contest dress, he curtsied to the audience. He took the ribbon and waved to the adulating crowd as he exited the stage, followed closely by Alakazam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't have won that one if it weren't for you, Kazza. You're paying off in all kinds of ways!\" Ash exclaimed once they found a more quiet hallway to finally relax in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'You seem to be enjoying yourself quite a bit,'</i> Alakazam replied. <i>'That body seems to suit you, don't you think?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gave a nervous smile as he undid Dawn's pontail, letting her hair fall past her shoulders. \"Well, the contests definitely do. I never realized it was so fun having an audience! The gym's are challenging, but I sort of feel like I don't get much recognition out of them, y'know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh quieted suddenly as he heard the door creak open, bolting to attention as Brock entered the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dawn! Just wanted to congratulate you! You did excellent out there,\" he exclaimed as he patted a hand on 'Dawn's' shoulder. \"Were you talking to someone in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I was just on the phone,\" Ash lied. \"And thanks! I really appreciate it. I think that accident a few weeks back has really given me some new energy, you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I get what you mean,\" Brock replied, his tone suddenly becoming a bit more serious. \"Listen, Dawn, I wanted to tell you something about Ash.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ash replied, suddenly feeling a little bit worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's been acting just a bit... off, since the accident. He's been repeating a lot of the same phrases, acting really single-minded, and even seems to have forgotten a lot of stuff. I was reminiscing with him about a gym battle back in Hoenn the other night and he couldn't even remember the Gym leader's name. Barely remembered what happened! It's kind of worrying.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh glanced at Alakazam for a second, who had his eyes closed in thought. \"Uh, wow Brock. That does sound worrying. Maybe the attack had more of an impact than we thought at first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock nodded in reply. \"I think so, which is why I decided to call his mother and Professor Oak. They agreed that I should take him back home to Kanto for a bit to recover. It's just not good for him to travel this way. I haven't told him yet; I wanted your help for that. What do you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was nervous now. He didn't think that Dawn's behavior was going to be a problem, but it seemed Brock was more observant than he gave him credit for. <i>'I guess I'm glad he cares.'</i> \"Uh, I guess you're right Brock. Let's wait until tomorrow though, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock nodded, \"thanks for backing me up, Dawn. I'm going to go keep an eye on him until then, we'll be back at the center, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock departed, leaving Ash alone with Alakazam. \"What do we now?\" Ash asked, worried that the high from his joyride was about to come crashing into an end. \"Do I really have to go back to normal?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Hmm, no, if you truly want to stay then there is one thing I can do.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ash asked, hopeful once more. He wanted to keep doing what he was doing; being new people and trying new things. He realized through being Dawn that he was just getting bored with the routine of his old life. He didn't want to go back to it yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Dawn can't imitate you properly because her consciousness isn't using all of your brain. She's just imitating you using her own memories. I could use my power upon her while she sleeps and align her consciousness with your mind more thoroughly. She'd gain all of your memories and personality; no one would know the difference.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like that? No drawbacks?\" Ash asked, for some reasoning doubting it'd be that easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlakazam shook his head. <i>'It would be a very... invasive process. If I do it, there's no guarantee I can undo it. Not to mention, you agreed she should go to your hometown regardless. If I do it, you won't necessarily be stuck as Dawn, but you likely won't be able to be Ash anymore' </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was silent at this. Could he really do that? If he said yes, he'd basically be throwing away his own identity for good. He'd just be drifting from body to body. It was as frightening as it was exciting. He'd really be on an adventure that would never end. However, what would that mean for Dawn? In a way, it'd sort of be like killing her; basically a death of identity. He loved using her body, but he sort of went into this thinking he'd give it back to her at some point, if only because he wanted a different one. He could just have Alakazam switch the two of them back and hypnotize Dawn into a trade; that way he'd be able to take Alakazam back with him to Kanto and Dawn would get her life back. What did he do? </span></div></div>",

Ash had Alakazam switch them back, and used hypnosis to make her think that she had been in her own body for the past two weeks. He also included a little order to Dawn about giving him Alakazam as a keepsake. \"It's been great traveling with you. Don't worry, I think we'll see each other again soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded. \"I think so too Dawn.

His mother was glad to see him home safe. Ash, for his part, was exhausted. \"It's good to be back, but I think I need to take a nap, mom.

Ash went up the stairs, leaving Brock and his mother behind to chat among themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh meant what he said, he was exhausted. He kicked off his shoes, put his hat aside and pokeballs aside, and immediately crashed onto the bed, ready to get some sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could guess it was early morning as he groggily saw the time on the alarm clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time to wake up, Pikachu,\" he mumbled. After a second of no response, he realized something was wrong. \"Pikachu?\" He asked, before gasping at the high pitch of his voice. He must have switched again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing off the sheets, Ash threw his feet to the ground, suddenly finding his legs much longer. Unsteadily, he walked over to the mirror, confirming his suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm mom?\" He asked, seeing Delila's reflection in the mirror: \"Why did he switch me?\" He asked no one in particular as he took stock of the situation. He had practice as a girl from his time as Dawn, but this was different. Dawn was a girl, but Delilah was a woman. Everything seemed a bit smaller around Ash now; his hips were much wider, his chest was much larger, and his legs were longer. Not to mention, he was only dressed in a short pink nightgown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he needed to get to the bottom of things, Ash quickly threw on his mothers bathrobe and ran out into the hallway and into his own bedroom. As he suspected, his own body was still sleeping. He wasn't sure if it was real sleep or hypnosis sleep though. As he looked through his poke alls, careful not to wake his old body or Pilachu, he found...</span></div></div>",

Quietly, he lifted the pokeball from the nightstand and returned to his mother's bedroom across the hall. It was a bit larger, and he didn't have to worry about waking his real body up. Clinking the button, he released Alakazam into the room, who didn't seem particularly surprised by Ash's new form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, you're awake I see,' it said to him nonchalantly through its telepathy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kazza, don't dance around the point,\" Ash replied with his mother's voice. \"Why did you do this? ...how did you do this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I think you should have realized by now I'm more powerful than most other Alakazams. A pokeball isn't enough to confine me.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't ask you to switch me with anyone!\" Ash exclaimed arms wide as he gestured down to his new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I took it into my own hands; after reading your mind I saw you were bothered at having to return. I figured you would like this new body, it has what Dawn had but more. With an adult's body, you can gain the attention and recognition that your own body lacked, correct? You also have a level of authority that Dawn and you never had. No one would tell you where to go or what to do. Not to mention she has beauty <i>and</i> maturity.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh turned his head towards the mirror as Alakazam spoke, considering the words as he ran his hands through his new, long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'It won't be hard. Just hypnotize Oak and Brock, maybe some others. After that, you can claim your pokemon from your old body and go back out into the world.This time though, you will have all your experience from the start. And no one will dismiss you as a child. It sounds alluring, doesn't it?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a suggestion Ash wouldn't have really considered before, but he was merit to it. He could start his career anew like this and really be taken seriously. He wouldn't need to relearn anything, he already had plenty of experience and strong pokemon. His old body could stay behind in Palette Town with Professor Oak while he traveled the world, winning fame as the beautiful and motherly trainer from Kanto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I'll leave you to think about it,'</i> Alakazam interrupted. <i>'Your mother will be under a spell just like Dawn was when she wakes. There's no need to worry about her for now. I feel like you will come to see it my way, however,'</i> he mentioned, before going back into his pokeball and leaving Ash to his own decisions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh awkwardly stood in the center of the room for a while after that, unsure of what to do next. Eventually though, his attention turned back to his new body in the mirror. Slowly, he let the bathrobe fall, revealing once again the night gown his mother had been wearing to bed. He slowly moved his hands to his chest, shocked by the sensation. They were much more sensitive than Dawn's. In comparison, Dawn's body may as well have been his own! He moved his hands further down, body tingling as he felt out the curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smiled, \"well, how about we give it a try at least. Can't hurt, right mom?\" </span></div></div>",

He had left Alakazam in his mother's bedroom with some clothes he laid out, so that he could have easy access to him. <i>'Don't want to be locked in before I make a decision,'</i> he reasoned. After a long while, he finished up his fun and stepped out of the shower, drying off and wrapping a towel around his torso. He figured he'd put off further exploration... for now. No need to jump in the deep end all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, come on... there we go!\" Ash exclaimed as he finally managed to clasp a white bra behind his back. It was definitely more of an ordeal to accomplish now that his current body was considerably more well-endowed than Dawn's. It didn't seem like a bad deal to him so far; he liked the sensations that Delia's body was sending him. Not to mention, he got quite a confidence boost from being so much taller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash examined himself over, wearing only undergarments in Delia's body.He flipped her hair, still hanging loose, and struck a pose. \"Look out world, here I come,\" he said confidently, trying to get a feel for his current voice. It didn't quite sound as confident as he would have liked, which he put down as a 'con'. He could work on it though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through Delia's closet, Ash decided to not do anything crazy for today. He saw outfits he liked, but didn't want anyone to think anything was off, so he opted to wear his mother's usual clothes, pink shirt and blue skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never thought I'd find myself wearing this...\" he muttered as he pulled her skirt up. Something about it felt relieving though. After his vacation in Dawn's body, he didn't really care to stay in his own. He would have never thought of using Delia's, so he felt some gratitude towards Alakazam for making the choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alright! Now time to go give this body a trial run,' he decided. He could go wander Pallet Town for a bit; he knew that Brock and Professor Oak were over at the lab and he could go have a practice round interacting with them as Delia. Otherwise, he could take a little trip over to Viridian city, where there was a bit more to do. The latter option would hold some surprises, and since there'd be fewer people to recognize his body, he could work on a new persona. Not to mention, he still had Alakazam at the ready if he wanted a new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did he go? </span></div></div>",

He started patting it and asking how it was feeling, then gave him some of  his special recipe pokemon food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lunatone had some, it begin to move in joy all of a sudden, it seems like Brock's special  home made taste really put some energy back to Lunatone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you young man\" appeared a voice in Brock's mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? is that you Lunatone, are you talking to me in my mind?\" Brock asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is I, I have been laying here for quite some times now, and they can't seem to find what's wrong with me as I always feels really tired, but after havong some of those food you gave me, for reason unknown, I regain and recover to full health. To thank you, I will grant you one wish, any with you like, as I have great powers gained upon many thousand years of survival with in the wonders of the nature world... Ask and be given what you desires... young one\" Lunatone says within Brock's mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(really? hmm... I don't want to doubt him as he said he is all powerful, so I guess I'll just ask for one, and see if it really works.... let see, something I always wanted but can't have...... Nurse Joy!! and Officer Jenny, and all those beautiful girls~~~~~) Brock thoughts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Lunatone, please grant me the power to posses the body of other females, allowing me to become them\" Brock wishers as he is in the same room as Nurse Joy and don't want her to hear him saying something like this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is done...\" upon saying that, Lunatone vanishes into thin air<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(hmm.... I don't feel any different...) Brock thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there~ may I be at service mister? hey where did the Lunatone go, the one that was laying here?\" Nurse Joy comes over and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ah.. oh~ the ah.... it's trainer come n took it away saying he'll try other helps from other places~ ah ha ha~\" Brock said with a slight panic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh.. that's too bad, I hope it was for the best, now are you here to have your pokemon restore to health, or do you require special help with something?\" Nurse Joy asked with a sweet angel like smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(hmm... the doors closed, and people don't normally come in here unless to see their pokemon.. and there's only one other pokemon here resting other the Lunatone that is now gone, chances of any one coming in here is thin, Ash ans the guys won't be back for a while... why don't I try out if I really have the power to posses girl bodys...) Brock thinks while smiling at Nurse Joy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"why yes, I do have this question I've been wanting to ask, Nurse Joy, how does it feel to be Nurse Joy? I mean? to be in your shoe and all~ helping the pokemon every single day\" Brock asked with a rather odd looking smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Joy giggles and said with a smile \"why I feel very fortunate to be able to help pokemon every day and become friends with them~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's sweet\" said Brock while thinking (now, tie to put that new power to use... to see if it really does work or not)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nupon saying that, Brock cleared his mind and focused on looking at Nurse Joy, while thinking... (I want to become Nurse Joy.. the one standing right in front of me)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nall of a sudden, Brock blanked out and regain his vision within less then a second, but who he sees in front of him is not Nurse Joy, it's him self<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what the..... hah!!! did it?\" Brock looked down right away as soon as he realized he was speaking in Nurse Joy's voice and saw him self now controlling a female body named Nurse Joy, wearing the dress she always wears<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(oh my gos it worked, I really have the power to become other girls now!! but wait... what happen to Nurse Joy then, is she in my body now as I'm in her body? )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock looked at his body, and realized it's just standing there now as a doll, a manikin, body with out a soul, however he did found out that he can control the movement of his own body, even have it pull a facial or speak the words he wants it to. And to his surprise, Nurse Joy seems to have acquired a slightly bigger breast, is this one of his powers too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did a few more test runs to see what els he can do, he found out that he can some how access Nurse Joy's brain, recall her memories and thoughts, thus enabling him to act out a perfect Nurse Joy with all her medical skills if he wanted, all the personal memories she had of her life, which means he can take over Nurse Joy's body and live the rest of his life as her if he desires to, and after a few more trails, he found out that's pretty much it. Now he wants to see if he can change back to his own body, because if he can't, then there might be a problem, and it'll also be less fun if he can only be Nurse Joy for the rest of his life, but before doing the switch back test, he wonders how he can explain to Nurse Joy if she asks questions about what just happened, will she remember the body switch? and the bigger breast she now has....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nupon wondering about how to answer those questions he switches back to his body and hoped for the best...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hm? oh my? did I just blanked out for a sec there? I'm sorry, I must have been working too hard today\" Nurse Joy said with blushing a bit, with a slightly embarrassed smile on her sweet goddess like pretty face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nit seems like the girl Brock possessed has no memories during the time while Brock was in her body, and her breast also return to it's normal size after Brock leaves her body<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Joy smiled, placing her finger on her cute lips while looking up and said.. \"now where were we~? ah that's right, as Nurse Joy I am....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(good...) without out another thought after that, Brock jumps right back into Nurse Joy's body and finishes her sentence for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.... always feeling very slutty~ all those pokemon I wanted to hump, all those mens I wish to have sex with, oh~ I'm so naughty in this pretty pick dress of mine, I just want to have some one humping me from behind~\" Brock says in Nurse Joy's sweet sweets voice, with Nurse Joy's innocent angel smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nupon saying that as Nurse Joy, Brock wonders what Nurse Joy thought about him few moments ago, so he went into her mind and check, and found out that she thought he was a little pervert, asking odds questions like that while looking at her with a rather disgusting smile... Brook felt a but pissed out there for scanned her mind to see if there's anything dirty he can dig up and spread around to get her back for it... he don't believe it, she's a perfect girl with nothing embarrassing or dirty to be revealed... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Well all that's going to change from this point on wards as now I'm in control of your spotless life... ) Brock thinks as he wonders how he should play with this body and mess up her life at the same time.. then he got an idea and begin acting it out..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brocky~ I'm so sorry to think of you as a pervert, the truth is~ I'm the biggest pervert and slut~ oh, won't you suck your dig to make it up for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nas Brock kneel down facing his original body's pants, he had his original body take off it's pants and got out his cell phone, while Brock handed over Nurse Joy's personal cell phone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe started sucking his own dig as Nurse Joy, using her cute little mouth, shoving the dig right down his throat, sucking as hard as he can with Nurse Joy's mouth while having his body take photos of it. When his body come, he let it shoot all over his face, the face of Nurse Joy which he now occupies and smiled as slutty as as can<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthen he takes off the dress he's wearing, walked over the on sick machop, with his original body, and started raping machop, sucking it's dig and kissing it, with machop laying there too sick to do a thing, he climb onto it and engulf it's dig with Nurse Joy's vagina, while his original body was video recording all of this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh~~~ fuck me~~ yeah~~~~~ I'm so slutty~~ I only get turn on by pokemon, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha~~~~\" Brock burst out laughing using Nurse Joy's voice, the of it turns him more even more, and the dig inside him is way to big for Nurse Joy's small vagina, it was making Brock feeling dizzy as well, when machop come Brock was filled with a sensation he never felt before<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh~~~~ ah~...ah...... so this is what it's like to get fucke by a pokemon.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmachop's semen was all over the floor as it was way too much to fit all inside Nurse Joy, Brock then started licking the floor and drinking the remainder semen on the floor, all of course video recorded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock then quickly get dressed into Nurse Joy's cloth, got his original body to follow him into the male's toilet without any one seeing, then he got his original body to tie him up on the toilet seat, gag him, blind fold him, and wrote 'Please fuck me over and over, I'm a slutty nurse, tell your friends to come fuck me too~ Love Slutty Joy~' with Nurse Joy's lip stick on his stomach. then he switched back into his old body, found a computer, and with the knowledge he's got from Nurse Joy's mind, he uploaded the photos and videos form Nurse Joy's cell phone to her personal blog, and changed her password, while mass e-mailing it to all her friends using her e-mail before he went back into the toilet, found Nurse Joy's struggling while setting her cell phone on vibrate dial to her own number and shoving it deep into her ass, smiling with joy as he see Nurse Joy shivering her body due to the vibration while crying as she urinates all over her dress...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock then leaves the pokemon center to join Ash and the guys while they were about to go get him to leave for the next town, after a quick catch up, they headed off for the next town<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNurse Joy, tied up in men's toilet, was raped by several pokemon trainers and left to vagina to drool with semen, she was eventually found when the cleaning staff come in  to clean the toilet, arrested by Officer Jenny for abusing her role by having sex with a pokemon and the distribution of her nudes on the web,they can't explain how or why is she tied up in the toilet, buy Officer Jenny and other staff just assumed as she sexually offended a pokemon first, it's pretty obvious that she got a random trainer to tie her up and fuck her while getting him to spread the message to some and enjoy her, Nurse Joy was putted away in jail sobbing, not knowing a single thing Brock did as her, only the violent rapes he has after Brock leaves her body...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a quite thought, Brock decided he should take over May's body and use it as his own, as he thinks why rush the fun by doing long distance possessions if there's a perfectly cute attractive girl's life here for him to take over with. Plus, as he travel as her, not only can he keep an eye on his original body while it carry on with auto pilot, not because he needs to, but just so he could use it for some extra fun, as it is part of his power to have his original body do what he usually does without him actually telling it what to act, so it'll carry on naturally, but the most important thing is, if he travel as May, he's sure to run into other pretty girls especially in places like woman's toilet or locker room that's in every town, not to mention it's just way more interesting to be a girl you've been with for a while, pretending to be her while your close friends all think your her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, he thought that the girls he meet and known won't go any way, like Misty, he can posses her any time, so why rush, when the more interesting stuff are right here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of chat with his friends, they soon begin packing their stuff so they can head off towards the next town<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brock~ can you help me put this away~\" May said at the very beginning of the packing with a cute smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(god... this shit again, well not this time bitch, I've had it with you...) Brock thoughts while turning around and say... \"sure May~ I'd love to~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand before May can replied, Brock jumps into her body, claiming it as his own, then reply him self with May's joyful voice while giving him self a sweet smile saying~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Brock~ you're always so nice to me~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the remainder of the time while his original body is doing all the packing up, Ash doing easy clean ups and Max mocking around with the pokemons, he thought he might try and have some fun to pass time. He headed for an spot behind large bushes slightly off the camp site not far away, and while he was there he felt the nature call from May's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH~ I better to let some urine out fast, don't want to piss all over my pretty body, not just yet anyway~\" Brock giggles while feeling indulged hearing him self giggling as May<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted up his white skirt and pulled down his body tight shorts and under wear, then begin to piss, while feeling a sensation from the flow of the urine coming out his front...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ah... can't believe it feels so good pissing as May, felt different from other girls....\" Brock whispers slightly while realizing something <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(hmm... I'm May now, and I'm going to continue living as her, pretending to be her, until some day I got sick of it...... and more likely, until the next time I want to posses some other girls... which means if I'm living as May all this time, and all of a sudden I left her body for some other girl, she's going to have a period of massive gap in her memories as during those black memory gap, I'm May... which won't be good for me as she will ask questions, and ask us... as we're traveling with her, damn... didn't thought about that, not being able to just left her and go like others girl could make thing difficult as Ash could also spot if somethings wrong...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock dress up while being mind boggled by this issue, as he doesn't have the power to mind control girls, or create fake memories for girls he had possessed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbeing stressed about this issue had taken up all the time he has, resulting him not being able to mess with May's body as the guys has finish packing and are ready to go, having difficulty coming up with a way to deal with it, Brock decided to ignore it for now, and stay in May's body before he had a good solution<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dawn, they reached a small hostel, where they can stay indoor and sleep in bed for once. Still boggled with the issue to control the situation if he left May's body Ash says...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May~ do you want a room to your self? you are a girl and all, it'll give you more privacy for a change\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.. yes!! that'll be very nice~ thanks guys~\" Brock smiled and said joyfully with May's body as what Ash said gave him an idea to proceed with<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night in his room alone, Brock got out May's portable video recorder, as he remember May's mom gave her one for the trip, and turned the video recording on pointed at him, as he begin to take his cloth off... he waves May's sexy body around a bit while feeling the tender skin he now have, the attractive curves he now wields, robbing and crabbing his breast and butts hard and tight, drooling over the body he's in right now while sucking May's doll like fingers, before he finally changed into one of May's many cute yet lingeries, then dances around in a sluttish pose and movement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(now.. for some real bushiness...) Brock thought while standing in front of the video recorder as May...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello May~ look~ don't you look sexy tonight? oh god, these breast feels so nice I can just rob them all day long~\" Brock said pulling sexually appealing poses then started robbing his breast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be wondering what's going on as you see your self feeling up your own body in front of the camera, but just listen to what he says, the guy standing right be side you, otherwise~ the following footage could get globally published~ heh heh heh~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nupon saying that, Brock started masturbating as hard as he can, every movement turns him on, as he feels so sexually aroused being May while wearing her lingerie, after a while of constantly violating his vagina and ass hole, Brock come all over the floor, while he sat there half exhausted he smile at the camera and said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you liked that? if you do, please call me and I'll let you fuck me~ My name is May and I'm a slutty pokemon trainer, this is my personal contacts....\" Brock told May's cell phone numbers and e-mails towards the camera with a slutty smile while finishing it off with a wink before truing it off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(now for phase 2.... hmm it seems like the guys are well asleep, good) Brock made mental contacted with his original body and make sure the guys are asleep before getting his original body to come into May's room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe got his original body lock the door, and tie him up in a chair with his legs wide open, and gag him with a special ring gag that keeps his mouth open but unable to speak, after he was securely tied up and gag, Brock left May's body and return to his original body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hm.....hmm!? hhhmmmmmmm~~~!! hmhm!!\" May started struggling when she regain her self and realized she was all tied up and gag, soon, she begin crying, as tears runs down her cute girly face, some what more attractive when she was gaged...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock licked the tears off her face n slapped her, telling her to shut up or he'll make her with greater pain. May quite down and started sobbing with fear, looking at Brock hoping he won't do anything to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock placed May's portable video recorder in front of her, turned it on to show her what he previously recorded while whispering in her ear to watch carefully....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the footage was finished, May was filled with horror and shock, she try to yell but slapped down by Brock again, before she could try again, Brock stuck his big fat dick inside her tiny mouth through that ring gag, forcing it down her throat, gaging her  for air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm!! hm~!!! hm!! hm~!!\" May let out with shivers as she was being fucked hard in the mouth while Brock grabs her head and banging her face, in and out her throat, struggling for air every time the dick was down her throat, then coming in her throat and mouth with large amounts of semen that pours out her ring gag and started drooling<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look bitch, you better listen to me carefully, the video you just saw~ it was none other then your self, but with a little twist... you see I was inside you body, pretending to be you, wearing your lingerie, masturbating as you, it felt really good, n guess what? I have powers to possess any girls I want, and while I'm in side them I can recall all her thoughts and memories, making it extremely easy to acquire their personal and private information, like said in the video, I could release those footage all over the net, and your life will be ruined~\" Brock said with an evil smile, and May listen with fear, and tried to kept quite as she realize what Brock can do... Brock continues...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"now as you may have realized, you have a major memory gap, the last thing you remember was telling me to clean up your shit, then you're here all tied up, that's because during the time I'm in your body, you will be seal away form anything I've done while I was in your body, you won't have any memory of what I did as you, now that's where you come in bitch, as of today, I'm going to continue living as you, until I feel like having some quick fun in some other girl's body, your job is to pretend every thing is fine, and work for me while I'm not in your body, serving me when ever I order you got it? or els... you know what I can do, will do as you.... with that footage and even more... understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock threatens with a rather joyful smile, while May can only nod sobbing quietly knowing her body and life now belongs to Brock, for him to enjoy as and use as, to serve him when he commands, now she only hopes for when ever the little freedom of time she gets can be longer each time when Brock goes for some other girl's body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"good~ girl, I'm going to give you some treat~\" Brock pats May on the head softy, combing her hair, then started fucking her mouth again violently while May let out small struggling sounds as she don't want to anger Brock, after he come again in her mouth, he also urinate in May's mouth, having her drinking it before giving her a soft kiss of the fore head, ad untie her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"now... time for me to go to bed, as you of course~ aren't you gonna invite me into your body bitch?\" Brock smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nstill sobbing and in fear, May said knowing there's nothing she can do but to follow his command.. \"ye... yes master, May's body is all yours to enjoy, please use it in any way you please.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock, smiling, knowing May seems to learn her role quite well, jumped back into Mays body, wiping off his tears, kneel down and started licking and cleaning his original body's dick before sending it off to bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ah~ problem solved~ what a day.... my mouth feels kinda funny, must be from all that fucking I did, gatta be more careful actually, don't wanna hurt my beautiful new body, heh heh~\" Brock sucks his finger while feeling his breast with joy, slowly falling asleep as May, wearing her lingerie, wondering what he should do as her tomorrow, knowing he's got 'her' whole life to enjoy it with...</span></div></div>",

One moment, she was looking at skintight suits at the Celadon dept. store, next, as Brock posessed her, he moved to the shoe section, and picked out a couple, trying high heels on in the dressing room, and using her psychic powers to make other women's clothes fall off. He laughed inwardly, but not out loud, as the women would label him a les, and he wanted to have some more fun in that body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           As he left the shop, he tossed his long brown hair back over her jumpsuit. The ticklish feeling gave him and idea - and no one was looking. He unzipped the top part of her suit, exposing Sabrina's bra, which had burst open. Somehow, he thought, his breasts had become bigger as he had posessed her. he realized though that the jumpsuit held her breasts at a certain size. now, he felt a certain pressure lift off his chest, replaced by a growing sense of extra weight. He leaned down, and crazily, began sucking his/her own boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Just then, cops came, and told him she was under arrest for stripping in public. Brock, scared, teleported to outside the Celadon gym, where Erika battled. Luckily, no one was fighting Erika, so Brock ran in and took over her. Sabrina collapsed, unconscious, and Brock held Sabrina hostage, for the cops when they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           When they had left, Brock checked out his new body, combing Erika's hair and massaging her breasts and ass. Skinny though she was, she weighed a lot because of her breast and ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Brock got tired, as pruning Erika for over and hour with nothing else to do sucked.

Broke communicates with Sabrina through the mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(hmm... since this is the first time I am actually in a body while the mind of the host isn't sealed up some where, I should use this chance to experiment... now I wonder if I can do anything to you, such as, have your soul totally destroyed so when I leave you'll just be a body with out a mind, or..... absorb you into me, make you, part of me, and acquire every thing you have, meaning I still keep all your memories and any thing els I need that you might have, such as your handy teleportation, and that mind control power you used on us a while back.... yes.. it will come in very handy)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbefore Sabrina can make any attempt, or take any action, her soul was being taken in by Broke, she felt her self becoming one with Broke, felt Broke tearing away her conscious, while she slowly loses every thing, her power, her memories, her mind, she hear Broke cried out in joy while slowly passing out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(HAA HA HA HA HAAA HAAAAAHAHAHAHA~~~~ I'm becoming you Sabrina, not just body, but in terms of mind, memories and power~~~ your memories~ your abilities~ even your feelings, they are all my now~~~~ and to take any where with!! HAAAA HA HA HA HAAAA~~~~~~~~)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsoon, the female body named Sabrina awakes, within her, only contained one soul, yet this soul was different from the two that was both within her before, it was the soul of Broke, but with the power of two added together dominated by a single mind... by Broke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(heh heh heh.... seems like I just picked up a trick to use from now on, before.. once I left a girl's body, l won't be able to access their memories anymore, but with Sabrina's mind control power added to my already powerful abilities, I can access their mind without actually being in their body, mind reading, how cool is that... teleportation, plus the ability to mind control girls to obey my every command like a puppet, think what I want them to think... now that I have fully absorbed Sabrina, I can take her abilities every where I go, while all her memories also stayed with me.... knowledge of one of the most powerful psychic in the world, nothing can stop me now... hahaha, not to mention another body that fully belong to me now..)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm are you okay girl? you were out for a while, and I was worried, I'm glad you come to, how do you feel? are you feeling a lot calmer? I'm not sure why you were in my room, but you seemed awfully scared\" Delia said with a caring smile while help picking Sabrina up, who now is just an empty body with out a mind for Broke to use as he desires any time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBroke looked at Delia while smiling with his new found body...</span></div></div>",

Every experiment and plan he had concocted failed due to a handful of trainers and their friends sticking their noses where they didn't belong. Hell, even his gym leader status was revoked! He had disappeared before from the shame of Team Rockets failures...but no more! His newest experiment would put Giovanni back on top! He had kept this specific experiment a secret from everyone but a few handpicked loyal scientists under his employ. He had been waiting fifteen years for this day to finally arrive all the while monitoring his enemies, all of those rotten Pokemon League Champions, their friends, the National Gym Leader Association, and anyone else that had crossed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the expected results of the Human/Pokemon Trans-mogrification Project he would finally have the opportunity to get his revenge! At least, he would be able to if the experiment was a success...the project team was still trying to find volunteers for human testing. After Bill's failure he ended up combining his own DNA with that of a pokemon.  Giovanni did not want that same thing to happen this time around, He needed to the experiment to be a success, if he could successfully combine a Ditto with human being, he could be on top again! Not just transform the Ditto, but literally combine it's DNA with a human's in order to give that human the Ditto's natural transforming abilities. That would allow for an unlimited amount of spies for Team Rocket infiltration missions.  He could have control of any major corporation in the world! He just needed the human testing to be completed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Three months later]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni was at his wit's end! it had been months and still no test subjects had been found for the experiment. He was beginning to worry that his science team wasn't really trying to complete the project anymore. He had grown suspicious that one of them might have started to cooperate with the National Gym Leader Association and the Pokemon Authorities in order to get out of potential jail time. Giovanni could not let this happen, he was currently on his way to the testing facility located deep underground on Cyanwood Island to check on the progress regarding the human testing. He was getting anxious as he hadn't recieved an update in over a month from the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the base from an underwater cave off the coast of Cyanwood and expected to find his team of scientists busy with their testing and research. Instead he found the base quiet and most likely deserted. He nervously entered the comm center and attempted to reach any personnel in the base but he couldn't raise a single member of the team. Giovanni then rushed to the lab and found it empty except for the equipment still set up and ready to be tested. He fired up the main processor and checked the diary logs for the experiment. The last entry was dated the day before and its content was what Giovanni had feared. One of the members of the science team had betrayed him and ratted out the project to the authorities! His science team had been taken into custody shortly after the diary log had been saved! It ended with a warning to Giovanni, telling him to leave the facility if he ever saw this message, as the facility was being closely monitored in case he showed up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni grew pale as he finished reading the final entry, realizing he had fallen into a trap. The fact that his final plan had ended in failure dawned on him as he heard the sound of many boots headed in his direction. He grew angry and frustrated, he had been so close!! If only they had been able to run the human trials for testing...that was it! Giovanni reasoned that he was doomed at this point, so he might as well test the machine on himself! He reasoned that even if failed and he perished it would probably be better than life in prison anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that reasoning in mind Giovanni opened the control program, loaded the Ditto DNA strain from the system and set the program to auto initiate in thirty seconds. With the commands ready to go he rushed into the glass capsule and closed himself in just as the first wave of police entered the lab. Giovanni recognized a number of the people sent to apprehend him. There were several of the trainers who had foiled him on their pokemon adventures, powerful gym leaders, and even some members of the different Elite Four squads employed by the Pokemon League.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group that had rushed into the lab noticed Giovanni just as the thirty second countdown had expired.  The glass capsule slowly filled with a thick pink mist and Giovanni felt intense pain as his body underwent changes to its chemical composition. Several members of the task force to arrest him attempted to open the capsule, but it was pressure sealed until the experiment was over. Giovanni began to panic as his body started to dissolve, he was melting! He realized then that the experiment had failed and he was going to die. As his body melted down into pink goop, he cursed those that had opposed him and vowed that someday, somehow he would have his revenge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the capsule finally opened, all that was left of the Team Rocket boss was a pile of pink sludge. The task force was upset that Giovanni could not be taken into custody, but everyone was glad that he was finally gone. It had been determined that the sludge would be collected for testing in a secure facility. However, as some of the Task Force personnel went to collect the sludge, the pink sludge began to move on its own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni had not disappeared as everyone had thought, his mind was still alive, controlling the sludge and giving it sentience. He had overheard the plan to collect and study him and he did NOT like the sound of that! With clumsy movements, he slimed his way over to the nearest ground pipe and slid his pink sludge body out of sight and into the pipe, effectively escaping the underground lab. The Task Force had witnessed this incident with great surprise, not fully understanding what had happened. However they had determined that the finding and catching the sentient sludge was a top priority and they wouldn't stop until it was found!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Giovanni moved his new body through the underground pipes, he was in constant thought about what his transformation could mean. He knew he would have to lay low and not draw attention to his new form if he wanted to stay out of the Task Force's hands, which would be tough considering the immense Pokemon power each member of the task force controlled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was figured he must be approaching an exit to the pipes as the darkness was receding in front of him. He emerged from the end of the pipe sticking out of a cliff face on the shore and slopped onto a Cyanwood beach front. Luckily he hadn't been spotted by anyone yet and he stealthily moved his slime body behind a beach chair underneath a large umbrella, away from any other beach gear. He would hide here and weigh the options he had to escape from Cyanwood. His options seemed very bleak as Giovanni couldn't think of a way that a large puddle of pink sludge wouldn't be noticed by one of the hundred different people and pokemon now searching for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sludge lay in contemplation, it didn't notice the human approaching the umbrella, the human reached the umbrella and sat down in the beach chair. This got Giovanni's attention, he couldn't risk being noticed by this person! He cautiously studied the figure who had sat down. It was a female swimmer, her blonde hair pulled back into a pony tail and her tanned, toned, buxom body covered by a red bikini. She seemed a little out of breath, probably just getting back from a swim. Giovanni slowly began to move away from the umbrella trying to avoid detection, however the swimmer had noticed movement out of the corner of her eye and turned towards the pile of sludge. Giovanni froze as the curious girl got up from her chair and approached his slimy body. The girl bent down to inspect the strange pink sludge, putting her face inches from Giovanni's mass. She wrinkled her nose and said \"Eww, this stuff is so gross looking! I bet Kyle would wanna see it though, I'm gonna call him over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Giovanni knew he couldn't let the girl call over this \"Kyle\" person, so he did the only thing he could think of to stop her from turning and calling out. He took his body mass and surged up from the ground and covered the swimmer's face. The girl was so surprised by the sudden movement that she opened her mouth to scream, which gave Giovanni only one course of action. He willed his pink mass into the girl's mouth and down her throat. The swimmer was gagging on the slime flooding her body and collapsed in the shade behind the chair, effectively hiding the incident from view. Her body lay on its back, her eyes rolled back into her head and slight muscle spasms rocked her body causing the soft fleshy globes on her chest to jiggle. After about a minute the spasms stopped and the girl slowly got to her feet, her lips spreading into a smile. A new mind in control of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni stood in silence as he gathered his thoughts on what had just transpired. He had seized control of the girl's body! His experiment had not been a failure! Well, it hadn't worked out as he had planned, but he could control anybody, BE anybody! He slowly ran his hands up and down his stolen flesh, exploring the skin he currently inhabited. He cupped the ample bosom of the swimmer and felt her body become aroused from the slight stimulation, then he moved a hand down to his crotch and felt the mound of the swimmer's pussy through her red bikini bottom. He whimpered slightly and then realized he was standing on the beach playing with himself. He quickly moved back to the girl's beach chair and pretended to sleep as he considered this new development...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The slime possessed swimmer sat in the beach chair very still, her eyes unfocused. Giovanni was deep in thought, he had been transformed into living slime. Capable of taking control of another living body. His thinking turned toward the body he had recently taken control of. He was already growing accustomed to the changes he felt from a female form, the new weight on his chest and the empty space between his shapely thighs. As his hands discreetly explored his stolen flesh, he felt his bikini bottom grow wet. \"This body is so easily aroused compared to my original form...\" Giovanni thought as his hands traveled towards his new crotch. At that moment, Giovanni noticed someone approaching his beach chair and trying to get the attention of woman he had taken control of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man in his early twenties was waving towards Giovanni and trying to talk to him. \"Well that must be Kyle...\" Giovanni muttered, slightly disappointed \"he's really spoiling a good opportunity here.\" Giovanni had stopped exploring the female body he was currently in as the guy approached. He didn't want to draw attention with any odd behavior. He didn't need the Pokemon League anywhere close to him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe, how was your swim?\" Kyle asked as he closed the last couple of feet between himself and the beach chair. \"Oh! uhhh...it was really, nice...babe\" Giovanni responded, not sure how he was going to keep his cover in front of this stranger. Kyle gave his possessed girlfriend a weird look. \"Katie are feeling you feeling okay?\" he asked, \"you've never called me babe before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni froze, he was definitely blowing his cover already and he was getting nervous. He needed to find out more about this female body he was controlling, he just didn't know how he could possibly do that! He concentrated on his host and he began to faintly hear a voice in the back of his mind. It sounded like someone was calling out for help so Giovanni focused in on the source. In the back of his mind, Giovanni found what appeared to be a cage housing the conscious mind of the woman who's body he had invaded. \"Hello? Is someone there?!? I need help! I can't control my own body! I need to tell Kyle that he's not talking to me!!\" Katie was screaming to no avail. Giovanni focused on Katie's conscious mind felt a connection to her. Flashes of her memories appeared to him and he realized he could complete his impersonation. He just needed to hijack Katie's mind for the information. As Giovanni was copying Katie's memories, mannerisms, and personality, she became aware of the connection and saw him. Giovanni was absorbing the last of the information he would need to impersonate the woman flawlessly when he looked at her consciousness and smiled. \"I hope you like being an audience, since I'll be \"Katie\" for the time being\" He stated before focusing his attention back to the physical world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few seconds had passed in the physical world and Kyle was waiting for an answer from his apparent girlfriend. Giovanni's stiff posture relaxed as he let Katie's mannerisms take over as he stood up. \"Sorry cutie, I was just zoning out a little too hard before you walked over\" Giovanni said as he giggled. His laugh caused the fleshy mounds on his chest to jiggle slightly. Kyle's gaze dropped to stare at his girlfriend's chest and Giovanni smiled slyly. He knew no one would question \"Katie\" again anytime soon. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Giovanni followed Kyle up the beach back towards the Cinnabar Hotel, a large grand hotel built a few years ago to improve the tourism on the island. Katie's body moved with a natural fluidity, however there was nothing natural about the mind controlling it. Giovanni had continued to use Katie's stolen mannerisms to keep up his disguise, but he was still very aware of the swaying in his hips and the slight bounce of his breasts with each step he took. It was distracting but also arousing to the man. He had to maintain focus in order to keep up his female appearance which meant he was constantly aware of how attractive Katie's body was. His crotch had been feeling warm and damp for a little while now and Giovanni was getting anxious to explore his stolen flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so preoccupied thinking about Katie's body that he didn't notice entering the hotel's lobby with Katie's boyfriend Kyle. Giovanni scanned the lobby as he was following Kyle towards the elevators. He stopped moving as he saw several prominent members of the Pokemon League stepping into a restricted elevator and the doors close behind them. Giovanni noticed that the elevator was being watched by several members of the Cinnabar police force in the area. \"No doubt there are others watching from less conspicuous locations\" Giovanni thought to himself. He realized that he had been standing in the middle of the hotel lobby for a little too long and turned back towards where Kyle was waiting for him. Giovanni would eventually need to know how the Pokemon League had discovered his operation and what the organization was planning to do next. How they would search for the pink mass of slime he had become. He looked down at the beautiful body he had stolen, he wouldn't be able to keep it if he wanted information. He would need a to take a new body, one important enough to have access to that elevator. However, Giovanni felt that swap could wait a little while. After all, he was still trying to get his bearings on his new abilities, not to mention the body he had stolen. Katie's body was slowly growing hotter from Giovanni's excitement and he could feel her nipples starting to harden as the elevator doors opened with a *ding* and he followed Kyle into the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator doors closed leaving \"Katie\" and Kyle alone as the elevator made its trip up to the eleventh floor, where the couples' room was located. Giovanni was trying to figure out how he could possess a member of the Pokemon organization that was hunting him without alerting anyone to his actions. At that moment Kyle took the opportunity to place his hands around Giovanni's waist and pull his body close. Giovanni was a little surprised by Kyle's advances but quickly recovered and moved his arms up around Kyle's neck. Katie's body had already been aroused before getting into the elevator and Giovanni did not mind the warm damp feeling between his legs. He didn't want to break his cover by not reciprocating the affection his host's boyfriend was showing and honestly, he was very curious about the pleasure he could feel while he was in control of such a sexy body. He certainly didn't blame Kyle for making a move in the elevator, the two of them were alone and Giovanni didn't have too much covering his stolen flesh at the moment. He was wearing a very light white summer dress that barely came down past his ass that Katie had worn down to the beach that morning over the red bikini which was visible through the dress anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle lifted the back of his girlfriend's dress and grabbed her ass as he pulled her into a long kiss. Giovanni let Katie's mannerisms and instincts take over as he leaned in and the pair locked lips. Giovanni could feel Katie's body getting excited and he pressed her body into Kyle's. There were still three floors to go but Giovanni wanted to make sure the current situation escalated back in the couples' hotel room. Katie's body was too horny for Giovanni to try and resist anymore. He moved one hand down to the bulge in Kyle's bathing suit and slipped a hand under the waistband. He could feel Kyle jump a little with excitement. He used Katie's stolen memories to expertly operate Kyle's shaft and keep him fully erect. Kyle had just moved his hand down to Giovanni's outer lips when the elevator stopped its ascent and the doors slid open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entwined couple basically fell out of the elevator doors before looking up and down the hallway, it looked deserted....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Giovanni had Katie's legs wrapped around Kyle as Kyle groped his ass cheeks. Kyle threw his girlfriend onto the bed and then began removing his shirt and shorts as he watched his girlfriend pull the summer dress up and over her head. Giovanni grinned as he threw the dress into the corner of the room, laying back on the bed he removed Katie's bikini top as well. He spread his legs and beckoned Kyle towards his stolen pussy, his body on fire at this point. Kyle climbed onto the bed and moved towards his girlfriend's mostly naked flesh, still unaware that her body had been hijacked by a slimy parasite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the foreplay already taken care of with the elevator ride the pair went right into it. Kyle slid the final piece of Katie's bikini down her thighs and positioned himself over her. Giovanni was barely in control of Katie's body as he felt Kyle enter into his pussy. The pleasure was more than he expected and he let out an audible moan. Kyle was thrusting into Katie's body in a fluid rhythm, slowly increasing his speed. Giovanni was experiencing female pleasure for the first time and he was intoxicated by it. He let erotic moans escape his stolen lips as he felt the warmth and pressure building between his thighs. He could feel Kyle starting to grow tired so he flipped their positions, his female body now on top. He moved up and down on Kyle's shaft, increasing his pace and gyrating harder as he felt an orgasm building. He held back as long as he could, Kyle reaching orgasm slightly faster than him. Giovanni felt an orgasm overtake him in pleasure just as he felt Kyle's load filling his pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni fell back onto the bed shaking from the intense pleasure he was feeling. Panting, his hands playing with his stolen tits, Giovanni had an idea spring into his mind. The perfect way to takeover a new host without being noticed, fluid transfer! He just needed to test his idea first, luckily he had the perfect test situation right in front of him...</span></div></div>",

Kyle lay next to him, panting after the fantastic sex he just had with his \"girlfriend\". \"I don't know what has gotten into you babe, but that was some of the best sex we've ever had!\" Kyle exclaimed as he rolled onto his side to face Giovanni. Giovanni had gone back into his mind, focusing on Katie's consciousness still locked away. She was crying in her cage, having witnessed the intense sex her boyfriend had just had with her hijacked body. Giovanni concentrated on reforming their connection while she was distracted. With the link complete he focused on her recent memories, the time he had just spent within her body. He changed altered Katie's memories so that she thought she had been in control the entire time up to now. Then it was time for the next part of his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni leaned over to Kyle's face and began a slow romantic kiss, slowly baiting the man into a more passionate make out. As Kyle pulled Katie's body closer to him, Giovanni moved his slime body up Katie's throat. Then it was time to act, Giovanni forced his slime body from between Katie's lips directly into Kyle's mouth and down his throat. Kyle was so surprised he didn't even have time to resist before Giovanni had moved completely into his body. Katie passed out as Giovanni left her body entirely while Kyle's body convulsed briefly as Giovanni took control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's body sat up, a new mind in control of it. Giovanni was pleased with how well the transfer had gone and he looked over towards the beautiful naked woman passed out beside him. He smiled as he moved Kyle's hands up in front of his face, before moving them down to the breasts he had recently owned. \"Wow, they feel so different from the outside\" Giovanni said, hearing his words from Kyle's voice was a drastic change from Katie's. Katie began to stir under his touch and Giovanni could feel his new equipment getting hard. He was glad Kyle recovered so quickly, he wanted to experience sex with Katie's body both ways before he moved to the next phase of his plan. Katie opened her eyes and sat up next to Giovanni, she was still slightly disoriented from the transfer a few minutes earlier. Giovanni looked at her, wondering if his manipulation had worked. She started to open her mouth when Giovanni moved in and began to kiss her. He didn't want her asking any questions he couldn't answer straight away so he figured he would take advantage of her confusion. Katie barely tried to fight the kiss before giving in and returning it. She pushed her tongue into Giovanni's mouth as they continued to kiss, moving her naked form underneath him. Giovanni felt her hands wrap around Kyle's erect penis and guide it into her awaiting pussy lips. Giovanni smiled as he began pumping his dick into Katie's eager cunt. He looked into Katie's eyes as she let out a moan, he could tell she had no recollection of his time controlling her beautiful body. He could feel the cum building in his penis as he thrust harder and harder, following the rhythmic bounce of Katie's breasts until he felt his load burst into her pussy. Katie exclaimed as she climaxed and pushed Giovanni off of her before laying back and panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni knew this was his chance, \"That was amazing babe\" he said as he kissed the exhausted swimmer. \"Why don't you take a nap, I'm gonna take a little walk then wake you up for dinner?\" Giovanni asked her. He didn't even get a response as Katie was already asleep. \"I guess having your body hijacked and abused really takes it out of you\" Giovanni laughed. He got up and redressed Kyle's body before leaving the room. As he rode the elevator back down to the lobby, he had to choose where he would look for his next target. The restaurant and bar would be a good place to check for important bodies, but the hotel pool would also provide plenty of opportunities...</span></div></div>",

She was wearing  blue and white shirt that had a pokeball emblem in the middle and black tights underneath a short yellow skirt. Giovanni couldn't think of the girl's name, instead focusing on her delightful curves, she had a prominent chest and slim waist from what he could tell.

So we need to succeed or we'll lose our investment.\" she replied as she handed him a crowbar to break a lock on the door.  James hated to use his strength to break locks, but he was the guy and Jessie was always forcing him to do the jobs she felt was too delicate for.  James tried in vain to brake the lock, but as usual his soft life growing up pampered in a mansion betrayed his lack of toughness.  \"Gimme that!\" Jessie growled at him as she swiped the crowbar from his hands.  Jessie used her whole body to pull at the lock with the crowbar and it opened.  \"Jessie!  You did it!\" James cheered at her efforts.  Jessie needed a little time to fully recover from that tremendous expenditure of her own energy, but it would have to wait.  They needed to steal quickly before they were caught.  James pulled out a flash light and saw some cages in the distance.  \"Jessie, most of these cages are empty!\" James replied.  \"There's one!\" Jessie pointed out triumphantly.  The poke'mon inside was like nothing Jessie or James had encountered before.  It was green in color and obviously a Leaf type, but it had some qualities of Dark Poke'mon as well.  Most strangely, it was shaped like a tulip buld with a two forked stalk shooting straight up out of it's head.  \"Jessie, the note says this Poke'mon is very dangerous!\" James noted.  \"Just what we need to please our boss!  Hahaha!\" she said happily as she worked the cage open.  Jessie looked inside the cage and got a good look at the strange Poke'mon.  \"Come to Momma, you dangerous Poke'mon.\" she said evilly.  Suddenly the stalk about the bulb like Poke'mon began to move and with lighting speed it threw it's tendril like stalk at Jessie.  \"Ahhh!\" Jessie screamed as the two forks at the end of the tendril squeezed around her neck.  \"Jessie!\" James yelped as he pulled Jessie from the cage, he was shocked at what he saw next.  Jessie's face and hair had been replaced by the visage of the Poke'mon, it's bulb like body stood firmly attached to the top of Jessie's neck.  James recoiled in horror as he frightened as the Poke'mon yelled \"SPLICIE!!!\" \"Poor Jessie!  Eaten by a dangerous Poke'mon.\" James said looking the rebuilt Jessie, now with a strange Poke'mon for a head.  \"I'm right here you moron!\" Jessie's voice said from inside the cage.  \"What!\" James said as he carefully peered inside, being brave enough to do so despite his fears another one of this Poke'mon was lurking inside.  There on the floor of the cage was Jessie's disembodied head, looking angrily as ever.  James took up her head into his arms and hugged it.  \"Jessie, You're alive!\" he said.  \"You numbskull!  You're messing up my beautiful hair!\" she snarled.  \"SPLICIEEE!\" the bizarre Poke'mon on Jessie's body yelled again.  \"Give me back my body you thief!\" Jessie demanded of it.  \"Jessie, how are we going to get your body back?\" James whined.  \"Attack it!  It's a Poke'mon!  You defeat it and it's your's\" she told him like he was an idiot.  \"Oh, right.  Wheezing, I choose you!  Use Toxic Smog!\" James commanded.  The room became filled with blinding smoke.  \"James, you idiot!\" Jessie said as her eyes teared and she coughed.  \"Ah, somethings choking me!' James cried.  The smog lifted with the sounds of everyone's coughing still proceeding with much power and fury.  \"Where did your body run off to!\" James asked Jessie, as he rose from the floor.  \"Ahhh!\" Jessie yelled as she saw James rise from the floor.  \"What, do you see your body?\" he asked her.  \"Yes, it's under your head!\" Jessie cried with horror.  \"What do you mean right under my neck?  I..\" James said, stopping to notice the feminine curves and delicate gloved hands.  \"Jessie how come I am wearing your uniform?\" James asked innocently.  \"Because it's on my body, you idiot!\" Jessie screamed angrily!</span></div></div>",

James got up and looked around and saw Wheezing and asked, \"Are you wheezing, Wheezing?\"  Wheezing answered simply, \"WHEEZEENG!\"  James realized it wasn't the Pokemon and looked around heard the coughing in the corner.  He walked over towards the sound of the coughing mindful of that he wasn't used to navigating through the world on Jessie's body.  There on the floor was Jame's previous body, the strange Pokemon bulb head coughing on the floor as it laid there incapacitated.  \"Okay Splicee!  You're mine!\" he said, remembering that Jessie had an empty Pokeball on her person.  He quickly pulled out the ball and tossed it at Splicie.  The Pokemon turned into energy and was sucked into the ball, leaving James' body headless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames held up the Pokeball to look at it's status.  It showed that Splicee was very weakened.  James then realized that Wheezing's attack had been super effective.  He walked over to his body, oddly it was breathing.  He placed the Pokeball into Jessie's hip holster and picked up his original body by the shoulders.  James was surprised despite struggling he managed to drag his headless former body over towards where Jessie's disembodied head lay.  \"Wow!  What happened!\" Jessie asked worriedly looking at James seemingly living headless body.   \"Creepy, isn't it!  I captured that Pokemon that switched us around with out thinking.  I didn't expect this!\" he exclaimed putting up a feminine gloved hand on his face in thought.  \"Think it could switch us back?\" Jessie asked with concern.  \"It's pretty weak, it might faint\" James told Jesssie.</span></div></div>",

You know what, I can't wait to get in my warm sleeping bag. I just need a shower under the little waterfall and then it's nappy time. Now, if you'll excuse me...\". he rushes to his bag to retrieve his bag containing pajama, toothbrush, and shampoo but takes Jessie's instead by mistake.

What? A shower? But...\" finally the cogs start running, and her face turns red \"Jaaaaameeees!\" She shouts<br>\r\n_______________<br>\r\nJames was still running under the full moon, still not used of the feeling of his breast bouncing up and down and his hips moving from side to side with each time his feet hit the floor. He wasn't also used to the high-heeled boots, that made him slow down a bit. he wasn't thinking about that though, his only concern getting away from the embarrassment and to the pond <br>\r\nWhen he arrived in front of the little pond, he stared for a second at the waterfall pouring down into it, making a natural shower. he always like the beauty of the limpid water shining in the night air, flying like liquid moon rays into the pond, disturbing the mirroring surface with concentric waves.<br>\r\nHe removed one glove, and was surprised from the time it took him to do so. he never had to pull that much to... suddenly he remembered that wasn't his body, and the thought of what he almost did made his face turn red like a cooked lobster.<br>\r\nHe wondered for a second what to do. He couldn't possibly strip down Jessie's body, could he? But he could have gone sleeping completely clothed either in his sleeping bag, he would ruin it. Sleeping outside the bag wasn't an option, he would have freezed to death.<br>\r\nThere was only one way to decide: he smelled down his armpit: he was all sweaty from all the running and lifting nhe did earlier. His armpit smelled a lot like oninons, and he felt the unpleasant feeling of his bra and panties, all sweaty and disgusting.<br>\r\nThis settled it, if had gone to sleep like that, he could have caused skin irritations and wounds, and he didn't want to have any part of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, carefully, he continued to strip down, his gloves were the first, showing him Jessie's manicured nails. They weren't panted or long, but James was amazed at how well cured they were: Jessie was always mindful of details. Next James, with his hand trembling, unbuttons the top of the rocket's uniform, revealing the black tight top underneath. After that he removes the skirt, and he's greeted with the sight of her deep blue tanga.<br>\r\nAfter that, he removes the top, getting a sight of the beautiful plunge underwire deep blue bra, sustaining the wonderful pair of boobs that were his, at least for now. Lastly, he removed the heeled boots. Now he was standing in the middle of the forest just in lingerie, shivering a bit in the night's fresh air<br>\r\nJames wondered if he should remove Jessie's lingerie too or conserve a bit of her privacy</span></div></div>",

He found it wasn't much harder to unclasp that the fake breast implants he wore so many times when he and Jessie masked themselves to steal the twerps' pok\u00c3\u00a8mon, so after few seconds, he managed to open it. It was the first time he had the chance to see Jessie's bosom in all its glory, and the sight was exactly like he had imagined. He especially liked the nipples, very proportionate and yet so sensitive.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Next he put his even more shaky hands on the brim of his tanga, and with a sonorous gulp, he slowly pulled down the panties. He looked down to see his groin, but his breasts were blocking the view, so he tried to bend back a bit.<br>\r\nHe was again surprised at how much Jessie's body was flexible, since he managed with no effort to get a good look at his pube: he saw a very well trimmed, tear shaped bush, and was amazed to see it was the same color of Jessie's hair. To confirm Jessie didn't dye it, he looked under his armpit, but he didn't find any hair there: it was silky smooth: James wondered if Jessie got laser treated, since feeling the legs gave the same silky smooth feeling.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Looking back up, he noticed his nipples were getting rock hard, probably because of the cold, so he quickly searched in the bag for a shampoo, a sponge and some soap to wash Jessie's clothes with, before stepping down in the warmer water.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The feelings of that shower were amazing: the water on his soft skin, the smell of rose of the shampoo, the erotic feeling of his hand massaging his breasts. After that, he felt so much relaxed, so he stepped out of the pond on a pre-positioned beach towel.<br>\r\nTo anyone passing there, the sight would have been breath-taking: a woman, like a gorgeous river nymph, slowly stepping out of a beautiful pond, her naked perfect wet body glimmering like quicksilver under a pallid moonlight, her water dripping pastel cerulean hair arranged in a bob cut partially covering her face.<br>\r\nJames wrapped another towel taken from the bag around his breasts and started to meticulously dry Jessie's body, still enjoying the different yet familiar feelings this new body gave him. When he was completely dry, he put on the standard rocket's female pajama: a black pair of bikini panties, a black sport bra, and long sleeved knee-length white nightgown with a big R printed on the right side. with black pantyhose and rubber soled slippers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After he was changed, he quickly washed Jessie's clothes, finished his personal hygiene routine, and then walked back to the cave.<br>\r\n________<br>\r\nJessie, still waiting in the cave, suddenly was awakened by a sound. Too scared to say anything, she waited to see what will happen, hoping that the Ursaring they saw walking in the forest last week didn't think to explore the cave. She was relieved though when he heard James' voice whisper: \"JessJess? Are you still here?\"<br>\r\n\"Where I should be you big dummy? You have my body, remember? Speaking of which... you are a total pervert! Just wait until I get a body back and I'll show you to grope me like you certainly did!\"<br>\r\n\"No Jessie, i can explain!\"<br>\r\n[A quick explanation later]<br>\r\nJessie looks down \"Ok, I understand. But I'm still mad at you\"<br>\r\n\"I know. I'll try to make up for it. Promise\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok, just start this fire and let's get to sleep. Hopefully tomorrow that jerk will switch us back\"<br>\r\nJames steps in Jessie's sleeping bag\"Good night, Jessie\"<br>\r\n\"Good night, pervert\"</span></div></div>",

Spli. cee. cee, spli, cee, splicee, cee, splispli, plicee\" Meowth proceeded to translate: \"Not necessarily, you can be put on any guys' body\"<br>\r\n\"But I don't wanna be a guy\"<br>\r\n\"You could always be a head\"<br>\r\n\"Tell that... thing... to put me on James' stupid body. for now.\"<br>\r\nSplicee uses his vines to retrieve Jessie's head and James' body from the opposite sides of the room, then he spurts from a vine a weird substance on James' neck. When Jessie's head is lowered onto it, it immediately sticks and James' body immediately stops being limp.<br>\r\nJessie flexes her new arms \"Hey, how could you be so weak?\" She moves her new hands down her pants \"at least this thing is big. Wow, so this is what an erection feels like. Nnice\" Immediately James' pants start to inflate, much to James' protests \"Hey, stop that\" <br>\r\n\"Nope, that's what you get for feeling me up last night, perv\"<br>\r\n\"You're a perv, jacking off in front of everybody\"<br>\r\nMeowth agrees\"Please, don't do it here. At least wait 'till you're alone\"<br>\r\n\"You know, I was starting to enjoy that. And I don't know why, but looking at my previous body makes me even more stiff\"<br>\r\n\"Eww, TMI, Jessie. TMI\" Meowth replies<br>\r\n\"Hey, you said I can be every guy I want?\"<br>\r\n\"That's what he said\"<br>\r\n\"And you noticed how James taking my body got the control over splicee, even though he was captured with my pok\u00c3\u00a8balls?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so?\" James inquires<br>\r\n\"What if I swap heads with the little brat?\"<br>\r\n\"We'll have the complete control over pikachu! That's the best plan ever!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, now we just need to go find the little boy and the other twerps he hangs out with\"<br>\r\n\"All right, but first I gotta change and you need a bath\"<br>\r\n\"Yuck like I wanted to see this body naked. Whatever, I'll be right back\" She takes James' bag and heads for the pond<br>\r\nAfter she's gone for good, James asks \"Say Meowth, wanna see Jessie's body completely naked?\"<br>\r\n\"I'd thought you'd never ask\" the pok\u00c3\u00a8mon happily answers</span></div></div>",

James, nervous at first to be around Jessie with each other's bodies, now is pretty confident with her new condition, letting her hair grow a bit and planning to tie it into a ponytail. Jessie instead passed the whole week lifting a barbell, and generally working out a bit, since he could not stand James's previous body's wimpyness. He discovered that while James's feature were softening, her pupils seemed to get bigger and her eyelashes more pronounced, he on the other hand was starting to get more masculine, developing even a stubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the training he was doing wasn't for nothing though, since their plan was to hijack Ash's body just for the time needed to trade it to Giovanni, after which they would have just abandoned it, allowing Jessie to get back to the body that he was currently resigned to inhabit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment Jessie was a little pissed with his partner, struggling to keep his pace running trough the woods \"Damn her and damn those high heeled boots. I'm so glad I don't have to wear 'em again, they were such a pain in the ass in these occasions\" he thought, after whispering \"Come on, Jamie. We'll loose 'em if I have to keep waiting for you\". James, now Jamie, whined: \"I can't do it. I keep twisting my ankles with all these damn bumps. Besides, Jesse, it's almost dusk. They are just about to camp for the night. They're not going much farther, don't worry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she positioned herself in the bush and whispered to Jesse: \"Yes. here they are. Ash is just over there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the others? \" Jesse asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are all there with him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time of this story, Ash was hanging out with... </span></div></div>",

She now had some difficulty looking around since the only things she could see were the tree fronds and the collar of her uniform, due to the fact that her sight lowered to her shoulders' level.<br>\r\nNo matter how hard she struggled, she couldn't enlarge the uniform enough to allow her to see straight in front of her. Eventually giving up, she removed the top part of the uniform, remaining in her black cotton tight top. Seeing that, Jesse Furiously whispered \"Oh no you're not! Go back to base and put on something more appropriate\" Jamie indicated the clearing on where the twerps were awakening, but Jesse quickly cut it out with \"Don't worry about the mission. We can handle it, right guys?\" She turned around to glare them with flaming eyes, so the pok\u00e8mon reluctantly agreed \"Yeah, sure.\" \"Spli, c\u00e8e, pli!\"<br>\r\nSo Jamie couldn't do anything other than slump her shoulders in defeat before turning around and slowly starting the march to the balloon. In doing so she gave a pretty good view of her breasts to Jesse who, even if he would never have admitted it, got a pretty serious boner from that; and when she turned around the sight of her ass did nothing but increase his desire for her, even though her body was his once. Weirdo.<br>\r\nTurning back to the clearing, Jesse noticed that now Misty's body was pretty much freaking out, and from her movements Jesse hypothesized that...</span></div></div>",

In fact now he sees from his skin-patch and the rocket's outfit high collar is impeding him to see properly, so now he is feeling around and trying to open a bigger hole in the outfit. In the end he just gives up and removes his gloves and jacket, remaining in just a black cotton shirt.<br>\r\nWhile Jesse's struggling to see, Jamie's angrily scolding Splic\u00e8e \"Damn it Splic\u00e8e!

Now we'll never be able to get a hold of the brat's body\"<br>\r\nSplic\u00e8e, peeping softly, tries to apologize while indicating meowth with Brock's hand \"Spli, cee-pli-pli\"<br>\r\nMeowth, after Splic\u00e8e finishes his sentence, gets a stupefied expression and angrily remarks \"Oh no, no way!\"<br>\r\nJamie, instantaneously changing expression, impishly asks \"Wait, What did he say?\"<br>\r\nMeowth, now nervous, tries to minimize\"Oh nothing, really. Nothing important...\"<br>\r\nBut Jamie, not buying that, insists with a dulcet voice\"Come on Meowth, don't lie to me. What did he say?\"<br>\r\nResigned, meowth complies, sighing \"Ok, fine. He said that pokemon can swap with humans with no restrictions\"<br>\r\n\"Splendid! That's good news. That means that you can take the twerp's body after all\"<br>\r\nNot surrending to his impending doom, Meowth argues \"Yeah, but Splic\u00e8e can too\"<br>\r\nAt that point, Splic\u00e8e joins in \"Spli! Splic\u00e8e! Spli!\"<br>\r\nBut meowth is having none of that \"You can abandon it! Ash's is more important, you jerk!\"<br>\r\nJamie, in an attempt to calm the fight, declares \"Ok.
